On March 7, 1996, respondent filed an action against petitioners in the Circuit Court for Kent County to recover for breach of contract arising out of that real estate transaction. The case came before the circuit court for a hearing on the merits on February 13, 1997. Prior to trial that day, the trial judge rendered a judgment pursuant to the parties\u2019 consent in favor of respondent in the amount of $5,000.00 with a proviso that it could be settled upon the payment of $2,550.00 within thirty days. The judgment was indexed and recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The thirtieth day fell on Saturday, March 15, 1997. In a handwritten memo dated March 10, 1997, petitioners advised respondent that they would pay the judgment on Monday, March 17, 1997 with a cashier\u2019s check. On March 17, the thirty-second day, petitioners presented respondent with a cashier\u2019s check for $2,500.00 and $50.00 cash and requested that respondent mark the judgment \u201creleased and satisfied.\u201d Respondent refused to file an Order of Satisfaction arguing that the $2,550.00 should have been paid by March 15, 1997, even though that day was a Saturday.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">On April 3, 1997, respondent filed a Petition for Deposition in Aid of Enforcement of Judgment. Petitioners filed an answer to that petition on April 8, 1997, and filed a Motion for Injunction, claiming that they had effectively paid within the thirty-day requirement because, pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1995 Repl.Vol.), Article 94, section 2 and Maryland Rule l-203(a), they had until March 17, 1997, to satisfy the judgment at the discounted rate. The circuit court denied this motion and on May 5, 1997, petitioners filed a Motion to Amend or Revise the Judgment, which was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court, holding that the discount provision did not constitute a court order. We granted a writ of certiorari to consider whether the trial court properly ruled that the parties\u2019 agreement to discount a judgment for payment within thirty days was not governed by Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Article 1, section 36<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Maryland Rule l-203(a), and the due date for payment, therefore, was not extended by virtue of falling on a Saturday. We hold that the trial court erred, that the agreement to discount the judgment was a court order governed by Maryland Rules l-203(a) and l-202(n), and the due date for payment was extended by virtue of falling on a Saturday. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Accordingly, we reverse. We shall not reach the applicability of Article 1, section 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">I. Discussion and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The threshold issue is whether the discount provision was a court order governed by the relevant provisions. To make this determination, we need to analyze three distinct questions of law: (1) whether the trial court rendered a final judgment; (2) if a final judgment was rendered, whether it included the discount provision; and (3), if a final judgment, which included the discount provision, was rendered, whether and how Maryland Rule l-203(a) would affect the due date for payment of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">A. Consent Judgments</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">There are two rules of court which are determinative as to whether the trial court rendered a judgment in this particular case. Maryland Rule l-202(n) defines judgment as \u201cany order of court final in its nature entered pursuant to these rules.\u201d Accordingly, a judgment is an order of court. Additionally, at the time this judgment was rendered, Maryland Rule 2-601 (1997)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prescribed the manner in which a judgment must be entered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">(a) When Entered.\u2014Upon a general verdict of a jury or upon a decision by the court allowing recovery only of costs or a specified amount of money or denying all relief, the clerk shall forthwith enter the judgment, unless the court orders otherwise. Upon a special verdict of a jury or upon a decision by the court granting other relief, the clerk shall enter the judgment as directed by the court. Unless the court orders otherwise, entry of the judgment shall not be delayed pending a determination of the amount of costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>(b) Method of Entry\u2014Date of Judgment.\u2014The clerk shall enter a judgment by making a record of it in writing on the file jacket, or on a docket within the file, or in a docket book, according to the practice of each court, and shall record the actual date of the entry. That date shall be the date of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">(c) Recording and Indexing.\u2014Promptly after entry, the clerk shall record and index the judgment, except a judgment denying all relief without costs, in the judgment records of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">This Court has previously interpreted the interplay between these two rules as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">Read in conjunction, Rule l-202(m)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] and Rule 2-60[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] make clear that two acts must occur for an action by a court to be deemed the granting of a judgment: the court must render a final order and the order must be entered on the docket by the clerk. These two required <em>acts\u2014rendition </em>of a judgment by the court and <em>entry </em>of the judgment by the clerk\u2014are discrete occurrences. Rendition of judgment is the judicial act by which the court settles and declares the decision of the law on the matters at issue. In other words, rendition is the court\u2019s pronouncement, by spoken word in open court or by written order filed with the clerk, of its decision upon the matter submitted to it for adjudication. The second act required under Maryland law\u2014the clerk\u2019s entry of the judgment on the docket\u2014is the purely ministerial act by means of which permanent evidence of the judicial act of rendering the judgment is made a record of the court. <em>See Doehring v. Wagner, </em>311 Md. 272, 533 A.2d 1300 (1987); <em>Corey v. Carback, </em>201 Md. 389, 94 A.2d 629 (1953).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>A judgment is therefore not granted until it is both properly rendered and properly entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><em>Davis v.

Fells Point Cafe, Inc., </em>344 Md. 120, 127-28, 685 A.2d 772, 775 (1996). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>both of these requirements were met when the court rendered a consent judgment in favor of respondent and the clerk recorded the judgment on the docket and indexed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\u201c <em>\u2018Rendition </em>of judgment is ... the court\u2019s pronouncement, by spoken word in open court or by written order filed with the clerk, of its decision upon the matter submitted to it for adjudication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fells Point Cafe, </em>344 Md. at 128, 685 A.2d at 775 (quoting <em>Davis, </em>335 Md. at 710, 646 A.2d at 370). In <em>Parkington Apartments, Inc. v. Cordish, </em>296 Md. 143, 149, 460 A.2d 52, 55 (1983), this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\"><em>Black\u2019s Lato Dictionary </em>1165 (5th ed.1979)[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] is instructive as to what the General Assembly may have contemplated when it used the term \u201crendition of judgment\u201d:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">\u201cRendition of a judgment is effected when trial court in open court declares the decision of the law upon the matters at issue, and it is distinguishable from \u2018entry of judgment,\u2019 which is a purely ministerial act by which the judgment is made of record and preserved. <em>Ex parte Gnesoulis, </em>Tex.Civ.App., 525 S.W.2d 205, 209 [ (1975) ]. A judgment is rendered as of date on which trial judge declares in open court his decision on matters submitted to him for adjudication, and oral pronouncement by the court of its decision is sufficient for \u2018rendition of judgment\u2019. <em>Farr v.

A permanent record of the judgment was created when the clerk placed it on the docket as entry number 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">Matter passed for settlement.

A judgment, however, will only be considered rendered by a court if it has clearly indicated that the issue submitted has been adjudicated completely and it has reached a final decision on the matter. As this Court previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUv\">\u201cIf a ruling of the court is to constitute a final judgment, it must have at least three attributes: (1) it must be intended by the court as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy, (2) unless the court properly acts pursuant to Md. Rule 2-602(b), it must adjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties, and (3) the clerk must make a proper record of it in accordance with Md. Rule 2-601.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\"><em>Fells Point Cafe, </em>344 Md. at 129, 685 A.2d at 776 (1996) (quoting <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767, 773 (1989)). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>all three of these attributes have been satisfied. First, the trial court\u2019s ruling was an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy. Second, it adjudicated all claims against all parties. Third, the clerk made a proper record of it in accordance with Maryland Rule 2-601. This Court concluded in <em>Davis, </em>335 Md. at 711, 646 A.2d at 370:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">[T]he trial court\u2019s ruling must be \u201can unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy.\u201d <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 41, 566 A.2d at 773; <em>see also Anthony v. Clark, </em>335 Md. 579, 644 A.2d 1070 [ (1994) ]. There are, however, no formal requirements regarding the rendition of a judgment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hark, </em>320 U.S. 531, 534, 64 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>359, 361, 88 L.Ed. 290, 292 (1944). As one court has observed, \u201c[t]here are no hard and fast rules for determining what is a judgment.\u201d <em>Associated Press v. Taft-Ingalls Corp., </em>323 F.2d 114, 115 (6th Cir.1963). Rather, whether a judgment has been rendered in a particular case is an inquiry that must be made on a case-by-case basis and which focuses upon the actions and statements of the court. [Second alteration in original]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">As illustrated, <em>supra, </em>the requirements for the rendering of a judgment were satisfied by the trial court. If the court had not properly rendered a final judgment, this agreement would have been a settlement agreement. A settlement agreement is not a final judgment. <em>Clark v. Elza, </em>286 Md. 208, 213-15, 406 A.2d 922, 925-26 (1979); <em>see also Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. Equitable Bank, </em>77 Md.App. 320, 328, 550 A.2d 407, 411 (1988); <em>Ramsey, Inc. v. Davis, </em>66 Md.App. 717, 725, 505 A.2d 899, 903, <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 514, 510 A.2d 260 (1986). The Court of Special Appeals has distinguished between these two related entities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">Although a settlement order resembles a final judgment, it is not the same. A settlement agreement is a contract which the parties enter into \u201cfor the settlement of a previously existing claim by a substituted performance.\u201d When this agreement is entered with the court, it is termed a settlement order; however, it is not a court order. Rather, it is a compromise between the parties, which they submit to the court to stay the proceedings in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-6\"><em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R., </em>77 Md.App. at 328, 550 A.2d at 411 (quoting <em>Mitchell Properties, Inc. v. Real Estate Title Co., </em>62 Md.App. 473, 482, 490 A.2d 271 (1985)). When parties agree to settlement terms in the presence of the court and ask the court to render a judgment based on that settlement agreement and the court renders a judgment on the settlement, the agreement becomes a final judgment. <em>Montgomery County v. Revere Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>341 Md. 366, 378, 671 A.2d 1, 7 (1996) (\u201cThus, an order entered on a docket pursuant to Rule 2-601, and having the effect of terminating the case ... is a final judgment.\u201d). <em>Chertkof v. Harry C. Weiskittel Co., </em>251 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>544, 549, 248 A.2d 373, 376 (1968); <em>see also Mitchell Properties, </em>62 Md.App. at 483, 490 A.2d at 276 (\u201cIf the court reduces the settlement order to a money judgment, it becomes a final judgment to the extent the underlying agreement address[es] the respective claims of the parties.\u201d). A court judgment makes the settlement agreement a judicial act. When parties endorse a judicial decree entered pursuant to a settlement agreement, \u201ca critical element [is added] to [the] contractual act: judicial conclusiveness.\u201d <em>Kirsner v. Fleischmann, </em>261 Md. 164, 170, 274 A.2d 339, 343 (1971); <em>see also Dorsey v. Wroten, </em>35 Md.App. 359, 361, 370 A.2d 577, 579 (1977) (\u201c[A] consent decree adds a critical element to the contractual act\u2014 judicial conclusiveness.\u201d). Looking at the actions and statements of the trial court, we conclude that there was a judgment rendered in this case. When the trial court reduced the proposed agreement to a consent judgment, it became a final judgment and an order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We now turn our analysis on whether a consent judgment is to be treated any differently than any other form of judgment. We start with an interpretation of Rule 2-612.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As we said in <em>State v. Bell, 351 </em>Md. 709, 720 A.2d 311 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">We begin our analysis with the canons of statutory construction that are also generally applicable in respect to rule construction. <em>See State v. Harrell, </em>348 Md. 69, 79, 702 A.2d 723, 728 (1997) ...; <em>In re Victor B., </em>336 Md. 85, 94, 646 A.2d 1012, 1016 (1994)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">We have said that \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Oaks v.

Its only distinction is that it is a judgment that a court enters at the request of the parties. Minutes from the Rules Committee meetings give insight to the intent behind the rules governing consent judgments: \u201c[A] consent judgment ... must dispose of all claims in the action.... [A]n order adjudicating less than all of the claims is not a judgment----\u201d Minutes of the Rules Committee, at 31 (Oct. 17, 1981). \u201cThe proposed amendment ] [is] designed to establish a bright line test for entry of judgment----\u201d Minutes of the Rules Committee (Sept. 13-14, 1985). Both statements permit the implication that a consent judgment is a judgment. There is no indication that the Rules Committee, or this Court, intended a consent judgment to be anything other than a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Generally, we hold that consent judgments should be treated in the same fashion as any other form of judgment. The rationale is simple: A judgment is a judgment, regardless of whether it was rendered after a lengthy trial or an agreement by consent. The primary purpose in having a settlement agreement become a court order is to get the imprimatur of the court, i.e., to turn the agreement into a court order so that it will be controlled by the rules applicable to judgments and court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Consent judgments are a hybrid of two competing aspects of the law. \u201cConsent judgments or decrees are essentially agreements entered into by the parties which must be endorsed by the court. They have attributes of both contracts and judicial decrees.\u201d <em>Chernick v. Chernick, </em>327 Md. 470, 478, 610 A.2d 770, 774 (1992).

Whether the law of contracts or judgments governs the interpretation of an aspect of a consent judgment is determined by the character of the specific aspect. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>\u201c[o]nce the court adopt[ed] the agreement of the parties and set[ ] it forth as a judgment of the court ... the contractual character of the agreement [was] subsumed into the court-ordered judgment.\u201d <em>Henderson v.

As one court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">Consent judgments are entered daily in our courts, and if they do not have a binding effect as to all of the issues raised, it would not be long before resort to this expeditious way of terminating litigation would cease. Certainly, under our present practice, which allows parties to protect themselves by providing for partial judgments and special findings to be made on issues of fact, a general judgment entered by consent should have as great if not greater adjudicative efficacy as to all of the questions in issue as one entered after a trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-11\"><em>Waldroup, </em>38 N.J.Super. at 426-27, 119 A.2d at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">We hold that, generally, for purposes of the issue before us in the case <em>sub judice, </em>consent judgments should normally be given the same force and effect as any other judgment, including judgments rendered after litigation.

The Discount Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">We now turn our attention to whether the discount provision was part of the consent judgment rendered by the trial court. If it was part of the consent judgment, then it is an order of the court and, thus, subject to the Maryland Rules. We hold that the discount provision was an integral part of the consent judgment. Respondent argues that we should only look to the first sentence of the judgment, which states, \u201cjudgment in favor of Plaintiff, Selbe Hubbard and against Oliver Jones and Mattie B. Jones in the amount of $5,000.00.\u201d Her contention is that the second sentence, \u201cJudgment can be settled upon payment of $2,5[5]0.00 within 30 days,\u201d should be ignored because it is contractual in nature and not a part of the consent agreement. This is simply wrong. The trial court\u2019s rendition of the entire judgment and its entry in the docket embody the consent judgment. Only by reading the consent judgment in whole can we interpret the intent and effect of the judgment. The discount provision clearly was intended by the parties and by the trial court to be part and parcel of the consent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">We noted in <em>Roged, Inc. v. Paglee, </em>280 Md. 248, 254, 372 A.2d 1059, 1062 (1977), a case involving a consent decree, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiM\">It is well settled that Maryland follows the objective test in the interpretation of contracts ... that where the language is plain and unambiguous, there is no room for construction, and it must be presumed that the parties meant what they expressed: not what the parties intended the contract to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. We have extended this principle to the interpretation of judicial decrees. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">We had earlier said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">We fail to see why a somewhat analogous approach should not be taken in the interpretation of a judicial decree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>whether or not it supplants a prior agreement of the </em>parties\u2014that it is not so much a question of what the parties or what the court intended the decree to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties, or of the court, would have thought it meant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\"><em>Monticello v.

Sacred Heart Hosp., </em>273 Md. 638, 643, 331 A.2d 313, 317 (1975) (quoting <em>Slice v.

This implication was demonstrated by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Shanty Town </em>Assocs., 92 Md.App. 103, 607 A.2d 66. In that case involving the interpretation of a consent judgment, the court implied that one needs to read the complete language of a consent judgment to determine its purpose. Thus, to understand the true meaning of a consent order,, the language of the judgment must be \u201c[r]ead as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 607 A.2d at 71. \u201c[T]he entire judgment\u2014all provisions considered\u2014should be read as a whole in the light of all the circumstances as well as of the conduct of the parties.\u201d <em>Hanson v.

The decree must be read as a whole, each of its provisions being interpreted together with its other provisions.\u201d <em>Westinghouse Air Brake Div. v. United Electrical, </em>294 Pa.Super. 407, 414, 440 A.2d 529, 533 (1982). \u201cAn interpretation of the judgment that gives meaning according to its entirety is favored over one that makes some part of it mere surplusage.\u201d <em>Hanson, </em>521 So.2d at 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>all parties agree as to what the judgment meant\u2014a discount if paid within thirty days. The agreement was turned into a court order when the parties jointly sought to have the trial court render and cause the entering of a judgment. When respondent initiated action <em>in the </em>case\u2014a \u201cPetition for Disposition in Aid of Enforcement of Judgment\u201d\u2014and petitioners responded with an answer and a \u201cMotion for Injunction\u201d <em>in the case, </em>the issue was framed as an action to enforce a court judgment, i.e., a court order. At this stage, it was not an action for specific enforcement of a contract; it was a proceeding based upon a court judgment and court order. The rules regarding judgments and court orders apply in proceedings based upon the judgment and order, starting the moment the entire judgment is rendered by the judge and entered and indexed by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has similarly interpreted consent agreements. In <em>Richardson v. Edwards, </em>127 F.3d 97, 101 (D.C.Cir.1997), that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">The Supreme Court has warned against searching \u201cfor the \u2018purpose\u2019 of a consent decree\u201d and then construing it in that light. <em>[United States v.] ITT Continental Baking [Co.], </em>420 U.S. [223,] 235, 95 S.Ct. [926,] 933[, 43 L.Ed.2d 148 (1975) ]. The decree must be construed \u201cas it is written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 95 S.Ct. at 935[, 43 L.Ed.2d 148]. Ordinary \u201caids of construction,\u201d such as the circumstances surrounding the formation of the consent order, may be consulted. <em>Id. </em>at 238 &amp; n. 11, 95 S.Ct. at 935 &amp; n. 11[, 43 L.Ed.2d 148], But ultimately the question for the lower court, when it inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>prets a consent decree incorporating a settlement agreement, is what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought the language meant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Read in its entirety, the wording of the consent judgment is plain and unambiguous. It clearly includes the language: \u201cJudgment can be settled upon payment of $2,5[5]0.00 within 30 days.\u201d It is evident from the wording of the entire judgment that the parties intended for the discount provision to be part of the consent judgment. Generally, the consent judgment must be construed in its entirety, as written, rendered, and entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the discount provision was included in the consent judgment. Clearly it was the intent of the parties to agree to the discount provision. In fact, the transcript indicates that it is an essential part of the consent agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">MR. WRIGHT: Your Honor, by consent of the Parties, a judgement will be entered in the amount of $5,000.00 in favor of the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">MISS DAVIS: [$]2,550.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">MR. WRIGHT:\u2014in favor\u2014well, you can hear out what I thought was our settlement proposal\u2014in favor of the Plaintiff against the Defendants, which may be settled within 30 days by payment of [$]2[,]550.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">Is that consistent with our agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">MISS DAVIS: That\u2019s good enough. That\u2019s fine, Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5g\">The evidence points towards the conclusion that the discount provision was an integral part of the consent agreement. In other words, if the petitioner paid the <em>judgment </em>within thirty days, then the amount of the judgment would be discounted. Once the trial court entered the entire judgment, i.e., the money judgment and the discount provision, it became an order of the court. <em>See </em>Md. Rule l-202(n) <em>supra. </em>As we have noted, a judgment is a judgment. We shall not enforce only part of its wording. Consequently, under the consent order, the judgment could be settled within thirty days at the payment of the discount sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>C. Time</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Because the discount proviso is included in the consent judgment and is, therefore, an order of the court, Maryland Rule l-203(a) applies to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Maryland Rule l-203(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">(a) <em>Computation of time after an act, event, or default. </em>In computing any period of time prescribed by these rules, by rule or order of court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not included. If the period of time allowed is more than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays are counted; but if the period of time allowed is seven days or less, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays are not counted. The last day of the period so computed is included unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">(1) it is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">(2) the act to be done is the filing of a paper in court and the office of the clerk of that court on the last day of the period is not open, or is closed for a part of the day, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, holiday, or a day on which the office is not open during its regular hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">We now look to the legislative intent behind this provision. As we noted, <em>supra, </em>the canons of statutory construction are applicable in respect to rule construction. The relevant language of Maryland Rule l-203(a), \u201c[i]n computing any period of time prescribed ... by rule or order of court ... [t]he last day of the period so computed is included unless: (1) it is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday\u201d is plain and free from ambiguity. First, it dictates that it applies to court orders such as consent judgments. Second, it directs that if the last day of a period was a Saturday, which it was in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the period shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>nm until the end of the next day that was not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday\u2014in this case, the following Monday.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">As we stated, <em>supra, </em>if petitioners paid the judgment within thirty days, then the amount of the judgment would be discounted. Under the facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>the thirtieth day fell on Saturday, March 15, 1997. Pursuant to Maryland Rule l-203(a), the period for payment of the judgment ran until the end of the next day that was not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday. That day was Monday, March 17, 1997, the day that petitioners paid respondent the amount due under the discount .provision, $2,550.00. \u201cA set method of time computation brings a degree of certainty to the law.\u201d <em>Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y, </em>306 Md. at 265, 508 A.2d at 141. We hold that petitioners\u2019 payment was timely and, therefore, satisfied the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">II. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">We hold that, generally, consent judgments are to be afforded the same force and effect as any other type of judgment. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the discount proviso was. part and parcel of the consent judgment and became a court order when the trial court rendered it on the record and the clerk entered it on the docket. That judgment, therefore, was governed by Maryland Rule l-203(a) and the due date for payment was extended to the next working day by virtue of falling on a Saturday. Thus, petitioners\u2019 payment of the discounted judgment on Monday, March 17, 1997 was timely. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR KENT COUNTY; RESPONDENT TO PAY THE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\">.

Prior wording required that the clerk only enter the judgment. The judgment in the case <em>sub judice </em>was rendered on February 13, 1997; therefore, the current version of Maryland Rule 2-601 was not controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">.
