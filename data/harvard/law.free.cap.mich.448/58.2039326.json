We decide that only those factors that are objective and verifiable may be used to judge whether substantial and compelling reasons exist, and thereby uphold the basic tenets of the test announced by the Court of Appeals in <em>People v Hill, </em>192 Mich App 102; 480 NW2d 913 (1991). The trial court in this case used both objective and subjective factors to determine that a deviation from the ten-year minimum sentence was appropriate. Consequently, we vacate the sentence imposed and remand to the trial court for the determination whether, in considering only those factors that are objective and verifiable, there are substantial and compelling reasons to sentence this defendant to a term of years below the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The defendant, Warren Perry Fields, pleaded guilty of one count of possession with intent to deliver more than 50 but less than 225 grams of cocaine. MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(iii); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(iii). The Legislature has prescribed a minimum sentence of ten years in prison for this crime. It also, however, has empowered courts to depart from some of the minimum sentence prescriptions under certain circumstances. MCL 333.7401(4); MSA 14.15(7401)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">The court may depart from the minimum term of imprisonment authorized under subsection (2)(a)(ii), (iii), or (iv) if the court finds on the record that there are substantial and compelling reasons to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">After accepting the defendant\u2019s plea, the court heard arguments on a request by the defense that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the judge depart below the statutorily imposed minimum sentence. After listening to statements from both sides on the issue, the judge applied <em>People v Troncoso, </em>187 Mich App 567; 468 NW2d 287 (1991), and decided to depart from the statutory minimum. The judge summarized his reasons for departure as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u2022 I\u2019m satisfied that the basis for my deviating from the mandatory 10-year is that you\u2019re a young man of 24 years of age and you have no prior record. I\u2019m also satisfied \u2014 standing alone obviously wouldn\u2019t matter but you just were over the 50 gram mark, the 54 grams.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> This appears to be, based upon the record, your only involvement that can be established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">You had a good job for over five years with a good work record, and I\u2019m taking into consideration the extreme remorse that I see from you. You are devastated by this. You\u2019ve admitted your guilt, and you\u2019ve accepted your responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">You\u2019ve got family[,] friends and co-workers, as evidenced by the letters, indicate you do \u2014 are a person capable of rehabilitation. I think you have a potential for rehabilitation, and I\u2019m satisfied that your motivation to help others, although totally in some respects outbalanced, at least it indicates that you\u2019re not a cold, callous drug dealer out to profit solely for your own benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The judge then deviated from the ten-year minimum, sentencing the defendant to a prison term of five to twenty years. The plaintiff appealed, and the Court of Appeals remanded for resentencing, citing <em>Hill, supra, </em>which had been decided as the appeal was pending. The defendant then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AuF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"AxQ\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">In 1978, the Legislature considered a bill to change the penalties imposed on controlled substance offenders. The legislative history of the bill indicates that it. was intended to combat an increase in drug-related crime. The House Legislative Analysis stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">Some persons claim that the state has failed to stem drug traffic because the penalties for drug dealing are not severe enough, and law enforcement tools are inadequate. They contend that the potential for profit in drug dealing is so great that Michigan\u2019s present penalties pose little or no deterrent to would-be violators, with lenient probation and parole policies weakening the threat of imprisonment still further. [House Legislative Analysis, HB 4190, Third Analysis, May 17, 1978.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The legislative analysis summarizes arguments advanced by both supporters and opponents of the bill. One argument advanced in support of the bill was summarized,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">The severe penalties imposed by the bill would have an important deterrent effect on illicit drug dealing. With the present drug penalties and parole possibilities, dealers feel that if caught they will spend little or no time in prison. The risk to them seems relatively small, and the potential for profit great. Consequently, only more severe penalties and the certainty of punishment will serve to deter would be violators. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In order to combat this problem, the Legislature decided to impose harsh minimum sentences for drug dealers. The law went into effect September 30, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Ten years later, the Legislature passed several amendments to the original statute, reducing the minimum sentences imposed. These amendments also included the addition of \u00a77401(4), which allowed a trial judge to deviate from minimum sentences Set out in the statute if there were substantial and compelling reasons to do so. According to the Senate Fiscal Agency, the bill\u2019s supporters argued that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">by allowing judges to depart from the minimum terms, and reducing the minimum for larger quantities, the bill would moderate what has been an uncompromising law and would give judges greater flexibility in making sentencing decisions based on the individual circumstances of a case. [Senate Fiscal Agency Analysis, SB 598, 600, 603, 610, Third Analysis, August 29, 1988.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The House Legislative Analysis added,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">The bill would make for a law that was strict without unduly interfering with judicial discretion. [House Legislative Analysis, SB 277 (Substitute H-2), First Analysis, December 16, 1987.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In 1989, the Legislature amended the law again, in order to return the minimum sentences for larger quantities to their original, longer lengths. 1989 PA 143. Section 7401(4) was left unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The words \"substantial and compelling\u201d caused almost immediate conflict in the lower courts. In <em>People v </em>Downey, 183 Mich App 405; 454 NW2d 235 (1990), the Court of Appeals panel analyzed several sentences that deviated from the statutory minimum. The panel concluded that judicial dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>cretion under the statute was \"very limited,\u201d and set strict standards for what kinds of reasons could be considered substantial and compelling. Central to those standards was the requirement that only objective factors capable of verification could be used to justify departure from the statutory minimum. The Court also held that only factors that existed before the defendant was arrested could be considered objective. <em>Id. </em>at 415-416.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In <em>People v </em>Krause, 185 Mich App 353; 460 NW2d 900 (1990), the Court of Appeals affirmed the \"objective and verifiable\u201d requirement set forth in <em>Downey. </em>The Court defined objective and verifiable factors as those \"actions or occurrences which are external to the minds of the judge, defendant and others involved in making the decision . . . [that are] capable of being confirmed.\u201d <em>Krause </em>at 358. The Court in <em>Krause </em>also modified the <em>Downey </em>test, by allowing trial judges to use both prearrest and postarrest factors. It warned, however, that postarrest factors should be used with caution because of the risk that defendants will create postarrest events to influence the sentencing judge. <em>Krause, supra </em>at 358-359.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Judge Griffin dissented in <em>Krause, </em>arguing that as long as the factors used to deviate from the statutory minimum were substantial and compelling, it should not matter whether they were objective and verifiable. He noted that neither the statute, the relevant legislative history, nor the common meaning of the words substantial and compelling even hinted at a subjective/objective dichotomy, and accused the Court in <em>Downey </em>of creating hurdles not intended by the Legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 363-365.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Judge Griffin later used his dissenting opinion in <em>Krause </em>as the basis for his majority opinion in <em>Troncoso, supra. Troncoso </em>created a split in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>case law, which was resolved by <em>Hill, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Hill, </em>the Court upheld the standard enunciated in <em>Krause. </em>Judge Griffin wrote a strong dissenting opinion, again restating his arguments in <em>Troncoso.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Statutes should be interpreted according to the common and approved usage of any undefined words within them. MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1). <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, Third College Edition </em>defines \"substantial,\u201d in relevant part, as, \"2 real; actual; true; not imaginary 3 strong; solid; firm; stout 4 considerable; ample; large 5 of considerable worth or value; important . . . .\u201d It defines \"compelling,\u201d in relevant part, as, \"irresistibly or keenly interesting, attractive, etc.; captivating</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">From these definitions it is evident that the words \"substantial and compelling\u201d constitute strong language. The Legislature did not wish that trial judges be able to deviate from the statutory minimum sentences for any reason. Instead, the reasons justifying departure should \"keenly\u201d or \"irresistibly\u201d grab our attention, and we should recognize them as being \"of considerable worth\u201d in deciding the length of a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The legislative history of MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401) supports this interpretation of the words substantial and compelling. By passing MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401), the Legislature hoped to keep drug dealers in prison for long periods, both .to remove them from society and to deter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>others from following their example. House Legislative Analysis, HB 4190, Third Analysis, May 17, 1978. See also <em>Hill, supra </em>at 116-117. In this context \"substantial and compelling\u201d cannot acquire a meaning that would allow trial judges to regularly use broad discretion to deviate from the statutory minimum. Such an interpretation would defeat the intent of the statute. Rather, it is reasonable to conclude that the Legislature intended \"substantial and compelling reasons\u201d to exist only in exceptional cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">It is true that the legislative history of the 1988 amendments indicates that \u00a7 7401(4) was meant to allow judges some flexibility in sentencing under the formerly rigid law. The legislative analyses consistently mention a desire to \"moderate\u201d an \"uncompromising\u201d law through judicial discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the Legislature will be presumed under established rules of statutory construction to have intended that its amendments of a statute be construed in connection and in harmony with the other provisions of the statute. <em>Williams v Secretary of State, </em>338 Mich 202, 207; 60 NW2d 910 (1953). The moderating effect of the 1988 amendments should therefore be read in light of the overarching intent of the Legislature to deter people from committing drug-related crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">We believe that the best method of maintaining the limited but moderating effect intended by the Legislature is to uphold the \"objective and verifiable\u201d test recently approved by the Court of Appeals in <em>Hill, supra. </em>This test allows judges to consider many of the factors traditionally utilized in formulating sentences. It also provides sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>restrictions to assure that the Legislature\u2019s intent in passing the statute will not be subsumed by the use of what is intended to be an exception to the rule of long mandatory sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We respect the opinion, voiced by Judge Griffin in <em>Troncoso, </em>that these are judicially concocted boundaries not contemplated by the Legislature or in the definitions of the words themselves. <em>Troncoso, supra </em>at 574. This is undoubtedly true to some extent. Nevertheless, we agree with the majority in <em>Hill </em>that the <em>Troncoso </em>standard does not adequately reflect the Legislature\u2019s intent to keep drug dealers off the streets and to deter others from following their paths. House Legislative Analysis, HB 4190, Third Analysis, May 17, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Furthermore, the subjectivity of the <em>Troncoso </em>standard makes appellate review of sentencing departures under the statute more difficult, and thus impairs the right of prosecutors to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> An appellate court cannot review whether the defendant has expressed remorse, or if he has a desire to help others, factors cited by the trial judge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">For these reasons, we believe that the intent of the Legislature is better served by giving the words \"substantial and compelling\u201d a more specifically defined meaning. As the Court of Appeals remarked in <em>Hill, supra </em>at 118:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">We find that if trial judges can use factors that are both subjective and not verifiable, they would have freedom to depart from the mandatory minimum for almost any reason they choose to use and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>they would hold in their hands the power to defeat the legislative purpose at will, subject only to review for abuse of discretion and lack of proportionality under <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990), the same standards that apply to sentences that are not mandatory. If one wishes to argue that judges ought to have such greater discretion, the argument should be addressed to the Legislature and not to the appellate courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">To leave the definitions of substantial and compelling to the discretion of the sentencing court therefore belies the legislative purpose in enacting a presumptive sentencing statute. <em>People v Brown, </em>184 Mich App 722, 723-724; 439 NW2d 38 (1990). In approving the objective and verifiable test, we hope to make it easier for both trial and appellate courts to sentence and review respectively within the perimeters that the Legislature intended.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">For additional guidance in regard to the meaning of the words \"substantial and compelling,\u201d we look to other jurisdictions that use these words to govern departures from presumptive sentences set by a state legislature. Several state legislatures and courts that have defined and interpreted this language in the sentence departure context have limited its meaning to exclude subjective factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The Washington Legislature has created a system of presumptive sentences, or sentencing guidelines. See Wash Rev Code Ann 9.94A.010 <em>et seq. </em>These guidelines require that if a judge departs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>from the presumptive sentence, the judge must list substantial and compelling reasons for the departure. Wash Rev Code Ann 9.94A. 120(2). In the statute, the Washington Legislature provides several examples of mitigating reasons that may be used to justify a downward departure from the guidelines. The great majority of these examples consist of circumstances surrounding the offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Although there is a split in authority, the Washington appellate courts have been moving toward an interpretation of their state\u2019s guidelines under which only objective factors could be used to justify a downward departure from a presumptive sentence. In <em>State v Hodges, </em>70 Wash App 621; 855 P2d 291 (1993), the Court of Appeals of Washington considered whether to affirm a downward de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>parture on the basis of several subjective factors. The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">An exceptional sentence is appropriate only when the circumstances of the crime distinguish it from other crimes of the same statutory category. . . . The [1981 Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s] sentencing guidelines must be applied \"equally to offenders in all parts of the state, without discrimination as to any element that does not relate to the crime or the previous record of the defendant.\u201d RCW 9.94A.340. [lid. at 624. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The court then concluded that \" 'departure is warranted only if objective factors common to the crime (as opposed to subjective factors relative to a particular defendant) are present.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 625.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The departure provisions in Oregon\u2019s sentencing guidelines are similar to Washington\u2019s. The sentencing judge may not depart from a presumptive sentence under Oregon law unless he finds substantial and compelling reasons to do so on the record. Or Admin R 253-08-001.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Legislature in Oregon, like Washington, has provided a nonexclusive list of reasons that may be used to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>a downward departure from the guidelines. Most of these examples involve circumstances surrounding the oifense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Oregon\u2019s appellate courts have also suggested that only objective factors should be used to justify a departure from that state\u2019s sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">To assist sentencing courts in determining whether substantial and compelling reasons exist, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>OAR 253-08-002(1) provides a list of aggravating and mitigating factors .... The examples in the commentary to the rule show that the factors permit consideration of the circumstances of a particular crime, which might be different from what was envisioned by the legislature when it established the presumptive sentence for that crime. If the court relies on a factor listed in OAR-253-08-002(1), its reasons for applying the rule must show that the case before it involves that sort of circumstance. The court must provide the same kind of explanation if it relies on factors not expressed in OAR 253-08-002. [State <em>v Wilson, </em>111 Or App 147, 150-151; 826 P2d 1010 (1992).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">It should also be noted that the Oregon courts look to the decisions of the Washington courts to help interpret their sentencing guidelines. <em>State v Kennedy, </em>113 Or App 134; 831 P2d 712 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The legislature in Kansas has also passed sentencing guidelines that contain a departure provision utilizing the phrase, \"substantial and compelling reasons.\u201d The Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act only went into effect on July 1, 1993, and, consequently, the Kansas state courts have not yet developed a body of case law interpreting the meaning of the phrase, \"substantial and compelling reasons.\u201d There are indications, however, that Kansas will also interpret this language to require that objective factors be used to justify a departure from the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">One such indication is that because of similarities between the two states, Oregon\u2019s sentencing guidelines served as perhaps the most influential model for the Kansas Legislature in constructing its guidelines. Moreover, the guidelines system implemented explicitly embraced retribution and incapacitation as the principal reasons for punishment and imprisonment. Thus, the crime of conviction, rather than the nature of the offender, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>become the primary determinant of the sentence. Gottlieb, <em>Kansas adopts sentencing guidelines, </em>6 Fed Sent Rptr 158 (1993). Finally, as the Washington and Oregon Legislatures, the Kansas Legislature has provided the courts of that state with a nonexclusive list of mitigating factors. The listed factors, without exception, encompass circumstances surrounding the offense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Although there are differences between these statutes and the statute at issue in this case, we think that the way the words \"substantial and compelling\u201d have been interpreted in the sentence departure context by other courts and legislatures serves as persuasive authority in regard to the most natural meaning of this language in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>area of the law. <em>Craig v Larson, </em>432 Mich 346, 356; 439 NW2d 899 (1989). That foreign jurisdictions have concentrated on circumstances surrounding the offense committed and excluded subjective factors from their interpretations reinforces our belief that our Legislature had a similar intention in referring to substantial and compelling reasons in MCL 333.7401(4); MSA 14.15(7401)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In order to refine and further clarify the test announced today, we make the following observations. First, in evaluating whether a case presents substantial and compelling reasons to depart below the mandatory minimum, courts should place particular emphasis on mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense. For example, in <em>People v Bates, </em>190 Mich App 281, 282-283; 475 NW2d 392 (1991), the trial court found that the defendant\u2019s only participation in the crime had consisted of providing transportation for the seller, and that his involvement was not for financial profit. It is appropriate for a sentencing judge to assign this type of fact situation considerable weight in deciding whether to depart from the statutory minimum. These kinds of circumstances, which fall short of warranting a finding of innocence but render the defendant less culpable, are often especially compelling because of the possibility that the Legislature did not consider this type of behavior when it set the statute\u2019s harsh minimum sentences.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Second, we approve of the short, nonexclusive list of factors set forth in <em>Downey </em>and <em>Hill, </em>for the purpose of evaluating whether a departure from the mandatory minimum is warranted. Those factors were identified as (1) the defendant\u2019s prior record, (2) the defendant\u2019s age, and (3) the defendant\u2019s work history.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Downey, supra </em>at 414-415.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Third, we overrule the notion from <em>Krause, supra, </em>that factors that arise after the defendant\u2019s arrest are disfavored. These factors should be assigned the same weight as preexisting factors such as age or employment history. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s cooperation with law enforcement officials should be given special attention by the sentencing court. Such assistance enables the authorities to more effectively fight drug-related crime, thus advancing the fundamental goal of MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401). House Legislative Analysis, HB 4190, Third Analysis, May 17, 1978. We note that the federal sentencing guidelines allow courts to depart below statutory minimum sentences under similar circumstances, as do the sentencing laws of several states. See, e.g., 18 USC 3553(e); USSG \u00a7 5K1.1; Idaho Code 37-2732B(8); Or Admin R 253-08-002(1)(a)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Finally, we hold that the existence or nonexistence of a particular factor is a factual determination for the sentencing court to determine, and should therefore be reviewed by an appellate court for clear error. <em>People v Legg, </em>197 Mich App 131, 134; 494 NW2d 797 (1992); <em>People v Harvey, </em>203 Mich App 445; 513 NW2d 185 (1994). The determination that a particular factor is objective and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>verifiable should be reviewed by the appellate courts as a matter of law. A trial court\u2019s determination that the objective and verifiable factors present in a particular case constitute substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the statutory minimum sentence shall be reviewed for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In order to give further guidance regarding the meaning of \"substantial and compelling\u201d within the context of MCL 333.7401(4); MSA 14.15(7401)(4), we cite with approval the following cases from the Court of Appeals. In <em>Harvey, supra, </em>the Court affirmed a trial judge\u2019s departure from the statutory minimum. The defendant in <em>Harvey </em>had no prior record at the age of thirty-three and had been steadily employed at General Motors for fourteen years. He had strong family support and had been on a tether program for about a year before sentencing where he was, in the words of the trial court, an exemplary probationer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We find the combination of the age and employment history of the defendant in this case to be especially noteworthy. Although courts often cite the young age of a defendant as a reason to deviate from a minimum sentence, a person who has advanced to middle age with a clean slate and a solid career may also present a compelling case for deviation, as someone with a proven capacity to live within the bounds society has set.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">In <em>People v Shinholster, </em>196 Mich App 531; 493 NW2d 502 (1992), the Court of Appeals found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>substantial and compelling reasons existed to depart from the minimum statutory sentence. The defendant, at age thirty-six, had a prior record that included only an eleven-year-old conviction for the possession of marijuana, a history of steady employment, and strong family support. In addition, the Court found that the government\u2019s actions, although not rising to the level of entrapment, purposefully escalated the crime. This last factor is of particular importance in our approval of the resolution reached in <em>Shinholster. </em>As a mitigating circumstance surrounding the offense, it weighs heavily in favor of a deviation from the statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In <em>People v Poppa, </em>193 Mich App 184; 483 NW2d 667 (1992), the defendant argued that substantial and compelling reasons' existed for a departure from the statutory minimum. He pointed to his extensive cooperation with law enforcement officials, and the defendant\u2019s assertion that part of the problems the defendant had been having at the time of his arrest were the result of his recent emigration from Romania and his difficulty adjusting to his newfound freedoms. The Court held that the trial court had acted within its discretion in not finding a sufficient basis to depart from the minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">We find that these cases correctly implemented the requirements of the test we approve and modify today. As the appellate courts of this state continue to work with and refine this test, we believe it will become progressively easier to evaluate what are and are not substantial and compelling reasons under the statute.

These reasons were not all objective and verifiable as we have now defined those terms. The judge considered in his analysis that the defendant had expressed \"extreme remorse,\u201d that he had accepted responsibility for his actions and was devastated by their results, and that he was motivated to help others. These factors, while acceptable under <em>Troncoso, </em>we now find to be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">However, the trial judge also listed several factors that are appropriate under the standard we announce today, including the defendant\u2019s age, his solid work record, and the fact that the defendant had no prior contact with the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Sentencing normally is not a job for the appellate court, the usual procedure being to send the case back to the trial judge for resentencing if it is found that the sentence is in some respect deficient. <em>People v Earegood, </em>383 Mich 82; 173 NW2d 205 (1970). It is unclear whether the trial judge in this case would have found substantial and compelling reasons to deviate from the statutory minimum solely on the basis of objective and verifiable factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Therefore we remand the case to the trial court for the judge to determine whether, under the standard announced today, he finds substantial and compelling reasons to deviate from the statutory minimum.

I would affirm the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>sion of the Court of Appeals, albeit for reasons other than those articulated by that Court. The majority analyzes the intent of the Legislature both in enacting the original version of MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401) and in amending that statute, inter alia, to add subsection 4. Bkickley, C.J., <em>ante </em>at 64-65. From this analysis, the majority concludes that the statute has an \"overarching intent ... to deter people from committing drug-related crimes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 68, while allowing trial courts some flexibility to depart below the statutory minimum sentences in the unique cases in which \"the Legislature\u2019s intent in passing the statute will not be subsumed by the use of what is intended to be an exception to the rule of long mandatory sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69. Although I agree with the majority\u2019s analysis of legislative intent, in my view, the statute fails to provide a satisfactory explanation of \"substantial and compelling reasons.\u201d The majority approaches the inadequately defined \"substantial and compelling reasons\u201d as if the Court has the authority to decide, as a matter of law, which factors should be included or excluded through application of an \" 'objective and verifiable\u2019 \u201d test. <em>Id. </em>at 68. The dissent would resolve the quandary by concluding that an objective and verifiable standard \"is unworkable,\u201d Cavanagh, J., <em>post </em>at 100, in favor of broad judicial discretion to subjectively consider all the circumstances that surround the particular offender and the particular offense. <em>Id. </em>at 90. I believe that in lieu of legislative clarification, we could provide guidance to the trial and appellate courts in implementation of the legislative intent by reference to the well-established meaning of \"substantial and compelling\u201d and the traditional standards regarding the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion. However, although I do not join in the majority\u2019s approval of <em>People v Shinhol</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>ster,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Brickley, C.J., <em>ante </em>at 78-79, in light of the extensive efforts of the Court of Appeals to provide meaningful guidance in interpreting the statutes at issue, I believe it would be a disservice to that Court, the trial courts, and the bar to dispose of this question in a plurality opinion. Accordingly, I concur with Chief Justice Brickley\u2019s resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Recognizing the primary legislative intent of the statute to deter drug crimes through the imposition of long minimum sentences,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is evident that the burden rests on the defendant to demonstrate substantial and compelling reasons on the record why a minimum sentence below that required by law is dictated and would not do damage to the law\u2019s overriding purpose. Thus, the presumption is, in all cases, that at least the minimum statutory sentence should be imposed. It is only when a. defendant can demonstrate justifications for a lower minimum sentence that are both substantial <em>and </em>compelling that such a departure is possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Initially, it is clear that substantial reasons for departure below the presumptively allowable minimum sentence are not enough to meet the defendant\u2019s burden. Satisfaction of the \"substantial evidence test\u201d standard of appellate review, for exam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>pie, used for review of decisions of administrative agencies, would be inadequate to meet a \"substantial and compelling reasons\u201d requirement. Under the substantial evidence test, only \"the amount of evidence that a reasonable mind would accept as sufficient to support a conclusion\u201d is required, <em>In re Payne, </em>444 Mich 679, 692; 514 NW2d 121 (1994) (opinion of Boyle, J.), despite the possible preponderance of evidence supporting a different conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 690, n 8, see also <em>Jackson v People, </em>9 Mich 111, 119 (1860), quoted in <em>Payne </em>at 690. The possibility of a debatable outcome is impermissible under the substantial and compelling evidence standard. The Legislature is presumed to have knowledge of the meaning of such terms and to have consciously elevated the burden of proof by the term \"compelling.\u201d Thus, unless those reasons also compel the conclusion that a lower minimum sentence should be imposed, the requirements of \u00a7 7401(4) have not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Demonstration of the distinction between substantial reasons and compelling reasons can be found in several United States Supreme Court decisions addressing constitutional questions outside the sphere of criminal law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Committee for Public Ed &amp; Religious Liberty v Nyquist, </em>413 US 756; 93 S Ct 2955; 37 L Ed 2d 948 (1973), the Court concluded that a package of financial aid programs for nonpublic elementary and secondary schools, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>created through amendment of New York State\u2019s education and tax laws, violated the Establishment Clause. The Court readily admitted that the state had \"substantial reasons\u201d for enacting the legislation. <em>Id. </em>at 795. \"Few would question most of the legislative findings supporting this statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court, however, still found that the programs were constitutionally impermissible. In rejecting the state\u2019s argument for preserving a portion of the legislation allowing tax credits to parents of children attending nonpublic schools, the Court concluded that the rationale of case precedent \"plainly compels the conclusion that New York\u2019s tax package violates the Establishment Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In <em>Hicklin v Orbeck, </em>437 US 518; 98 S Ct 2482; 57 L Ed 2d 397 (1978), the Court considered the constitutionality, under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, of a state statute deemed \"Alaska Hire.\u201d Claiming a desire to reduce unemployment, Alaska Hire required a number of categories of oil and gas related agreements to contain clauses requiring employment of qualified Alaska residents, in preference over nonresidents. Citing <em>Toomer v Witsell, </em>334 US 385; 68 S Ct 1156; 92 L Ed 1460 (1948), the Court admitted that the Privileges and Immunities Clause did not preclude state efforts to \"bias employment opportunities in favor of its own residents,\u201d 437 US 525, but noted that such discrimination was only permissible where a \"substantial reason\u201d for such action exists, i.e., \" 'there is something to indicate that noncitizens constitute a peculiar source of evil at which the [discriminatory] statute is aimed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525-526. The Court held that no appropriately substantial reason existed in <em>Hicklin </em>to justify the state\u2019s action, and, moreover, even if it did, Toomer, inter alia, \"compelled] the conclusion that Alaska Hire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>nevertheless fails to pass constitutional muster\u201d because the blanket preference for state residents did not bear a substantial relationship to the avowed purpose of reducing unemployment. <em>Id. </em>at 526-527.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Both \u2022 <em>Nyquist </em>and <em>Hicklin </em>demonstrate that while <em>substantial </em>reasons \u2014 strong, solid reasons of considerable value \u2014 may exist to justify a course of action, those reasons will be inadequate if countervailing, superior considerations are presented that <em>compel </em>a conclusion against such action. In the cases discussed above, those superior considerations were the requirements of the Establishment and Privileges and Immunities Clauses, which forced a conclusion striking down the legislative action in question. Those constitutional precepts are pr\u00e9sumptively \"compelling\u201d unless arguments for an exception are of such force that they are irrebuttable, being both substantial and compelling. In the present case, the superior consideration that must be met and decisively surmounted is the overarching legislative intent of deterrence of drug crimes. It is to further clarification of the \"substantial and compelling reasons\u201d standard of review to which I now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The \"substantial and compelling reasons\u201d standard is most familiar in challenges to state action burdening fundamental rights or discriminating against suspect classes. See, e.g., <em>Dunn v Blumstein, </em>405 US 330, 335; 92 S Ct 995; 31 L Ed 2d 274 (1972) (striking down durational residence requirements). Under this strict scrutiny standard of review, such state action is impermissible unless it is a necessary means to promote a compelling state interest. <em>Id. </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>While cases imposing a substantial and compelling reason standard of review where state action impinges on fundamental rights demonstrate the imposing burden such a standard represents, of more apt analogy to the present case is the less restrictive \"rational basis\u201d test applied to equal protection claims against state action that implicates no fundamental right or suspect classification. Under both the rational basis and strict scrutiny tests, a similarly high standard of proof is required of a party challenging the presumptively valid position. The rational basis test, however, presumes that the state action is valid. Such a presumption is analogous to the presumption that the minimum sentencing requirements of MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401) advance the valid legislative goal of crime deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In rational basis review cases, the state need only articulate, not prove, a legitimate state interest advanced by its action. \"There is a presumption that the objectives articulated by the ordinance are the ones actually pursued,\u201d and such presumption controls <em>\"'unless an examination of the circumstances forces . . . [the </em>conclusion] <em>that they could not have been a goal of the legislature.' \" JBK, Inc v City of Kansas City, Mo, </em>641 F Supp 893, 903 (WD Mo, 1986) (emphasis added), citing <em>Minnesota v Clover Leaf Creamery Co, </em>449 US 456, 463, n 7; 101 S Ct 715; 66 L Ed 2d 659 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">In <em>JBK, </em>plaintiffs brought a variety of constitutional challenges against an ordinance regulating massage parlors. In holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 substantive due process and equal protection claims did not survive the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court noted that to survive such a motion, the party challenging the legislation must \"offer evidence of a <em>substantial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>character (or at least an argument based upon <em>compelling </em>logic) which rebuts the presumption\u201d of constitutional validity. <em>Id. </em>at 904 (emphasis added). The court described the argument that must be advanced by the party opposing the motion to be one that \"forces the conclusion\u201d that the goal advanced for the legislation was not an objective actually pursued. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">United States Supreme Court cases applying the rational basis test to equal protection challenges clarify what is necessary to constitute \"evidence of a substantial character\u201d and an \"argument based upon compelling logic\u201d rebutting a presumption upholding state action. \"[T]hose challenging the legislative judgment must convince the court that the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based <em>could not reasonably be conceived to be true </em>by the governmental decision-maker.\u201d <em>Vance v Bradley, </em>440 US 93, 111; 99 S Ct 939; 59 L Ed 2d 171 (1979) (emphasis added). Parties challenging state action reviewed under the rational basis test must advance an argument precluding debate. Such challenges \"cannot prevail so long as 'it is evident from all the considerations presented . . . that the question is at least debatable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clover Leaf Creamery Co, supra </em>at 464. \"[I]t is the very admission that the facts are arguable that immunizes from constitutional attack\u201d the statute being challenged. <em>Vance, supra </em>at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">It is the need for an argument that \"forces the conclusion\u201d that the presumptive rule should not be applied that I would find to be at the crux of the \"substantial and compelling reasons\u201d of \u00a7 4, and makes the rational basis test a valuable tool for understanding this standard. As noted several times, the \"overarching intent\u201d of MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401) is \"to deter people from committing drug-related crimes.\u201d Like the legitimate state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>interest advanced under a rational basis review, this legislative intent is presumed to be advanced by the imposition of at least the minimum sentences commanded by the statute. It is only when a defendant advances an argument that convinces a court that the legislative intent \"could not reasonably be perceived\u201d to be advanced by imposition of the minimum sentence in the case, that \"substantial and compelling reasons\u201d for departure from the minimum sentence have been articulated. Thus, as long as it is evident from all the considerations presented that the question of departure from the statutory minimum is debatable, no substantial reasons compelling departure from the minimum should be found. In effect, the burden of proof is to satisfy the sentencing court that in the circumstances presented no reasonable legislative or judicial decisionmaker would impose the mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The standard described is a difficult but not impregnable barrier to a defendant convicted of a drug offense under MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401). For example, where a defendant substantially assists after arrest in the investigation or prosecution of another defendant, where such cooperation is verified by the proper authorities, departure below the minimum may be in order. See 18 USC 3553(e); USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. Imposition of the statutory minimum sentence where the defendant has provided assistance would discourage future cooperation, because other defendants perceive that no benefit can be derived from their action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Without such assistance, the task for au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>thorities in continuing to fight drug activity is made more difficult, and aggregate deterrent effect on the continued commission of drug crimes \u2014 the fundamental goal of MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401) \u2014 is thus retarded by the failure to deviate from the statutory requirements. However, although the Legislature has given the trial courts a stringent standard of discretion, confined in its exercise, it does not follow that other circumstances of a uniquely substantial and compelling character so as to compel deviation below the statutory minimum sentences may not be shown. As the legislative history clearly indicates, <em>ante </em>at 64-65, the Legislature also intended to allow flexibility in individual circumstances. The long and tortured history of judicial efforts to define \"substantial and compelling\u201d by reference to some touchstone that does not negate the express legislative preference is a graphic illustration that we are not well served by resort to amorphous terms like \"substantial and compelling\u201d without defining what is meant, if only by example. Where a statute prescribes a serious penalty on the one hand, and on the other invites avoidance by judicial construction, the underlying policy decisions have simply been shifted to another forum. In lieu of legislative guidance, I would resort to the standards inherent in any formulation of burden of proof and burden of persuasion. The defendant must come forward with evidence, and it must be sufficient to convince the trial court that no reasonable decisionmaker would impose the minimum sentence ordinarily assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In summary, the presumption exists that no lesser minimum sentence than that prescribed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>the statute should be imposed.

After examining the statutory language, and after considering the legislative intent, I would hold that the Legislature specified that the controlled substance sentencing departure from the mandatory minimum sentence threshold is a substantial and compelling reason. The Legislature did not specify any limitations on the types of factors a sentencing court may consider, nor did it specify the appropriate weight to be given any traditional sentencing factors. Therefore, a sentencing court may consider the individual circumstances of a case, i.e., all the factors and circumstances surrounding the offender and the offense. Moreover, because sentencing relates to <em>this </em>defendant, and to <em>this </em>sentencing judge, then, <em>by de\u00f1nition, </em>the weighing of all the factors and circumstances before the sentencing court must be subjective.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">I respectfully dissent because the majority is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>improperly adding limitations to judicial discretion that the Legislature has not intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In the instant case, the defendant pleaded guilty of possession with intent to deliver 50 to 225 grams of cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, the applicable statutory term of imprisonment was \"not less than 10 years nor more than 20 years.\u201d MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(iii); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(iii). The statute also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">The court may depart from the minimum term of imprisonment authorized under subsection (2)(a)(ii), (iii), or (iv) if the court finds on the record that there are <em>substantial and compelling </em>reasons to do so.

At that time, the Legislature <em>reduced </em>the mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment with the idea that the lower minimum terms would be more readily imposed. House Legislative Analysis, SB 277 (Substitute H-2), First Analysis, December 16, 1987. The bill also allowed departures from these mandatory minimums for substantial and compelling reasons. The recognized importance of judicial sentencing discretion emerged among the arguments supporting the bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">By reducing certain minimum terms, and allowing judges to depart from them, the bill would moderate what has been an <em>uncompromising </em>law and <em>would give judges greater flexibility </em>in making sentencing decisions based on the <em>individual cir</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>cumstances of a case. </em>At the same time, strong measures for major controlled substance violations would be retained.

It did not change the \"substantial and compelling\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Until today, we have not specifically addressed the issue before us now. However, in <em>People v </em>Schultz, 435 Mich 517; 460 NW2d 505 (1990),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> four members of this Court underscored the importance of judicial discretion in sentencing under this statute.

He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">Thus, the legislative mandate is clear: The sentencing courts of this state are authorized to exercise discretion and, in appropriate cases presenting substantial and compelling circumstances, to depart from the Public Health Code\u2019s mandatory minimum terms. <em>[Id. </em>at 531.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Justice Boyle, in her concurring opinion, also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">I have confidence that the trial judiciary of this state will apply today\u2019s decision in a manner that implements a public policy that decries the scourge of drugs while reflecting, <em>in appropriate cases, the equally important belief </em>that only the rarest individual is wholly bereft of the capacity for redemption. <em>[Id. </em>at 533-534.

After observing that the Legislature did not define \"substantial and compelling,\u201d the <em>Downey </em>panel looked to dictionary definitions of those terms and to statutes of Minnesota and Washington, which also used the \"substantial and compelling\u201d standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">After reviewing the history of sentencing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Michigan, the <em>Downey </em>panel properly noted that the rehabilitative potential of the individual is an appropriate factor for the sentencing court to consider.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <em>Downey </em>panel provided a \"nonexhaustive\u201d list of appropriate factors to consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">(1) the facts of the crime which mitigate defendant\u2019s culpability . . ., (2) defendant\u2019s prior record, (3) defendant\u2019s age, and (4) defendant\u2019s work history. [Id. at 414-415.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The panel then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">We should, however, state that the term \"substantial and compelling\u201d <em>implies </em>that the factor must be capable of verification and thus is an objective standard as opposed to a subjective one. For example, a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>readily verifiable and objective. On the other hand, a defendant\u2019s protestations of remorse and his actions after his arrest which are relied upon to show his remorse and rehabilitative potential are much more subjective and thus would not, absent other exceptional circumstances, be appropriate factors to consider. <em>[Id. </em>at 415-416. Emphasis added.]<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The <em>Downey </em>panel had to <em>infer </em>an \"objective\u201d limitation because there was no such direction from the Legislature. It further illustrated the difficulties of drawing an objective/subjective line by its attempt to characterize <em>external </em>actions as subjective. I think actions are observable by others and they are, therefore, verifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The difficulties of an arbitrary objective/subjective line were illustrated in <em>People v Krause, </em>185 Mich App 353; 460 NW2d 900 (1990). The <em>Krause </em>panel adopted the \"objective and verifiable\u201d limitation, but disagreed with the <em>Downey </em>panel\u2019s conclusion regarding the \"subjectivity\u201d of certain factors. The <em>Krause </em>majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">[W]e disagree with the <em>Downey </em>panel\u2019s conclusion that, because an action is taken or an incident occurs after a defendant\u2019s arrest, such action or incident becomes subjective. . . . The fact that a defendant expresses remorse, whether orally or in writing, is an objective action which can be confirmed. However, a defendant\u2019s intent when he expresses remorse is within his own mind and is, therefore, subjective. It cannot be confirmed by his own statement. Consequently, his mere protestation of remorse should not be considered as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>balancing factor for determining substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the mandatory sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">On the other hand, a defendant\u2019s active involvement in volunteer work, or cooperation with the police after his arrest, are events which exist outside the minds of the persons involved in deciding the defendant\u2019s sentence and can be verified. ... It is only when the sentencing court, upon an evaluation of all the objective, verifiable information, reaches the conclusion that the collective facts provide substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the mandatory sentence that it may, in the exercise of discretion, decide to do so. <em>[Id. </em>at 358-359.

Judge Griffin reviewed principles of statutory construction, found that the terms \"substantial and compelling\u201d were undefined by the Legislature, and looked to common dictionary definitions. He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">In light of these definitions and the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent to expand sentencing discretion, we cannot subscribe to the <em>Downey </em>restrictions which limit the sentencing court\u2019s consideration to prearrest factors capable of objective verification. The terms used by the Legislature plainly contemplate a broader scope of relevant criteria. . . . The litmus test invented by the <em>Downey </em>panel is a creative construction of a penal statute which is unsupported by any legislative history and not evident from a fair reading of the words used by the Legislature. <em>[Id. </em>at 574.]<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark>_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>In <em>People v Hill, </em>192 Mich App 102; 480 NW2d 913 (1991), a superpanel majority resolved the conflict in the Court of Appeals panels by adopting the <em>Downey </em>and <em>Krause </em>approach. In so doing, the <em>Hill </em>majority quoted and relied upon a legislative analysis that was written in 1978. In particular, the <em>Hill </em>majority quoted an argument against mandatory sentences that advocated greater sentencing discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 116-117, quoting House Legislative Analysis, HB 4190, Third Analysis, May 17, 1978. The majority stated: \"This latter point of view was obviously rejected when the mandatory minimum sentencing statutes were adopted.\u201d <em>Hill </em>at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">What is \"obvious,\u201d is that in 1987-88, some ten years later, this \"latter view\u201d was clearly reflected in the addition of \u00a7 7401(4). The <em>Hill </em>majority not only took statements out of context (by completely ignoring the accompanying statements in 1987-88 regarding increasing judicial discretion), it also relied on statements made in another time frame. The majority improperly failed to recognize that, in 1987-88, the Legislature did <em>not </em>reenact the approach that the majority claimed to be giving effect to. This fatal flaw in the majority\u2019s analysis led it to overemphasize the legislative intent to stiffen drug penalties, by <em>completely disregarding </em>the accompanying legislative intent to increase judicial sentencing discretion, and to give relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>from \"an uncompromising law.\u201d Senate Fiscal Agency Analysis, SB 277 (as enrolled) (1987 PA 275), Revised Third Analysis, January 5, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The <em>Hill </em>majority further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Regardless of whether the original mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and subsequent amendments have the desired results, we find that if trial judges can use factors that are both subjective and not verifiable, they would have freedom to depart from the mandatory minimum <em>for almost any reason </em>they choose to use and they would hold in their hands the power to defeat the legislative purpose at will, <em>subject only </em>to review for abuse of discretion and lack of proportionality under <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990), the same standards that apply to sentences that are not mandatory. <em>[Id. </em>at 118. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The <em>Hill </em>majority exaggerated the extent of the sentencing court\u2019s discretion. I believe that the review standard is higher than the <em>Milbourn </em>proportionality standard. The Legislature has established the standard of review of discretion, and that standard is substantial and compelling reasons \u2014 not just \"any\u201d reason.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AMG\">The <em>Hill </em>panel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">The threshold decision that the trial judge must make is whether there are substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the mandatory mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>mum sentence .... It is with respect to this threshold decision that the Legislature has evidenced its intent to limit to extreme cases departure from the statutory minimum sentence. However, once the trial court determines that there are substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the statutory minimum sentence, <em>there are no limits in the statute of the factors </em>that the trial judge may apply in deciding how far below the statutory minimum sentence the court should go. <em>[Id. </em>at 119. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">That is the whole point. The Legislature specified no limitations on the types of factors the sentencing court may consider. It only specified the threshold that the sentencing court must reach, and that threshold is that the circumstances of the case must establish a substantial and compelling case for a sentencing departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Judge Griffin, in his dissent in <em>Hill, </em>adhered to his approach in <em>Troncoso:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">There is nothing in the language of the statute or its legislative history that limits the discretion of sentencing judges to consideration of only those sentencing factors that are both \"objective\u201d and \"verifiable.\u201d Such restrictions are neither expressed nor implied in the law. The statute requires the articulated reasons for departure to be \"substantial and compelling,\u201d nothing more, nothing less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">The majority has chosen to rewrite the statute at issue. Its use of preamendment legislative history is puzzling. It appears that the majority relies upon the Legislature\u2019s now-discarded intent of permitting no deviation from the mandatory minimums only because there is no support for <em>Downey-Krause </em>in the legislative history of the 1987-1988 amendments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">The test created by the majority is a judicial invention never contemplated by the Legislature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The key terms \"objective\u201d and \"verifiable\u201d remain undefined and are therefore unworkable. We cannot look to the Legislature for guidance, because the Legislature has not used these terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">The problem of applying such vague standards is readily apparent in this case. Whether defendant Hill\u2019s substantial family support is an \"objective\u201d and \"verifiable\u201d sentencing factor is anyone\u2019s guess. <em>[Id. </em>at 121.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">After <em>Hill, </em>the Court of Appeals has addressed numerous factual challenges under the \"substantial and compelling\u201d standard. If anything, I think the cases indicate that the \"objective and verifiable\u201d limitation is unworkable.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">One good demonstration of the problem is found in <em>People v Harvey, </em>203 Mich App 445; 513 NW2d 185 (1994). The <em>Harvey </em>panel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">In this case, the trial court made objective findings that defendant had no prior record . . . and was thirty-three years of age at the time of his arrest. He also had <em>strong family support </em>and had been steadily employed at General Motors for fourteen years. In addition, he had been on a tether program (for the less serious conviction) for about a year before being sentenced for the instant offense and had been, in the words of the trial court, \"an exemplary probationer.\u201d <em>We \u00f1nd no clear error in the trial court\u2019s determination </em>that there were substantial and compelling reasons for a downward departure. <em>[Id. </em>at 448-449. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Notice that \"family support\u201d was one of the factors expressly rejected in <em>Downey. </em>The <em>Hill </em>majority intended to limit sentencing court discretion. But, by using circular terms, it has not limited appellate court discretion \u2014 if the appellate court wants to uphold a particular sentence depar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>ture, it need only state that the factors were objective and verifiable. If the appellate court wants to vacate the departure, it need only state that the factors were subjective. Is \"family support\u201d objective or is it subjective? There is no absolute answer. That is the flaw with an arbitrary objective/subjective test. The proper inquiry should be whether the nature and the extent of this defendant\u2019s family\u2019s support rise to the level of substantial and compelling reason, in the mind of this sentencing judge, to depart from the mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In the case at bar, the majority concludes that \"substantial and compelling\u201d reasons should be limited by the \"objective and verifiable\u201d test that was approved in <em>Hill. </em>The majority argues that this limitation will better serve the Legislature\u2019s' intent. Brickley, C.J., <em>ante </em>at 69-70. It states further that leaving the interpretation of \"substantial and compelling\u201d to sentencing courts \"belies the legislative purpose\u201d in enacting this statute. <em>Id. </em>at 70. The majority has ignored the other legislative intent to \"give judges greater flexibility in making sentencing decisions based on the individual circumstances of a case.\u201d Senate Fiscal Agency Analysis, SB 277 (as enrolled) (1987 PA 275), Revised Third Analysis, January 5, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">I am troubled by many of the majority\u2019s \"observations\u201d in part iv. For instance, the majority states that mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense should appropriately be given \"considerable weight in deciding whether to depart from the statutory minimum.\u201d Brickley, C.J., <em>ante </em>at 76. The majority finds such circumstances <em>\"especially compelling </em>because of the possibility that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the Legislature did not consider this type of behavior when it set the statute\u2019s harsh minimum sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76 (emphasis added). My first response is that the Legislature is presumed to know what it is doing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, if the Legislature did <em>not </em>know what it was doing, the argument becomes even stronger that sentencing courts should have broader sentencing discretion. And, finally, I do not see how a mere \"possibility,\u201d which may or may not be true, can ever be \"especially compelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">I would further add that if a factor can count both for and against the defendant, then, <em>by de\u00f1nition, </em>the sentencing court must have the ability to <em>subjectively </em>consider all the circumstances that surround the particular offender and the particular offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">For example, the educational background of the defendant <em>may </em>directly suggest rehabilitative potential.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For instance, an individual who has put himself through college reveals his ambition to try to improve his life. Moreover, whatever grades and success that the individual achieved in pursuing an education are personal achievements \u2014 not simply advantages of status. By comparison, an individual who, by accident of birth, comes from a wealthy status and yet fails to be graduated from high school or college, has perhaps revealed a lack of ambition, and, consequently, the educational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>background may suggest <em>lack </em>of rehabilitative potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Likewise, an employment history can reveal characteristics of this individual and may well better inform the sentencing judge about his culpability and rehabilitative potential. A work history <em>can </em>be bad. An individual who, for no particular reason, drifts from job to job reveals a lack of persistency. By the same measure, consider an individual who, by accident of birth, lives in an area with high unemployment and low standards of living. If that individual has persistently tried to hold a job, even if unsuccessfully, that individual again has revealed an ambition to try to improve his life. In such a case, I would argue that the individual\u2019s specific work history should legitimately be considered as a factor. Moreover, because the individual\u2019s work history can work either for or against that particular individual, then, by definition, the sentencing court must have the ability to subjectively consider all the circumstances that surround the particular offender and the particular offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Additionally, an individual\u2019s age can count both for and against that particular individual, and consequently, its significance must fall within the subjective discretion of the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In sum, because individual offenders and individual offenses involve radically different circumstances, by definition, the totality of the circumstances must be considered by the sentencing court in determining whether substantial and compelling reasons exist to depart from the statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In \u00a7 7401(4), the Legislature did not define \"sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>stantial and compelling.\u201d Clearly, the statute provides that one or more factors must be deemed substantial and compelling to the trial court that is sentencing the individual defendant. I believe that there could be no universal agreement about what rises to the level of substantial and compelling. It relates to <em>this </em>defendant and to <em>this </em>sentencing judge, who is examining <em>this </em>individual and <em>this </em>offense. If this type of discretion is not what the Legislature intended, it can and will say so. It certainly could have enumerated all the factors and the respective weight to be given to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Starting from the premise that the Legislature is presumed to be familiar with the principles of statutory construction,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it can be presumed that the Legislature intended that the Court first apply the plain meaning rule of statutory construction. Further, the Legislature can be presumed to know that the Court will also seek \"to give effect to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Gardner v Van Buren Public </em>Schools, 445 Mich 23, 44; 517 NW2d 1 (1994) (citation omitted). Under the plain meaning rule of statutory construction, the legislative intent is ascertained from what the Legislature said, not from what it <em>could </em>have said.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is absolutely no direction from the Legislature in either the language of \u00a7 7401(4), or in the legislative history surrounding its enactment, that we should limit substantial and compelling reasons to \"objective\u201d factors. Therefore, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s assertion that this was the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">I agree that the factors must be verifiable \u2014 for the simple premise that a reviewing court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>have an evidentiary basis to review the sentencing court\u2019s discretion. Therefore, the evidentiary basis logically must be verifiable. But how the individual factors are weighed, by definition, must be subjective.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">I cannot make, the leap to an \"objective\u201d limitation that the <em>Downey </em>panel made. I think Judge Griffin correctly predicted that the test is unworkable. <em>Harvey </em>demonstrates that a reviewing court can twist the \"objective\u201d linguistics test to support a desired result. For instance, is extreme remorse purely subjective if the defendant demonstrates outward signs of it? Again, one reviewing court can state that the remorse is subjective and reject the factor; another reviewing court can state that the remorse is objective and accept the factor. The better test is whether the sentencing judge is satisfied that the nature and the extent of the defendant\u2019s remorse are substantial and compelling reasons to support a sentencing departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The Legislature could have expressly listed appropriate mitigating or aggravating factors. For comparison, we can look at sentencing provisions used by other legislatures. For instance, a Rhode Island statutory provision uses the \"substantial and compelling\u201d standard, but, unlike our statute, <em>expressly limits </em>what may be considered substantial and compelling. For illegal possession of quantities of one ounce to one kilogram of a controlled substance, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">In all such cases, the justice imposing sentence shall impose a minimum sentence of ten (10) years imprisonment and may only impose a sentence less than that minimum if he or she finds that substantial and compelling circumstances exist which justify imposition of the alternative sentence. Such a finding may be based upon the character and background of the defendant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>cooperation of the defendant with law enforcement authorities, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and/or the nature and quality of the evidence presented at trial. If a sentence which is less than imprisonment for a term of ten (10) years is imposed, the trial justice shall set forth on the record the circumstances which he or she found as justification for imposition of the lesser sentence. [RI Gen Laws 21-28-4.01.l.]<footnotemark>[13]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Likewise, a Florida statute provides mandatory minimum sentences when greater amounts of a controlled substance are involved; offenders with lower amounts of a controlled substance are sentenced according to the sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The statute contains a sentencing departure provision that is limited to motions from the government based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to law enforcement agencies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">The state attorney may move the sentencing court to reduce or suspend the sentence of any person who is convicted of a violation of this section and who provides substantial assistance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the identification, arrest, or conviction of any of that person\u2019s accomplices, accessories, coconspirators, or principals or of any other person engaged in trafficking in controlled substances. The arresting agency shall be given an opportunity to be heard in aggravation or mitigation in reference to any such motion. Upon good cause shown, the motion may be filed and heard in camera. The judge hearing the motion may reduce or suspend the sentence if the judge finds that the defendant rendered such substantial assistance. [Fla Stat Ann 893.135(4).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Statutes in Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, and Nevada also track this language, i.e., mandatory m\u00ednimums may be reduced <em>only </em>on a motion from the government based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to law enforcement agencies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">These statutes are specific \u2014 Michigan\u2019s is not. The argument that departures should be limited to \"substantial assistance\u201d cases does not apply to the Michigan situation because the statute itself does not limit the <em>types </em>of reasons that may be substantial and compelling.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Another example is a Kansas statute that provides a presumptive sentencing grid that is drug-crime specific.

Section 7401(4) simply provides that if the sentencing court finds substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the minimum term, it may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The majority misses the point when it reviews other <em>statutory </em>schemes to reinforce its \"belief\u201d that the Michigan Legislature had a corresponding intent. If the Michigan Legislature had wanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>limit the sentencing court to enumerated factors, it could certainly have done so. The Michigan Legislature chose not to. Because the Legislature chose not to, I believe that the majority is improperly limiting the scope of judicial sentencing discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In the instant case, the defendant, who had no prior convictions, pleaded guilty of one count of possession with intent to deliver more than 50 but less than 225 grams of cocaine. Under the statute, the mandatory sentence was ten to twenty years. The sentencing judge found substantial and compelling reasons to depart from the mandatory sentence and imposed. a five- to twenty-year sentence. The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">All right. Well, the Court is satisfied, and the record should reflect that I have read the presentence report, the letters that came on your behalf, both the sentencing memos, and I am satisfied that the law applicable, at this time, is <em>People v Troncoso, </em>187 Mich App 567, decided in 1991. <em>Troncoso </em>indicates that absent a statutory definition or controlling judicial definition, we must comply with the legislative directive to construe statutory language according to the common and approved usage of the words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">I\u2019m satisfied that there are some factors here that would allow this Court to come to the conclusion that there are some \u2014 that there is substantial and compelling reason to deviate from the mandatory 10-year sentence. However, I would agree with the Prosecutor that this problem, regarding cocaine, is a terrible problem that is absolutely just \u2014 not only \u2014 I\u2019ll start over. It\u2019s a cancer and, you know, with the amount of drugs that were involved here, clearly incarceration would be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>I\u2019m satisfied that the basis for my deviating from the mandatory 10-year is that you\u2019re a young man of 24 years of age and you have no prior record. I\u2019m also satisfied \u2014 standing alone obviously wouldn\u2019t matter but you just were over the 50 gram mark, the 54 grams. This appears to be, based upon the record, your only involvement that can be established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">You had a good job for over five years with a good work record, and I\u2019m taking into consideration the extreme remorse that I see from you. You are devastated by this. You\u2019ve admitted your guilt, and you\u2019ve accepted your responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">You\u2019ve got family friends and co-workers, as evidenced by the letters, indicate you do \u2014 are a person capable of rehabilitation. I think you have a potential for rehabilitation, and I\u2019m satisfied that your motivation to help others, although totally in some respects outbalanced, at least it indicates that you\u2019re not a cold, callous drug dealer out to profit solely for your own benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">Taking all these into consideration, I\u2019m satisfied that there will be a deviation, but there has to be a significant penalty for someone who sells in excess of 50 grams of cocaine for approximately $2,300 at street value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">Therefore, taking all those factors into consideration, it will be sentence and judgment of this Court [that] you be confined to the jurisdiction of the Michigan Department of Corrections for a minimum term of five years and a maximum term of 20 years ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for resentencing because the sentencing court relied on factors that were improper under <em>Hill.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">I find that the sentencing court thoroughly examined both positive and negative circumstances of the case before it. I see no abuse of discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>its determination that substantial and compelling reasons for a sentencing departure existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In conclusion, the Legislature provided the threshold for controlled substance sentencing departures: substantial and compelling reasons. This is not unlimited discretion. The evidentiary record will have to demonstrate to a reviewing court that such reasons exist. I find that such a record exists in the case at bar. Therefore, I would reverse the Court of Appeals decision and reinstate the trial court\u2019s sentence, because the sentencing departure was based on substantial and compelling reasons.</p>\n<judges id=\"b294-6\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b294-7\">Weaver, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\"> MCL 333.7401; MSA 14.15(7401).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-11\"> There, the issue was whether the amendments of the controlled substance statute should be applied retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-12\"> Justice Levin and I concurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b275-9\"> Those statutes expressly limited the acceptable mitigating factors to consideration of the facts of the crime.

The Legislature\u2019s imposition of presumptively mandatory sentences for certain drug offenses reflects the Legislature\u2019s, and thus society\u2019s, determination that the length of the sentences contained in the statute are necessary to discipline the offender, to protect society and to deter others from committing drug offenses. The statutory amendment allowing deviation in exceptional circumstances reflects a desire to give judges some flexibility in making sentencing decisions based upon individual circumstances. . . .
