We find that the defendant\u2019s sentence does not violate the requirements of <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990), and that the sentencing judge did not violate the defendant\u2019s attorney-client privilege. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Upon discovering that the mother of his three female first cousins would be out of town at a funeral, the defendant persuaded the oldest cousin to allow him to spend the night with them in their home. The girls had been told by their mother not to let anyone in. When the defendant arrived late in the evening, the fourteen-year-old complainant was already asleep on the living room couch, her bed. Following several hours of conversation between the defendant and the complainant\u2019s two older sisters, aged eighteen and sixteen respectively, and the eighteen-year-old\u2019s departure to the hospital with a sick child, the defendant was left alone to sleep on the living room floor. Sometime thereafter, the defendant placed a pillow over his sleeping fourteen-year-old cousin\u2019s face, pulled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>down the girl\u2019s pants, and proceeded to penetrate her vaginally.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Part of this assault was witnessed by the complainant\u2019s sixteen-year-old sister, who entered the living room in response to the noise of something falling. Once there, she observed the defendant, naked from the waist down, on top of the victim, holding a pillow over her face.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When she asked the defendant what he was doing on top of her sister, he replied, 'T don\u2019t know,\u201d and \"I ain\u2019t doing nothing to her.\u201d The sister went back to her bedroom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Later, the victim, crying, came into the bedroom, told her sister that \"John Henry had raped her.\u201d They went into the bathroom to wash out the victim\u2019s underwear, which \"had white stuff \u201d in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The defendant never admitted his guilt, contending that the victim fabricated the offense for reasons known only to herself. Moreover, the defendant testified at trial that many of the incriminating statements he gave to the detective in charge of the case that bore his signature were incorrectly transcribed because both he and the detective were \"half asleep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The jury took one hour to convict the defendant of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Finding the guidelines range of six to ten years inadequate, the trial judge sentenced the defendant to twenty-five to fifty years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The Court of Appeals remanded the case to allow the defendant to challenge his sentence and trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness. The successor judge, Richard Cunningham, held an evidentiary hearing over five days on these issues that fills 221 pages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Defendant called several family members in support of the claim that the trial attorney should have placed them on the stand. The testimony may be fairly summarized as irrelevant to the issue of commission of the offense, as indicating that the incident had caused substantial difficulty in the family because defendant\u2019s supporters refused to accept defendant\u2019s guilt, and as having been presented at the defendant\u2019s request. At the conclusion of that lengthy hearing, Judge Cunningham rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that counsel had been ineffective, and \"acting independently of Judge Talbot\u2019s decision,\u201d again sentenced the defendant to twenty-five to fifty years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Judge Cunningham noted that the defendant had received eleven major misconduct tickets during his time in prison. He also concluded that a witness called by the defendant, a former fellow inmate, was lying when he testified that he, not defendant, had started all the fights leading to the misconduct tickets. The judge also noted the defendant\u2019s absolute lack of regard for the victim and lack of remorse for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The sentencing information report listed the following reasons for departure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">(1) In general, the guidelines for esc offenses fail to adequately address the seriousness of the crime. Guidelines are based upon actual sentences imposed during a time prior to the \"feminist movement\u2019s\u201d success in having society in general, and judges in particular, recognize the \"special\u201d nature of such crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">(2) The guidelines fail to take into account the family relationship between the actor and the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">(3) This is a resentencing. The guidelines fail to take into account the eleven prison misconducts by this defendant since the original sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>(4) Guidelines fail to take into account defendant\u2019s absolute lack of remorse and low potential for rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">(5) Guidelines are not sufficient to reflect the very high degree of exploitation in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed this judgment of sentence. The Court affirmed the decision that trial counsel had not been ineffective, rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the judge forced appellate counsel to violate the attorney-client privilege, and held that defendant\u2019s sentence was proportionate to the seriousness of the offense. Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued January 13, 1993 (Docket No. 117039) (after remand). This Court granted the defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 445 Mich 880 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">LEGALITY OF THE DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The defendant challenges the validity of his sentence under <em>People v Milbourn, supra, </em>in which this Court held that some sentences that fall within the legislatively prescribed range may nevertheless be illegally long or short. According to <em>Milbourn, </em>a trial court abuses its discretion when it imposes a sentence that is not \"proportional\u201d to the seriousness of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Under <em>Milbourn, </em>the maximum sentence for a given offense is proportionate where the circumstances surrounding the offense place it in the most serious class with respect to the particular crime. <em>Id. </em>at 654; see also <em>People v Merriweather, </em>447 Mich 799; 527 NW2d 460 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">The case at bar presents neither the maximum nor minimum sentence, and thus <em>Milbourn </em>directs courts to consult the second edition of the Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>gan Sentencing Guidelines as an aid to determining the proportionality of the sentence. Under <em>Milbourn, </em>the \"key test\u201d of proportionality is not whether the sentence departs from or adheres to the recommended range, but whether it reflects the seriousness of the matter. Thus, it is possible that a sentence within the guidelines range could be disproportionately high or low. 435 Mich 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In the absence of factors legitimately considered at sentencing and not adequately considered by the applicable guidelines, a departure from the recommended range indicates a possibility that a sentence may be disproportionate. <em>Id. </em>at 657, 661. However, <em>Milbourn </em>did not state or establish that any factors accounted for in the guidelines had been adequately considered or appropriately weighed. As we have recently noted, \"[n]either the grids nor <em>Milbourn </em>dictate that a departure from guidelines is to be arithmetically measured to determine the propriety of a given sentence.\u201d <em>Merriweather, supra, </em>447 Mich 808. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit expressed the same concept in <em>United States v Ocasio, </em>914 F2d 330, 336 (CA 1, 1990), in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">Although some other courts have, from time to time, suggested formulaic approaches to assessing the reasonableness of particular departures, . . . we are wary of such pat answers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">In <em>Milbourn, </em>the Court repeatedly observed that sentencing judges are not required to adhere to the guidelines. The majority explained that \"the guidelines may not be a perfect embodiment of the principle of proportionality,\u201d 435 Mich 661, that they \"do not have a legislative mandate,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 656, and that \"requiring] strict adherence to the guidelines would effectively prevent their evolution,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>In the instant case, the trial judge found that the recommended range was inadequate to reflect the seriousness of this offense. We agree with the finding and conclude that the sentence imposed satisfies the proportionality requirement of <em>Milbourn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In addition, assuming arguendo that the guidelines range is adequate to reflect the seriousness of the offense, we find that the sentence did not constitute an abuse of discretion because the offense involved circumstances not accounted for, or accounted for inadequately, in formulating the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">A. THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE CRIME</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Judge Cunningham explained that he imposed a sentence higher than the range set by the Sentencing Guidelines Advisory Committee because that range is too low:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">We have seen what I find to be ridiculously low guidelines in the offense of Criminal Sexual Conduct in the First Degree, just in general.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">The observation is well taken. For example, for a defendant who had no prior convictions and who raped a victim at knife point but did not actually cut or inflict permanent injury on his victim, the guidelines would recommend a one-year minimum sentence as appropriate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">For this defendant, who raped a fourteen year old by putting a pillow over her face, the guideline sentence \u2014 two to eight years \u2014 is so stunningly low that the trial judge could only think of one explanation]_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>I think that the guidelines for this offense reflect a time when young women were treated as property, when this wasn\u2019t considered a very serious offense at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">While the accuracy of this statement is debatable, that does not undermine the conclusion that the range is too low.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\"><em>Milbourn </em>specifically contemplated that judges could impose sentences higher than the guidelines\u2019 r\u00e1nge when that range is too low:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">[T]rial judges may continue to depart from the guidelines when, in their judgment, the recommended range under the guidelines is disproportionate, in either direction, to the seriousness of the crime. <em>[Id. </em>at 657.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">For the majority, Justice Brickley<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">[T]he key test is whether the sentence is proportionate to the seriousness of the matter, not whether it departs from or adheres to the guidelines\u2019 recommended range. <em>[Id. </em>at 661.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">While we agree with the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the recommended range is too low, the issue is not whether we agree with the trial court\u2019s selection of an appropriate sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Unless there is some basis for deciding what range would have been appropriate, we cannot reliably conclude that the sentence was disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">B. FACTORS NOT CONSIDERED BY THE GUIDELINES</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">Alternatively, Judge Cunningham pointed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>three aggravating factors that were not accounted for in the guidelines. First, he found that the guidelines fail to account for the family relationship between the defendant and the victim. The <em>Milbourn </em>majority considered any such prior relationship an archetype justification for departure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">In some cases, there may be important sentencing factors that are not included in the sentencing guidelines. Perhaps the clearest example of such a factor is the prior relationship, if any, between the victim and the offender. <em>[Id. </em>at 660.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The trial judge found the relationship to be an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Second, the judge considered the fact that the defendant received eleven misconduct tickets in prison before being resentenced. Misbehavior after arrest is clearly a legitimate factor to consider at sentencing. <em>Texas v McCullough, </em>475 US 134; 106 S Ct 976; 89 L Ed 2d 104 (1986); <em>People v Mazzie, </em>429 Mich 29, 35; 413 NW2d 1 (1987) (opinion of Brickley, J.); <em>id. </em>at 43-47 (Boyle, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The guidelines do not account for misconduct in custody. However, just as an exemplary custodial record might be found to be a mitigating circumstance, misconduct in custody may be an aggravating circumstance indicating a disposition to violence or impulsiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Third, the judge found that the guidelines failed to account for the \"defendant\u2019s absolute lack of remorse and low potential for rehabilitation.\u201d Both factors are legitimate considerations in determining a sentence. See <em>People v Wesley, </em>428 Mich 708; 411 NW2d 159 (1987) (lack of remorse); <em>People v Snow, </em>386 Mich 586, 592; 194 NW2d 314 (1972) (potential for rehabilitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">In addition, although not referenced in the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>tencing information report, the judge specifically found on the record that the inmate produced at defendant\u2019s request had lied. In imposing sentence, a trial court may consider a defendant\u2019s own perjury where there is a rational basis in the record for concluding that the defendant wilfully made a flagrantly false statement on a material issue. <em>People v Adams, </em>430 Mich 679; 425 NW2d 437 (1988). Within constitutional limits, the federal sentence guidelines provide for upward sentence enhancement where a defendant wilfully suborns untruthful testimony during \u201ca sentencing proceeding.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1; Hutchinson &amp; Yellen, Federal Sentencing Law &amp; Practice (2d ed), pp 485-487.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Finally, by the time the Ginther<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> hearing was concluded, the defendant was making allegations that his appellate attorney, who served him commendably in difficult circumstances, was also ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">C. FACTORS CONSIDERED WITHIN THE GUIDELINES</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The sentencing judge also pointed to a factor that he felt was considered inadequately: the high degree of exploitation of the victim. The record presents a pattern of exploiting family relationships that began with defendant going to the home on the night in question and continued throughout the evidentiary hearing. Producing family members to testify who had no information relevant to the charge could have been reasonably viewed by the sentencing court as continued exploitation of the victim by dividing the family over the incident. As the trial court expressly observed in response to defense counsel\u2019s claim regarding the effect on the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>That would be absolutely no value to me coming from these people. I\u2019ll tell you why. Because it\u2019s very clear to me that the concern here is with Mr. Houston, it is no way at all to that young woman. So, A, I would find I would have a concern about the believability of it. But B, I can find where that young woman\u2019s going to have to suppress around her family anything that she feels, she can\u2019t let out anything she feels about this incident because of the lack of support she\u2019s been given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The dissent\u2019s assertion that the guidelines range \"already reflected a family relationship between the defendant and the victim,\u201d <em>post </em>at 345, overlooks the fact (apparent in the trial court testimony and the testimony at the evidentiary hearing) that the familial relationship alluded to was not simply the relationship between the victim and the defendant. Moreover, the trial judge\u2019s view agreed with the Legislature\u2019s view of the seriousness of the offense. The Legislature recognized that a familial relationship between the victim and the offender is an aggravating factor and established that, by virtue of the family relationship, the crime in question is \"punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years.\u201d MCL 750.520b(2); MSA 28.788(2)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">D. ANALYSIS OF THE SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In summary, the record reflects that the trial court considered defendant\u2019s exploitation of the victim, postcustody misconduct, absolute lack of remorse, production of perjured testimony, and exploitation of the family relationship as reasons for the sentence imposed. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assumption, the guidelines furnish no reliable basis for the Court to conclude that defendants presenting similar patterns would have been sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>tenced within the guidelines range of two to eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">It is likely, although not provable, that a defendant found guilty by a jury of esc i who failed to express remorse while not expressly denying guilt, engaged in substantial subsequent misconduct, exploited the family relationship, and produced testimony found to be perjurio\u00fas would be sentenced in the range of the highest twelve and one-half percent of sentences the guidelines, do not reflect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">It is likely, although again not provable, that the guidelines range of two to eight years represents to some significant degree cases disposed of with explicit or implicit sentence concessions. Federal guidelines data, for example, indicate that guilty pleas, on average, result in considerably lower sentences, thirty to forty percent lower than what would have been imposed had the defendant been convicted at trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If one assumes that some portion of the pool of sentences falling into the range of two to eight years was imposed as a result of waiver trials, it is again likely that this defendant was not in fact similar to others within that grid. Taking these considerations together in light of our experience that the vast majority of defendants express remorse after conviction, it is highly likely that the guidelines\u2019 ranges reflect sentences of those who have received systemic sentence concessions and demonstrated potential for rehabilitation by expressing remorse. In short, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>given that the guidelines treat the same real offenses differently depending on the method of disposition, we have no ground in the guidelines for concluding how other judges would have addressed this defendant\u2019s situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">By allowing departures when the guidelines consideration of a particular factor is \"not adequate,\u201d <em>Milbourn </em>allows sentencing judges to reweigh the guideline variables. It is through this process that the trial judges can remove the distortions induced by a classification system that is, by necessity, overly simplistic. The data that form the basis for the range within each cell have been filtered<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> through the point system formulated by the Sentencing Guidelines Advisory Committee. While compilation of empirical data and considerations about ease of use required a relatively simple methodology, application of that methodology to concrete cases can be very questionable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>_ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>We can assume that there are other cases of intrafamilial sexual assaults that produce such intrafamily conflicts, that there are sentences based on subsequent custodial misconduct, that there are cases where the defendant\u2019s sentence reflects a trial court\u2019s finding of lack of regard , for the victim, and lack of remorse, including the production of perjured testimony. It is entirely possible that defendants like Mr. Houston, who have been found guilty by a jury of taking advantage of younger relatives, receive much higher sentences than the great number of other defendants regardless of which cell they fall into. If this were the case, those sentences would not be reflected in the guideline ranges on the assumption that they make up only a small percentage of esc i convictions. However, we have no way of knowing to what extent, if at all, and where outside the guidelines range trial courts might sentence such defendants. Thus, the sentencing guidelines range is simply inapplicable to Mr. Houston.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">THE POSITION OF THE DISSENTING OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">We reject the dissent\u2019s conclusion that the trial court\u2019s considerations were already factored into and accounted for by the Criminal Sexual Conduct Guidelines. Cf. <em>post </em>at 344. To suggest that the trial judge must establish to what extent the guidelines variables do not fully account for sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>fencing factors is to impose on the trial court an obligation to prove that something is not what it does not purport to be. Trial courts would be required to demonstrate not only that the situation is dissimilar to others, but how dissimilar it is. Such an impossible burden would effectively prevent the evolution of guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">There is no basis for the dissent\u2019s assumption that the guidelines \"adequately\u201d account for the factors and weights assigned. The guidelines assign a numerical weight to certain variables on the assumption that these weights approximate what trial judges were doing in the cases within the statistical base. The committee properly and specifically disclaimed any suggestion that it had properly weighed the variables identified.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, we are unable to conclude that the variables identify and assign the proper weight to any given factor that any judge, many judges, or most judges would assign.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">From our analysis it is clear that the guidelines do not reflect certain variables that a sentencing judge may properly consider. Further, as the guidelines presently exist, no one knows for certain which variables were considered, or what weight was accorded them. Thus, it cannot be said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>that this offense and this offender are, in fact comparable to the situation within the applicable grid cell of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The defendant contends that resentencing is required because the court violated his \"attorney-client privilege when it ordered defense counsel to reveal that Mr. Houston had insisted on calling witnesses to his <em>Ginther </em>hearing.\u201d We reject this claim because the defendant waived his privilege.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">At issue are inquiries directed to appellate defense counsel about whether he had consulted with his client and why so many witnesses had testified at the hearing. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention that the reason for the inquiry was to determine whether defendant himself had caused such a lengthy hearing, it is clear that the question was directed to the adequacy of counsel\u2019s representation and the implicit suggestion that counsel\u2019s deficiencies had deprived defendant of a meaningful hearing. These inquiries immediately followed allegations by the defendant that counsel \"did not come and talk to me and see me,\u201d and had not consulted him about critical decisions. The judge questioned defense counsel about the truth of these allegations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>As Wigmore explains, a client\u2019s allegation that an attorney breached his duty to the client waives the attorney-client privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">There is always also the objective consideration that when his conduct touches a certain point of disclosure, fairness requires that his privilege shall cease whether he intended that result or not. He cannot be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, to withhold the remainder. He may elect to withhold or to disclose, but after a certain point his election must remain final. As a fair canon of decision, the following distinctions may be suggested:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APQ\">(6) When the client alleges a breach of duty to him by the attorney, the privilege is waived as to all communications relevant to that issue. [8 Wig-more, Evidence (McNaughton rev), \u00a7 2327, pp 636-638.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">The fact that the defendant\u2019s allegation was not brought in a formal complaint against his attorney is of no consequence. In <em>Leverich v Leverich, </em>340 Mich 133, 137; 64 NW2d 567 (1954), a divorce case in which the attorney was not a party, this Court noted that \"[ajfter the wife claimed to the court that she had received from her attorney improper advice as a result of which she agreed to the property settlement, and she had testified in relation to such claim, it was proper and competent for the attorney to testify as to the advice he gave her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">The defendant\u2019s claim on the record that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>attorney had not spoken with him made it necessary for the court to address the issue. While a court must carefully evaluate the statements made by a defendant and protect the privilege where appropriate, it is not required to stand idle in the face of claims that counsel made decisions \"without talking to me.\u201d The truth was the defendant himself was making the principal decisions involved in the conduct of the <em>Ginther </em>hearing. The trial court was not required to let stand statements on the record, unexamined and unrebutted, that would have resulted in another remand to the trial court for a hearing, this time about the effectiveness of appellate counsel. Consequently, the defendant waived any claim to privilege by making this allegation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-1\">333</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b515-5\">Riley, Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> The prosecution urges us to address the question whether sentence guidelines violate the separation of powers, Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 45, and exceed the scope of judicial power, MCL 769.1(1); MSA 28.1072(1).

Under our constitution, authority to establish sentences rests with the Legislature. Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 45.

The committee\u2019s goal was to reflect the current practice of \"the majority\u201d of judges during a given period.

I concur with the general rule posited by Justice Cavanagh, as I understand that rule to be: A sentence that departs from the recommended guidelines is not necessarily disproportionate if the judge\u2019s reasons for departure consist of factors not already encompassed by the guidelines. The rule posited by Justice Cavanagh not only recognizes that the guidelines fail to account for the multitude of variables surrounding a particular offense and offender, but also provides a workable method by which trial courts and appellate courts can uphold proportionality in sentencing._</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>While I agree with the rule postulated by Justice Cavanagh, I do not concur in part m of his opinion, because most of the reasons for departure articulated by the trial judge do not consist of factors already encompassed by the guidelines. Thus, it is the extent of departure from the guidelines, as opposed to the mere departure, that constitutes an abuse of sentencing discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The sentencing judge specifically identified the reasons upon which he based his decision to depart from the sentence guidelines for first-degree criminal sexual conduct. Unlike the majority, I confine my review to those reasons that are specifically identified on the sentencing record and in the departure evaluation form. To speculate, as the majority does, that reasons other than those identified by the sentencing judge, motivated his decision to depart from the guidelines, defeats the purposes of requiring judges to specifically articulate their reasons for departure. See <em>People v </em>Fleming, 428 Mich 408; 410 NW2d 266 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Properly focusing on the reasons that the sentencing judge identified as the basis for his departure from the guidelines, I agree with Justice Cavanagh that the \"psychological effect [of this crime] on the victim\u201d and \"exploitation of the victim\u201d are factors already encompassed by the criminal sexual conduct sentencing guidelines and were insufficient reasons for departure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>agree that the sentencing judge\u2019s general dissatisfaction with the guidelines is not in itself a legitimate reason for departing from the guidelines. If those three reasons had been the only basis for the judge\u2019s departure from the sentencing guidelines, then there would be no need for me to write separately. However, the sentencing judge identified other reasons that I believe are not encompassed by the guidelines and which merit further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The sentencing judge identified the defendant\u2019s eleven prison misconducts as a reason for departure. Because prison misconduct is a relevant sentencing consideration, not encompassed by the guidelines, the judge did not abuse his discretion by considering it.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Similarly, the family relationship between the defendant and the victim was a relevant sentencing consideration not encompassed by the criminal sexual conduct guidelines. <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630, 660-661; 461 NW2d 1 (1990). At least in the context of a first-degree criminal sexual conduct offense, it is not sufficient to say that because a factor, such as family relationship, was an element of the offense, it necessarily is encompassed by the guidelines. In contrast to other offenses, a conviction for first-degree criminal sexual conduct may be premised on eight distinct theories, all of which are punishable by imprisonment for life or any term of years, many of which would not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>a family relationship. See MCL' 750.520b(l)(a)-(h); MSA 28.788(2)(l)(a)-(h). Because the relevant sentencing guidelines do not distinguish between first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a family member and other types of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, they oifer no guidance in resolving the question what sentence, within the statutorily prescribed range, is suitable to this offender who in perpetrating this offense sexually forced himself upon a young family member. In fact, the family relationship between the victim and the defendant would seem especially pertinent here, where that relationship facilitated the perpetration of the crime. Accordingly, consideration of the relationship between the defendant and the victim was not an abuse of sentencing discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The sentencing judge also identified the defendant\u2019s \"low rehabilitative potential\u201d as a reason for departure from the guidelines. While the record is less than clear about why this defendant is regarded as having low potential for rehabilitation, an individual\u2019s potential for rehabilitation generally is a legitimate sentencing consideration, not already encompassed by the guidelines. <em>People v Snow, </em>386 Mich 586, 592; 194 NW2d 314 (1972). Therefore, it was not an abuse of sentencing discretion to consider that factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The defendant\u2019s apparent lack of remorse is also not a factor considered by the guidelines. However, under the facts of this case, I cannot conclude that remorse was a proper consideration. Following the defendant\u2019s allocution in which he repeatedly asserted his innocence, the sentencing judge explained its finding of remorselessness as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">First of all, I\u2019m extremely concerned by your lack of remorse. Now, certainly you are protesting your innocence, and you have every right to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>test your innocence and I will not hold that against you in any way. But I do see among \u2014 I see in you, sir, an absolute failure to accept responsibility for your behavior and absolute disregard for the concern about other people. I see now a desire only for yourself, an absolute disregard for that young woman that was hurt. I was very concerned about that, no remorse whatsoever in what you did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">While the sentencing judge paid lip service to the defendant\u2019s right to assert innocence, it is obvious that the judge\u2019s finding of remorselessness was based merely on the defendant\u2019s assertion of innocence. Therefore I cannot conclude that remorselessness was a proper sentencing consideration in this case. In <em>People v </em>Yennior, 399 Mich 892 (1977), this Court held: \"A court cannot base its sentence even in part on a defendant\u2019s refusal to admit guilt.\u201d A majority of this Court reaffirmed <em>Yennior </em>and explained that reliance on a defendant\u2019s assertion of innocence is not a proper sentencing consideration if it appears that \"had the defendant affirmatively admitted guilt, his sentence would not have been so severe.\u201d <em>People v </em>Wesley, 428 Mich 708, 713, 725; 411 NW2d 159 (1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">On the basis of the record in this case, it appears that had the defendant admitted guilt, his sentence would not have been as severe because the perceived lack of remorse, on which this sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>tence was partly based, would have been lacking. Therefore, in accord with the majority view expressed in <em>Wesley, </em>I would conclude that the sentencing judge was improperly influenced by the defendant\u2019s persistent assertion of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In this case, any attempt to distinguish the defendant\u2019s continued assertion of innocence from his lack of remorse would be an illusory effort designed to justify a sentence that would have been less severe if the defendant had affirmatively admitted his guilt. Nothing in <em>Yennior </em>or <em>Wesley, supra, </em>compels such sophistry.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">While the sentencing judge based his discretionary departure from the guidelines on some reasons not already encompassed by the guidelines, his other reasons consisted of factors already encompassed by the guidelines and were of sufficient importance and significance to lead me to conclude that the extent of departure from the guidelines in this case resulted in a disproportionate sentence. Accordingly, I would find the sentence to be invalid, and would remand for resentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-7\">Levin, J., concurred with Brickley, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> \"Psychological injury to the victim\u201d is encompassed by offense variable 13 and \"offender exploitation of victim\u201d is encompassed by offense variable 7.

The defendant was convicted by a jury of first-degree criminal sexual conduct<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was sentenced to a term of twenty-five to fifty years. The Court of Appeals affirmed after a remand at which the same sentence was imposed. The defendant argues that the trial court abused its sentencing discretion by imposing a disproportionate sentence. I would hold that the trial court abused its sentencing discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>imposing a disproportionate sentence, because the extent of the departure from the sentencing guidelines\u2019 recommended minimum sentence was not supported by the reasons given by the trial court. Therefore, I would vacate the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">A jury found that the defendant had engaged in forcible sexual intercourse with his fourteen-year-old cousin, while spending the night of March 5, 1987, at her home. At the July 1987 trial, the victim testified that she had been asleep on the couch when the defendant placed a pillow over her face and penetrated her vaginally. The defendant denied any sexual misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The trial judge departed from the guidelines\u2019 recommended minimum range of six to ten years, and sentenced the defendant to a term of twenty-five to fifty years imprisonment. The court later denied a delayed motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial court for two purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, the trial court was to conduct a <em>Gin</em>ther<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> hearing to consider the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Second, if the trial court determined that the trial counsel had not been ineffective, the trial court was directed to re-sentence the defendant. The panel instructed the trial court to articulate on the record its reasons for departing from the guidelines, as required by <em>People v Fleming, </em>428 Mich 408; 410 NW2d 266 (1987). Further, the panel directed the trial court to comply with the <em>Milbourn </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> principle of propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tionality that had been explained by this Court in the interim between the sentencing and the remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In May 1992, on remand, the original trial judge\u2019s successor conducted a lengthy <em>Ginther </em>hearing, which consumed four court sessions over a six-week period. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and immediately resentenced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The judge first scored the offense variables under the sentencing guidelines. He scored offense variable 7, Offender Exploitation of Victim Vulnerability, the maximum fifteen points.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In doing so, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">It would be hard for me to imagine a more exploitive situation. We have testimony. . . indicating that the victim, 14 years old, is at her home. Her parents are gone. They\u2019re out of town to attend the brother\u2019s funeral and the young woman\u2019s granddaddy\u2019s funeral. And while they\u2019re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>gone, this defendant, Mr. John Henry Houston, exploits the family relationship to get in the door, to even get in the home. The young woman was told by her parents not to let anybody in while they were gone. . . . And he gets in only because the way he exploits and used the family relationship. He exploits and uses that relationship to get close to that young girl, to get her to trust him. He uses and exploits that relationship to be in a situation where he can ultimately grab the pillow, put it over her face while he rapes her there on the floor in her own home. He uses the great difference in their size and age to carry that out. He exploits the fact that he\u2019s so much bigger and she\u2019s got nowhere to cry for help. I can\u2019t think of a more exploitive situation than this man who weasels his way and exploits his way into the home of that young girl, waits until they can get alone and then takes her physically against her will right there in the home of her own \u2014 in [sic] the. floor of her own home. I\u2019m giving 15 points only because I can\u2019t give any more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The judge then determined that the guidelines recommended a minimum sentence of between twenty-four and ninety-six months.. However, he again imposed the sentence of twenty-five to fifty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">After remand, the Court of Appeals affirmed the sentence, finding that it was proportionate under <em>Milbourn.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">In <em>Milbourn, </em>this Court found \"shocks the conscience\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to have been an unsatisfactory formulation of the standard for reviewing sentences. Rather, we explained that a sentencing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>abuses its discretion if it imposes a sentence that is not \"proportionate to the seriousness of the circumstances surrounding the offense and the offender.\u201d <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630, 636; 461 NW2d 1 (1990). We drew this conclusion by examining the work of the Legislature, which sets the parameters of judicial sentencing discretion. It cannot be doubted that the Legislature intends judges to apply a principle of proportionality, when it is evident that such a principle has informed and guided the Legislature\u2019s own decisions in the area of sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 650-651.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">In <em>Milbourn, </em>we further explained that the second edition of the Sentencing Guidelines reflects an attempt to parallel this principle of proportionality scheme. Recognizing the limitations of the guidelines, however, we noted that a departure from the guidelines would be appropriate in a situation in which the guidelines did not adequately reflect legitimately considered circumstances of the p\u00e1rticular offender and the seriousness of the particular offense. <em>Id. </em>at 657. We cautioned that a sentencing court\u2019s failure to give adequate reasons for such departures, and for the extent of such departures, should signal the appellate court that the sentence may be disproportionate. <em>Id. </em>at 659-660. By approving departures based on ambiguous reasons, the appellate court risks the danger of allowing the sentencing judge to improperly consider factors twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The instant case presents an opportunity to refine further our <em>Milbourn </em>discussion on departures from the sentencing guidelines. I would hold that <em>a </em>sentencing court that departs from the guidelines must clearly articulate its reasons for doing so, and must explain why those reasons warrant the <em>extent </em>of the departure. Most importantly, if the court is relying on reasons that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>already accounted for in the sentencing guidelines or are already an element of the particular offense, I would hold that the court must explain how those reasons have not been fully accounted for in the sentence that the guidelines recommend. In <em>Milbourn, </em>we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">there will be occasions when the conduct or the criminal record to be scored under the sentencing guidelines is extraordinary in its degree, and thus beyond the anticipated range of behavior treated in the guidelines. <em>[Id. </em>at 660, n 27.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">However, I believe the sentencing court should not cover the same ground twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">We now turn to the guidelines departure in this case. On the sentencing information. report (sir) departure evaluation form, the trial court listed five reasons for departure outside the recommended range:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">(1) In general, the guidelines for esc offenses fail to adequately address the seriousness of the crime. Guidelines are based upon actual sentences imposed during a time prior to the \"feminist movement\u2019s\u201d success in having society in general, and judges in particular, recognize the \"special\u201d nature of such violent crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">(2) The guidelines fail to take into account the family relationship between the actor and the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">(3) This is a resentencing. The guidelines fail to take into account the eleven prison misconducts by this defendant since the original sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">(4) Guidelines fail to take into account defendant\u2019s absolute lack of remorse and low potential for rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>(5) Guidelines are not sufficient to reflect the very high degree of exploitation in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">At the resentencing, the judge further commented on his departure reasons. In doing so, he revealed a disdain for the guidelines in general.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">Let me begin by saying that I find these guidelines to be totally inaccurate \u2014 inadequate in regard to the situation. Guidelines are historical and guidelines are based upon what sentences have been given in the past, and I think that the guidelines for this offense reflect a time when young women were treated as property, when this wasn\u2019t considered a very serious offense at all. We have seen what I find to be ridiculously low guidelines in the offense of Criminal Sexual Conduct in the First Degree, just in general.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The defendant contends that the judge impermissibly discarded the guidelines merely because he disagreed with them in general. The defendant cites <em>Milbourn, </em>and <em>People v Schnepp, </em>185 Mich App 767; 463 NW2d 183 (1990), for the proposition that a trial judge may not simply disregard the guidelines. I agree. In <em>Milbourn </em>at 656, we stated that the second edition of the sentencing guidelines was the best \"barometer\u201d for sentencing a given case. Further, the second edition better reflects <em>current </em>sentencing practices, and, therefore, it should be used as the starting point for sentencing. The sentencing court should not summarily disregard the guidelines altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Regarding the sentencing judge\u2019s contention that the guidelines reflect archaic attitudes toward sexual assault, the defendant reminds us that the second edition of the sentencing guidelines went into effect in 1988, long after the criminal sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>conduct act<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> took effect. I am unable to join the judge in supposing that the 1988 second edition of the guidelines reflects a failure of the state\u2019s judiciary, as late as the mid-1980s, to recognize the seriousness of criminal sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The trial court also based departure from the guidelines on the defendant\u2019s blood relationship with the victim. The prosecutor and the defendant both state that the blood relationship was the element of the charge that elevated the crime to first-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant further argues that had the defendant <em>not </em>been related to the victim, the maximum that he could have been convicted of was third-degree criminal sexual conduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant contends that the guidelines range would then have been twelve to twenty-four months. He argues that, in <em>this case, </em>the blood relationship, in and of itself, raised the applicable guidelines range to twenty-four to ninety-six months. I would agree. I believe that the recommended range of minimum sentences for <em>this defendant, </em>in <em>this case, </em>already reflected a family relationship between the defendant and the victim. I do not believe that the trial judge explained how this elevated range did not sufficiently account for the blood relationship factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">During resentencing, the judge also commented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>on the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse, on the potential long-term psychological effect on the victim, and on his own desire to send a message to the community. I would find that the judge has not sufficiently explained how these considerations are not already reflected by the sentencing guidelines as applied to criminal sexual conduct convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">For instance, the court scored zero points for offense variable 13 (psychological injury to the victim), citing an insufficient record caused by the victim\u2019s failure to come forward. However, after scoring the guidelines, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">I am concerned that the guidelines do not take into account long-term effects of this type of sexual assault. Certainly we have one little category that says five points if there\u2019s a psychological injury to the victim, but do we have something that\u2019s going to take into account the entire life of that 14-year-old who was raped there in her own home under these extraordinarily cruel circumstances?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The judge further rejected the attorney\u2019s attempt to add that the victim had recovered. The trial court opined that the victim was suppressing her feelings because her relatives had been unsupportive. He further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">I\u2019ll take that into account, that she is leading an apparently on-the-surface normal life, but I cannot accept the fact that there is not a potential for serious psychological damage to occur, and if it hasn\u2019t exhibited any manifest signs at this point, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t occur in the future, and the possibility is one of the things that does concern me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Every forcible sexual assault inflicts lasting psychological harm. That is one of the many reasons that the Legislature provides a maximum of life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>imprisonment for first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and it is reflected in the sentences imposed by Michigan judges for this offense. The guidelines being a reflection of those sentencing practices, the recommended ranges reflect a recognition of the life-altering nature of this offense. In this case, the judge said that the victim \"is leading an apparently on-the-surface normal life,\u201d but has \"a potential for serious psychological damage.\u201d What is missing from the record is the judge\u2019s explanation of how this situation exceeds in seriousness the plight faced by every young victim of a forcible sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">And finally, the court based its departure from the guidelines on the very high degree of exploitation that it found in this case. I would note that the judge had already scored fifteen points for offense variable 7, based on exploitation of the victim by the defendant. My review of the record does not reveal an obvious explanation of why the exploitation by the defendant was \"extraordinary in its degree, and thus beyond the anticipated range of behavior treated in the guidelines.\u201d <em>Milbourn </em>at 660, n 27. Here, the victim was asleep before the sexual assault. I would find that the trial court has not sufficiently explained how the exploitation exceeds that found in cases of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in which the fam-. ily relationship is an element of the offense. Neither has the court explained its apparent conclusion that the exploitation has not been fully accounted for by scoring the maximum number of points for offense variable 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Because the trial judge failed to adequately explain how some of the reasons that he relied on were not sufficiently accounted for, I believe that the primary remaining reason for sentence departure was the defendant\u2019s prison misconducts. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>factor alone would not justify the extent of the departure of this case. Because some of the trial judge\u2019s reasons <em>may </em>amount to legitimate departure reasons with a more sufficient explanation of why those reasons are more extreme than the statutory offense and the guidelines reflect, I would remand for further articulation of the reasons. For these reasons, I would vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">At the time of sentencing, this defendant was thirty-one years of age. The presentence investigation report contained this rather unremarkable evaluation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">John Henry Houston is a 26 year old native of Birmingham, Alabama. The Houston family migrated to Detroit, MI in 1966. The defendant has some positive factors in his background including a stable upbringing and the continued support of his family. He has no youth bureau contacts or juvenile record. The instant case represents Mr. Houston\u2019s only felony conviction on his adult record. The defendant is in good health and denies a substance abuse history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">There are also a number of negative features in this case. The defendant\u2019s natural parents were never legally married. The defendant\u2019s mother married Cornelius Jones in 1957 and that marriage ended in separation in 1986. The defendant fathered two children (approximately 6 years and 9 years) from different women: the defendant\u2019s mother has had legal custody of the defendant\u2019s older daughter since 1986. The defendant stated he was employed at the Mini-Mart Food Center in Detroit, Mi from 1983 to March 1987, however, per a phone conversation with the owner\u2019s son of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>mini-mart food store, the defendant last worked there in 1985. Furthermore, the defendant stated from January, 1987 to March, 1987 he held gainful employment at the Orion\u2019s Enterprise located in Livonia, MI before quitting. The directory assistance has no listing for this company, therefore, employment could not be verified. A check with the Detroit Police Department Identification Bureau reveals that the defendant was convicted of Possession of Marijuana on March 2, 1979 before the Honorable William C. Hayes and was fined $25 or four days jail on case # T337742.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">The complainant on the instant offense or her family failed to return the victim\u2019s impact statement, therefore, restitution is not recommended at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The top end of the recommended guidelines range was eight years in prison. However the sentencing trial judge felt that this was far from adequate for this first-time offender. He was of the belief that for this hardly unusual intrafamily esc offense, it was necessary to more than triple the top of the guideline range. This belief will cost the taxpayers of this state some $750,000 in prison costs before this defendant turns fifty-six years of age and serves his minimum sentence. A sentencing judge certainly has the right and obligation to protect society from violent offenders. Surely, however, the circumstances of the offense and the characteristics of the offender must be carefully balanced to protect society, to not squander the state\u2019s scarce resources and to see, for a definite, reasonable period of time, that the defendant, in a structured setting, works toward rehabilitation. His probation officer stated: \"It is our feelings that his rehabilitation could best be effective in a structured setting where he would derive the maximum help.\u201d In my view, giving time like candy is irresponsible, symptomatic of a simplistic mentality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>and an utter waste of the state\u2019s precious resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The defendant also argues that the trial court violated his attorney-client privilege at the re-sentencing hearing by improperly asking his attorney whether it was the defendant who had insisted on calling so many witnesses to testify at the hearing. His attorney\u2019s answer revealed that it had indeed been the defendant who had wanted the witnesses called. The Court of Appeals found no merit to this issue. My review of the record leads me to conclude that the judge asked an irrelevant question and that he treaded dangerously close to violating the defendant\u2019s attorney-client privilege. I believe that the judge was expressing his frustration with the length of the hearing. However, I do not believe that the judge used the information that he obtained to punish the defendant. Because I would remand for resentencing, I would not decide whether the defendant was prejudicially harmed by a violation of his attorney-client privilege. I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that the defendant waived his privilege.</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-6\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-9\"> MCL 750.520b(1)(b)(ii); MSA 28.788(2)(1)(b)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"> Unpublished opinion per curiam, issued February 19, 1992 (Docket No. 117039).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\"> <em>People v Ginther, </em>390 Mich 436; 212 NW2d 922 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\"> <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630; 461 NW2d 1 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\"> The sentencing guidelines provide for scoring ov 7, Offender Exploitation of Victim Vulnerability, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">15 Offender exploits the victim due to a physical disability, mental disability, youth, agedness, or an abuse of authority status</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">5 Offender exploits the victim through a difference in size/ strength, or because the victim was intoxicated, under the influence of drugs, asleep, or unconscious</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">0 No exploitation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">Instructions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">A.

These over sixty cases are most likely to reflect the range of punishment imposed in circumstances resembling the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">From this review, it appears that few defendants have received sentences as long as Houston\u2019s sentence of twenty-five to fifty years, and then only when one or more of the following factors were present: a physical assault, in addition to the sexual assault, causing physical injury to the victim;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a victim under the age of puberty, often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>under the age of ten or even under the age of five;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> an elderly victim;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a record of prior criminal activity, including, in some cases, prior esc convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>tions;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a long-term pattern of sexual abuse with, the victim;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and a close \"familial\u201d relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>between the defendant and the victim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In the instant case, while Houston was related to the victim by blood, he did not generally reside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>in the household.
