We hold that collateral estoppel bars relitigation of this claim. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Plaintiff David Nummer is a white male who was hired as an auditor by the Treasury Department in 1970 and transferred to the intelligence unit of the Tax Fraud Division in 1978. Plaintiff remained in the Tax Fraud Division until 1987, when all Tax Fraud Division auditors were transferred to the newly formed Discovery Division within the Department of Treasury. Plaintiff objected to the transfer and filed a grievance with the Department of Civil Service. His grievance alleged two theories of recovery: first, that the Department of Treasury breached a contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>promise that he would remain within the Tax Fraud Division and, second, that the transfer constituted discrimination on the basis of race and gender in violation of the civil service provisions set forth in art 11, \u00a7 5, of the Michigan Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">On June 17, 1988, the civil service hearing officer denied recovery on both theories. Plaintiff appealed the decision to the Employment Relations Board, which denied leave.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Civil Service Commission subsequently reviewed and approved the Employment Relations Board\u2019s decision. Plaintiff then appealed the final determination of the commission to the circuit court, which affirmed the commission\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">While plaintiff\u2019s appeal was pending in circuit court, and before that court issued its opinion affirming the decision of the commission, plaintiff filed a new action in circuit court. The second case, also based on plaintiff\u2019s transfer to the Discovery Division, alleged breach of contract and race and sex discrimination in violation of the Civil Rights Act. MCL 37.2101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 3.548(101) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Defendant responded to the second action by alleging that the commission\u2019s determination that the transfer did not breach any contractual obligation and that the transfer was not for discriminatory reasons collaterally estopped redetermination of these issues in the circuit court. The circuit court agreed that plaintiff was collaterally es-topped from bringing either the contract issue or the discrimination issue and dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Plaintiff appealed the dismissal in the Court of Appeals. The Court held that the contract issue was collaterally estopped,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but that collateral estoppel did not apply to the civil rights claim. The Court of Appeals refused to apply collateral estoppel to the discrimination issue because it believed that the Legislature, in the civil rights arena, \"chose to set aside the principles of collateral estoppel in civil rights cases and to countenance a multiplicity of litigation.\u201d 200 Mich App 695, 700; 504 NW2d 724 (1993). Defendant appealed, and we granted leave.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The preclusion doctrines serve an important function in resolving disputes by imposing a state of finality to litigation where the same parties have previously had a full and fair opportunity to adjudicate their claims. <em>Storey v Meijer, Inc, </em>431 Mich 368, 372; 429 NW2d 169 (1988). By putting an end to litigation, the preclusion doctrines eliminate costly repetition, conserve judicial resources, and ease fears of prolonged litigation. Whether the determination is made by an agency or court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>inapposite; the interest in avoiding costly and repetitive litigation, as well as preserving judicial resources, still remains. <em>Univ of Tennessee v Elliott, </em>478 US 788, 798; 106 S Ct 3220; 92 L Ed 2d 635 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">At issue in this case is the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Generally, \"[f]or collateral estoppel to apply, a question of fact essential to the judgment must have been actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment. In addition, the same parties must have had a full opportunity to litigate the issue, and there must be mutuality of estoppel.\u201d <em>Storey, supra </em>at 373, n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">However, because defendant is seeking to preclude relitigation on the basis of an administrative decision, three additional requirements must be satisfied. The administrative determination must have been adjudicatory in nature and provide a right to appeal, and the Legislature must have intended to make the decision final absent an appeal. <em>Senior Accountants, Analysts &amp; Appraisers Ass\u2019n v Detroit, </em>399 Mich 449, 457-458; 249 NW2d 121 (1976); <em>Roman Cleanser Co v Murphy, </em>386 Mich 698, 703-704; 194 NW2d 704 (1972). See also <em>Storey, supra </em>at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">It is not seriously contested that the general requirements of collateral estoppel are met and that at least the first two requirements for administrative estoppel are satisfied. In the Civil Service Commission, plaintiff alleged that the Department of Treasury violated Civil Service Commission Rule 1-2.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This claim between the same parties involved a similar factual issue as that which was actually litigated and decided in the Civil Service Commission. Moreover, plaintiff was represented by counsel before the agency; had the opportunity to, and did in fact, call witnesses; and had a full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>hearing on the merits of his claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, he appealed this decision to the Employment Relations Board and then to the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">This proceeding, therefore, clearly was not summary in nature. See <em>Storey, supra. </em>Furthermore, it is disingenuous to argue that plaintiff did not have a full opportunity to present his claim or that the adjudicatory nature of the proceeding is not sufficiently akin to a judicial proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, neither party suggests that the proofs required in the agency determination differ from a Civil Rights Act claim in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In terms of the right to appeal, plaintiff certainly was afforded numerous opportunities. In addition to the two intra-agency appeals, he obtained review in the circuit court. Thus, plaintiff had the opportunity to appeal, did in fact appeal, and, hence, satisfies the second part of administrative estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The point of contention in this case centers on the third element of administrative estoppel, i.e., that the Legislature intended the decision to be final absent an appeal. Plaintiff and Justice Mallett rely on MCL 37.2606(1); MSA 3.548(606)(1), which provides the standard of review on appeal from the Civil <em>Rights </em>Commission: \"An appeal before the circuit court shall be reviewed de novo.\u201d Even assuming that a Civil Service Commission determination should be akin to a Civil Rights Commission determination, a plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>whose claim is fully adjudicated by a formal hearing is only afforded the opportunity to <em>appeal </em>the decision and receive a de novo review, but is not afforded the right to file a complaint anew raising the same claim. In this case, plaintiff appealed to the circuit court and received a review under a competent, material, and substantial evidence standard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Viculin v Dep\u2019t of Civil Service, </em>386 Mich 375, 392; 192 NW2d 449 (1971). While this appeal was pending, plaintiff decided to file a new, original action in the same court. This new action was assigned to a different judge who had to decide issues on the basis of the same factual setting. There is absolutely no legislative intent for this multiplicity of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Preclusion doctrines are judicial creations, developed and extended from the common law. Accordingly, the Legislature is free to modify its strict application in any given statutory scheme. 2 Davis &amp; Pierce, Administrative Law (3d ed), \u00a7 13.3, p 256. However, the Civil Rights Act is devoid of any statement that traditional preclusion rules do not apply to this statutory scheme. Hence, the difficulty lies in determining whether an intent can be <em>inferred </em>from the statutory scheme. Davis &amp; Pierce, <em>supra. </em>In doing so, it must be remembered that the Legislature is deemed to legislate with an understanding of common-law adjudicatory principles. <em>Garwols v Bankers Trust Co, </em>251 Mich 420, 424-425; 232 NW 239 (1930); <em>Astoria </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>Federal S &amp; L Ass\u2019n v Solimino, </em>501 US 104, 107-108; 111 S Ct 2166; 115 L Ed 2d 96 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">To date, the closest this Court has come to making such a determination was in Storey, <em>supra. </em>We considered whether a determination by the Michigan Employment Security Commission precluded relitigation of the same issue regarding dismissal in a subsequent civil suit for wrongful discharge and breach of employment contract. In terms of legislative intent to modify traditional preclusion principles, we found MCL 421.11(b)(1); MSA 17.511(b)(1) controlling. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">Except as provided in this act, such information and determinations shall not be used in any action or proceeding before any court or administrative tribunal unless the commission is a party to or a complainant in the action or proceeding, or unless used for the prosecution of fraud, civil proceeding, or other legal proceeding pursuant to subdivision (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Accordingly, this Court held \"that \u00a7 11(b)(1) clearly and unambiguously prohibits the use of mesc information and determinations in subsequent civil proceedings unless the mesc is a party or complainant in the action.\u201d <em>Storey, supra </em>at 376.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">Federal cases have reached similar conclusions, but under slightly less explicit direction from Congress. For example, in <em>Solimino, supra, </em>the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>held that an age discrimination claim<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is not precluded by a judicially unreviewed finding by a state administrative agency. The Court refused to rely on any negative intent, i.e., that Congress did not make a clear statement abrogating common-law preclusion and thus preclusion applied, but instead considered whether there was any intent to be inferred from the statutory scheme.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Looking to the filing requirements of the statute, which required exhaustion of remedies with state authorities before filing in federal court, the Court held that there was congressional intent to abrogate preclusion principles. 501 US 111. The Court reasoned that the filing requirements \"plainly assume the possibility of federal consideration after state agencies have finished theirs.\u201d Id._</p>\n<p id=\"AJs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\">Reviewing the Civil Rights Act, there is nothing remotely similar to the provisions found dispositive of legislative intent in either <em>Storey </em>or <em>Solimino. </em>Section 606 merely provides: \"An appeal before the circuit court shall be reviewed de novo.\u201d Clearly, the express intent presented by the provision in <em>Storey </em>is far from the instant provision providing that an <em>appeal </em>from the Civil <em>Rights </em>Commission \"shall be reviewed de novo.\u201d The latter says nothing about use in later proceedings. The plain language simply contemplates an <em>appeal </em>from the Civil Rights Commission, but does not, by any stretch of the imagination, contemplate a new, original action in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Moreover, fact-specific holdings in federal decisions like <em>Solimino </em>are inapposite because the federal system requires exhaustion of administrative remedies before review in the courts. <em>Kremer v Chemical Construction Corp, </em>456 US 461, 469; 102 S Ct 1883; 72 L Ed 2d 262 (1982). Where exhaustion is required, granting preclusive effect to an agency decision would undermine the role of the courts in the enforcement of laws prohibiting discriminatory treatment. Michigan law, on the other hand, clearly does not require exhaustion of administrative remedies before filing in circuit court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>385 Mich 537, 558-560; 189 NW2d 243 (1971);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Marsh v Dep\u2019t of Civil Service, </em>142 Mich App 557, 562-563; 370 NW2d 613 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The statutory provision at issue in <em>Solimino </em>confirms this difference. It mandates that a plaintiff first proceed in the state agency before filing in the courts. Accordingly, it creates a reasonable inference that preclusion rules should not apply. The same cannot be said with respect to the Michigan statute, however. It merely provides that <em>appeals </em>from the Civil Rights Commission should be <em>reviewed </em>de novo. In other words, it provides guidance on <em>direct </em>appeal in circuit court and says nothing about filing a new, original action in circuit court after receiving full review in an administrative agency, with a subsequent appeal and review in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The dissents would break new ground in Michigan law by countenancing a greater multiplicity of litigation<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> than was ever arguably intended by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Legislature.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, the statutes at issue in both <em>Storey </em>and <em>Solimino </em>do not support such an inferred intent analysis as is employed by Justice Mallett. Even if we were considering an action first begun in the Civil Rights Commission, it would be unreasonable to infer such intent from a statutory provision stating the standard of review on <em>appeal. </em>Indeed, without question a plaintiff beginning in the Civil Rights Commission and <em>appealing </em>to the circuit court, where he receives an adverse decision, would <em>not </em>be entitled to file a new, original action in circuit court. Preclusion would certainly bar the action because there would be no legislative intent for this multiplicity of litigation and waste of judicial resources. The same should be true for claims beginning in the Civil Service Commission.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The dissents cite briefly MCL 37.2803; MSA 3.548(803) and Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29, for support in finding that preclusion does not apply. Both the statute and the constitutional provisions employ the same language which, in effect, states that nothing in the constitution or the Civil Rights Act \u201dshall be construed to diminish the right of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>party to direct and immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">What the dissents fail to do is provide an analysis of the meaning of this clause. However, in <em>Pompey, supra, </em>this Court engaged in extensive analysis of its meaning and concluded that the clear intent of this provision was to permit claimants to seek relief in the courts without first exhausting administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 558-560, n 19.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In other words, the Civil Rights Commission does not have exclusive jurisdiction over discrimination claims, but instead has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts. See also <em>Marsh, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Assuming this provision applies to the Civil Service Commission, imposing preclusion would not offend this clause or even implicate its prohibitions in this case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Civil Rights Commission, the Civil Service Commission, and the circuit court still have concurrent jurisdiction over discrimination claims. <em>Marsh, supra. </em>Plaintiff elected to adju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>dicate his claim to conclusion in the Civil Service Commission and lost. Once a tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction has rendered a decision on the merits, \u00a7 606 mandates that any subsequent relief would be in the form of appellate review.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Hence, \u00a7 606, not \u00a7 803, answers the question whether \"it is clear that the Legislature intended to make the determination final in the absence of an appeal.\u201d <em>Storey, supra </em>at 373. Reading \u00a7 803 in light of \u00a7 606, it is clear that the Legislature intended to make the Civil Rights Commission findings final in the absence of an appeal and, accordingly, also must have intended to make Civil Service Commission determinations final in the absence of an appeal. Regardless of whether an appeal is taken, the Legislature has provided only one remedy from an adverse determination, i.e., direct appeal in the circuit court. An appeal by its very nature contemplates the possibility of reversal, but it certainly does not contemplate a new, original action. If the Legislature intended anything else, it would have said so more directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Additionally, we reject the notion that 2 Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a7 83, pp 266-267, contemplates an abrogation of preclusion under the instant statutory scheme. In discussing the scope of the provision, the commentary indicates that this section would not apply \"when a determination of an administrative tribunal is being subjected to direct judicial review.\u201d Comment a, p 268. This is a logical conclusion given that \"such a review is a continuation of the original administrative litigation and the final outcome is still in contest. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>rules of res judicata do not foreclose the appellate contest, just, as they do not prevent an appellate court from reversing a lower judicial tribunal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Certainly, the instant case technically fits within the scope of \u00a7 83 because it is not on direct appeal. However, relying on a provision addressing a direct appeal to support the finding of legislative intent to abrogate preclusion principles seems counterintuitive. Section 83 simply does not support such a finding. It is illogical to believe that a provision that would displace the situation from the scope of the rule could be used as the basis for finding a new, original action permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The \u00a7 83 commentary<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and its accompanying illustration confirm that \u00a7 83 is not controlling in this case. The example contemplates a statute which provides \" 'the remedies provided under this statute <em>are in addition to all other remedies available to an affected employee or prospective employee.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). In this case, the operable provision provides that an appeal shall be reviewed de novo. Obviously, explicit cumulative remedies, as presented in the example, and de novo review on appeal, as is presented in this case, are not remotely similar. Accordingly, the legislative intent envisioned by \u00a7 83 is not satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">The dissents appear to confuse the question directly presented to this Court. The question is not whether the standard of review on direct appeal should be de novo on the record instead of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>competent, material, and substantial evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Viculin, supra. </em>The question is whether the Legislature intended to abrogate well-established preclusion doctrines when a plaintiff files a new, original action after adverse agency and circuit court decisions. Specifically, the point of contention centers on whether the Legislature intended a Civil Service Commission determination to be final in the absence of an appeal.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> To this question, the answer is undoubtedly yes, the Legislature intended it to be final.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">There are numerous laws regarding discrimination, the most obvious of which is the constitution.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> There, the framers saw fit to provide the Civil Service Commission with the authority to resolve discrimination claims occurring in state employment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Desiring to extend this protection to private employment, the framers then created Const 1963, art 5, \u00a729, which created the Civil Rights .Commission. In light of these provisions, it becomes clear that the delegates contemplated that two constitutionally created administrative bodies would hear similar discrimination claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Against this backdrop, however, the delegates only provided de novo review for claims originating in the Civil Rights Commission.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">When the Legislature enacted the Civil Rights Act pursuant to the requirements set forth in Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and art 5, \u00a7 29,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> it simply followed the procedures already existing under the constitution. Both the constitution and the Legislature provided that appeals from the Civil Rights Commission would be de novo, while also providing that parties have a direct and immediate right to remedies in the courts. Without changing the substance of that already provided as a constitutional right,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> it must be presumed that the Legislature adopted the intent of the framers.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Review<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ing the convention debate and the <em>plain language </em>of these provisions, the intent is simply as follows: Appeals from the Civil Rights Commission shall be de novo and parties need not exhaust administrative remedies before proceeding to circuit court.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Finally, we do not share the dissents\u2019 fears regarding the consequences preclusion could have on the Civil Service Commission. The dissents contend that preclusion would discourage claimants from filing before the Civil Service Commission in fear of losing the right to a remedy in the courts. In addition, Justice Mallett maintains that preclusion would create a greater incentive for the government to actively contest this claim, thereby \"undermining the advantages of informality, cost, and speed in the resolution of such disputes in the administrative forum.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The dissents appear to forget that a claimant has three forums to pursue a discrimination claim: the Civil Service Commission, the Civil Rights Commission, and the circuit court. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>plaintiff has not asked this Court to alter the standard of review for discrimination claims arising in the Civil Service Commission.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In any event, unlike <em>Storey, </em>in which we considered preclusion in the context of the mesc proceeding on unemployment benefits, the Civil Service Commission is not such a limited body. In fact, it is the constitutionally created agency designed to deal with <em>all </em>facets of state employment. If this creates the alleged consequences espoused by the dissents, the Legislature is the appropriate body to remedy this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">We find that plaintiff is estopped from relitigating this discrimination claim in circuit court. With all the requirements of administrative estoppel being satisfied, including the intent to make the decision final in the absence of an appeal, we refuse to sanction a greater multiplicity of litigation than anything currently provided by statute or unnecessarily waste judicial resources. We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b738-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Boyle and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\"> Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, states that the Civil Service Commission shall have the power to \u201cregulate all conditions of employment in the classified service,\u201d and that \"[n]o appointments, promotions, demotions or removals in the classified service shall be made for religious, racial or partisan considerations.\u201d Pursuant to Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5, the Civil Service Commission has the authority to promulgate rules to effectuate the mandates of \u00a7 5.

The Court explained that \"it would make little sense for Congress to write such a provision if state agency findings were entitled to preclusive effect in Title VII actions in federal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court then turned to its decision in <em>Chandler v Roudebush, </em>425 US 840, 848; 96 S Ct 1949; 48 L Ed 2d 416 (1976), where the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">\"The legislative history of the 1972 amendments reinforces the plain meaning of the statute and confirms that Congress intended to accord federal employees the same right to a trial <em>de novo </em>[following administrative proceedings] as is enjoyed by private-sector employees and employees of state governments and political subdivisions under the amended Civil Rights Act of 1964.\u201d <em>[Elliott, supra </em>at 795-796.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Interestingly, the Age Act at issue in <em>Solimino </em>did not contain that provision. The <em>Solimino </em>Court explained this omission was immaterial because the \"substantial weight\u201d provision, like the filing requirements, both indicate and support the finding that preclusion should not apply. 501 US 112.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b729-5\"> In defining the scope of powers entrusted to the Civil Rights Commission, the people provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to diminish the right of any party to direct and immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.

The opinion, however, fails to grasp the important concept of mutuality of estoppel. Estoppel must work both ways. See <em>Howell v Vito\u2019s Trucking &amp; Excavating Co, </em>386 Mich 37, 43; 191 NW2d 313 (1971). Our position will conserve resources by permitting a plaintiff to offensively use a favorable Civil Service Commission decision in circuit court to obtain damages or remedies not available before the commission. Justice Levin\u2019s view would require a plaintiff receiving a favorable ruling in the Civil Service Commission to relitigate the entire claim before reaching a damages or other remedy determination. Hence, our holding reduces the multiplicity of litigation, and Justice Levin\u2019s opinion actually serves to increase it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\"> The dissents would also break new ground on an issue not raised in this Court by overruling <em>Walker v Wolverine Fabricating &amp; Mfg Co, Inc, </em>425 Mich 586; 391 NW2d 296 (1986), and holding that a proceeding de novo either on direct appeal from the agency or in a new, original action is not limited to the record made before the agency.

However, each agency must be assessed separately, and no blanket statement regarding collateral estoppel can be made for all administrative agencies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">In order to determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s action is barred by collateral estoppel, we must examine the Civil Service Commission\u2019s final decision in light of general collateral estoppel requirements<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the three-part test adopted in <em>Roman Cleanser Co v Murphy, </em>386 Mich 698, 703-704; 194 NW2d 704 (1972), and more recently applied in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>Storey v Meijer, Inc, supra. </em>The decision will be given preclusive effect if (1) the administrative determination is adjudicatory in natur\u00e9, (2) there is a method of appeal, and (3) it is clear that the Legislature intended the agency decision to be final in the absence of an appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The first prong of the <em>Storey </em>test, assessing whether an administrative agency\u2019s determination is adjudicatory in nature, requires a comparison between the similarity of the agency\u2019s procedure and that of a court. 2 Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a7 83, comment b, p 268; 2 Davis &amp; Pierce, Administrative Law (3d ed), \u00a7 13.3, p 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Like the majority, we do not contest that the commission\u2019s determination is adjudicatory in nature. The commission is a quasi-judicial administrative agency created by the constitution, and the specific determination is similar in numerous respects to that of a judicial proceeding. <em>Viculin v Dep\u2019t of Civil Service, </em>386 Mich 375, 386; 192 NW2d 449 (1971), citing <em>People ex rel Clardy v Balch, </em>268 Mich 196, 200; 255 NW 762 (1934), and <em>In re Fredericks, </em>285 Mich 262, 266; 280 NW 464 (1938). The employee has the right to be represented by counsel, and the commission has the authority to subpoena witnesses and require the production of documents. In addition, the employee has the right to examine and cross-examine witnesses, the employee has the right to submit exhibits,, and there is a definite point of finality in the proceedings. Although proceedings before the commission may not be as extensive as those employed by a court, the plaintiff filing a claim with the commission trades the rigidity of a judicial tribunal for the informality, simplicity, and rapidity of an administrative determination. There is no indication that the differences between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>commission hearing and a judicial proceeding hinder the ability to present a discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The second prong of the <em>Storey </em>test requires that a method of appeal be available, but is not concerned with whether an appeal was taken. While an actual appeal is not necessary in order for an agency decision to be given preclusive effect,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff in this case pursued his appeal. Again, we do not contest that the commission procedures satisfy this aspect of the test. The Michigan Constitution allows final commission decisions to be appealed to the circuit court. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The critical issue disputed in this case is whether the commission\u2019s civil rights determination fulfills the third prong of the test; that is, whether the Legislature, in enacting the Civil Rights Act, intended to abrogate the traditional rules of preclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the rules of preclusion are a judicial creation, <em>Howell v Vito\u2019s Truck</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>ing &amp; Excavating Co, </em>386 Mich 37; 191 NW2d 313 (1971), the presumption of preclusion will not apply \" 'when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Astoria Federal S &amp; L Ass\u2019n v Solimino, </em>501 US 104, 108; 111 S Ct 2166; 115 L Ed 2d 96 (1991), quoting <em>Isbrandtsen Co v Johnson, </em>343 US 779, 783; 72 S Ct 1011; 96 L Ed 1294 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">According to <em>Storey </em>and 2 Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a7 83, collateral estoppel is not to be applied to administrative agency decisions if it conflicts with a legislative policy that permits a court to make an independent determination of an issue in a subsequent civil proceeding. <em>Storey </em>at 377. 2 Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a7 83(4), p 267, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">An adjudicative determination of an issue by an administrative tribunal does not preclude relitigation of that issue in another tribunal if according preclusive effect to determination of the issue would be incompatible with a legislative policy that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">(a) The determination of the tribunal adjudicating the issue is not to be accorded conclusive effect in subsequent proceedings; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">(b) The tribunal in which the issue subsequently arises be free to make an independent determination of the issue in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">We find that Civil Service Commission decisions are subject to this exception to the general rule of preclusion. Collateral estoppel does not apply to final decisions of the Civil Service Commission because the Legislature did not intend these determinations to be conclusive in subsequent civil litigation. Applying preclusive effect to these decisions is incompatible with legislative policy that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>allows a court to make an independent determination of the same issue. <em>Storey </em>at 377; 2 Restatement Judgments, 2d, \u00a7 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Unlike the majority, we find that the Legislature intended to allow an independent determination in circuit court in the standard of review set forth in the Civil Rights Act. MCL 37.2606; MSA 3.548(606). Although the requirement set forth in the Civil Rights Act applies only to review of Civil Rights Commission determinations, we find no legislative intent to treat Civil Service Commission determinations differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">The standard of review set forth in the Civil Rights Act indicates that the Legislature intended plaintiffs to have an independent review of their civil rights claims in a judicial forum. Section 606 of the act provides that \"[a]n appeal before the circuit court shall be reviewed de novo.\u201d MCL 37.2606; MSA 3.548(606).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Allowing a judicial proceeding when plaintiffs pursue their administrative remedy in the Civil Rights Commission,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>denying a similar treatment when plaintiffs seek adjudication by the Civil Service Commission violates the goals of the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The Civil Service Commission was created by the people of Michigan and has been in effect since January 1, 1941, through the enactment of art 6, \u00a7 22, of the Constitution of 1908, now art 11, \u00a7 5, of the current Michigan Constitution. This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">The commission shall classify all positions in the classified service according to their respective duties and responsibilities, fix rates of compensation for all classes of positions, approve or disapprove disbursements for all personal services, determine by competitive examination and performance exclusively on the basis of merit, efficiency and fitness the qualifications of all candidates for positions in the classified service, make rules and regulations covering all personnel transactions, and regulate all conditions of employment in the classified service. [Const 1963, art 11, \u00a7 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">It is undisputed that the purpose of the amendment was to eliminate the \"spoils system\u201d and the politicization of state employment. The goal was to improve- the state of the classified civil service through the efforts of a single agency. See <em>Council No 11, AFSCME v Civil Service Comm, </em>87 Mich App 420, 424; 274 NW2d 804 (1978), aff\u2019d 408 Mich 385; 292 NW2d 442 (1980); <em>Reed v Civil Service Comm, </em>301 Mich 137, 154-155; 3 NW2d 41 (1942); <em>Dep\u2019t of Civil Rights ex rel Jones v Civil Service Dep\u2019t, </em>101 Mich App 295; 301 NW2d 12 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Although the Civil Rights Commission was created to end invidious forms of discrimination through the effort of a single agency, the Civil Rights Commission does not have exclusive jurisdiction over state employees\u2019 discrimination claims.

An independent review is guaranteed in two of the three forums in which civil service employees can file a discrimination claim: the circuit court and review de novo of a Civil Rights Commission decision pursuant to MCL 37.2606; MSA 3.548(606).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Review of Civil Service Commission determinations, however, is governed by a more deferential standard. Civil Service Commission determinations are reviewed to determine if there is \"competent, material and substantial evidence on the record as a whole\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to support the commission\u2019s decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>Viculin, supra; Crider v Michigan, </em>110 Mich App 702; 313 NW2d 367 (1981). Thus, if we were to grant preclusive effect to a discrimination decision by the Civil Service Commission, plaintiffs who pursued their discrimination claims before the commission could never secure an independent determination in a judicial forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">For these reasons, we would find that the Legislature did not intend such result, but rather intended to guarantee \"the right of any party to direct an immediate legal or equitable remedies in the courts of this state.\u201d Const 1963, art 5, \u00a7 29; MCL 37.2803; MSA 3.548(803).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Treating the Civil Rights Commission and the Civil Service Commission differently is unsupported by the language or the intent of the Civil Rights Act. Civil service disputes often involve factors and considerations not present outside the civil service arena. In instances in which civil service employment presents unique constraints and obligations, the Civil Service Commission may be a better informed decisionmaker than either the courts or other administrative agencies that are not familiar with civil service employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">We do not, however, find discrimination to be such a situation. Discrimination is discrimination, whether in the civil service arena or in the private sector. While the Civil Service Commission is undoubtedly frequently required to determine whether discrimination has occurred in state employment, we are unable to conclude that it has special knowledge or expertise requiring greater deference to its determinations than that of the Civil Rights Commission. To the contrary, it would be anomalous to give greater deference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>determinations of the Civil Service Commission with regard to discrimination issues, an agency that only addresses discrimination as one facet of its jurisdiction,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> than to the Civil Rights Commission, the agency expressly created to remedy discriminatory treatment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">We conclude that because a determination by the primary agency vested with eliminating discrimination does not preclude an independent determination in a judicial forum, neither should the determination of the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Civil rights claims have consistently been treated differently than other employment claims. While the Civil Service Commission possesses \"plenary power\u201d to determine the procedures by which \"a state civil service employee may review his grievance,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> including claims arising under the Civil Rights Act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> denying preclusive effect to the Civil Service Commission discrimination determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>nation recognizes the unique nature of a discrimination claim and fulfills the intent of the Legislature to provide an independent determination in a judicial forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Lastly, our conclusion is further justified by the consequences that would follow from barring the plaintiff from receiving an independent determination by the circuit court. Civil service employees are not required to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing a civil rights claim directly in circuit court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, plaintiffs should not be discouraged from pursuing an administrative remedy that offers the advantage of resolving disputes more quickly and with less expense than similar judicial proceedings. We tacitly acknowledged this concern in <em>Storey </em>when we noted that granting preclusive effect to determinations of the Employment Security Commission would entail a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">substantial risk that the potential application of collateral estoppel will cause a qualified claimant to forego a claim for unemployment compensation in order to protect the right to pursue a civil claim with its full range of benefits. <em>[Id. </em>at 378.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Likewise, were we to adopt the defendant\u2019s argument here, civil service employees, in order to avoid the preclusive effect of an adverse Civil Service Commission determination, would be encouraged to forgo proceedings before the commission in order to preserve an independent determination in a judicial forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">As we also recognized in Storey, \"[d]ue to the full range of remedies available in a civil action, the parties have a greater incentive to fully liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>gate the civil claim than the claim for unemployment benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 378. The same incentives are present in proceedings before the Civil Service Commission.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Fearful of an adverse determination, the defendant employer would have a strong incentive to contest discrimination in all Civil Service Commission proceedings because a victorious plaintiff would be able to offensively assert the determination of the commission in circuit court and recover damages that the commission does not have the authority to award. Thus, application of collateral estoppel would encourage exhaustive contests of discrimination claims, undermining the advantages of informality, cost, and speed in the resolution of such disputes in the administrative forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In enacting the Civil Rights Act, the Legislature sought to ensure an independent determination in a judicial forum. An independent determination cannot be guaranteed if preclusive effect is granted to the previous Civil Service Commission discrimination determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">We would hold that the Legislature intended to eliminate the preclusive effects of the Civil Service Commission determination. For this reason, we would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and would hold that a final determination by the Civil Service Commission does not preclude the plaintiff from relitigating the same issues in circuit court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Cava\u00f1agh, J., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b750-4\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjdX\">David Nummer was transferred from one unit of the Department of Treasury to another.

The Court of Appeals reversed,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">It is clear that in enacting the Civil Rights Act, the Legislature chose to set aside the principles of collateral estoppel in civil rights cases and to countenance a multiplicity of litigation. As provided by the statutory scheme, the Legislature intended to permit civil rights litigants to have \"two bites of the apple,\u201d even if two separate proceedings reach opposite results or engender repetitious and perhaps needless litigation in violation of the principles of collateral estoppel. As this Court noted in <em>Walters </em>[v <em>Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>148 Mich App 809, 819; 385 NW2d 695 (1986)], quoting <em>Pompey v General Motors Corp, </em>385 Mich 537, 560; 189 NW2d 243 (1971), a civil action for the redress of a violation of a civil rights statute may be pursued in addition to \" 'the remedial [administrative] machinery provided by statute.\u2019 \u201d Thus, a plaintiff whose civil rights claim is denied by the Civil Service Commission may file an original action in the circuit court, which may conclude otherwise and award injunctive relief or damages, including costs and reasonable attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition in favor of the department respecting Nummer\u2019s breach of an enforceable promise claim, but reversed regarding his race and sex discrimination claims under the Civil Rights Act, and remanded the case for further proceedings regarding those claims only.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">In a circuit court civil, rights action, in contrast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>with a Civil Service Commission proceeding, the parties have a right to a jury (or judge) determination of the factual issues.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The administrative hearing and decision-making process, while adjudicatory, is informal and expedited, in contrast with the formal and deliberative proceedings in a circuit court trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">A new determination by a circuit court jury of the issue of sex and race discrimination, decided against Nummer by the Civil Service Commission, would thus, as set forth in the Restatement of Judgments, be \"warranted by differences in the quality or extensiveness of the procedures followed in\u201d circuit court as compared to those followed in a Civil Service Commission administrative proceeding.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">This is not a case in which the litigant seeking to relitigate an adverse decision by an administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>tive tribunal could have obtained an adjudication of all his claims in a circuit court action. A state civil servant in the classified service cannot, in a circuit court action asserting that his civil rights have been violated, join claims seeking redress for violation of his civil service rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Nummer\u2019s claims that his transfer from the Tax Fraud Division to the Discovery Division of the Treasury Department violated an enforceable promise, and also violated a rule requiring that personnel decisions be made on the basis of merit, could only be advanced before the Civil Service Commission, and could not have been advanced in circuit court.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The third strand of his complaint, the civil rights claim, alone can be advanced in circuit court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">A state civil servant will generally conclude that he is more likely to prevail on a civil rights claim in a circuit court civil rights action than before the Civil Service Commission. Today\u2019s decision\u2014 precluding a circuit court civil rights action following a Civil Service Commission hearing on a civil rights grievance \u2014 will generally result in state civil servants splitting their claims of civil rights and noncivil rights grievances. The state civil servant henceforth will not file a grievance involving a civil rights, claim before the Civil Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Commission, and will file in circuit court,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> resulting in litigation before the Civil Service Commission of noncivil rights grievances and in the circuit court of civil rights claims, thus assuring the multiplicity of litigation that the doctrine of collateral estoppel seeks to discourage.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In some cases, including this case, the factual predicate of a state civil servant\u2019s noncivil rights grievance may so relate to the factual predicate of his civil rights grievance that a Civil Service Commission hearing officer\u2019s findings on the noncivil rights grievance may decide factual issues central to a circuit court civil rights action. Where that might occur, a well-informed and advised civil servant henceforth must choose whether to forgo, by not grieving his noncivil rights claims \u2014 in order to protect his civil rights claim against an adverse finding by a Civil Service Commission hearing officer on an issue central to a circuit court civil rights action \u2014 or run the risk of such an adverse finding by filing a grievance regarding his noncivil rights claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Even if Nummer had \"chosen\u201d to forgo filing a grievance with the Civil Service Commission respecting violation of his civil rights, application of conventional collateral estoppel doctrine would nevertheless bar his circuit court civil rights action. The Civil Service Commission\u2019s finding that he had been transferred for \"legitimate business considerations\u201d \u2014 thus rejecting his merit selection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>grievance \u2014 would ordinarily preclude relitigation of the bona fides of the reasons for the transfer in the circuit court civil rights action.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">While the majority\u2019s conclusion that the circuit court civil rights action is precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel might be read as limited to a case, such as this, in which the claim of discrimination was raised before the Civii Service Commission and there was a finding that the claim of discrimination was not meritorious, it no doubt would be contended in another case that, although no claim of discrimination had been presented before the Civil Service Commission, factual findings in the Civil Service Commission proceeding preclude relitigation of the issue of the reason for the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Preclusion is a judicially created doctrine that serves to eliminate redundant litigation. It should not be extended to a case in which the litigation is not redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">A state civil servant who has both a civil rights grievance and a noncivil rights grievance should be able to seek a Civil Service Commission hearing of his noncivil rights grievance without running the risk that the decision of that claim will preclude a circuit court civil rights claim even if the employee does not file a grievance regarding his civil service discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">The majority should limit its holding to the facts of this case where grievances involving both a civil rights and a noncivil rights claim were filed. The majority should, I believe, add that where a grievance does not involve a civil service discrimination claim, a finding regarding another claim will not preclude a civil rights action. To fail to do so may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>mean that a person employed in the state classified service will be constrained from filing legitimate nondiscrimination grievances, lest an adverse determination foreclose a civil rights action.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Neither judicial economy nor the doctrine of collateral estoppel inexorably requires this Court to conclude that the needs of judicial economy outweigh the needs and rights of persons in the state classified service to exercise their civil service grievance hearing rights without potentially sacrificing their rights and remedies under the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Applying the conventional collateral estoppel doctrine in this case charging sex and race discrimination means that a state civil servant who protests, here a transfer, in another case, discipline, on any basis \u2014 whether on the basis of violation of civil rights or violation of other rights\u2014 runs the risk of a factual finding that may bar his civil rights action. A state civil servant who wishes to preserve his right to a jury determination in a circuit court civil rights action of his claims of sex or race discrimination must forgo filing a grievance before the Civil Service Commission regarding any issue that might result in a finding that the action taken by the department was for bona fide reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">It is a feature of civil rights litigation that a person claiming a violation of his civil rights has a multiplicity of remedies.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> That is a constitutional and legislative choice annoying to some, but a choice that this Court should honor by denying preclusion of a circuit court action where there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>were sound reasons for first seeking administrative relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Neither the framers of the constitution nor the Legislature intended that an employee in the state civil service would be put to such an election of which right to assert, and constrained to forgo one right to protect another.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The framers of the constitution, in providing for the plenary power of the Civil Service Commission,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and the Legislature, in providing for a circuit court civil rights action, did not intend to preclude a state civil servant who unsuccessfully pursued a grievance involving a civil rights violation before the Civil Service Commission from obtaining a jury determination of the civil rights claim in a legal action expressly preserved by the constitution to all citizens.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The policies underlying the judicially created doctrines of collateral estoppel and preclusion do not require that those doctrines be applied so rigidly as to force such an election of which right to assert and which right to abandon to protect the other right. The policies, protective of the civil service rights of state employees and of the civil rights of all citizens, as expressed in the constitution, and protective of civil rights, as expressed in the statutes, oblige us to protect both a state employee\u2019s civil service grievance rights <em>and </em>his circuit court civil rights cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Because a transfer in violation of a state civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>servant\u2019s civil rights would also be grievable before the Civil Service Commission, a civil servant claiming that his transfer was discriminatory should be encouraged to advance that claim before a Civil Service Commission hearing officer at the same time he advances his noncivil rights grievances so that the hearing officer has all the claims before him and can review all the evidence, and make a decision on all the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">A circuit court civil rights action is not \"repetitive\u201d or unnecessarily duplicative of a civil service hearing. A civil service hearing was required to provide Nummer with an opportunity to present his breach of enforceable promise and merit rule grievances. Permitting plaintiffs like Nummer to raise the civil rights issue before the Civil Service Commission without risking preclusion of a circuit court civil rights claim might, in particular cases, actually conserve judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">A proceeding before the Civil Service Commission ordinarily moves more speedily than a circuit court civil rights action, and provides an opportunity for mediation and rectification of an employee\u2019s grievance that might avoid unnecessary litigation. Providing such an opportunity is in the public interest, the interest of the Civil Service Commission, the department of state government for which the civil servant works, and the civil servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The public interest in preserving the efficacy of Civil Service Commission hearings as a means of protecting civil servants and the administration of state government from untoward action by a state governmental official militates against applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel in a manner that will tend to eliminate Civil Service Commission hearings respecting employee complaints regarding transfers or discipline in any case in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>which the employee may wish to preserve for adjudication by a jury in circuit court claims of sex, race, or other discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The majority\u2019s assertion that had Nummer complained to the Civil Rights Commission and appealed to the circuit court, a \u00a7 801 circuit court civil rights action would be precluded by an adverse decision in the circuit court,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> ignores that the claimant is not ordinarily a party in a Civil Rights Commission proceeding<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and ordinarily is not represented by separate counsel.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The majority references no decision of the Court of Appeals in which \u00e1 party sought to retry in a circuit court civil rights action issues decided on the merits by the Civil Rights Commission and affirmed or reversed on appeal in the circuit court. There may be no such case simply because the Civil Rights Commission takes relatively few cases to formal hearing, and, when it does, the complainant may generally prevail or accept an adverse determination following a full hearing on the merits and a determination de novo on appeal to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Such a scenario cannot be compared to adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>tion of a civil rights claim by a civil service hearing officer, one page affirmances by the Employment Board and the Civil Service Commission, and further review by the circuit court under the deferential reviewing standard requiring that the commission\u2019s decision be affirmed if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In <em>Walker v Wolverine Fabricating &amp; Mfg Co, Inc, </em>425 Mich 586; 391 NW2d 296 (1986), the complainant appealed from a decision of the Civil Rights Commission dismissing his complaint after finding that there were not sufficient grounds to issue a charge. It is one thing to construe the constitutional provision, \"appeals [from the Civil Rights Commission] shall be tried de novo,\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> as not permitting expansion of the record <em>on appeal </em>where the issue is whether the Civil Rights Commission properly declined to bring a charge, and, thus, to decide the merits. It would be quite another to so construe that constitutional provision where the circuit court reviews a decision by the Civil Rights Commission <em>on the merits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">An appeal (under article 6 of the Civil Rights Act) from the Civil Rights Commission truly tried de novo in circuit court on the merits, with a full record made by counsel for the complainant, probably would preclude a circuit court action brought in the claimant\u2019s name under \u00a7 801 (article 8 of the Civil Rights Act), especially if it was the claimant who appealed from the Civil Rights Commission to the circuit court.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The majority states that \"review under a compe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>tent, material, and substantial evidence standard\u201d \"is not 'on the merits.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Although such appellate review is not de novo, it is nevertheless supposed to be a search of the record and a review to determine whether there is the requisite evidentiary support for the decision \"on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The majority states that the framers of the Constitution of 1963 desired, as set forth in art 5, \u00a7 29, to extend to \"private employment\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the protection provided in the civil service provisions of the constitution against discrimination.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This is inconsistent with recognition that there is no need for a state civil service employee to exhaust his administrative remedies<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> \u2014 he can proceed under the Civil Rights Act directly in the circuit court which, thus, provides remedies not limited to \"private employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">There are a large number of governmental employees who are not in the state classified civil service: state employees who are excepted from the classified state civil service, and county, city, and township employees, all of whom are covered by the Civil Rights Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">x</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">The following statement appears on pp 561-562 of the dissenting opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\">The standard of review set forth in the Civil Rights Act indicates that the Legislature intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>plaintiffs to have an independent review of their civil rights claims in a judicial forum.

Allowing a judicial proceeding when plaintiffs pursue their administrative remedy in the Civil Rights Commission, but denying a similar treatment when plaintiffs seek adjudication by the Civil Service Commission violates the goals of the Civil Rights Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The discussion of \u00a7 606 (article 6) as the source of the right to an \"independent determination\u201d overlooks that \u00a7 606 concerns only an appeal from the Civil Rights Commission.

I find that Grievant has not overcome this fact in his proofs. That the auditors were all men and that mostly women and other minorities replaced them is largely irrelevant because of the differing levels of the two classifications. In addition, the eligibility pool from which the regulation agents were selected was made up primarily of minority persons and this, not discrimination, is the reason for the staffing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">decision</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">The Department of Treasury\u2019s transfer of David A.
