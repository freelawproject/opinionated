Specifically, we must decide whether the plaintiff in this action was wholly or partially dependent on her deceased husband, where her contribution to the family\u2019s household income<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was nineteen percent. Additionally, we must determine the proper formula for calculating a partially dependent person\u2019s weekly benefit pursuant to MCL 418.321; MSA 17.237(321).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, we must determine whether a partially dependent person\u2019s weekly benefit is subject to the statutory maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>mum and minimum rates of compensation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">We conclude that plaintiff contributed to the household income by means of a regular and substantial pension and therefore was only partially dependent on her husband when he died. Additionally, we hold that the proper formula for the calculation of a weekly benefit for a partially dependent person must include consideration of such person\u2019s' regular and substantial income as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-7\">Deceased employee\u2019s annual after-tax earnings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">Total relevant annual family income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-9\">X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-10\">\n<em>80%</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-11\">X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-12\">Deceased employee\u2019s after-tax weekly wage</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">Finally, we determine that once the weekly benefit is calculated under this formula, it is not subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation. Wp note, however, that a partially dependent person\u2019s weekly benefits are inherently subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation because the calculation of a wholly dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>person\u2019s weekly benefit is included in the partially dependent person\u2019s calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">On March 10, 1986, Clifford Weems, an employee of defendant Chrysler Corporation was injured in a work-related automobile accident that resulted in his death on March 23, 1986. Because Mr. Weems died in a work-related accident his widow, plaintiff Virginia Weems, was entitled to death benefits pursuant to MCL 418.321; MSA 17.237(321).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time of her husband\u2019s death, plaintiff had retired from the irs and was receiving a monthly pension of $850. Chrysler therefore maintains that Mrs. Weems was only partially dependent on her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">On May 13, 1986, Chrysler filed a petition for determination of rights with the Bureau of Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation requesting a determination of who was dependent on Mr. Weems at the time of his death and whether they were wholly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>partially dependent on him. Mrs. Weems also filed a petition for hearing on June 16, 1986, claiming that she and her three grandchildren were dependent on Mr. Weems. Additionally, Allstate Insurance, Mr. Weems\u2019 no-fault insurer, filed a petition to intervene aligning itself with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The magistrate held that plaintiff was fully dependent, but that her grandchildren were not dependents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Chrysler was ordered to pay weekly benefits to Mrs. Weems at the maximum rate of $374 per week for five hundred weeks starting from the date of Mr. Weems\u2019 death. Defendant filed an application for review of claim with the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission. Plaintiff did not seek review. The wcac modified the magistrate\u2019s decision holding that because of Mrs. Weems\u2019 monthly pension, she was only partially dependent on Mr. Weems. Additionally, the wcac concluded that the maximum and minimum rates of compensation applied to persons partially as well as wholly dependent. Therefore, because the formula the wcac used to calculate plaintiff\u2019s benefits produced a figure lower than the minimum rate of compensation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the wcac awarded Mrs. Weems the then-minimum rate of compensation of $207 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Plaintiff and defendant appealed the wcac\u2019s decision in the Court of Appeals. The Court affirmed the wcac, holding that plaintiff was par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>tially dependent<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and was entitled to the minimum weekly benefit. Although the Court\u2019s holding with respect to this issue is confusing, in order to achieve its result, the Court necessarily concluded that a partially dependent person\u2019s weekly benefit is subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">We granted leave to appeal<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals on the issue of partial dependency. We reverse the Court of Appeals decision granting plaintiff, as partially dependent, the statutory minimum weekly benefit and instead adopt a formula for calculating death benefits that properly considers the partially dependent person\u2019s regular and substantial income. Additionally, we reverse the Court of Appeals determination that a partially dependent person\u2019s weekly benefit is directly subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation. We reiterate that the maximum and minimum rates of compensation are inherent within the formula for calculating a partially dependent person\u2019s benefits. The partially dependent person\u2019s formula includes consideration of what a partially dependent person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>would have received if wholly dependent, and that figure is subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">We are limited to a review of the findings of fact made by the wcac. <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257, 263; 484 NW2d 227 (1992). Additionally, the standard of review of a final wcac decision is that its findings are conclusive if there is any competent evidence to support them. <em>Id. </em>at 261-263; <em>Corbett v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>194 Mich App 624, 631; 487 NW2d 825 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Mindful of these standards, we must first determine whether there is any competent evidence supporting the wcac\u2019s conclusion that Mrs. Weems was partially dependent on her husband at the time of his death. It is conceded that nineteen percent of the Weems\u2019 household income was derived from Mrs. Weems\u2019 $850 monthly pension. Plaintiff, however, asserts that her contribution was de minimis and is no indication that she was only partially dependent on her husband.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ever, decisions of this state, as well as decisions of other jurisdictions, persuade us that Mrs. Weems was partially dependent on her husband when he died.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">We first note that in <em>Rose v Paper Mills Trucking Co, </em>47 Mich App 1, 7; 209 NW2d 305 (1973), the Court held that the decedent\u2019s stepson, who was receiving monthly social security benefits of $105, was partially dependent on his deceased stepfather. The Court concluded that dependency is a question of fact, and, if the undisputed facts clearly demonstrate that the claimant was not totally dependent, a court could determine that the claimant was partially dependent as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Similarly, in <em>Ammons v Dunbar &amp; Sullivan Construction Co, </em>54 Mich App 107, 109-110; 220 NW2d 323 (1974), the claimant lived with her son and daughter. Until his death, the claimant\u2019s son paid the entire cost of maintaining the home, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>which amounted to approximately $400 monthly. During the time the decedent maintained the home, his mother received a pension and social security benefits, totaling $115 monthly. The claimant, however, saved all these payments and made no contribution toward household expenses. The Court held that the plaintiff was only partially dependent on her son, stating that \"while the plaintiff may. have chosen to depend wholly upon her son\u2019s contribution despite her regular independent income, because of such income she was not wholly dependent upon the earnings of the deceased.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, in addition to holding that the claimant\u2019s payments rendered her partially dependent, the Court held that the manner in which a dependent disposes of any supplemental income is irrelevant to the determination whether the person was wholly or partially dependent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Plaintiff relies on <em>Kalcic v Newport Mining Co, </em>197 Mich 364; 163 NW 962 (1917), for the proposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>tion that her income was trifling. However, in <em>Kalcic, </em>unlike the present case, the supplemental income the claimant received was sporadic, twenty or thirty cents a day, two or three times per month.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The claimant\u2019s husband contributed roughly ninety-three percent of the annual income, while her <em>irregular </em>wages provided only approximately seven percent of the annual income. We are therefore persuaded that <em>Kalcic </em>is clearly distinguishable from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">From these cases, it is apparent that the law of dependency is well settled in Michigan. The law is likewise well settled in most other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Virtually all jurisdictions agree that a regular and substantial supplemental income, which is not merely temporary, mandates a determination of partial dependency. In the present case, it is undisputed that plaintiif received regular payments of $850 per month. These payments were determined by the wcac to be substantial, rather than de minimis.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On the basis of the decisions of this state and a plain reading of the statute distinguishing between partial and whole dependents, we agree that Mrs. Weems was partially dependent on her deceased husband. The wcac\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff was receiving substantial and reasonably regular income is unquestionably supported by \"competent evidence\u201d and is therefore conclusive. <em>Corbett </em>and <em>Holden, supra. </em>The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed with regard to the issue of partial dependency._</p>\n<p id=\"Azr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b875-3\">Having concluded that Mrs. Weems was partially dependent on her husband, it is necessary to determine the proper formula for calculating a partially dependent person\u2019s weekly benefit. It is conceded that the following language of \u00a7 321 calculating benefits for partial dependents is somewhat ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-4\">If the employee leaves dependents only partially dependent upon his or her earnings for support at the time of injury, the weekly compensation to be paid shall be equal to the same proportion of the weekly payments for the benefit of persons wholly dependent as 80% of the amount contributed by the employee to such partial dependents bears to the annual earnings of the deceased at the time of injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The language \"the amount contributed by the employee to such partial dependents bears to the annual earnings of the deceased\u201d is particularly difficult to apply.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Chrysler urges the adoption of a formula in which the total relevant annual family income first is divided equally among all those dependent on it when the employee died.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> After equally allocating the total relevant annual family income among those supported by it, Chrysler would then subtract the amount contributed by the partially dependent survivor. We are not persuaded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>defendant properly construes MCL 418.321; MSA 17.237(321). The lack of statutory support for Chrysler\u2019s formula is augmented by the formula\u2019s lack of logic. The death of a household member will not proportionately diminish household expenses. For example, large expenses such as mortgage payments, insurance, and taxes remain the same after the death of a household member.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Plaintiff proposes that she should have received the proportion of the maximum benefit ($374 per week) that corresponds to the same ratio of the income provided by the deceased worker for her support. Under this method, she claims that she is entitled to eighty-one percent (her husband\u2019s share of the household income) of $374<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or roughly $302.94 per week. Plaintiff relies on the general purpose of the wdca, which has the goal of humane and benevolent compensation to families who have lost the wages of a family member. As conceded by plaintiff, however, the proposed method is essentially without authority. In fact, the Court in <em>LePalm v Reveo DS, Inc, </em>202 Mich App 33; 507 NW2d 771 (1993), specifically rejected this calculation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Instead, the <em>LePalm </em>Court adopted a formula that properly considers the regular and substantial income of the partially dependent person. Although we do not adopt the exact formula enunciated in <em>LePalm, </em>we agree that the partially dependent person\u2019s annual wages are a factor in determining the proportion a partially dependent person will receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">It is clear from the language of MCL 418.321; MSA 17.237(321) that the Legislature intended to treat wholly and partially dependent persons proportionately on the basis of their dependence. The Legislature provided that claimants who were wholly dependent on a deceased employee would receive death benefits that would total eighty percent of the deceased employee\u2019s after-tax weekly earnings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">80%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-8\">X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-9\">Deceased employee\u2019s after-tax weekly earnings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-10\">Death benefits for wholly dependent claimant</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">It is clear and it logically follows that the Legislature intended that partially dependent persons receive eighty percent <em>of the extent of their dependency on </em>the deceased employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">To determine the partially dependent person\u2019s benefits, the deceased employee\u2019s annual after-tax earnings are combined with the partially dependent person\u2019s regular and substantial annual income. The resulting figure is the total relevant annual family income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Deceased employee\u2019s annual after-tax earnings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-5\">+</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-6\">Partial dependent\u2019s regular and substantial annual income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-7\">Total relevant annual family income</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">The partially dependent person is, therefore, dependent on that fraction of the total relevant annual family income contributed by the deceased employee\u2019s annual after-tax earnings. In other words, we must divide the deceased employee\u2019s annual after-tax earnings by the total relevant annual family income:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-9\">Deceased employee\u2019s annual after-tax earnings Total relevant annual family income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-10\">Claimant\u2019s partial dependency</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-11\">Once the claimant\u2019s partial dependency is determined, proportionality with the formula for wholly dependent benefits requires that the resulting figure be multiplied by the amount that would be awarded if the partially dependent person were wholly dependent. Thus, the formula is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-12\">Deceased employee\u2019s annual after-tax earnings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-13\">Total relevant annual family income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-14\">X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-15\">80%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-16\">X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-17\">Deceased employee\u2019s after-tax weekly wage</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-18\">Application of this formula provides death benefits to partially dependent persons that are proportionate to the benefits they would have received had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>they been wholly dependent on the earnings of the deceased employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In the present case, it is uncontested that all of Mr. Weems\u2019 income went toward household support.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Therefore, to implement this formula, we must initially combine Mr. Weems\u2019 annual earnings ($42,791) and Mrs. Weems\u2019 annual earnings ($10,200), which equal $52,991. This reflects the total relevant annual family income. Mr. Weems\u2019 annual income ($42,791) is then divided by the total relevant annual family income ($52,991) to yield a proportion that is eighty-one percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Pursuant to the statute, this percentage is then multiplied by the amount a wholly dependent person would receive in weekly benefits, which, in this case, is the statutory maximum \u2014 $374.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The final result is that Mrs. Weems is entitled to receive $302.94 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">This calculation is consistent with the manner used to initially determine partial dependency, i.e., the only criteria by which a person is adjudged wholly or partially dependent is whether that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>person receives a regular and substantial income. This is the <em>only </em>factor that even categorizes a person as partially dependent. Yet, both partial dissents propose a remand in order to determine what amount of the decedent\u2019s income was used for the support of the partial dependent.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Such a determination is absolutely unworkable in practice. It would be impossible in most cases to even roughly estimate which portion of the decedent\u2019s income was used for the sole support of the dependent.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, such a construction does not address the issue of the dependent\u2019s income that was used to support the decedent. In cases where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>the dependent was earning, e.g., forty percent of the household income in which the majority of that income was used for the support of the decedent, the dependent will be in a substantially better position than may be accounted for by the dissent\u2019s formula. The proposal to remand for the sole determination of what portion of the decedent\u2019s income went to support the dependent does not consider this important factor.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Having calculated the amount Mrs. Weems should have received in weekly benefits, we must now determine whether that amount is subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation. We first review the plain language of the statute and note that the limiting language \"subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation\u201d does not precede the calculation for partial dependents.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In construing a statute, \"effect must be given, if possible, to every word, sentence and section.\u201d <em>Grand Rapids v Crocker, </em>219 Mich 178, 182; 189 NW 221 (1922). Moreover, to discover the legislative intent, \"the entire act must be read, and the interpretation to be given to a particular word in one section arrived at after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>due consideration of every other section so as to produce, if possible, a harmonious and consistent enactment as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182-183. Qualifying words and phrases in a statute refer solely to the last antecedent in which no contrary intention appears. <em>General Motors Corp v Erves (On Rehearing), </em>399 Mich 241, 273; 249 NW2d 41 (1976) (opinion of Williams, J.); <em>Kizer v Livingston Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>38 Mich App 239, 252; 195 NW2d 884 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The fact that the statute distinguishes between wholly and partially dependent persons indicates that the two classes were ultimately intended to be compensated differently. For example, if a wholly dependent person\u2019s benefits were below the minimum, that dependent would be entitled to the minimum. A partially dependent person should only expect to receive a percentage of what a wholly dependent person would receive. To hold otherwise would be to ignore the plain language of the statute, distinguishing between whole and partial dependents. If a partially dependent person received the same amount as a wholly dependent person, it would frustrate the Legislature\u2019s intent in drawing that distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The maximum and minimum rates of compensation must not be applied to alter a partially dependent person\u2019s weekly benefit <em>after </em>the proper formula has been applied to determine the dependent\u2019s weekly benefit.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> A partially dependent person\u2019s benefit is a percentage of a wholly dependent person\u2019s benefit, which has already been adjusted according to the statutory maximum and minimum rates of compensation. Therefore, hypotheti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>cally, if in the present case a wholly dependent person was entitled to the statutory minimum, and it was determined that a partially dependent person was entitled to seventy-six percent of the wholly dependent person, the result would be lower than the minimum rate of compensation, not subject to it. In this manner, the maximum and minimum rates of compensation are considered in the calculation to the extent that partially dependent persons receive a percent\u00e1ge of the amount paid to wholly dependent persons that has been adjusted for the statutory maximum and minimum rates of compensation. We are persuaded that this is the only logical interpretation of the statute because the qualifying language follows and modifies wholly dependent persons.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The same language does not follow and therefore should not be read to modify the amount paid to partially dependent persons except to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>that the benefits that a partially dependent person receives are modified by the amount the partial dependent would have received had the partial dependent been wholly dependent.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">Mrs. Weems was not wholly dependent on her husband when he died. She had a continuous and substantial income that amounted to nearly twenty percent of the household income. Her monthly pension therefore was not de minimis. The proper formula for calculating the weekly benefits of a partially dependent person is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-8\">Deceased employee\u2019s annual after-tax earnings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-9\">Total relevant annual family income</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-10\">X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-11\">80%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-12\">X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-13\">Deceased employee\u2019s after-tax weekly wage</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-14\">which would allow Mrs. Weems to collect $302.94 per week. The maximum and minimum rates of compensation do not directly apply to partial dependents, although they are implicitly figured into the formula because a partially dependent person\u2019s benefit is a product of what a totally dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>person would have received (which is subject to the maximum and minimum rate of compensation). The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed with respect to the issue of partial dependency. The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed with regard to the calculation of weekly benefits and the extent that it holds that the maximum and minimum rates of compensation directly apply to partially dependent persons.</p>\n<judges id=\"b885-5\">Brickley, C.J., and Mallett and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-9\"> Under MCL 418.321; MSA 17.237(321), we understand the total relevant annual family income to include the regular and substantial contributions, if any, of a claimant\u2019s and the deceased worker\u2019s after-tax wage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b865-10\"> The statutory formula for calculation of a death benefit for a partially dependent person is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-11\">If the employee leaves dependents only partially dependent upon his or her earnings for support at the time of injury, the weekly compensation to be paid shall be equal to the same proportion of the weekly payments for the benefit of persons wholly dependent as 80% of the amount contributed by the employee to such partial dependents bears to the annual earnings of the deceased at the time of injury.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b866-14\"> MCL 418.355(2); MSA 17.237(355)(2) provides for the maximum weekly benefit rate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-15\">Effective January 1, 1982, and each January 1 thereafter, the maximum weekly rate of compensation for injuries occurring within that year shall be established as 90% of the state average weekly wage as of the prior June 30, adjusted to the next higher multiple of $1.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">MCL 418.356(2); MSA 17.237(356X2) provides for the minimum weekly benefit rate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-17\">The minimum weekly benefit for death under section 321 shall be 50% of the state average weekly wage as determined under section 355.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\"> If death results from the personal injury of an employee, the employer shall pay, or cause to be paid, subject to section 375, in i of the methods provided in this section, to the dependents of the employee who were wholly dependent upon the employee\u2019s earnings for support at the time of the injury, a weekly payment equal to 80% of the employee\u2019s after-tax average weekly wage, subject to the maximum and minimum rates of compensation under this act, for a period of 500 weeks from the date of death.

As plaintiff has conceded, that statute was held unconstitutional in <em>Day v W A Foote Memorial Hosp, </em>412 Mich 698; 316 NW2d 712 (1982), in which the Court held that the statutory conclusive presumption that widows, but not widowers, were wholly dependent on their deceased spouses was gender-based discrimination and violative of the Equal Protection Clause. Plaintiff requests that this Court reconsider its decision in <em>Day.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s position is untenable because the Court again addressed this issue in <em>Pike v City of Wyoming, </em>431 Mich 589; 433 NW2d 768 (1988). In <em>Pike, </em>the Court held that MCL 418.353(1)(a)(i); MSA 17.237(353)(1)(a)(i), a provision of the worker\u2019s disability act that conclusively presumes a wife to be dependent, was also held to be unconstitutional. Because of the Court\u2019s recent affirmation of <em>Day </em>and the fact that both decisions are based on the United States Supreme Court decision <em>Wengler v Druggists Mutual Ins Co, </em>446 US 142; 100 S <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Ct 1540; 64 L Ed 2d 107 (1980), plaintiff\u2019s request to reconsider <em>Day </em>is not meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Additionally, plaintiff argues that the Court of Appeals and the wcac\u2019s conclusions lack logic because if Mr. Weems had survived, Mrs. Weems would have been considered wholly dependent under MCL 418.353(1)(b); MSA 17.237(353)(l)(b). The relevant portion of the statute states: \"[e]xcept as to those conclusively presumed to be dependents, no person shall be deemed a dependent who receives less than 1/2 of his support from an injured employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">This argument is also without merit because the presumption of whole dependency when beneficiaries have received less than half their support from deceased employees is <em>not </em>included in \u00a7 321. The presumption is specifically set forth in \u00a7 353, but that section addresses the compensation the dependent of a disabled employee will receive, rather than the compensation the survivor of a deceased employee will receive. It appears that because the Legislature did not include the language from \u00a7353 in \u00a7321, it did not intend for the presumption to apply in situations arising under that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b871-11\"> [A]ny substantial and reasonably regular income from any source other than the decedent will in most states bar a finding of total disability.

Although we are not presented with such a situation, we note that in such a circumstance, e.g., in which the decedent is partially supporting children living in another household, that amount of the decedent\u2019s wages that went toward the support of the child or children would be subtracted from the decedent\u2019s contribution toward household support of the partially dependent spouse.

Therefore, a wholly dependent person would have been eligible for that amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\"> Neither dissent has cited any credible sources that would indicate such a construction was intended by the Legislature. Justice Cavanagh suggests that the following language from MCL 418.331(b); MSA 17.237(331)(b) dictates such a result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">If there is no one wholly dependent or if the death of all persons wholly dependent shall occur before all compensation is paid, and there is but 1 person partially dependent, such person shall be entitled to compensation according to the extent of his or her dependency ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">We see no support for the suggestion that the \"extent of his or her dependency\u201d manifests a legislative intent to factually determine that portion of the decedent\u2019s income that was used for the support of the dependent. Again, such a reading is inconsistent with the general purpose of the statute since the very determination whether a person is dependent hinges on the existence of a supplemental income. Indeed, hypothetically, a mere twenty percent of the decedent\u2019s income may have gone toward the support of a wholly dependent person. Yet, that person remains wholly dependent because the portion of the decedent\u2019s income used for the dependent\u2019s support is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Therefore, the language of the statute should not be construed in the manner proposed by the dissent because it produces an illogical result.

See MCL 418.321; MSA 17.237(321). However, the analogy falls apart. The difference is that the next sentence after the five-hundred-week limitation makes it clear that the limitation applies to wholly and partially dependent persons: \"If at the expiration of the 500-week period any such wholly or partially dependent person is less than 21 years of age . . . .\u201d No such correlation exists to indicate that the maximum and minimum rates directly limit a partially dependent person\u2019s benefit. To the contrary, the statute clearly indicates that a partially dependent person\u2019s benefit is a product of a wholly dependent person\u2019s benefit. This suggests that the maximum and minimum rates do apply to a partially dependent person\u2019s benefit but only to the extent that the benefit is a product of a wholly dependent person\u2019s benefit. Therefore, unlike the five-hundred-week limitation, no such reference is made to partially dependent persons beyond the clear requirement that benefits are derived from a percentage of a wholly dependent person\u2019s benefit.

Setting the statutory limits aside, assume that a deceased employee had after-tax earnings of $50,000. For policy reasons, the Legislature determined that the most any employer would be liable for in death benefits is eighty percent of the employee\u2019s earnings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Edward M. Welch describes this as the \"total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>benefit available.\u201d Welch, Worker\u2019s Compensation in Michigan: Law &amp; Practice (rev ed), \u00a7 15.21, p 15-20. He instructs that this total benefit amount is divided or prorated among the deceased employee\u2019s dependents, as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 321, 331, 335, and 341. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 15.22, p 15-21. If that employee left dependents who were wholly dependent, then \u00a7\u00a7 321 and 331 provide that the wholly dependent persons will divide between themselves a total amount of eighty percent of $50,000, or $40,000. By comparison, if the deceased employee left dependents who were partially dependent upon sixty percent of the deceased employee\u2019s salary for support, it is only logical then, that \u00a7 321 provides that the dependents should receive eighty percent of the extent of the earnings that they were dependent upon. In other words, they would divide eighty percent of sixty percent of $50,000, or $24,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Mr. Welch illustrates this idea with a hypothetical example of a deceased employee who contributed ten percent of his salary to his partially dependent mother. Welch, \u00a7 15.22, p 15-22. He states that the mother would then be entitled to ten percent of the total benefit available, i.e., ten percent of eighty percent of the deceased employee\u2019s net salary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Once we determine the amount that is logically expected, then we can determine whether the total amount of death benefits is within the statutory limits. The statutory limits reflect the Legislature\u2019s intent to limit the risks that both business and labor would bear. This purpose flows from the compromise design of the worker\u2019s compensation \"no-fault\u201d system.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In exchange for automatic benefits, employees gave up unlimited tort recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>ery.

It identifies those dependents of the deceased employee who also receive substantial and reasonably regular income from other sources.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The statute continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-10\"><em>[T]he weekly compensation to be paid shall be equal to </em>... . [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">This identifies the formula that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">The statutory formula is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-13\"><em>[Tjhe same proportion of the weekly payments for the bene\u00f1t of persons wholly dependent as 80% of the amount contributed by the employee to such partial dependents bears to the annual earnings of the deceased at the time of injury. </em>[Emphasis added.] _</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>In order to make it more readable, I will separate the factors of the formula. The statute identifies one factor as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-6\">\n<em>the annual earnings of the deceased at the time of injury.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">This simply means the annual earnings of the deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Another factor in the formula is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-10\">\n<em>the amount contributed by the employee to such partial dependents.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">I interpret this as designating the extent of the partial dependency,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in other words, that portion of the employee\u2019s salary that was used to support the dependents. This factor would require a factual determination by the trier of fact. The trier of fact could start with the amount of the deceased employee\u2019s salary and take proofs from the parties regarding the extent that the salary supported the partial dependents. In a given case, it may be easier for the trier of fact to start with such factors as the total household expenses<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and cost of living statistics, and then work backwards, by subtracting the income from the dependent person(s), to determine the amount of the deceased employee\u2019s salary necessary to maintain the standard of living for the dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">Returning to the formula, the critical language is:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>\n<em>the same proportion of the weekly payments for the benef\u00edt of persons wholly dependent as 80%.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">This language simply dictates that death benefits for partially dependent persons shall be determined by the same procedure that death benefits for wholly dependent persons are determined. Death benefits for wholly dependent persons are a direct function of the deceased employee\u2019s after-tax average weekly wage. Consequently, death benefits for partially dependent persons likewise should be a direct function of the deceased employee\u2019s after-tax average weekly wage. Further, the Legislature provided that the eighty percent limitation it provided in the wholly dependent person benefits computation also applies to death benefits for partially dependent persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Therefore, I conclude that the final factors in the statutory formula are the eighty percent multiplier and the deceased employee\u2019s after-tax average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Accordingly, I find that the statutory formula reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-9\">80%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-10\">X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-11\">amount contributed to partial dependent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-12\">annual earnings of the deceased</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-13\">X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-14\">employee\u2019s after-tax average weekly wage</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">This interpretation is derived directly from the statutory language and is consistent with the overall design. It will never result in an award to a partially dependent person that is greater than an award to a wholly dependent person, and it will almost always result in an award to a partially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>dependent person that is less than the corresponding award to a wholly dependent person.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Once the first step of determining the \u00a7 321 death benefits is completed, the second step in the analysis is to compare the resulting amount to the statutory limits. If the resulting amount is greater or lesser than the statutory limitations, <em>then, and only then, will the statutory limits be applied. </em>This interpretation preserves the clear language of \u00a7 356. \"In construing legislative intent it is mandatory, if possible, to construe an act as a whole, thus avoiding the construction of one provision in such a manner as to negate another.\u201d <em>Franges v General Motors Corp, </em>404 Mich 590, 611; 274 NW2d 392 (1979) (citation omitted). Section 356 provides that \"[t]he minimum weekly benefit for death under section 321 shall be 50% of the state average weekly wage as determined under section 355.\u201d MCL 418.356(2); MSA 17.237(356)(2). There is no qualifying language that provides that the \u00a7 356 minimum only applies to death benefits for wholly dependent persons, as the majority is injecting into \u00a7 356. Section 356 unambiguously provides a minimum for \u00a7 321 death benefits. Death benefits for partially dependent persons are \u00a7 321 death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Additionally, in 1980 PA 357, the Legislature combined the minimum benefit levels from various provisions into a single provision, \u00a7 356.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>process, the Legislature specifically \"eliminate[d] minimum weekly benefit rates <em>(except for death or partial disability) </em>. . . .\u201d Senate Analysis, SB 1044 (Second Analysis), January 7, 1981 (emphasis added). Sections 321 and 331 demonstrate that the Legislature clearly knew how to distinguish wholly dependent persons from partially dependent persons. If the Legislature had intended that \u00a7 356 not apply to death benefits for partially dependent persons, it would have said so. This interpretation is also in line with our earlier holding that under the pre-1980 \u00a7 351, part-time employees were entitled to the same statutory minimum compensation as full-time employees where the Legislature did not expressly provide a distinction. <em>Irvan v Bor</em>man\u2019s, <em>Inc, </em>412 Mich 496, 502; 315 NW2d 521 (1982). Therefore, the statutory minimum for death benefits applies to death benefits payable to partially dependent persons.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>By the same measure, \u00a7 355 provides that \"[t]he maximum weekly rate of compensation for injuries occurring within that year shall be established as 90% of the state average weekly wage . . . MCL 418.355(2); MSA 17.237(355)(2). This is a blanket limitation that applies to all benefits payable under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s injection of the dependent person\u2019s income into the formula. Riley, J., <em>ante </em>at 696. There is absolutely no language in \u00a7 321 that would even remotely suggest that the amount of the dependent person\u2019s income is a relevant factor in the statutory formula. The amount of the <em>dependent person\u2019s </em>income is irrelevant; the only amount that is relevant is the amount of the <em>deceased employee\u2019s </em>income that was provided to support the dependents. See Welch, \u00a7 15.22, p 15-22: \"the percentage of the dependent\u2019s income that came from the deceased worker is immaterial. The percentage of compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>sation is based on the portion of the worker\u2019s income that went to the dependent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Moreover, the majority has failed to recognize that a partially dependent person\u2019s financial status is not tied to a wholly dependent person\u2019s financial status. It is an independent and unrelated function. The' majority\u2019s premise that a partially dependent person is automatically entitled to less money seems to be based on an erroneous belief that a family\u2019s total household expenses are automatically lower when there are two incomes, as opposed to one. The sources of the incomes is irrelevant. The issue is how much income is required to maintain the household\u2019s standard of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Under the well-defined rules of statutory construction, we must read \u00a7 331(b), \"extent of their dependency,\u201d in conjunction with \u00a7 321, \"the amount contributed by the employee to such partial dependents.\u201d The majority\u2019s new formula totally negates the \"amount contributed\u201d language without explanation. The majority has created a new formula, which invents a new term designated as the total relevant family income, without even attempting to connect this concept to \u00a7 321. Riley, J., ante at 696. Section 321 provides the statutory formula, which expressly refers to an <em>amount contributed </em>by the deceased to the survivors. \"Amount\u201d means quantity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The ordinary dictionary definition of \"contribute\u201d is \"to give (money, . . .) along with others to a common supply, fund, etc.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \"Give\u201d in turn means \"to hand to someone\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or to transfer something.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>\"contribute\u201d requires an act of giving. Therefore, I interpret \u00a7321 as providing that the relevant quantity is the actual dollars that the deceased employee <em>gave </em>to the dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">The majority states that the claimant\u2019s partial dependency is the \"fraction of the total relevant annual family income contributed by the deceased employee\u2019s annual after-tax earnings.\u201d Riley, J., <em>ante </em>at 696. While this idea sounds plausible, it is not found in \u00a7 321. Section 321 refers to the fraction of the <em>deceased employee\u2019s income </em>that the employee <em>gave, </em>i.e., contributed, to the dependents \u2014not the fraction of the common pool that came from the deceased employee. These are two very different concepts that the majority.is interchanging without a single reference to \u00a7 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Additionally, I believe that the majority\u2019s formula will prove inflexible when faced with multiple households. In today\u2019s society there is a very real possibility that the deceased employee had been supporting multiple relatives in multiple households, and \u00a7 331(b) makes references to children of former spouses living with the former spouse or guardian, and to parents, siblings, grandparents, and grandchildren. Indeed, in the instant case, the plaintiff argued that part of her husband\u2019s salary was sent to the support of their grandchildren in another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">The majority has left unexplained which relevant family income will be counted. For instance, if the deceased employee had paid $100 per week for the support of a child to a former spouse, will the former spouse\u2019s income be a factor in the formula, even though the amount contributed to the child was clearly $100 per week? If the child is sixteen years or older,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the majority\u2019s approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>leaves the difficult specter of determining how much that child would have received if wholly dependent and what fraction of the former spouse\u2019s household income came from the child support. I believe that the sounder approach is to preserve the flexibility that the statute contains, which provides that for those not conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent, the question of dependency is one of fact, \u00a7 331(b)- In such a scenario, the child was clearly dependent on all the $100 per week that was contributed to the child. Therefore, depending on how the total death benefits package is limited by the statutory limits, the child should theoretically be entitled to eighty percent of the $100.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I do not believe that the majority\u2019s approach would yield such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We have previously stated that we are to construe the worker\u2019s compensation act in a manner that advances the Legislature\u2019s underlying policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">The Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act was designed to help relieve the social and economic difficulties faced by injured workers. As remedial legislation, it is liberally construed to grant rather than deny benefits. <em>[Bower v Whitehall Leather Co, </em>412 Mich 172, 191; 312 NW2d 640 (1981). Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">This same rationale should apply to the amount of those benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">However, the majority\u2019s creative use of the statutory maximum results in an artificial ceiling for death benefits below the statutory maximum in \u00a7 355. As explained above, I believe that partially dependent persons are entitled to eighty percent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the amount contributed by the deceased employee to them, with the total death benefits limited by the statutory maximum. In contrast, the majority limits the wage variable in its benefits formula to the statutory maximum, in spite of its admission that the statute is ambiguous. Contrary to the <em>Bower </em>spirit of liberally construing the remedial worker\u2019s compensation act in favor of granting benefits, the majority is inappropriately restricting the full availability of statutorily provided benefits. I believe that the statutory maximum and minimum should be applied <em>after </em>determining the applicable death benefits for partially dependent persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Therefore, in the instant case, we do not have any findings regarding what portion of Mr. Weems\u2019 salary was contributed to maintain the Weems household.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">I would remand this case for a factual determination of the amount of Mr. Weems\u2019 salary that was contributed to the support of Mrs. Weems.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>concur with the majority with respect to its conclusion that Mrs. Weems was only partially dependent upon Mr. Weems.
