We remand to the Court of Appeals to consider the issues raised by Harper-Grace that were not reached by the Court of Appeals, including the claim, not specifically addressed by the Court of Appeals, that the jury should not have been permitted to find that nurse negligence was a cause of Bahr\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Brian Bahr was admitted to Harper Hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>after apparently developing pneumonia. A laboratory test indicated a low blood-sodium level. Bodily fluids are normally one percent saline. A three percent intravenous saline solution was ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The three percent saline solution was administered intravenously beginning at 4:00 a.m. The last hourly check was sometime before 7:00 a.m. by a nurse who went off duty at 7:00 a.m. The nurse who came on duty at 7:00 a.m. occupied herself with examining patient records and other paperwork, and did not check on Bahr. At 7:47 a.m., his personal physician arrived and found him in cardiac arrest. Bahr was resuscitated, but, because his heart had stopped for between four and ten minutes, he sustained brain damage. He remained in a coma and died twenty-five days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Bahr had been under the care of his personal physician, Theodore Wizenberg, M.D., a resident, Pankaj Hukku, M.D., and an intern, Mark Huntoon, M.D. All three were involved in the medical decisions regarding Brian\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">On the fifth day of trial, Bahr and Wizenberg settled, and the trial continued against Harper-Grace respecting Bahr\u2019s claim that Brian\u2019s death was caused by malpractice of the resident, intern, and nurses.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals observed that there were \"three critical points from which the trier of fact could have determined, and in this case did determine, malpractice,\u201d and that the factual issues were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">1. Whether an arterial blood gas test should have been performed to determine if it was safe to give decedent fluids.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">2. Whether the 0.9 percent saline solution should have been increased to three percent in. view of the patient\u2019s rising sodium content.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>3. Whether, having ordered the three percent saline solution administered, the defendant\u2019s physicians should have known that danger of cardiac arrest was thereby increased and that the decedent\u2019s condition should have been monitored continuously, or at least more carefully.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The Court of Appeals said, and we agree, that the standard of care for general practitioners is that of the local community or similar communities,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and is nationwide for a specialist.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties agreed, and the Court of Appeals said, that interns and residents, as nonspecialists, are held to the standard of care of the local community or similar communities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">A majority of the Court of Appeals panel acknowledged that Dr. Neilson had testified that he was familiar with the standard of care for interns, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>residents, and nurses, but said that there was no testimony that he was familiar with the standard of care for interns, residents, and nurses in Detroit or similar communities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We reverse, and conclude that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in finding that Neilson was qualified to testify regarding the standard of care applicable to interns and residents in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Dr. Neilson, an internal medicine specialist \u00e1nd associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, testified that an arterial blood gas test should have been ordered by the resident and intern to determine the. pneumonia\u2019s effect on Bahr\u2019s blood-oxygen level, and that it was a violation of the standard of care for the resident or intern to fail to administer such a test before administering a three percent saline solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Dr. Neilson\u2019s testimony regarding the errors of omission and commission indicated what he thought were the departures by the resident and intern from the standard of care, and thus the standard of care applicable to their errors of omission and commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Dr. Neilson further testified that the resident and intern violated the standard of care in failing to provide for the monitoring of Bahr\u2019s reaction to the three percent saline solution either in an intensive care unit or, if a room in an intensive care unit was not available, by adding monitoring equipment in the private room in which he was placed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Dr. Neilson also testified that the nurses violated the standard of care in failing to monitor Bahr between the last check before 7:00 a.m. and 7:47 a.m. when his personal physician arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">A majority of the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">[T]here was no testimony that Dr. .Neilson was familiar with the requisite standard of care for interns, residents, and nurses in the Detroit community or similar communities. Although Dr. Neil-son testified that he was familiar with the stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>dard of care, he did not state what the applicable standard of care was. Dr. Neilson did not state whether interns, residents, and nurses were governed by a local, as opposed to a national, standard.<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">A party offering the testimony of an expert witness must demonstrate the witness\u2019 knowledge of the applicable standard of care.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> A trial judge\u2019s decision finding an expert witness to be qualified is reviewed for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> An expert familiar with the standard of care in a community may testify concerning the standard of care in that community, although he has not practiced in the community.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A . specialist may testify regarding the conduct of nonspecialists, if he has knowledge of the applicable standard of care.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Dr. Neilson testified to the judge\u2019s satisfaction regarding his qualifications and familiarity with the standard of care for residents and interns. He testified that he was familiar with the standard of care applicable to interns and residents on the basis of his own education and practice, and from teaching medicine to residents and interns._</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>We agree with the dissenting judge that Dr. Neilson\u2019s credentials \"were unassailable; his curriculum vitae showed practice experience in areas [Philadelphia] indisputably comparable to the Detroit metropolitan area. He was a teacher of interns and residents in comparable areas.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial judge did not abuse her discretion in finding that Dr. Neilson was qualified to testify regarding the standard of care applicable to residents and interns.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">We also agree with the dissenting judge that if there was a critical deficiency regarding the voir dire of Dr. Neilson, it should have been brought to the attention of the judge, and that it appeared that such a \"deficiency would have been cured by further direct exploration, because the court was familiar with the applicable standards and, indeed, instructed the jury correctly.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASl6\">Harper-Grace\u2019s lawyer objected to the question what a reasonable and prudent physician or intern or resident would do under the circumstances on the general basis that Dr. Neilson\u2019s knowledge of the standard of care had not been shown. The objection was overruled, and Neilson testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>he was familiar with the standard of care for interns and residents.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Harper-Grace\u2019s lawyer declined an opportunity for voir dire concerning Dr. Neilson\u2019s qualifications.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Other objections did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>concern Dr. Neilson\u2019s qualifications respecting residents or interns.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Harper-Grace did not complain, before Neilson testified about the errors of omission and commission, that there had been no reference to the standard of care for residents and interns in Detroit or similar communities. Nor did it so particularize in its motion for a directed verdict or its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Nor, when qualifying its expert witness<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> regarding the standard of care applicable to residents and interns, did Harper-Grace\u2019s lawyer or its expert witness particularize whether he was testifying about a standard of care for residents and interns in Detroit or similar communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">We conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the judgment entered for Bahr on the .basis that Dr. Neilson had not been qualified to testify concerning the standard of care applicable to residents and interns in Detroit and similar communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Harper-Grace contends that Dr. Neilson, at most, established a prima facie case that the treatment departed from the standard of care applicable to a specialist. Harper-Grace contends that Neilson did not distinguish between a physician or specialist on the one hand, and residents and interns on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Harper-Grace stresses that during the voir dire, Bahr\u2019s lawyer inquired whether there was a differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ence in the way internal medicine is practiced according to the standard of care depending on geographic location, to which Dr. Neilson responded \"within your hypothetical question, not really.\u201d Harper-Grace contends that Dr. Neilson was thus being qualified regarding the standard of c\u00e1re applicable to specialists and not residents and interns.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\">The inference drawn on appeal by Harper-Grace should have been drawn and articulated on the record before the judge ruled shortly thereafter that Dr. Neilson was qualified concerning the standard of care applicable to residents and interns, and may hot be urged for the first time long after Dr. Neilson had concluded his testimony. Such an inference is belied by Dr. Neilson\u2019s particularized testimony.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> He testified specifically about the errors of omission and commission of the resident and intern. There was no objection to Dr. Neilson\u2019s failure to distinguish more specifically during his testimony. We therefore conclude that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in permitting Dr. Neilson to testify concerning the standard of care applicable to residents and interns in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The Court of Appeals also erred in reversing on the basis of the inadmissible hearsay testimony concerning Dr. Gilroy, a neurologist who examined Bahr after the cardiac arrest. Dr. Gilroy is said to have testified only with respect to what Drs. Clark and Neilson said, namely, that Bahr should have been monitored electronically in a private room, preferably in an intensive care unit. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>admission of the hearsay statement was not prejudicial error.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Reversed and remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-6\">Brickley, C.J., and Cavanagh, Boyle, Riley, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with'LEViN, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b328-7\">Weaver, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\"> 198 Mich App 31, 35; 497 NW2d 526 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-11\"> <em>Id. </em>at 33-34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b320-8\"> id at 39.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\"><em> Fortner </em>v <em>Koch, </em>272 Mich 273, 281; 261 NW 762 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Subject to subsection (2), in an action alleging malpractice, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that in light of the state of the art existing at the time of the alleged malpractice:</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">(a) The defendant, if a general practitioner, failed to provide the plaintiff the recognized standard of acceptable professional practice or care in the community in which the defendant practices or in a similar community, and that as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">(b) The defendant, if a specialist, failed to provide the recognized standard of practice or care within that specialty as reasonably applied in light of the facilities available in the community or other facilities reasonably available under the circumstances, and as a proximate result of the defendant failing to provide that standard, the plaintiff suffered an injury.

Crane\u2019s testimony was directed to Wizenberg\u2019s treatment decisions. He also criticized the resident\u2019s and intern\u2019s treatment. Harper-Grace waived any objection to the foundation for Crane\u2019s testimony when it failed to object in that regard at the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\"> Dr. Neilson used the pronoun \"they\u201d in describing the persons who committed the acts of omission and commission. \"They\u201d did not measure Bahr\u2019s blood gas to determine how serious the pneumonia was, and, thus, \"they\u201d had no way of knowing how dangerous it was to add fluid or sodium. \"They did not evaluate that risk at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">Neilson was asked to whom he was referring when he said \"they.\u201d He responded: \"The doctors.\u201d He was asked: \"Which doctors?\u201d He responded: \"The house officers who were taking care of the patient.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>He was asked: \"And that\u2019s the intern and resident?\u201d He responded: \"That\u2019s correct.\u201d He continued that they should have administered an arterial blood gas test because that was the only way of knowing whether the patient could tolerate what he was going to be exposed to, and the risk of \"drown[ing].\u201d He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">If you have inflammation in the lungs and you\u2019re given fluid most of that fluid will go to the lung and make it more difficult to breathe and you have to have some way of [assessing] whether you can tolerate the risk or whether the ri'sk is worth taking in the first place.
