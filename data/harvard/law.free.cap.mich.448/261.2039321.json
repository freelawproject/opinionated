With respect to the first claim of prosecutorial misconduct, we must decide whether use of and reference to the terms \"Arab,\u201d \"Arab connection,\u201d and \"Iraqi\u201d at a trial conducted during the Per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>sian Gulf War deprived defendant of a fair trial. Reviewing the statements in context, including the other evidence admitted at trial, we conclude that the statements were innocuous, not intended to inflame the jury, and not of a degree that prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Second, we must decide whether the prosecutor improperly bolstered the credibility of his witnesses by eliciting their promises to give truthful testimony or face prosecution and life imprison-, ment. We conclude that this line of questioning was relevant and did not result in any improper bolstering of prosecution witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Third, we must decide whether the prosecutor appealed to the fears and prejudices of the jury by allegedly injecting a civic duty argument, expressing a personal opinion about defendant\u2019s guilt, and using denigrating terms to describe defendant. Again, we find no error requiring reversal. Reviewing the argument in its entirety, we are persuaded that it was based on evidence produced at trial, in part responding to argument by defense counsel, and accordingly did not appeal to the fears and prejudices of the jury. We also conclude that the claimed use of denigrating terms did not result in error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Finally, turning to the alleged evidentiary error, we must determine whether the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting evidence that prosecution witness Salwan Asker was beaten while defendant was present in another room. We conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting this evidence because it was relevant to Asker\u2019s motivation for cooperating with the government. In any event, admission of this evidence was harmless in light of other evidence demonstrating defendant\u2019s participation in this conspiracy. Thus, we are persuaded that defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>not deprived of a fair trial. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Defendant Saad Bahoda was indicted by a grand jury for conspiracy to possess with intent to deliver and to deliver in excess of 650 grams of cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The indictment alleged a conspiracy beginning in January of 1985 and continuing until August, 1989. While nine individuals were named in the indictment, only defendant Bahoda and codefendant Basam Jarges were prosecuted in the instant trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The jury trial commenced on February 4, 1991, before Oakland Circuit Court Judge Richard D. Kuhn. On February 12, 1991, the jury found defendant guilty as charged. He was later sentenced to mandatory life in prison without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Court of Appeals. He claimed that he was denied a fair trial because of references to his Arabic ethnicity during the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and during the questioning of prosecution witnesses Rene Arias, Wissam Abood, Salwan Asker, and Lawrence Awdishi Similarly, defendant claimed that the prosecutor improperly bolstered the credibility of two prosecution witnesses by eliciting testimony of an agreement that promised to send them to prison for life if they lied at trial. Likewise, defendant claimed error requiring reversal because the prosecutor resorted to a civic duty argument, improperly embellished the strength of his case to the effect that drug cases do not get any better than the instant case, and improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>denigrated defendant. Finally, defendant maintained that it was irrelevant and prejudicial to admit evidence that prosecution witness Salwan Asker was beaten by Emanual Newman, after being driven to this location by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The Court of Appeals agreed with defendant, finding that \"defendant was denied a fair trial, even if he did not object to every single instance of misconduct now complained of, because the cumulative prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s comments could not have been cured by an instruction.\u201d 202 Mich App 214, 216; 508 NW2d 170 (1993).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court also found error requiring reversal in the admission of evidence regarding defendant\u2019s participation in the beating of Salwan Asker because it tended to show that defendant was a bad person who deserved conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">We granted leave to appeal on May 6, 1994.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">We turn first to whether defendant was denied a fair trial by the use of Arabic and Iraqi references. Defendant reminds us that this jury trial occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>during the third and fourth weeks of the Persian Gulf War and is relevant because defendant and many of the alleged coconspirators are Chaldean Iraqis.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">As with all forms of prosecutorial misconduct, this Court abhors the injection of racial or ethnic remarks into any trial because it may arouse the prejudice of jurors against a defendant and, hence, lead to a decision based on prejudice rather than on the guilt or innocence of the accused.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, this Court is not hesitant to reverse where potentially inflammatory references are intentionally injected, with no apparent justification except to arouse prejudice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In reviewing such claims, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Court examines the remarks in context to determine whether they denied defendant a fair trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>People v Allen, </em>351 Mich 535; 88 NW2d 433 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"AO-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Against this backdrop, we turn to defendant\u2019s specific claims of misconduct. At trial, several references were made to Arabic ethnicity,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the first occurring during the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement. In discussing the expected testimony of prosecution witness Salwan Asker, the prosecutor explained that Asker chose to cooperate with the government after he was arrested on immigration charges. In doing so, the prosecutor noted that \"Mr. Asker will tell you he\u2019s an Iraqi native, as are many people in this crowd.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defense counsel did not object, and thus no limiting instruction was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">After opening statements, the prosecutor called Rene Arias. Arias informed the jury that he was a Cuban native who was testifying for the government under a plea arrangement subjecting him to fifteen years in prison rather than mandatory life. When referring to members of the drug conspiracy, Arias often referred to them either using ethnic or racial references. Specifically, Arias referred to one member as the \"Argentina\u201d or \"Argentine,\u201d to others as the \"Columbians [sic],\u201d to one man as \"black,\u201d and to defendant, Ray Akrawi, and Atheer Gappi as the \"Arabs\u201d or the \"Arab connection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Reacting to Arias\u2019 comments regarding ethnicity, the prosecutor occasionally used the same term to phrase a follow-up question. Generally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>however, defense attorneys objected to these Arabic references, resulting either in a rephrasing of the question<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or simply being sustained by the trial judge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After a few references to Arabic ethnicity, both the prosecutor and the trial judge admonished Arias. No such objection or admonishment was offered with respect to any other nationality, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On cross-examination, <em>defense counsel </em>immediately questioned Arias regarding his Cuban heritage and his arrival in this country by means of the Mariel boat lift. Defense counsel also questioned Arias regarding his immigration status and his possible deportation. At one point, Arias became frustrated with questions about his ethnicity and responded: \u201dYou told me before \u2014 you ask me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u2014you ask me before not to talk about Arabs, now you\u2019re talking about M[a]rielitas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On redirect examination, more references emerged regarding Arabs. After one reference of note,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> an objection ensued, followed by a discussion in the presence of the jury regarding the use of the term \"Arabs.\u201d It was observed that the United States was fighting a war in the Middle East, not Colombia, and reference to the term \"Arab\u201d was not appropriate. After ordering the prosecutor to rephrase the question, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\"><em>Q. </em>Talk about the Columbians and everybody all you want, but we can\u2019t mention that \"a\u201d word, do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\"><em>A. </em>I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\"><em>Q. </em>Okay. You were mad at the Columbians, and you were also mad at somebody else. Don\u2019t tell us their nationality or group, but why were you [mad] at them?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Subsequently, the prosecutor elicited references to the Iraqi nationality of several prosecution witnesses, including Wissam Abood, Salwan Asker, and Lawrence Awdish. In doing so, the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>also inquired of these witnesses whether Detroit had a large Chaldean population. They answered in the affirmative, indicating that many Chaldeans left Iraq to avoid discrimination and religious persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">While it was unfortunate that this trial occurred during the Persian Gulf War, our review of the comments persuade us that they did not prejudice defendant by causing the jury to convict because of prejudice rather than the evidence. Unlike <em>Cluett v Rosenthal, </em>100 Mich 193, 200; 58 NW 1009 (1894), we do not find a \"studied purpose to arouse the prejudice of the jury . . . .\u201d In <em>Rosenthal, </em>the comments were clearly intentional and designed to arouse prejudice against Jewish defendants. The plaintiff\u2019s. counsel referred to the defendants as \"[tjhese men of Jerusalem,\u201d suggesting that the defendants, like all Jews, were taking advantage of the plaintiff, and, in doing so, caricatured the speech and gestures of Jews. <em>Id. </em>at 199. Similarly, in <em>Nemet v Friedland, </em>273 Mich 692, 696; 263 NW 889 (1935), this Court found error requiring reversal where the plaintiff\u2019s counsel commented that \"I think this man, like the Jew Shylock, was after the last pound of flesh and last drop of blood.\u201d Finally, in <em>Solomon v Stewart, </em>184 Mich 506, 511; 151 NW 716 (1915), defense counsel consistently made arguments that the transaction at issue was a \"Jew deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">We simply do not have the deliberate arousal of prejudice in this instance as was the case in <em>Rosenthal, Friedland, </em>and <em>Stewart. </em>We find this situation more akin to the facts in <em>People v Marji, </em>180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Mich App 525, 538-541; 447 NW2d 835 (1989),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and <em>George v Travelers Indemnity Co, </em>81 Mich App 106, 114-116; 265 NW2d 59 (1978).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In those cases, the questioning was improper and probably irrelevant, but did not rise to the level of error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In the instant case, most of the comments were improper and possibly irrelevant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nonetheless, we find the comments, viewed in context, to be innocuous, unintended, and not of a degree that prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On these facts, where most of the prosecution witnesses were of Arab descent, we find it difficult to believe that the prosecutor deliberately injected ethnicity in an attempt to convince the jury to convict on the basis of prejudice or that the mere reference to Arabic ethnicity deprived defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Simply because these references occurred during the Persian Gulf War does not mean that reversal is required. It must be remembered that we were fighting with, as well as against, those of Arabic heritage during the Persian Gulf War. Hence, prejudice by use of Arabic ethnicity does not automatically follow. In this case, we are persuaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>that these comments were not deliberately injected by the prosecutor, but rather were responses by a witness who, because of his limited command of the English language, used this term to distinguish one group of purchasers from another. In this context, where references were frequently followed by admonishments by the prosecutor and trial judge, we are convinced that defendant received a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Finally, the prosecutor\u2019s comment during his opening statement and the questioning of the ethnic heritage of various witnesses probably were improper. However, given that the names of these witnesses were obviously Arabic in origin and the defense theory was that many of these witnesses faced deportation if they did not seek a plea, we cannot find error requiring reversal. Read in its entirety, along with the other evidence against defendant,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we conclude at this point that defendant was not denied a fair trial because of the prosecutor\u2019s references to ethnicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Defendant\u2019s second claim of prosecutorial misconduct alleges improper bolstering of prosecution witnesses. The prosecutor is said to have improperly elicited the substance of either a plea arrangement<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or other reward for testifying, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\"use immunity,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in exchange for telling the truth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>at defendant\u2019s trial. The prosecutor then reminded the jury of these agreements during closing argument.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A detective also testified concerning general police procedures that help verify statements made by informants. However, in doing so, he did not refer specifically to any government witness in this case.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Included in the list of improper prosecutorial commentary or questioning is the maxim that the prosecutor cannot vouch for the credibility of his witnesses to the effect that he has some special knowledge concerning a witness\u2019 truthfulness.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>People v Enos, </em>168 Mich App 490, 492; 425 NW2d 104 (1988). While this is generally improper, the simple</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbX\">reference to a plea agreement containing a promise of truthfulness is in <em>itself </em>[not] grounds for reversal. A more accurate statement of the law appears to be that, although such agreements should be admitted with great caution, admissibility of such an agreement is not necessarily error unless it is used by the prosecution to suggest that the government had some special knowledge, not known to the jury, that the witness was testifying truthfully.<footnotemark>[23]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Generally, \"[b]y calling a witness who testifies pursuant to an agreement requiring him to testify truthfully, the Government does not insinuate possession of information not heard by the jury and the prosecutor cannot be taken as having expressed his personal opinion on a witness\u2019 veracity.\u201d <em>United States v </em>Creamer, 555 F2d 612, 617-618 (CA 7, 1977).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Reviewing the record in this light, we are per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>suaded that the comments and questions did not rise to the level of error requiring reversal. The questioning, as it relates to the entire trial,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> was proper and did not convey a message to the jury that the prosecutor had some special knowledge or facts indicating the witness\u2019 truthfulness.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>People v Williams, </em>123 Mich App 752, 755-756; 333 NW2d 577 (1983).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Although defendant questions whether the contents of the plea arrangement or rewards were admissible absent a request by the defense,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> given the entire circumstances of this case, including cross-examination of defense attorneys, \"we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>say that they were fatally prejudicial or entirely without provocation.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Allen, supra </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">With respect to witness Hadair, aside from some initial questioning concerning the basics of the plea arrangement,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> which defense counsel immediately began questioning about on cross-examination, the alleged bolstering occurred on redirect examination.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> There, the prosecutor was attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ing to respond to impeachment questioning regarding a prior hearing at which Hadair named several coconspirators but failed to mention any dealings or discussions with defendant. While proper impeachment does not invite improper bolstering, after reviewing it in context, and given its brevity, we are persuaded that it did not convey any special knowledge.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We construe this questioning simply as an attempt to rehabilitate a prosecution witness.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Likewise, the prosecutor\u2019s redirect examination of Asker was brief and in response to vigorous cross-examination that had the effect of showing that Asker was lying to keep himself from being deported or going to prison, or because of his drug addiction.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> On the basis of these facts, we do not deem this questioning error requiring reversal because the questioning was brief, was on redirect examination,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and was in response to questioning that arguably required some attempt at rehabilita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Moreover, in this case, the questioning was objected to and was allowed to stand, with the judge admonishing the prosecutor to move on to a different line of questioning. Viewed in its entirety, we conclude that it was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We also find the comments during closing argument brief and not improper bolstering of prosecution witnesses. There was no objection to the closing argument. Read in their entirety, the comments were fair and distinguishable from conduct found to require reversal in other cases.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Assuming there was some impropriety in this argument, the judge\u2019s instruction that arguments of attorneys are not evidence dispelled any prejudice.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Finally, we are persuaded that the testimony of Agent Palombella likewise did not result in improper bolstering. While he testified regarding police procedures used to verify the events occurring in any criminal organization, he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>relate it specifically to this case. Unlike <em>People v Smith,</em><footnotemark><em>39</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nothing in his testimony indicated that he believed the prosecution witnesses testified truthfully or that the stories of specific witnesses were verified. Finally, any impermissible inference flowing from his testimony did not amount to error requiring reversal in this six-day jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Defendant\u2019s final claim of prosecutorial misconduct asserts prejudicial error stemming from the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. Defendant maintains the prosecutor resorted to a \"civic duty\u201d argument about the \"drug problem\u201d in society, thus appealing to the fears and prejudices of jury members. He also contends that the prosecutor expressed personal opinions about defendant\u2019s guilt by improperly referring to the strength of his case and denigrating defendant on evidence not produced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Generally, \"[p]rosecutors are accorded great latitude regarding their arguments and conduct.\u201d <em>People v Rohn, </em>98 Mich App 593, 596; 296 NW2d 315 (1980), citing <em>People v Duncan, </em>402 Mich 1; 260 NW2d 58 (1977). They are \"free, to argue the evidence and all reasonable inferences from the evidence as it relates to [their] theory of the case.\u201d <em>People v Gonzalez, </em>178 Mich App 526, 535; 444 NW2d 228 (1989). See also <em>People v Bigge, </em>297 Mich 58, 68; 297 NW 70 (1941). Nevertheless, prosecutors should not resort to civic duty arguments that appeal to the fears and prejudices of jury members<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> or express their personal opinions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>of a defendant\u2019s guilt,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and must refrain from denigrating a defendant with intemperate and prejudicial remarks.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Such comments during closing argument will be reviewed in context to determine whether they constitute error requiring reversal.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">A. CIVIC DUTY</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Specifically, defendant claims that the prosecutor made an improper civic duty argument to the jury by referring to the size of the drug problem,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> the pervasive nature of this drug organization,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> the amount and value of the drugs seized during the arrest,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and the unique locations at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>which some of these drug transactions occurred.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">While there are numerous claims of misconduct, we are persuaded that all these references constituted permissible commentary on evidence admitted at trial. References to the size of the drug organization, the amount and value of the drugs, and locations at which some of these transactions occurred were all \"reasonable inferences from the evidence as it relates to his theory of the case.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, supra </em>at 535. Simply because some drug deals occurred at a public pool or bakery, i.e., evidence admitted at trial, does not make commentary about it impermissible. On these facts, we are persuaded that the prosecutor was not \"injecting issues broader than the guilt or innocence of the accused under the controlling law,\u201d but was rather asking the jury to convict on the basis of evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>produced at trial. Accordingly, we do not discern any improper attempt to appeal to the fears and prejudices of jury members.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Moreover, we note that defense counsel failed to object.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We believe that if defense counsel perceived any impropriety, he should have objected and sought an appropriate instruction. In any event, we agree that the conduct certainly did not rise to the level of error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">B. PERSONAL OPINIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Defendant also claims that the prosecutor committed prejudicial error by injecting personal opinion regarding the strength of his case.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>these isolated comments in context, we find no error requiring reversal.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">We conclude that these comments were intended to rebut the defense theory that this was a \"bought\u201d case, i.e., that government witnesses were granted some type of favor in exchange for their testimony against defendant, or that the government witnesses were simply liars. While using the prestige of the prosecutor\u2019s office to inject personal opinion is improper,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> the rebuttal nature of these comments did not amount to error requiring reversal.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> There was a substantial amount of evidence against defendant. The prosecutor simply commented on the effect and strength of this evidence, albeit some of the com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>merits may have been ill-advised. On the record before us, we do not believe the jury suspended its power of judgment in favor of the \"wisdom\u201d or \"belief \u201d of the prosecutor\u2019s office.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In the instant case, the prosecutor was merely responding to defense claims that the prosecutor had presented a bought case. These comments were so innocuous that it did not cause a timely objection.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Moreover, the evidence presented was not so even-sided that it could be deemed a \"credibility contest.\u201d Indeed, the defendant did not even present a case. We are persuaded that, even if the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper, they did not rise to the level of error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"AhW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>C. DENIGRATING DEFENDANT</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Following the contention that the prosecutor improperly expressed personal opinions about defendant\u2019s guilt is the claim that the prosecutor improperly denigrated defendant. Defendant contends that the prosecutor referred to defendant and his associates as \"thieves, like the thieves and the sharks that they are,\u201d when in fact there were no allegations or evidence of theft. See, e.g., <em>People v Fredericks, 125 </em>Mich App 114, 118; 335 NW2d 919 (1983). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Defendant takes the comment out of context. The prosecutor was explaining what occurred after the organization\u2019s leader died.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Indeed, the comment was directed at members of the organization generally, not simply defendant. Given the isolated nature of this comment in this lengthy record and its explanatory purpose, we certainly would not find error requiring reversal, and we so hold.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Finally, we turn to the question whether the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting evidence regarding defendant\u2019s involvement in the beating of prosecution witness Salwan Asker.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Generally, evidence that is relevant will be ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>missible. MRE 401 defines relevant evidence as evidence that has \"any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d However, relevant evidence \"may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d MRE 403. The trial judge in the present case followed this procedure when deciding to admit this evidence on the basis that Asker\u2019s motivation for testifying was at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">When reviewing evidentiary decisions under MRE 401 and 403, our review is limited to whether the decision was an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> In doing so, we are mindful that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">close questions arising from the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion on matters concerning the admission of evidence do not call for appellate reversal because the reviewing justices would have ruled differently. Reversal is warranted only if the resolution of the question by the trial court amounted to an abuse of discretion. The decision upon a close evidentiary question by definition ordinarily cannot be an abuse of discretion. <em>[People v Golochowicz, </em>413 Mich 298, 322; 319 NW2d 518 (1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>On the record before us, we do not discern such an abuse of discretion. While Asker\u2019s beating occurred after the conspiracy charged in the indictment, the evidence was relevant to demonstrate Asker\u2019s motivation for testifying and cooperating with the authorities.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> We are persuaded, as was the trial judge, that the credibility of Mr. Asker, a key prosecution witness, was clearly at issue in this case. This evidence was probative of Salwan Asker\u2019s explanation for cooperating with the authorities, while also touching on his credibility. Indeed, it directly refuted the defense inference that Asker was lying and only testifying in order to avoid prosecution, deportation, or simply to get help with his drug addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">While it may be argued that the evidence portrayed defendant as a \"bad person\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> even though defendant did not participate in the beating,<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>given the relevancy of the testimony, the trial judge\u2019s contemporaneous assessment of its effect on the jury, and defendant\u2019s failure to request a limiting instruction,<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> we are persuaded that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the testimony. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit explained in <em>United States v </em>Long, 574 F2d 761, 767 (CA 3, 1978): \"If judicial self-restraint is ever desirable, it is when a Rule 403 analysis of a trial court is reviewed by an appellate tribunal.\u201d We follow this wisdom, realizing that \"Rule 403 determinations are best left to a contemporaneous assessment of the presentation, credibility, and effect of testimony\u201d by the trial judge. <em>People v VanderVliet, </em>444 Mich 52, 81; 508 NW2d 114 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Assuming, however, that admission of the testimony was error, we deem it harmless in light of other evidence demonstrating defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Several witnesses testified about defendant\u2019s direct involvement in this drug conspiracy, including coconspirators Asker, Arias, Hadair, Abood, and Awdish. On one occa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>sion, Special Agent James Helverson observed a narcotics transaction between Larry Awdish and defendant. Moreover, there was evidence from several witnesses that defendant possessed a beeper for use in drug transactions. There was also evidence that defendant\u2019s car contained a secret compartment used for hiding narcotics or a small gun. Finally, there was evidence that defendant fled after the indictment was issued, at which time he traveled under an assumed name and changed his physical appearance. Given the totality of this evidence, we find that any error in admitting Asker\u2019s testimony regarding the beating was harmless.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Our review of the three claims of prosecutorial misconduct persuade us that none of the prosecutor\u2019s statements or actions rose to the level of error requiring reversal.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> This was a high stakes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>hard fought case, vigorously contested by able advocates. Given that reality, it is inevitable that the record will not be pristine. It does not follow that the trial was not fair.

The fact that a statement has been reversible error in one case does not automatically mean that a similar remark is reversible error in another case. Each case must be considered on its own facts. For example, a remark found to constitute reversible error because it was not supported by the evidence would <em>not </em>be reversible error in a case where it was supported by the evidence.

On cross-examination, Asker said that he held defendant responsible for his beating.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\"> MRE 105 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">When evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">In this case, the evidence was admissible to show Asker\u2019s motivation for testifying and to rebut the inference that he was lying for his own personal benefit. However, it was not admissible as bad character evidence. Realizing this, defense counsel should have sought a limiting instruction, but did not. In this situation, we cannot find error requiring reversal. See <em>People v VanderVliet, </em>444 Mich 52, 75; 508 NW2d 114 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\"> We also note that there was a videotape of a coconspirator accepting a package of cocaine. Although defendant was not depicted in the video, it is still admissible against defendant because he was charged with conspiracy. When proof of an agreement is shown, other evidence against a coconspirator becomes evidence against defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b474-8\"> Defendant also argues that it was error requiring reversal to admit the hex-shaped stick used in the beating. Even if this was error, we likewise find it harmless in light of the other evidence admitted against defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\"> The Court of Appeals also held that the cumulative effect of errors denied defendant a fair trial. We disagree. In making this determination, only actual errors are aggregated to determine their cumulative effect. <em>United States v Rivera, </em>900 F2d 1462, 1471 (CA 10, 1990) (en banc) (\"Impact alone, not traceable to error, cannot form the basis for reversal\u201d). In this case, the only conduct possibly found to be improper was the ethnicity references and the prosecutor\u2019s isolated injection of personal opinion in closing argument and the arguable denigration of defendant. We found no impropriety regarding claims of improper bolstering, use of a civic duty argument, or with the admission of testimony with respect to the beating of Salwan Asker. Hence, the latter will not be considered in the cumulative-error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">The three actual errors all were based on claims of prosecutorial misconduct. Although the cumulative effect of these types of errors is not subject to any fixed considerations, relevant factors include the extent to which the remarks may have misled the jury and prejudiced defendant, whether they were isolated or extensive, whether they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>were deliberately or accidentally injected, and the strength of other evidence against defendant. <em>Davis v Zant, </em>36 F3d 1538, 1549 (CA 11, 1994). Reviewed in this light, we are not persuaded that the cumulative effect of these errors in this six-day jury trial warrants a new trial. Although frequent, the ethnicity references were not deliberately injected, did not mislead the jury, and, in the context of other evidence, did not prejudice defendant. The personal opinions and claims of denigration were isolated and, combined with the ethnic references, do not rise to the level of error requiring reversal.

There should be zero tolerance of ethnic references, and a heavy burden should be imposed on the prosecutor to justify any such reference. If, as here, the prosecutor fails to sustain such burden, a new trial should be ordered without requiring the defendant to show prejudice. Such references without justification should be regarded as so offensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process that reversal and remand for a new trial should ordinarily follow as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">After every wave of immigration, the Irish to the east coast, the Germans to the Midwest, the Jews and Italians, demagogues \u2014 politicians, religious and political \u2014 and some prosecutors have sought to exploit prejudice against newcomers.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Similar waves of immigration of African Americans from the South during and following World War II, of Vietnamese and Koreans in more recent years, and of Hispanics to the southwest, have been exploited by the unprincipled. Now, it is the immigration of Iraqis, Chaldeans, Muslims, and other Arabs to Dearborn and other Michigan cities where some of the largest American Arabic communities have formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">One need not have lived in Boston in the late nineteenth century, or in Minnesota during World War I, or in the major cities where Jewish and Italian immigrants congregated, to know that there was prejudice against the Irish, Germans, Jews and Italians. One does not have to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Korean or Vietnamese to know about the prejudice against them, or an African American to know about the prejudice against them, or an Iraqi, Chaldean, Muslim or Arab to understand that there is prejudice against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">That Bahoda was an Iraqi was irrelevant and immaterial. When it was first mentioned, his lawyer remained silent. But as the references to ethnicity became more frequent, he objected. The prosecutor defended the references to Bahoda\u2019s ethnicity. Then, instead of adhering to the court\u2019s rulings barring such references, as he said he would, he unabashedly returned to the ethnic theme.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The American Bar Association Standards provide respecting the prosecution function:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">(a) The prosecutor may argue all reasonable inferences from evidence in the record.

The charges were part of a crackdown against the remnants of the Kalasho drug dealing organization in the Detroit metropolitan area. The members of the Kalasho organization were alleged to have conspired to buy and sell large quantities of cocaine, between January, 1985, and August, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">A number of drug dealers testified pursuant to agreements with the prosecutor for charge and sentence concessions.

Asker said that he and Bahoda delivered drugs on a number of occasions. Asker discussed a road trip with Bahoda to collect money owed to the drug organization. Asker also provided, over objection, testimony regarding an incident during which Bahoda drove him to meet another drug dealer, Emanuel Newman. Newman beat Asker with a stick containing numerous hex-head screws while Bahoda was in an adjacent room.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Bahoda then drove Asker to the home of Asker\u2019s uncle.

Awdish and Karim communicated with Bahoda to purchase one-eighth of a kilo of cocaine (approximately four and one-half ounces) in Southfield. At the agreed location, Karim entered another automobile, paid $3,000 and received an aluminum foil ball containing cocaine from Bahoda.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>In his closing argument, the prosecutor reviewed the testimony of the witnesses and the evidence.

The majority concludes, \"This was a high stakes, hard fought case, vigorously contested by able advocates. Given that reality, it is inevitable that the record will not be pristine. It does not follow that the trial was not fair.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The majority touches upon but does not engage in harmless-error analysis. Nor does the majority consider the cumulative prejudicial effect of what occurred at the trial.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The majority separately addresses each of Bahoda\u2019s claims, and avoids considering the larger, more fundamental question whether Bahoda received a fair trial.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s improper references to Bahoda\u2019s Arab ethnicity are most objectionable. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>prosecutor during his opening statement referred to the Iraqi background of one of the witnesses, as well as Iraqi spectators; permitted references to, and himself referred to, the \"Arab connection\u201d; questioned witnesses concerning their Chaldean background and the Chaldean community; and referred to \"the Arabs\u201d in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">While the majority expresses disapproval of the ethnic references,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and states that most of the comments were \"improper and possibly irrelevant,\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the majority nevertheless concludes that the comments \"did not prejudice defendant by causing the jury to convict because of prejudice rather than the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The majority ignores that the trial occurred during this country\u2019s involvement in the Gulf War.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The majority also concludes that the comments were not deliberately injected into the proceedings by the prosecution. While I agree that a number of the references to Arabs may not have been deliberate, the prosecutor deliberately \u2014 long after he agreed to refrain from commenting on ethnicity\u2014 asked witnesses their birthplaces and inquired concerning the nature and size of the Chaldean community in the Detroit area.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>When the prosecution interjects issues beyond the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial may be jeopardized.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This is particularly true of ethnic allusions.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The prosecutor erred when he bolstered the testimony of Asker<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and Haidar.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Both witnesses were testifying pursuant to charge and sentence plea agreements that had been arranged with the prosecution. The prosecutor elicited testimony on redirect examination that each witness had agreed to testify truthfully and would be sent to prison for life if he lied.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The prosecutor elicited testimony from a police investigator that he had verified the stories of both witnesses. The Court of Appeals found that this testimony suggested to the jury that the prosecutor had special knowledge of the truth of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Although a prosecutor has a duty to disclose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>terms of a plea agreement,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> he may not vouch for the credibility of a witness.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Asker was asked on redirect examination, \"if you lie to this Jury what happens?\u201d He responded, \"I go to jail for life, <em>I have been promised by you.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>41</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) Asker thus made explicit what was implicit in the prosecutor\u2019s belaboring that the charge and sentence concessions were in exchange for truthful testimony.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">It is well established that a lawyer trying a case for a party may not testify at the trial, and that, again, the prosecutor may not personally vouch for the truth of the testimony he offers. The prosecutor in this case crossed both lines. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">A strong case can be made for excluding a plea agreement promise of truthfulness. The witness, who may otherwise seem untrustworthy, may appear to have been compelled by the prosecutor\u2019s threats and promises to come forward and be truthful. The suggestion is that the prosecutor is forcing the truth from his witness and the unspoken message is that the prosecutor knows what the truth is and is assuring its revelation.[<footnotemark>43</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The in-exchange-for-truthful-testimony incantation is Orwellian. The prosecutor decides what is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>truthful testimony,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and the witness has no practical opportunity for judicial review. The witness knows the testimony he must provide to obtain the benefit of the bargain he made with the prosecutor. These witnesses, facing life imprisonment without parole, knew that the prosecutor, if dissatisfied with their testimony, had the power to make them run the gauntlet, and fully understood what the prosecutor meant by truthful testimony. But the jury, unless instructed by the court concerning that esoteric meaning of truthful testimony, might be misled by prosecutorial repetition of the in-exchange-for-truthful testimony incantation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The majority dismisses Bahoda\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s questions to Asker and Haidar were error.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The majority concludes that the prosecutor was merely attempting on redirect examination to rehabilitate these witnesses.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The majority notes that the redirect questioning of Asker was in response to vigorous cross-examination by defense counsel regarding Asker\u2019s motive to lie. The majority states, \"On the basis of these facts, we do not deem this questioning error requiring reversal because the questioning was brief, was on redirect examination, and was in response to questioning that arguably required some attempt at rehabilitation.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> That the questioning occurred on redirect examination does not justify what otherwise would be inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">While the testimony of the investigator may have been general,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> I agree with the Court of Appeals that the questioning was improper because it suggested that the authorities had taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>special steps to assure that witnesses were telling the truth, and was tantamount to an expression of opinion by the police/prosecutor regarding the truthfulness of the witnesses.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The prosecutor argued that the street value of the cocaine could \"retire the debt of half the Third World countries,\u201d and was more than most of the jurors together could expect to earn in their lifetimes. The prosecutor observed that some of the allegedly conspiratorial activities took place at a community swimming pool in Oakland County. The prosecutor commented on the size and pervasiveness of the drug problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">As the majority notes, a prosecutor is accorded much latitude in constructing his arguments,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and is free to comment on the evidence and the inferences to be drawn from the evidence.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> A prosecutor may not, however, argue issues broader than the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence without infringing on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Prosecutors are not permitted to appeal to the juror\u2019s sense of \"civic duty.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In <em>People v McCoy, </em>392 Mich 231, 239-240; 220 NW2d 456 (1974), this Court criticized the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal summation that his office did not \"bring cases unless we\u2019re sure, unless we\u2019re posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>five.\u201d The Court said that \"it is not permissible for the prosecutor to vouch for the defendant\u2019s guilt on his own knowledge or on the knowledge of police officers who did not testify.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7a\">The prosecutor in the instant case assured the jury that the evidence \"doesn\u2019t get any better,\u201d and was almost \"too good,\u201d and that the case was \"perfect\u201d and \"well organized [and] that\u2019s as good as it is going to get.\u201d The majority characterizes these comments as \"isolated,\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and \"innocuous.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The majority states that the comments were intended to rebut defense counsel\u2019s theory that this was a \"bought\u201d case. Implicit in the majority\u2019s reasoning is the notion that the prosecutor should be permitted special leeway in responding on rebuttal. Such a view is unsupported by case law.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">I also agree with the Court of Appeals that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>was error to admit evidence regarding the beating of Asker after the conclusion of the alleged con-. spiracy.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> It is not claimed that Bahoda participated in the beating. The Court of Appeals concluded that the evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial because it was designed only to show that Bahoda was a person deserving of conviction.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The majority finds no abuse of discretion in the admission of the evidence, concluding that it was admissible because Asker\u2019s credibility was in issue and the evidence was probative of Asker\u2019s motive for cooperating with the authorities. Assuming that Asker\u2019s motive was relevant, the evidence that he had been beaten shortly before he decided to cooperate with the authorities could have been admitted without Asker\u2019s testimony that Bahoda had driven him to and from the site of the beating, and was in an adjoining room during the beating. The evidence that Bahoda had driven Asker served no relevant purpose, and portrayed Bahoda as a duplicitous and dishonorable enforcer.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b493-5\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b493-6\">Weaver, J., took no part in the decision of this case._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-12\"> 202 Mich App 214; 508 NW2d 170 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> My reasons are set forth in a dissenting statement in <em>Fluker, </em>442 Mich 892-893, in which Chief Justice Cavanagh joined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\"> <em>Q. </em>You were mad at who?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\"><em>A. </em>To the Columbians [sic, Colombians] and to the Arabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\"><em>Q. </em>And you were mad at who, the Arabs too?</p>\n<p id=\"ABLY\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I was mad to them . . .</p>\n<p id=\"Aub\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>Mr. Sonenberg </em>(interposing): I\u2019m going to object in reference to nationality.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\"><em>Mr. Bunting: </em>Well, he didn\u2019t object when he said Columbians, your Honor.

Of course, the mere mention of the status of the accused as shown by the record may not be improper if it has a legitimate bearing on some issue in the case, such as identification by race. But where the jury\u2019s predisposition against some particular segment of society is exploited to stigmatize the accused or the accused\u2019s witnesses, such argument clearly trespasses the bounds of reasonable inference or fair comment on the evidence. Accordingly, many courts have denounced such appeals to prejudice as inconsistent with the requirement that the defendant be judged solely on the evidence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[9]\">\n<p id=\"b480-12\">9 Standard 3-5.8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[10]\">\n<p id=\"b481-11\">10 202 Mich App 220.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b481-12\"> MCL 750.157a; MSA 28.354(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b481-13\"> MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b482-7\"> Arias was arrested on June 28, 1988, by federal agents while driving his pickup truck containing 99 kilos of cocaine.
