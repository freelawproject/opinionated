We conclude that the insurers who denied liability are primarily liable for no-fault property protection benefits because their insureds\u2019 vehicles were \"involved in the accident\u201d that arose out of the use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle. MCL 500.3121(1); MSA 24.13121(1); MCL 500.3125; MSA 24.13125. The Court of Appeals opinion is affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. A thief \"hot-wired\u201d Columbus Bone, Sr.\u2019s, car as it was parked at a private residence. The next morning, while the thief was driving the stolen vehicle northbound on Woodward Avenue, a City of Fern-dale police officer patrolling the area observed that the vehicle was running without keys in its ignition. Suspecting that the vehicle had been stolen, the officer activated his overhead lights and signaled the driver to pull over. The thief ignored this direction, and instead accelerated, continuing north on Woodward. The officer followed in quick pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The chase lasted for about half a mile, at which point the cars approached the intersection of Woodward and Nine Mile Road. The officer saw that the traffic signal for Woodward was red and slowed down, hoping to deter the stolen vehicle from disregarding the red light. The driver still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>ignored the signal and proceeded through the intersection, resulting in a multivehicle collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">First, the vehicle crashed into a pickup truck driven by its owner, Clinton Durfee, on eastbound Nine Mile. Next, the vehicle collided with a truck driven by its owner, Randy Leroy Lemons, also on eastbound Nine Mile. The impact of this crash caused the truck to split in two. The rear portion of the truck smashed into a nearby building on the northeast corner of Woodward and Nine Mile. The truck\u2019s gas tank exploded, the building caught on fire, and both the building and its contents were destroyed. The police vehicle did not collide with any of the other vehicles, nor did it incur any damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The owners and insurers of the building sought no-fault property protection benefits from the insurers of the owners of the truck, the pickup truck, and the stolen vehicle. Auto Club Insurance Association (acia), the insurer of the owner of the truck, also filed a third-party complaint against the City of Ferndale, claiming that the allegedly self-insured Ferndale was liable for a share of the property protection benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The insurers disagreed about their respective liabilities. League General Insurance Company, the insurer of the owner of the pickup truck, and acia conceded liability for a one-quarter pro-rata share of payable property protection benefits. Royal Insurance Company, the insurer of the owner of the stolen vehicle, denied liability, arguing that under \u00a7 3121(1) of the no-fault act, the damage could not be said to have arisen out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of its insured\u2019s motor vehicle as a motor vehicle because a thief had been operating the vehicle when the accident occurred. Ferndale also denied liability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>claiming that under \u00a7 3125 of the no-fault act, the police car was not \"involved in the accident. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">The insurers filed cross-motions for summary disposition of the liability issue. The trial court granted acia\u2019s motion for summary disposition against Royal, ruling that Royal was liable for a share of property protection benefits. However, it denied acia\u2019s motion for summary disposition against Ferndale, ruling that Ferndale was not liable for a share of property protection benefits. The Court \u00f3f Appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> affirmed both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Royal and acia applied for leave to appeal in this Court. We granted both applications and consolidated the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Our basic task in this case is to interpret sections of the no-fault statute pertaining to property protection benefits. The rules governing interpretation of statutes are well established. The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to identify and to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <em>Mull v Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, </em>444 Mich 508, 514, n 7; 510 NW2d 184 (1994); <em>Coleman v Gurwin, </em>443 Mich 59, 65; 503 NW2d 435 (1993). The first step in ascertaining such intent is to focus on the language in the statute itself. <em>Thornton v Allstate Ins Co, </em>425 Mich 643, 648; 391 NW2d 320 (1986). If the statutory language is certain and unambiguous, judicial construction is neither required nor permitted, and courts must apply the statute as written. <em>Mull </em>and <em>Coleman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Where the meaning of statutory language is not clear, judicial construction becomes necessary. Courts are to accord statutory words their ordinary and generally accepted meaning. <em>Id. </em>More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>over, when courts interpret a particular phrase in a statute, they must, whenever possible, construe the phrase in such a way that the interpretation does not conflict with, or deny effect to, other portions of the statute. <em>Grand Rapids v Crocker, </em>219 Mich 178, 182-183; 189 NW 221 (1922). Finally, when courts interpret the no-fault act in particular, they are to remember that the act is remedial in nature and must be liberally construed in favor of the persons intended to benefit from it. <em>Gobler v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>428 Mich 51, 61; 404 NW2d 199 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The provisions of the no-fault act dealing with property protection benefits are \u00a7\u00a7 3121-3127. Generally, a no-fault insurer will be liable to pay property protection benefits if the three following requirements are met:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">1. There has been \"accidental damage to tangible property arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle . . . .\u201d Section 3121(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">2. .The facts do not implicate any of the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>torily enumerated exceptions for property protection liability. Section 3123.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">3. The insurer insures the owner of a vehicle \"involved in the accident,\u201d in which case the insurer will be primarily liable; or, the insurer insures the operator of a vehicle \"involved in the accident,\u201d in which case the insurer will be secondarily liable. Section 3125.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">When two or more insurers are liable for property protection benefits in the same order of priority, benefits are paid by insurers in a manner that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>accomplishes an equitable distribution of loss among the insurers. Section 3127.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Property protection benefits are distinguishable from personal protection benefits (pips) because, among other things, property protection benefits provide third-party protection, whereas pips provide first-party protection. In other words, when a person\u2019s property has been damaged because of a motor vehicle, he does not look first to his own no-fault insurer for recovery, but, rather, to the \"insurers of owners or registrants of vehicles involved in the accident . . . .\u201d Section 3125. In contrast, when a person suffers injuries because of a motor vehicle, he generally looks first to his own no-fault insurer for recovery. See \u00a7\u00a7 3114(1) and 3115(1). A significant exception to the general liability scheme exists with regard to property protection benefits where the property that has been damaged is a moving motor vehicle. In that situation, the damaged property owner <em>does </em>look to his own no-fault insurer for recovery, provided he has purchased optional collision protection. See \u00a7 3123(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>In this case, the damaged property owners and their insurers seek third-party property protection benefits from the insurers of the owners of four vehicles that were present at the accident scene. Two of the insurers already have admitted responsibility. We conclude that the other two insurers, Royal and Ferndale, are also liable for a share of property protection benefits because the facts presented satisfy each of the aforementioned requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The accidental damage to the building in this case arose out of the use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle, thereby making the damaged property owners and insurers eligible for property protection benefits under \u00a7 3121(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We examined what is meant by the language \"arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle\u201d under no-fault law in <em>Thornton, supra. </em>While the specific no-fault benefits at issue in <em>Thornton </em>were pips, our analysis in <em>Thornton </em>of the causal nexus that must exist between the injury and the motor vehicle equally applies to property protection benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In <em>Thornton, </em>we adopted several criteria to be used to assess whether the requisite causal connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>tion between the injury and the motor vehicle was sufficient to trigger no-fault benefits. The primary consideration in the causation analysis \"must be the relationship between the injury and the vehicular use of a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Thornton, supra </em>at 659-660. In addition, the relationship between the use of the vehicle as a motor vehicle and the injury must be \"more than incidental, fortuitous, or 'but for,\u2019 \u201d and the vehicle\u2019s connection with the injury should be \" 'directly related to its character as a motor vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659. On the basis of the particular facts in <em>Thornton, </em>we concluded that the requisite causal nexus had not been established, emphasizing that \"[t]he motor vehicle was not the instrumentality of the injuries,\u201d and that \"the injury could have occurred whether or not [the claimant] used a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Thornton, supra </em>at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Applying the criteria from <em>Thornton </em>to the facts of this case, we conclude that the property damage arose out of the use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle. Specifically, we hold that the destruction of the building arose out of the use of the <em>truck </em>as a motor vehicle. The truck was the vehicle that crashed into the building, and the truck\u2019s gas tank caused the building to catch fire and sustain serious damage. Seconds before the accident, the driver of the truck was using it for transportation purposes \u2014 an activity that is \"directly related to [the truck\u2019s] character as a motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Thorn</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>ton, supra </em>at 659. This functional use of the truck cannot be said to have a merely \"incidental,\u201d \"fortuitous,\u201d or \"but for\u201d connection with the damage: because the truck crashed into the building, it acted as \"the instrumentality of the injuries.\u201d <em>Thornton, supra </em>at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\">On the basis of the above, we find that the relationship between the use of the truck and the damage was direct for purposes of no-fault law. We consider irrelevant the fact that at the precise moment the truck smashed into the building it was not being used as a motor vehicle because it was cut in half. Suppose a vehicle was being used for transportation purposes seconds before colliding with another vehicle, causing the first vehicle to roll over consecutively and ultimately to hit a pedestrian. The fact that the car was rolling, rather than being used as a motor vehicle, seconds before hitting the pedestrian likewise would lead us to conclude that the injury arose out of the use of the first vehicle as a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Both Royal and Ferndale argue that they are not liable for property protection benefits because the damage here cannot be said to have arisen out of the use of their particular insured\u2019s vehicle as a motor vehicle. We reject this argument because we disagree with its premise that, in a multivehicle accident situation, each insurer\u2019s liability for property protection benefits turns on whether the damage arose out of the use of the <em>insured\u2019s </em>vehicle as a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>While \u00a7 3121(1) refers to an insurer\u2019s liability, the section primarily encompasses the threshold requirement that claimants must satisfy to be eligible for property protection benefits: showing that the damage arose out of \"the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle . . . Once that is established, the damage fits within the purview of the no-fault statute, and the claimant is entitled to no-fault coverage. In a single vehicle accident, the primary liability of the insurer of the owner of the single vehicle physically connected to the accident <em>will </em>turn on whether the claimant can establish that the damage arose out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of the <em>insured\u2019s </em>vehicle as a motor vehicle. The claimant is not entitled to coverage unless the causal nexus is established, and the insured\u2019s vehicle is the only possible vehicle available to demonstrate the required nexus.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">However, in a multivehicle accident, the liability of each insurer of an owner of a vehicle having some physical connection with the accident <em>will not </em>turn on whether the claimant can establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>that the damage arose out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of <em>each insured\u2019s </em>vehicle as a motor vehicle. Section 3121(1) only requires that the claimant be able to show that the damage arose out of \"the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Once that showing is made with respect to <em>one </em>motor vehicle, the insurers of owners of vehicles having some physical connection to the accident are potentially primarily liable for property protection benefits. Whether such insurers in fact will be found primarily liable will turn on whether any exceptions for liability exist under \u00a7 3123, and whether the insureds\u2019 vehicles were \"involved in the accident\u201d under \u00a7 3125. A vehicle may be \"involved in the accident\u201d even though the damage cannot be said to have arisen out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of <em>that </em>vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In other words, in this multivehicle accident, even if we were to accept Royal and Ferndale\u2019s claim that the damage did not arise out of the use of their insureds\u2019 vehicles as motor vehicles, Royal and Ferndale are not necessarily relieved of liability. Because the damage arose out of the use of a motor vehicle (the truck) as a motor vehicle, and because the insureds\u2019 vehicles had more than a random association with the accident scene, Royal and Ferndale may be primarily liable for property protection benefits. Whether they in fact will be found liable will depend on the outcome of analyses under \u00a7\u00a7 3123 and 3125.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The facts in this case do not implicate any of the exceptions for property protection liability under the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The Legislature did not choose to preclude coverage for property protection benefits on the basis that a thief was driving the insured\u2019s vehicle when the accident occurred. That the Legislature contemplated the car-thief scenario when it drafted the no-fault act is made manifest by the existence of \u00a7 3113(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 3113(a) provides that insurers do not have to pay pips to a car thief who incurs injuries in a motor vehicle accident. Because the Legislature did not incorporate any type of exception for the car-thief situation with respect to property protection benefits, we will not recognize one for the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Similarly, the Legislature did not articulate any coverage exception for insured police cars, making it inappropriate for us to create one now. The fact that both the Ferndale and Royal insureds are innocent of any wrongdoing is not grounds for an exemption from no-fault liability in light of \u00a7 3121(2)\u2019s direction that property protection bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>fits are to be paid \"without regard to fault.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We would violate basic rules of statutory construction if we ignored the Legislature\u2019s clear and unequivocal language in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Royal and Ferndale are primarily liable for a share of property protection benefits because both their insured\u2019s vehicles were \"involved in the accident\u201d according to our construction of that phrase as it is used in \u00a7 3125.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">While the phrase appears in several provisions throughout the no-fault act,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it is not defined in the act. In <em>Heard v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>414 Mich 139; 324 NW2d 1 (1982), we examined its meaning as it is used in \u00a7 3113(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 3113(b) provides that an injured person will not be entitled to pips if such person was the owner or registrant of an uninsured motor vehicle or motorcycle that was \"involved in the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABi\">In construing the phrase in Heard, we observed that \"[w]hether a vehicle is 'involved\u2019 cannot be determined by abstract reasoning or resort to dictionary definitions. It depends on the meaning derived from the purpose and structure of the no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>fault act.\u201d <em>Heard, supra </em>at 147. For a vehicle to have been \"involved in the accident\u201d requires, at a minimum, that the vehicle be used as a motor vehicle at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Further, a vehicle does not fit within the category of vehicles \"involved in the accident\u201d merely on a showing of a \"but for\u201d connection between the functional use of the motor vehicle and the injury \u2014 even where a \"but for\u201d standard is narrowed by interposing a requirement of physical proximity between the use of the vehicle as a vehicle and the injury or damage.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Since <em>Heard, </em>several panels of the Court of Appeals also have examined the import of the phrase \"involved in the accident\u201d in the context of various no-fault sections,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but not the sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>regarding property protection benefits. When interpreting the phrase, the panels adhered to our observations in <em>Heard, </em>while at the same time providing their own elaborations. A consistent theme in the Court of Appeals cases is the requirement that an \"active link\u201d exist between the injury and the use of the motor vehicle as a motor vehicle in order for the vehicle to be deemed \"involved in the accident.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Combining what we said in <em>Heard </em>with the guidance provided by the Court of Appeals, we hold that for a vehicle to be considered \"involved in the accident\u201d under \u00a7 3125, the motor vehicle, being operated or used as a motor vehicle, must actively, as opposed to passively, contribute to the accident. Showing a mere \"but for\u201d connection between the operation or use of the motor vehicle and the damage is not enough to establish that the vehicle is \"involved in the accident.\u201d Moreover, physical contact is not required to establish that the vehicle was \"involved in the accident,\u201d nor is fault a relevant consideration in the determination whether a vehicle is \"involved in an accident.\u201d Finally, as already indicated by our discussion in part A, the concept of being \"involved in the accident\u201d under \u00a7 3125 encompasses a broader causal nexus between the use of the vehicle and the damage than what is required under \u00a7 3121(1) to show that the damage arose out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of the motor vehicle as a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The standard we adopt for construction of the phrase \"involved in the accident\u201d comports with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>the basic criteria we endorsed in <em>Heard. </em>Consistent with what we said in <em>Heard, </em>the standard recognizes that the vehicle must be involved as a motor vehicle, and that a \"but for\u201d connection between the functional use of a motor vehicle and the injury is insufficient. Our specific holding in <em>Heard </em>was that a parked vehicle is considered \"involved in the accident\u201d only if one of the exceptions under \u00a7 3106(1)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> applies. To the extent that our holding in <em>Heard </em>can be read to equate the \"involved in the accident\u201d standard with the \"arising out of\u201d standard, we now clarify that such comparisons are appropriate only when assessing whether a <em>parked vehicle </em>is \"involved in the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The meaning that we give to the phrase \"involved in the accident\u201d is also consistent with the structure of the no-fault act. The sections in the no-fault act that set forth the \"arising out of\u201d standard precede the act\u2019s mention of the \"involved in the accident\u201d standard in the case of both pips and property protection benefits. This order of appearance accords with our view regarding how to properly assess the liability of an insurer of an owner of a vehicle \"involved in the accident\u201d in multivehicle accident situations. First, it must be determined whether the damage arose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>out of the operation, ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle under \u00a7 3121(1). If this determination yields an affirmative conclusion, only then may it become necessary to determine whether the insureds\u2019 vehicles were \"involved in the accident\u201d under \u00a7 3125. The touchstone for liability under \u00a7 3125 is whether the vehicle is \"involved in the accident.\u201d Section 3125 does not direct that the phrase \"involved in the accident\u201d be equated with the \"arising out of the ownership, operation,\u201d etc., language in \u00a7 3121(1), even though it would have been easy for the Legislature to so indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Finally, and most importantly, the construction we apply to the language \"involved in the accident\u201d is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent when it drafted the no-fault act. As we explained in <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 578-579; 267 NW2d 72 (1978), cert den 442 US 934 (1979), <em>(After Remand), </em>412 Mich 1105 (1982), \"The goal of the no-fault insurance system was to provide victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses.\u201d Our construction will increase the possibility of \"assured\u201d and \"adequate\u201d reparation because the liability of <em>each </em>insurer in a multivehicle accident would not turn on whether the claimant could establish that the damage arose out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of that particular insured\u2019s motor vehicle as a motor vehicle, but, rather, on the broader criterion that the insured vehicle be \"involved in the accident,\u201d where the accident arose out of the use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle. While the causal nexus is more liberal under the \"involved in the accident\u201d standard, the standard\u2019s requirement that the vehicle be used as a motor vehicle, and that it make an active contribution to the happen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ing of the accident, guarantees that insurers will not be held liable for property protection benefits simply because of a remote association between their insureds\u2019 vehicles and the accident. Finally, the standard would facilitate \"prompt\u201d reparation of benefits. Because the standard is straightforward in its application, insurers should be less likely to dispute liability among other insurers when their insureds\u2019 vehicles were \"involved in the accident,\u201d and, instead, more likely to pay benefits to eligible victims of motor vehicle accidents in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Applying our construction of the phrase \"involved in the accident,\u201d we conclude that both the stolen vehicle and the police vehicle were \"involved in the accident\u201d under \u00a7 3125. The fact that neither vehicle made physical contact with the damaged building is not dispositive. The thief was using the stolen vehicle as a motor vehicle at the time of the accident, and this use directly led to the collision with the truck, and caused it to crash into and damage the building. Hence, the use of the stolen vehicle made an \"active contribution\u201d to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Likewise, the police officer was using his vehicle as a motor vehicle while he pursued the stolen vehicle. This active use perpetuated the stolen vehicle\u2019s flight, which, in turn, resulted in the collision with the other cars and the damage to the nearby property. We consider it to be unimportant that seconds before the multivehicle collision, the police vehicle \"backed off and allowed more room between the patrol car and the susp[ect] veh[icle]\u201d in an effort to deter the stolen vehicle from running the red light. Before slowing down, the police vehicle had actively pursued the stolen vehicle, and this pursuit, in part, obviously prompted the stolen vehicle to ignore the red light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>and collide with the other vehicles. Those collisions directly resulted in the damage to the property. Thus, the use of the police vehicle as a motor vehicle had an active link with the damage, making it \"involved in the accident\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3125, and notwithstanding the fact that the same use could not be said to have given rise to the damage for purposes of \u00a7 3121(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\">Because in this case the property damage arose out of the use of the truck as a motor vehicle under \u00a7 3121(1), none of the exceptions for liability applied under \u00a7 3123, and the Royal and Ferndale insureds\u2019 vehicles were \"involved in the accident\u201d under \u00a7 3125(1), we conclude that Royal and Fern-dale are primarily liable to pay a share of the property protection benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Royal argues that it should not be liable for coverage because a thief was driving the car at the time of the accident. Royal supports this argument by referring to <em>Lee v DAIIE, </em>412 Mich 505, 509; 315 NW2d 413 (1982), in which this Court found that \"it is the policy of the no-fault act that persons, not motor vehicles, are insured against loss.\u201d Relying on this statement, Royal insists that its insured did not have a role in the accident, and, therefore, Royal\u2019s duty to provide no-fault coverage was not triggered. We are not persuaded by Royal\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">As a general matter, the principle that we recognized in <em>Lee </em>is true. Moreover, the language in \u00a7 3125 is in accord because it directs that primary liability rests with \"insurers of <em>owners </em>or <em>registrants </em>of vehicles involved in the accident.\u201d While we recognize the validity of the principle we stated in <em>Lee, </em>we are also cognizant that at various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>places throughout the no-fault act, the Legislature chose to make the liability of the insurer turn on whether the <em>insured\u2019s vehicle </em>is \"involved in the accident,\u201d rather than on the involvement of the <em>insured </em>in the accident. The primary insurer liability scheme for property protection benefits under \u00a7\u00a7 3121(1) and 3125 is such an example.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">When this Court made the observation in Lee, the benefits at issue were pips. With regard to pips, the duty to provide coverage for the insured generally is not linked to the involvement of the insured\u2019s vehicle in the accident. As indicated, the insurer that is primarily liable for pips is the insurer of the injured person. The primary insurer\u2019s duty to provide pips is triggered when the insured is injured, and the injury arises out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> An insurer is primarily liable even though the insured does not own, operate, maintain, or use a vehicle involved in the accident \u2014 all that is required is that the insured suffer an injury in an accident involving a motor vehicle. <em>Lee v DAIIE </em>at 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In contrast, when, as in this case, the type of benefit sought is property protection benefits, the primary insurer\u2019s obligation to provide benefits is tied to the involvement of its insured\u2019s vehicle in the accident. As mentioned, the no-fault automobile insurer of the person who suffers property damage is <em>not </em>primarily liable. Rather, under \u00a7 3125, primary liability rests with the \"insurers of owners or registrants of vehicles involved in the accident,\u201d where the accident arose out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle. Sections 3121(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>and 3125 read in conjunction provide evidence that the primary insurer\u2019s duty to pay property protection benefits may be triggered whether or not its insured personally participated in the accident. This conclusion is supported by <em>Michigan Mutual Ins Co v Carson City Texaco, Inc, </em>421 Mich 144; 365 NW2d 89 (1984), in which the insurer was held to be liable even though the insured did not personally participate in the property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">This case requires us to decide whether the insurer of a motor vehicle is responsible under the no-fault insurance act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq., </em>to pay benefits for property damage arising out of the maintenance of a motor vehicle in the course of a business of maintaining motor vehicles. We hold that such insurer is responsible. <em>[Id. </em>at 146.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In this case, while Royal insures a vehicle owner, its primary liability turns on the involvement of the insured\u2019s vehicle in the accident. In accord with what we stated in <em>Lee, </em>we conclude that Royal, along with the other insurers of owners of vehicles \"involved in the accident,\u201d bear primary responsibility for payment of property protection benefits under \u00a7 3125.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">We hold that Royal and Ferndale are primarily liable to pay a share of property protection benefits because their insureds\u2019 vehicles were \"involved in the accident,\u201d which arose out of the use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle. We affirm the Court of Appeals decision regarding Royal\u2019s liability, but reverse its decision regarding the City of Ferndale\u2019s liability.

Because the injuries did not arise out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle, as is required under \u00a7 3105(1), we concluded that the claimant was not eligible for PIPS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b215-5\"> We similarly reject Royal\u2019s more specific contention that it is not responsible because the damage did not arise out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of its insured\u2019s vehicle <em>by its insured. </em>The clear language in \u00a7 3121(1) does not include any requirement that an insured be the person operating, maintaining, or using the vehicle when the accident happens. Royal confuses the requirement under \u00a7 3121(1) with the requirement under \u00a7 3163(1), which sets forth the circumstances under which an out-of-state insured is entitled to no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>fault benefits. Section 3163(1) expressly requires that the insured be the person who operates, maintains, or uses the vehicle as a motor vehicle when the accident occurs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">An insurer authorized to transact automobile liability insurance and personal and property protection insurance in this state shall file and maintain a written certification that any accidental bodily injury or property damage occurring in this state arising from the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle <em>by an out-of-state resident who is insured </em>under its automobile liability insurance policies, shall be subject to the personal and property protection insurance system set forth in this act. [MCL 500.3163(1); MSA 24.13163(1). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The qualifying language in \u00a7 3163 regarding an out-of-state insured\u2019s participation in the accident is conspicuously absent from the language in \u00a7 3121. We will not contravene the Legislature\u2019s intent to omit the limitation when it drafted \u00a7 3121(1) by construing the section in the way that Royal advances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b217-5\"> Both Ferndale and the Court of Appeals rely on the holdings in <em>Sanford v Ins Co of North America, </em>151 Mich App 747; 391 NW2d 473 (1986), and <em>Peck v Auto-Owners Ins Co, </em>112 Mich App 329; 315 NW2d 586 (1982), to support the proposition that Ferndale is not liable for property protection benefits. Reliance on these cases is misplaced because both dealt with single motor vehicle accidents in which the claimants\u2019 only chance of collecting benefits hinged on showing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the use of the single motor vehicle (the police car) as a motor vehicle gave rise to the claimant\u2019s injuries under \u00a7 3105(1). Because this is a multivehicle accident situation, and the facts establish that the damage arose out of the functional use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle (the motor vehicle not being the police car), the primary liability of the insurer of the police car turns on whether the police car was \"involved in the accident\u201d under \u00a7 3125. While recognizing that <em>Peck </em>and <em>Sanford </em>are factually distinguishable from the instant case, we decline to express an opinion concerning the holdings and-reasoning in <em>Peck </em>and <em>Sanford </em>at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"> A person is not entitled to be paid personal protection insurance benefits for accidental bodily injury if at the time of the accident any of the following circumstances existed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">(a) The person was using a motor vehicle or motorcycle which he or she had taken unlawfully, unless the person reasonably believed that he or she was entitled to take and use the vehicle.
