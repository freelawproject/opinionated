Peters had no personal interest in the trip, nor had he any control over the operation of the car. He did not accompany the party, nor were the members of the party on any business or errand for him. <em>(Wylie </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>137 N. Y. 257; <em>Thorpe </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., </em>76 N. Y. 406; <em>Dwinelle </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., </em>120 N.

Peters lived at Rotterdam Junction, where he kept a store. He was the owner of a Hudson car. Silvester Nalli lived with the defendant. Nalli had a brother who lived in Amsterdam. The week before November 11, 1923, Peters had promised Nalli and his brother to take them for a ride in his car to St. Johnsville \u2014 an outing for Armistice Day. As the time approached, Peters discovered that he could not go on account of his wife\u2019s illness, and he thereupon asked Antonio Mondrone to take his place, and to drive these people to St. Johnsville in his, Peters\u2019, car. Mon-drone lived at Rotterdam Junction, was a laborer working in the roundhouse for the railroad company. He was also a licensed chauffeur, and on other occasions, at Peters\u2019 request, had driven his car for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On the trip the car was overturned, and Silvester Nalli killed. There was evidence to show that the accident was due to Mondrone\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The judgment entered on the verdict of the jury in favor of the administrator of Nalli\u2019s estate, and against Peters and Mondrone, was reversed by the Appellate Division. A new trial was granted to Mondrone, but the complaint dismissed as to Peters.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">If Mondrone were driving Peters\u2019 car at his request, on his, Peters\u2019, business, or enterprise, acting in this particular as his servant or agent, Peters would be liable for his negligence. Whether or not he was to receive pay would merely be evidence bearing upon the question. Peters might be hable even though Mondrone was to .receive no compensation. <em>(Althorf </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>22 N. Y. 355; <em>Wyllie </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>137 N. Y. 248.) We think that there was evidence in this case from which the jury might find, or reasonably infer, that Mondrone was driving for the defendant, at his request, and for his benefit; that at the time of the accident he was engaged on the defendant\u2019s business, or undertaking. Even one acting under such circumstances as a volunteer, might render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the owner of the car liable. (See <em>Althorf </em>v. <em>Wolfe, supra.) </em>The liability for the acts of another is not dependent upon the strict relationship of master and servant, but upon relationship of similar nature, where one acts for another, at his request, express or implied, for his benefit, and under his direction. Under such circumstances, the negligence of the agent is the negligence of the master or the principal. <em>(Lowell </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>183 App. Div. 701; affd., 228 N. Y. 592; <em>Orlando </em>v. <em>Pioneer Barber Towel Supply Co., </em>239 N. Y. 342; <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>214 N. Y. 249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The judgment of reversal must be modified in so far as it dismisses the complaint against John Peters; and a new trial granted, with costs to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">His cock, Ch. J., Cardozo, Pound, McLaughlin, Andrews and Lehman, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
