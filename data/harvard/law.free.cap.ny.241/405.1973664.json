Laws ch. 6), article 5-A of which law is quoted in full in the foot note.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The charge against him is that he attended a meeting of and remained a member of Buffalo Provisional Klan of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan with knowledge that said association, which has more than twenty members, requires an oath as a prerequisite or condition of membership, and is not a labor union or a benevolent order mentioned in the Benevolent Orders Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 3), had not complied with the provisions of the statute by filing with the Secretary of State a sworn copy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>its constitution, by-laws, rules, regulations and oath of membership, together with a roster of its membership and a list of its officers for the current year. His contention is that the statute is void for unconstitutionality in that it deprives him of his liberty without due process of law and denies him the equal protection of the law for the reason that it is arbitrary and discriminatory class legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Secret societies have, in the past, been recognized as meeting a desire of many of our citizens to band themselves together by oaths more horrific than harmful. Thus in <em>Purple </em>v. <em>Horton </em>(13 Wend. 2) the court had before it the oath of a master mason and found nothing therein to disqualify a freemason as a juror in an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>where one of the parties to a suit at law was a freemason and the other was not. The act before us places its approval on numerous well-known lodges, chapters, commanderies, consistories, councils, temples, grottos, posts, tribes, aeries, camps, tents, nests, encampments and cantons wherein brothers, sisters, sons or daughters are united in mystic ties. (Ben. Orders Law, \u00a7 2.) Labor unions and, more recently, college fraternities and sororities (L. 1925, ch. 521) whose name is legion, have also received legislative approval. They have a good reputation, at least the Legislature has recognized the innocuous, if not excellent, character which they claim for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">But the Legislature may take notice of the potentialities of evil in secret societies, and may regulate them reasonably without depriving the members thereof of their liberty without due process of law. Indeed, the danger of certain organizations has \"been judicially demonstrated. The manifesto of the political party known as the Left Wing of the Socialist Party, or Communists, has been said openly to advocate criminal anarchy in violation of the provisions of the Penal Law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gitlow, </em>234 N. Y. 132; affirmed, 268 U. S. 652.) Secret societies may be formed for the same purposes. The Legislature must, however, adopt a reasonable ground of classification in regulating such secret societies and organizations. <em>(Lawton </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>152 U. S. 133; <em>People </em>v. <em>Klinck Packing Co., </em>214 N. Y. 121; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beakes Dairy Co., </em>222 N. Y. 416, 429.) It cannot legitimately vent its permanent or passing wrath on a single society unless such society is known or shown to be in a class by itself. The present statute addresses itself to very general characteristics which admittedly may include the most laudable as well as the vicious. It seems reasonable to separate the known from the unknown, the presumptively good from the possibly evil, the sheep from the goats. Benevolent orders, labor unions and college fraternities have existed for many years and while not immune from hostile criti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>cism, have on the whole justified their existence. Conceivably those that remain, or some of them, might win equal favor on better acquaintance. With the wisdom of the legislation in question we have not to do. The Legislature may doubtless strike at a fancied evil, believed by many to exist, without balancing with accuracy the actual danger to the State against the beneficent purposes publicly avowed by the members of such societies. <em>(Otis </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>187 U. S. 606, 609.) It follows that a classification which does not include all oath-bound secret societies may be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Another objection to the statute requires consideration. The act in question aims only at societies which require an oath as a prerequisite or condition of membership. Similar organizations which are not oath bound are entirely outside of its provisions. Any organization under the ban might take itself out of the regulations by adopting a solemn pledge or affirmation rather than an oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">A promissory oath is defined by Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary as \u201c a solemn appeal to God, or in a wider sense, to some superior sanction or a sacred or revered person (as the temple, the altar, the blood of Abel, the Koran, a tribal superior, etc.) * * * in witness of the inviolability of a promise or undertaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The State in dealing with judicial oaths, which are taken as a sanction for the truth of an affirmation or declaration in legal or quasi-legal matters, like the oath of a witness or an affiant, defines <em>\u201c </em>oath \u201d (Gen. Const. Law, \u00a7 36; Cons. Laws, ch. 22) to <em>\u201c </em>include every mode authorized by law of attesting the truth of that which is stated,\u201d and punishes for perjury both one who swears and one who affirms that any material matter is true which is known to be false. (Penal Law, \u00a7\u00a7 1620,1621; Cons. Laws, ch. 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The policy of the State is, therefore, to disregard the form of the sanction <em>\u201c </em>on any occasion in which an oath is required by law, or is necessary for the prosecution or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>defense of a private right, or for the ends of public justice, or may lawfully be administered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Public policy thus makes no distinction between oaths and affirmations so far as the pains and penalties of perjury are concerned. But promissory oaths are not included in the definitions quoted. They may not be the basis of a criminal prosecution for perjury. The faithless public official who violates his oath of office is punishable but not for perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Can it be said that a solemn promise or obligation, not in the form of an oath or appeal to Almighty God, is not as binding on the conscience of the ordinary member of a secret organization as the oath would be? Is such a distinction a sound basis for classification? Does it arbitrarily discriminate against those who believe in a Supreme Being or higher power? Is the line drawn with any well-defined moral admeasurement between potential good and bad? These considerations address themselves to the law-making power if not to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Assuming that all might be included, on judicial review, a classification is not held to be bad because it is not comprehensive. The Legislature need not attack the whole evil at once. <em>(Keokee Coke Co. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>234 U. S. 224, 227.) Certain oath-bound societies have in the past, as matter of common knowledge, been revolutionary and a menace to established government. For the purpose of regulating Sunday labor one rule has been made for barbers in New York and Saratoga, while another rule is applied to the rest of the State. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Havnor, </em>149 N. Y. 195.) As an oath is recognized by many as the highest form of obligation, a distinction may reasonably be made between oath-bound secret societies and societies which bind their members by pledges of less time-honored solemnity and between accepted oath-bound societies and oath-bound societies in general. The classification we have to consider is r\u00e9al and readily made as matter of form. It may not rest on a very substantial basis in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>opinion of many, but <em>\u201c </em>the power to declare a law unconstitutional is always exercised with reluctance.\u201d <em>(Pollock </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co., </em>157 U. S. 429, 554.) The enactment before us may be upheld as not \u201c actually and palpably unreasonable and arbitrary <em>\u201d </em>on the authority of precedents which have gone far to uphold legislative power in matters of classification. <em>(Radice </em>v. <em>New York, </em>264 U. S. 292, 296, 297.) It rests on an opinion reasonably permissible for its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Hiscock, Ch.
