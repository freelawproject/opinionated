On April 2, 2009, the district court sentenced Hill to 57 months in prison and three years of supervised release. As his sole issue on appeal, Hill contends that there is a conflict between the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement at sentencing and the amended written judgment with regard to the issue of credit for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">When there is a clear conflict between the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement at sentencing and the written judgment, the oral pronouncement controls.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When there is merely ambiguity between the two, this Court reviews the record to ascertain the district court\u2019s intent, which determines the final sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">In Hill\u2019s case, there is no conflict between the oral pronouncement and the amended written judgment, nor even an ambiguity. In its oral pronouncement, delivered on April 2, 2009, the district court indicated that Hill should receive credit for time served beginning October 6, 2008, the date he was taken into custody.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its amended written judgment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the district court indicated that Hill should receive credit for time served \u201cfrom October 6, 2008 until April 2, 2009.\u201d Hill contends that the amended written judgment\u2019s \u201cuntil April 2, 2009\u201d term is inconsistent with the oral sentence. But because April 2, 2009, was the date of Hill\u2019s sentencing hearing, there is no reasonable argument that any credit for time served could extend beyond that date. Indeed, Hill makes no argument to substantiate his assertion that the alleged conflict may harm him. Thus, because the oral pronouncement and the amended written judgment agree that Hill is to receive credit for the same amount of time served, there is no ambiguity, much less a conflict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">In any event, as Hill recognizes in his appellate brief, the district court does not ultimately determine credit for time served.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Attorney General, through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the Bureau of Prisons, does.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For this reason, too, Hill\u2019s request that this Court strike the \u201cApril 2, 2009\u201d term from the amended -written judgment would offer him no relief if granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
