He argues that the BIA erred in concluding that he was not entitled to an exception based on changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen under a \u201chighly deferential abuse of discretion standard, regardless of the basis of the alien\u2019s request for relief.\u201d <em>Gomez-Palados v. </em>Holder; 560 F.3d 354, 358 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is not \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 304 (5th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Generally, a party may file only one motion to reopen. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). In addition, motions to reopen must be \u201cfiled within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.\u201d \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). However, the filing periods are not applicable if the motion to reopen is \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). <em>See also </em>\u00a7 1003.2(c) (2)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">Nadeem has not shown that any changed conditions in Pakistan impact his claim. Although the BIA determined that Nadeem\u2019s evidence shows an increase in violence against religious minorities, Na-deem concedes that he is not a Christian or member of any other religious minority. Instead, Nadeem asserts that potential persecutors will impute his mother\u2019s Christianity to himself. However, none of the evidence indicates an increase in violence for people similarly situated to Nadeem\u2014 Muslims with known Christian family members \u2014 or even that his Christian mother has experienced an increase in persecution based on her religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">The BIA considered all of the evidence presented, and Nadeem cannot demonstrate that it abused its discretion by making a decision that was \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Singh, </em>436 F.3d at 487. Therefore, Nadeem\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Ciic R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
