Plaintiff, a federal inmate, filed this <em>Bivens </em>action alleging that Defendants violated Plaintiffs First Amendment rights by failing to obtain certain food so that Plaintiff could have a religious ceremonial meal on a religiously significant date. Because Plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of showing a clearly established right, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b653-24\">Plaintiff is an observant Muslim serving a 188-month sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Jesup, Georgia (\u201cFCI Jesup\u201d). Plaintiff had requested certain food items so that he and other Nation of Islam (\u201cNOI\u201d) inmates at FCI Jesup could partake of the ceremonial Eid-ul-Fitr feast on 3 October 2008. Plaintiff says this date was important because the feast is supposed to occur within three days of the completion of Ramadan.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Defendants agreed, pursuant to Bureau of Prisons policy, to obtain the food for the feast.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By 3 October, Defendants had procured some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the food items Plaintiff had requested. Objecting to the sufficiency of the meal that was offered, Plaintiff and some of the other NOI inmates did not partake of the feast on that day. The meal was ultimately rescheduled for 20 October 2008, at which point Plaintiff and other NOI inmates did participate in the meal (despite that it was no longer within the religiously significant time).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Plaintiff \u2014 proceeding <em>pro se </em>\u2014 filed this lawsuit in June 2009, claiming Defendants violated his right to the free exercise of his religion. Invoking the defense of qualified immunity, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss \u2014 which the district court converted to a motion for summary judgment. The district court concluded that Plaintiff had not shown the violation of a clearly established right, and so the court granted summary judgment for Defendants. Plaintiff now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment based on qualified immunity, resolving all issues of material fact in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1294 (11th Cir.2009). To overcome Defendants\u2019 qualified-immunity defense, Plaintiff bears the burden of showing both that Defendants\u2019 conduct amounted to a constitutional violation and that the right violated was already \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of Defendants\u2019 conduct. <em>Youmans v. Gagnon, </em>626 F.3d 557, 562 (11th Cir.2010). Failure to make either showing will defeat Plaintiffs claim. Here, we move directly to the question of whether Plaintiffs right was already clearly established at the pertinent time.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">A \u201cclearly established\u201d right is one whose contours are fixed \u201cso clearly that a reasonable official would have understood his acts were unlawful.\u201d <em>Dolihite v. Maughon, </em>74 F.3d 1027, 1040-41 (11th Cir.1996). A judicial precedent is not always required to establish clearly a right: in some situations, \u201cthe words of a ... federal constitutional provision may be so clear and the conduct so bad that case law is not needed to establish that the conduct cannot be lawful.\u201d <em>Vinyard v. Wilson, </em>311 F.3d 1340, 1350 (11th Cir.2002). But this case is not such a case: the words of the First Amendment\u2019s free exercise clause\u2014 which say that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\u201d \u2014 do not clearly require Defendants to provide Plaintiff with all of the exact food he requested for a religious meal on a specific date.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">So, we next turn to the question of whether Plaintiffs rights were clearly established by a precedent already existing at the time Defendants acted. <em>Id. </em>at 1351. For officials to have fair warning that their acts are unlawful, \u201cthere need not be a case \u2018on all fours,\u2019 with materially identical facts\u201d; a right can be clearly established even by factually distinct cases, \u201cso long as the prior decisions gave reasonable warning that the conduct at issue violated constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Holloman ex rel. Holloman v. Harland, </em>370 F.3d 1252, 1277 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (involving a First Amendment violation). But, the decisions that we look at for this analysis are only \u201cdecisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, or the highest court of the state where the case arose.\u201d <em>Jenkins by Hall v. Talladega City </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Bd. of Educ., </em>115 F.3d 821, 826 n. 4 (11th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Plaintiff has not identified \u2014 nor have we found \u2014 any decision of the United States Supreme Court, this Court, or the Supreme Court of Georgia that could have put Defendants on notice that failing to provide Plaintiff with the exact food he requested, on a specific date of religious significance, must violate Plaintiffs federal rights. Plaintiff has failed to show not only that any case involved similar facts to those at issue here, but failed to show even that \u201cstatements of general principle from [the controlling] precedents\u201d would obviously apply here and could have given Defendants reasonable warning that their conduct was unlawful. <em>Holloman, </em>370 F.3d at 1278. Plaintiff has therefore failed to meet his burden of showing a clearly established right; he cannot overcome Defendants\u2019 qualified immunity. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment for Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\">.
