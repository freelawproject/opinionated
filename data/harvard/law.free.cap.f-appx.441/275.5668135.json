Hernandez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion challenged his conviction of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-22\">This court has a duty to examine the basis of its jurisdiction, <em>sua sponte, </em>if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). A timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement in a civil case. <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). Where the United States is a party, a notice of appeal in a civil action must be filed within sixty days of entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-23\">The judgment dismissing Hernandez\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was entered on October 20, 2010, and the only filing by either party within sixty days was Hernandez\u2019s November 19, 2010, motion for reconsideration that was construed by the district court as a Rule 60(b) motion. Because that motion sought reconsideration only, it did not evince an intent to appeal the judgment. <em>See Mosley, </em>813 F.2d at 660. Furthermore, the November 19 motion was filed thirty days after entry of the judgment and thus did not suspend the time for filing a notice of appeal, even if it were considered a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A). Because Hernandez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>did not file a timely notice of appeal from the judgment dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion, his appeal from that judgment is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Hernandez\u2019s appeal of the denial of his motion for reconsideration is also subject to dismissal. That motion sought only a reevaluation of the claim in his \u00a7 2255 motion that his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance by failing to file a direct appeal. Thus, his motion for reconsideration constituted a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 532 &amp; nn. 4-5, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). Because Hernandez did not obtain this court\u2019s authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See id. </em>at 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641; <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Hernandez\u2019s appeal from the order denying his motion for reconsideration is frivolous and also is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In summary, the appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction; the motions for certificate of appealability and leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
