On appeal, Padurjan argues that the district court committed a number of errors in calculating the attorneys\u2019 fees for his claim. Upon a thorough review of the briefs, the record, and the extensive and well-reasoned orders of the magistrate and district judges that calculated the fee orders in this case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-21\">We review awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for abuse of discretion, though we consider <em>de novo </em>questions of law. <em>Atlanta Journal &amp; Constitution v. City of Atlanta Dep\u2019t of Aviation, </em>442 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2006). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-22\">[i]n reviewing the district court\u2019s hourly rate determination, an appellate court must be mindful that, [ajlthough an attorney[ ] fees award is reviewed for abuse of discretion, the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>what constitutes a reasonably hourly rate is a finding of fact subsidiary to the total award and is therefore reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9A\"><em>ACLU of Ga. v. Barnes, </em>168 F.3d 428, 436 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">To calculate reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, courts are to consider the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation, together with the customary hourly rate for similar legal services. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). These amounts are multiplied together to determine the so-called \u201clodestar.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Resolution Trust Corp. v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., </em>996 F.2d 1144, 1149-50 (11th Cir.1993). Although \u201c[adjustments to that fee then may be made as necessary in the particular case,\u201d <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 888, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1544, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984), the district court did not adjust the lodestar in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Padurjan argues first that the district court committed reversible error by setting the reasonable rate of his lead attorney, Chris Kleppin, at $225 per hour for purposes of calculating the lodestar. In support of this argument, Padurjan emphasizes that his attorney has charged clients, and has been awarded by other courts, $300 per hour in recent FLSA cases. He further emphasizes his attorney\u2019s training and success in FLSA litigation. To be sure, these are relevant considerations, but they are only <em>some </em>of the relevant considerations a court should take into account in fashioning the reasonable hourly rate. As we have explained, the court \u201cis itself an expert on the question and may consider its own knowledge and experience concerning reasonable and proper fees and may form an independent judgment either with or without the aid of witnesses as to value.\u201d <em>Loranger v. Stierheim, </em>10 F.3d 776, 781 (11th Cir.1994) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">That is precisely what the court did in this case. Specifically, in reasoning that Kleppin engaged in an \u201cinefficient, over-litigatory approach\u201d that warranted reducing the reasonable rate, the district court reached the sort of \u201cindependent judgment\u201d that the <em>Loranger </em>court encouraged. <em>Id. </em>Notably, the court also made clear that it was knowledgeable about a prior reduction in Kleppin\u2019s award on the same ground in another case, a ruling which this court ultimately affirmed. <em>See Perez v. Carey Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>373 Fed.Appx. 907, 912 (11th Cir.2010) (unpublished). While the unpublished opinion in <em>Perez </em>did not require the district court to impose a reduced fee, it is persuasive authority that reliance on these same factors did not constitute clear error. All of this review leads us to affirm the district court\u2019s decision to set Kleppin\u2019s fee at $225 per hour. <em>See Loranger, </em>10 F.3d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Padurjan next argues that the district court erred by holding that Padurjan could not recover fees incurred by his expert fee witness. As part of the parties\u2019 fee dispute, Padurjan employed the services of Marc Cooper, Esquire, who spent upwards of forty six hours analyzing and calculating the appropriate fee award in this case. Aventura responds that Cooper played no role in litigating the merits of the underlying FLSA claim, nor was he an expert witness appointed by the court. Aventura contends that, as a result, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., </em>482 U.S. 437, 107 S.Ct. 2494, 96 L.Ed.2d 385 (1987), precludes the award of Cooper\u2019s fee in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>We agree with Aventura. In <em>Crawford Fitting, </em>the Supreme Court held that the costs taxable in favor of a prevailing party are limited to those authorized in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. 482 U.S. at 442-45, 107 S.Ct. at 2497-99. We then applied this holding specifically to the statute at issue here \u2014 the FLSA \u2014 in <em>Glenn \u00b6. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>841 F.2d 1567 (11th Cir.1988), where we explained that the reasoning of <em>\u201cCrawford Fitting </em>indicates that, although a statute may shift <em>attorney </em>fees, the statute does not operate to shift <em>witness </em>fees unless the statute refers explicitly to witness fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1575. We conclude that no statute provides for Cooper\u2019s fees, and therefore that in light of <em>Glenn, </em>the district court did not err in refusing to award them.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Next, Padurjan argues that the district court erred by reducing the reasonable hours incurred by fixed percentages without providing precise justification for each hour reduced. Padurjan emphasizes that in <em>Norman v. Housing Auth. of the City of Montgomery, </em>836 F.2d 1292 (11th Cir.1988), this Court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that when reducing the reasonable hours to bill the losing party, \u201cthe district court must be reasonably precise in excluding hours thought to be unreasonable or unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. Padurjan submits that the district court\u2019s broad percentage cut runs afoul of our <em>Norman </em>rule. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Padurjan\u2019s argument fails because it ignores our more recent holding in <em>Loran-ger. </em>In that case we explained that \u201c[i]n a case ... where the fee motion and supporting documents are ... voluminous, it is sufficient for the court to provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the reduction.\u201d 10 F.3d at 783. The more than $200,000 Padurjan seeks in attorneys\u2019 fees is indication enough that this case is voluminous. As a result, because the district court \u2014 through adoption of the magistrate\u2019s thorough report and recommendations, which provided cut-by-cut explanations for each percentage-based reduction \u2014 provided at least a \u201cconcise but clear explanation of its reasons for the reduction,\u201d it did not err in effecting broad percentage-based deductions to the hours expended by Padurjan\u2019s attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Finally, Padurjan argues that the district court committed reversible error by refusing to award costs for certain depositions that did not comply with the restrictions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30. This argument is without merit. The sole case relied for by Padurjan, <em>EEOC v.W&amp;O, Inc., </em>213 F.3d 600 (11th Cir.2000), in relevant part holds only that it is reasonable for the district court to impose costs upon depositions taken with the knowledge of the party being taxed, where those depositions are \u201c necessarily obtained for use in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621 (quotation marks omitted). But <em>W &amp; O </em>does not support the proposition advanced by Padurjan \u2014 that the district court abuses its discretion in refusing to award deposition costs that are not \u201cnecessarily obtained for use in the case\u201d and exceed the bounds of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We therefore reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">For each of the above reasons, we affirm the fee award imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
