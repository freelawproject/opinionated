To be considered a career offender, a defendant must have had \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (a). Robinson conceded that one of his prior convictions on which the district court had previously relied qualified as a predicate felony offense under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), but argued that his other four prior convictions no longer qualified as \u201ccrime[s] of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). One of the convictions that Robinson challenged was a conviction for resisting arrest with violence under Florida Statute 843.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">We have recently held, however, that a prior conviction for resisting arrest with violence under Florida Statute 843.01 is categorically a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act. <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010). We have also held that because the definitions of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under ACCA and \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) are virtually identical, we consider cases interpreting one as authority in cases interpreting the other. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010). Robinson\u2019s prior conviction under Florida law for resisting arrest with violence is thus a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Because Robinson still has at least two qualifying prior convictions under \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), the district court did not err in denying his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
