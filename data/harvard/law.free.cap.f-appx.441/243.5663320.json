Although Guzman Pi\u00f1ales argues to the contrary, sentences within the properly-calculated guidelines range determined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 are entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Additionally, because Guzman Pi\u00f1ales did not object to his sentence as unreasonable in the district court, we review the reasonableness of the sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-23\">Guzman Pi\u00f1ales asserts that his sentence is unreasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 double counted his prior drug trafficking conviction by using it to determine both his offense level and his criminal history score. Because offense levels under \u00a7 2L1.2 are based upon defendants\u2019 criminal history instead of analysis of empirical data, national experience, and the offense conduct, he contends that his sentence was greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). A sentence calculated under \u00a7 2L1.2 is not unreasonable simply because the guideline double counts the defendant\u2019s criminal history or because the guideline lacks an empirical basis. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6) (a conviction that triggers the 16-level enhancement may be assigned criminal history points).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-24\">Next Guzman Pi\u00f1ales asserts that the 16-level enhancement he received for his prior drug trafficking conviction produced a sentencing range greater than necessary to deter future crime and protect the public. He notes that his crimes occurred in \u201cthe fairly distant past\u201d and he lived a peaceful and law abiding existence in Mexico for more than eight years before attempting to illegally reenter. He asserts that it was unreasonable to sentence him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the same as someone with a recent criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">The district court explicitly accounted for the fact that Guzman Pi\u00f1ales remained in Mexico for eight years by sentencing him at the bottom of the guidelines range instead of imposing a higher sentence. The court also carefully explained that a guidelines sentence was necessary to meet the sentencing goal of deterring future crimes because Guzman Pinales\u2019s children were United States citizens and the temptation to return to be with them would continue. That Guzman Pi\u00f1ales purportedly lived a law abiding lifestyle in Mexico does not affect the district court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Guzman Pi\u00f1ales also asserts that the Guidelines overstated the seriousness of his offenses because the underlying nonviolent conduct was akin to trespass. This argument fails to overcome the presumption that a guidelines sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2 is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 682-83 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Additionally, Guzman Pi\u00f1ales contends that his sentence failed to account for his history and the circumstances of his offense because he \u201cwas fleeing the drug violence that has made Juarez one of the most dangerous places in the world.\u201d He asserts that he tried to live in Juarez, but the violence \u201cwas brought to his door.\u201d He does not repeat the allegation in his written objections to the presentence report that he was under duress at the time of the offense because he was facing \u201ccertain death\u201d at the hands of drug traffickers whom he helped to convict. Instead he contends that the violence in Juarez mitigates in favor of a lower sentence by providing a motive for his attempted reentry. Assuming arguendo that a motive of avoiding violence is a factor that should receive significant weight in sentencing, the record contains no evidence that Guzman Pi\u00f1ales was facing a threat of violence when he entered the United States. He thus fails to show that his motive for entering the United States was a factor that should have received significant weight. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied,, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Finally, Guzman Pi\u00f1ales asserts that his sentence is unreasonable because of the unwarranted sentencing disparity between his sentence and sentences rendered in districts with fast-tract sentencing programs. Conceding that the issue is foreclosed by our precedent, he nevertheless raises it to preserve it for further review by the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">As Guzman Pi\u00f1ales has failed to demonstrate any error, plain or otherwise, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
