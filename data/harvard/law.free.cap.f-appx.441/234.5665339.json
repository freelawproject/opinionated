Burton\u2019s complaint, premised upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, alleged that during and before 2004, the defendants violated her constitutional rights, as well as state and federal law. The violations alleged by Burton include that she was subject to \u201ca plurality of United States Bill of Rights Violations,\u201d church/state violations, bias crime, forced exile, animal cruelty, and cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The district court found that Burton\u2019s allegations were \u201cwholly frivolous in both law and fact[,]\u201d as they were \u201ceither not actionable under any set of facts or not actionable in a federal court of limited jurisdiction.\u201d Burton\u2019s claims, the district court added, were also time-barred by Texas state law. The district court accordingly denied Burton\u2019s motions to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>(IFP), for appointment of counsel, and for service of process by U.S. Marshal, and dismissed her case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint as frivolous. <em>Macias v. Raul A. (Unknown), Badge No. 153, </em>23 F.3d 94, 97 (5th Cir.1994). An IFP proceeding may be dismissed if the complaint \u201clacks an arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Id.) see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). The district court has broad discretion in making its determination that a complaint is frivolous. <em>Macias, </em>23 F.3d at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">Burton argues \u201c[t]he Complaint pleadings were not malicious or frivolous[, neither were any delusions presented to the Court.\u201d Burton further argues that \u201c[t]he facts are not \u2018fantastic\u2019 ... and the \u2018legal theory\u2019 is relevant.\u201d Burton fails, however, to explain <em>why </em>her complaint is not deficient. Instead, her appellate briefs are conclusory, confirming that her claims are frivolous. <em>See Pedraza v. Meyer, </em>919 F.2d 317, 318 n. 1 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">Largely for the reasons articulated by the district court, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny Burton\u2019s motions and dismiss her case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
