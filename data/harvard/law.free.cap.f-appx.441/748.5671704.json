In Ground 6 of his motion, Bachiller alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge a jury instruction to determine the quantity of drugs individually attributable to him and the other defendants at his trial on drug, robbery, and firearm charges. We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-16\">Whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992), by failing to address Bachil-ler\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction requiring the jury to make a threshold determination of the drug quantity attributable to each defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-21\">In ground 6 of his motion to vacate, Bachiller fairly presented a claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction for the jury to make a threshold determination of the drug amount attributable to each defendant at his trial. The government concedes that the district court did not address this claim. We disagree with the contention of the government that Bachiller waived his argument by failing to raise it in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Accordingly, we vacate the order denying Bachiller\u2019s motion and remand with instructions to address the claim that he raised in ground 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-22\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
