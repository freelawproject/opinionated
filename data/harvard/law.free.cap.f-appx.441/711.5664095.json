California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel has correctly assessed the relative merit of this appeal from the judgment and commitment order entered in June 17, 2010. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from representing Gonzalez in his direct appeal is GRANTED, and the convictions and sentences imposed in the June order are AFFIRMED. Nevertheless, because the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter an amended judgment and commitment order on September 8, 2010, while the present appeal was pending, the judgment in this case is VACATED. The matter is now REMANDED for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to consider the government\u2019s motion to reduce Gonzalez\u2019s sentences, and to re-enter the amended judgment if it deems that action appropriate. <em>See United States v. Russell, </em>776 F.2d 955, 956 (11th Cir.1985) (holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain, during the pen-dency of an appeal, a motion filed pursuant to a prior version of Rule 35(b)); <em>see also United States v. Turchen, </em>187 F.3d 735, 743 (7th Cir.1999) (reaching the same conclusion with respect to a motion filed pursuant to the current version of Rule 35(b)).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
