On appeal, Li argues that the IJ and BIA erred in making an adverse credibility finding, and that he established eligibility for relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we dismiss Li\u2019s petition in part and deny it in part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>An adverse credibility finding may be based on inconsistencies and \u201cany inaccuracies or falsehoods in [an applicant\u2019s] statements, without regard to whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1 )(B)(iii). If the IJ and the BIA explicitly determine an alien is not credible, they must give \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for the adverse credibility determination. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe burden then shifts to the alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-3\">Here, the IJ and BIA provided specific, cogent reasons to support the adverse credibility finding, which Li failed to rebut. For instance, Li failed to detail his travel to Belize and his repatriation to China in his asylum application statement. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (noting the omission of significant events prior to a hearing may support an adverse credibility determination). Li also failed to adequately explain why the same photograph was used in multiple documents issued years apart by different agencies. Moreover, the documentary evidence provided by Li and the testimony provided by Li\u2019s wife do not provide corroboration to his testimony compelling reversal of the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1347 (11th Cir.2008) (stating an IJ is under no obligation to credit an applicant\u2019s documentary evidence or assign it decisive weight). Because Li failed to show the record compels reversal, we deny his petition for review with regard to his claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-15\">. Li also argues the BIA erred in determining he did not file his asylum application within one year after the date of his arrival in the United States. We lack jurisdiction to review this decision, and dismiss Li\u2019s petition with regard to this claim. <em>See Chacon-Botero </em>v. <em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-23\">. We review findings of fact under the substantial evidence test and must affirm the decision if it is \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). We also review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test and do not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ or BIA. <em>Id. </em>We may not overturn find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>ings of fact, including a credibility determination, unless the record compels it. <em>Id. </em>at 1287.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
