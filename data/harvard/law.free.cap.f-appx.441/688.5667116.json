Valle filed a complaint alleging violations of his constitutional rights on September 23, 2011, and he requests the court stay his execution so that his claims may be heard. Valle is scheduled to be executed today, Wednesday, September 28, 2011, at 4:00 p.m. Because Valle has not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">Valle contends his execution will violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution because he says he was denied clemency proceedings or alternatively was denied clemency itself without the benefit of a clemency investigation and clemency counsel. Valle previously litigated clemency claims in Florida state court, and the district court questioned whether the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine precluded review of Valle\u2019s claims in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-17\">We are not convinced that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars the exercise of jurisdiction here. \u201cThe <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine ... is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments ... and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). The doctrines of issue or claim preclusion may bar Valle\u2019s clemency claims, but we are not convinced that dismissal is warranted for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-18\">Turning then to Valle\u2019s motion to stay his execution, the district court concluded Valle failed to meet his burden of persua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>sion. A prisoner moving to stay his execution bears the burden of showing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\">(1) he has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">(2) he will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">(3) the stay would not substantially harm the other litigant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">(4) if issued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-8\"><em>DeYoung v. </em>Owens, 646 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2011) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">This court previously declined to stay Valle\u2019s execution because Valle had not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. <em>Valle v. Sec\u2019y Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>654 F.3d 1266, 2011 WL 3925753, at *2 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). We agree with and adopt the district court\u2019s reasoning on this issue. A stay of Valle\u2019s execution is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-14\">. The doctrine is named after two cases: <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.
