The district court reduced his sentences to 188 months of imprisonment pursuant to recent amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-22\">The website of the .Bureau of Prisons shows that Hall was released from prison on September 3, 2010. \u201cWhere a defendant has begun serving a term of supervised release, the appeal of the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is moot.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>645 F.3d 328, 328 (5th Cir.2011). Here, as with the defendant in <em>Booker, </em>Hall \u201cmakes no mention of his term of supervised release and does not argue that it should be terminated; his arguments pertain only to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any termination of supervised release must be sought by a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>645 F.3d at 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-23\">IT IS ORDERED that Hall\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED as unnecessary and the appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
