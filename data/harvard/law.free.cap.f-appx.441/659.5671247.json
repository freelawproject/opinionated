Squires challenges the finding that his part-time position as a custodian at a Duncan Donuts restaurant was substantial gainful activity for the purpose of establishing past relevant work. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">We review the decision by the Commissioner \u201cto determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). Substantial evidence consists of \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Squires\u2019s past employment constituted substantial gainful activity. A person is not disabled if he can return to his past relevant work, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), 416.920(a)(4)(iv), which includes work that he had performed \u201cwithin the past 15 years, that was substantial gainful activity, and that lasted long enough for [the claimant] to learn to do it,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1560(b)(1), 416.960(b)(1). In August 2005, Squires accepted a position as a custodian at a Duncan Donuts restaurant for which he was paid over $1,400 a month, which created a presumption that he had performed substantial gainful activity that year. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.15T4(b)(2)(ii), 416.974(b)(2)(ii). The custodial tasks that Squires performed daily at Duncan Donuts ranged from cleaning floors to making deliveries, which were significant physical and mental activities that qualified as substantial activity, notwithstanding the fact that Squires worked part-time. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1572(a), 416.972(a). Although Squires earned less in 2006 than in 2005, his work was a gainful activity because it was performed \u201cfor pay or profit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 404.1572(b), 416.972(b). Squires earned seven dollars an hour for his custodial services.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">We AFFIRM the judgment in favor of the Commissioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
