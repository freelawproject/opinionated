In March 2010, Scott moved the district court to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, a retroactive amendment that reduced the drug quantity thresholds and base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. The court denied his motion, and he appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">Scott argues that he was sentenced within the Guidelines sentencing range that would have been applicable under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, despite qualifying as a career offender, and that he was therefore eligible for a sentencing reduction based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He contends that under some circumstances courts have held that defendants who qualified as career offenders, but who received a downward departure from the Guidelines sentencing range, remain eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. Since he received such departure and a sentence within the sentencing range applicable if his offense level were fixed by \u00a7 2D 1.1, he should be resentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a \u201csentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706, which has been made retroactive, amends the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1325. However, if a defendant is a career offender, his base offense level is determined under the career offender guideline, \u00a7 4B1.1, and not the drug quantity guideline in \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. As such, Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering a career offender\u2019s applicable guideline sentencing range. <em>Id. </em>at 1328. Therefore, such a defendant\u2019s sentence is not based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered within the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the district courts are not authorized to reduce a sentence under that statute. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28, 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-16\">Further, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) modification \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). In addressing whether a defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction, a district court is to consider only the effect of the applicable guideline amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 780-81. Thus, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In this case, the district court properly denied Scott\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 706 did not lower Scott\u2019s career offender sentencing range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. Because Scott was sentenced as a career offender, under \u00a7 4B1.1, he was not entitled to an Amendment 706 sentence reduction. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28, 1330. Moreover, the district court correctly abstained from considering whether Scott\u2019s career offender designation was erroneous because it was not permitted to do so within a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780-81. Finally, no exceptions to the general rule that career offenders are ineligible for Amendment 706 reductions through \u00a7 3582, apply here, even assuming that they could.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
