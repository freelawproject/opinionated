At sentencing, Olivas contended: his 2007 deferred adjudication did <em>not </em>qualify as an aggravated felony under the statute; and, therefore, his offense was subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>a 10-year maximum sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(b)(1), rather than a 20-year maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The Government conceded the point, and the district court noted the correction. Nevertheless, the judgment of conviction did <em>not </em>reflect this fact and stated incorrectly that Olivas had been convicted under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Olivas contends the error: requires remand, for the judgment to be modified to reflect conviction and sentencing under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), not \u00a7 1326(b)(2); and entitles him to resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Regarding the modification, the Government concedes that Olivas had <em>not </em>been convicted of an aggravated felony before deportation and agrees the judgment must be reformed to reflect that Olivas was convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) because the written judgment conflicts with the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Olivas bases his assertion that he is entitled to resentencing on the claim that the district court committed procedural error by considering the aggravated felony conviction in determining his sentence. Our court reviews sentencing decisions for reasonableness, first ensuring that the district court did <em>not </em>commit significant procedural error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cA procedural error during sentencing is harmless if the error did <em>not </em>affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009) (citations and internal quotations marks omitted). The proponent of the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the error was harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The government asserts the error was harmless. On the other hand, Olivas contends that the district court, in imposing, <em>inter alia, </em>48 months\u2019 imprisonment, could have misunderstood he was subject to a 20-year, rather than a 10-year, maximum sentence. In any event, an error in the district court\u2019s understanding that occurred after sentencing is harmless. <em>See id. </em>at 753. At sentencing, the court ruled the 20-year maximum did <em>not </em>apply. And, at that same 16-minute hearing, the court ruled that a downward departure was appropriate, in part, \u201cto reflect the fact that [Olivas] did receive deferred adjudication in the aggravated assault case in the state court\u201d. These rulings show the district court understood the maximum sentence when it sentenced Olivas. Therefore, the error in the written judgment was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The judgment is modified to reflect a conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1), instead of \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and this matter is remanded to district court for the limited purpose of correcting the written judgment to reflect this modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED; LIMITED REMAND FOR CORRECTION OF JUDGMENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
