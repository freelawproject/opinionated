The Board affirmed the findings of the immigration judge that Agalliu failed to prove that she suffered past persecution or that she would be persecuted if she returned to Albania because of a fundamental change in country conditions. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">We review the decision of the Board for substantial evidence. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2009). Because \u201c[o]ur review for substantial evidence is highly deferential,\u201d we \u201c \u2018must affirm the decision of the Board if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351 (quoting <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001)). Even if the record supports a finding contrary to that reached by the Board, to reverse its decision \u201c\u2018we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Agalliu challenges the finding that she was not persecuted based on her political opinion, but we need not address that issue because, even if we assume that she suffered past persecution, substantial evidence supports the finding of the Board that there has been a fundamental change in country conditions. Agalliu alleged that, between 2002 and 2004, she was persecuted by members of the Socialist Party because she supported the Republican Party, but the record establishes that the strength of the Socialist Party diminished after the national elections in 2005. The 2006 Country Profile states that, as a result of the elections in 2005, the \u201cDemocratic Party and its allies,\u201d including the Republican Party, controlled a majority of Parliament and had elected the leader of the Democratic Party, Sali Berisha, as prime minister. Agalliu expresses fear of Socialists who have retained their positions under the new government, but the Profile states that \u201cneither the Government nor the major political parties engage in policies of abuse or coercion against their political opponents\u201d and, \u201c[wjhile serious political repression existed in the past, there are no indications of systemic political persecution in Albania at the present time.\u201d The substantial evidence of a charge in country conditions also means that the record does not compel a finding that Agalliu has an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution or that she is entitled to humanitarian asylum. Because Agalliu failed to establish that she was entitled to asylum, she also cannot satisfy the higher standards applied to applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232-33 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1201 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">We DENY the Agallius\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
