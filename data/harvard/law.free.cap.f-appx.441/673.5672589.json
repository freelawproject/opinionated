No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-22\">In dismissing Clark\u2019s section 2254 petition, the district court did not specify whether the dismissal was with or without prejudice. We granted a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court erred when it dismissed Clark\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for failure to exhaust state remedies by not ordering that the \u00a7 2254 petition be dismissed without prejudice!)]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-23\">In his opening brief on appeal, however, Clark does not address the issue set forth in the COA. \u201cWhile we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). Instead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Clark raised only issues that were outside the scope of the COA.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because our review is limited to those issues specified in the COA, we will not consider these arguments on appeal. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b700-17\"> In his brief, Clark argues that the state\u2019s delay in processing his state habeas petition deprived him of the opportunity to examine a key witness and impaired his ability to defend himself if he is granted a new trial. He also contends that he should be excused from the exhaustion requirement because the state ha-beas court's delay \u2014 and the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s failure to address all of the issues raised in his application for a certificate of probable cause \u2014 rendered his state remedies inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
