Boros checked the truck\u2019s registration and discovered that although at some point in the past the truck had been registered, the registration had been \u201ccancelled,\u201d meaning that it was not registered to anyone. And the truck did not sport a valid license tag. When Glover exited the Wal Mart with his wife and younger brother and drove away in the truck, Boros followed and initiated a traffic stop. After obtaining Glover\u2019s identification, Boros gave Glover a traffic citation for operating his truck without a tag in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 320.07(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Boros noted on the citation that this was a criminal offense requiring a court appearance. Boros also cited Glover for having no proof of insurance, in violation of \u00a7 316.646(1), and failure to produce proof of registration, in violation of \u00a7 320.0605 (neither a criminal offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">Boros arrested Glover and placed him in the back seat of his patrol car. Since Glover\u2019s wife was unable to drive<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his brother was a juvenile, Boros and Lt. David Krika, Boros\u2019s supervisor who had arrived on the scene, impounded the truck. A partial inventory search conducted at the scene pursuant to the police department\u2019s inventory policy yielded a white mask similar to the mask worn by the Winn Dixie robber, a loaded machine gun and ammunition. A subsequent search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>conducted at the impoundment lot pursuant to a search warrant uncovered two firearms, ammunition, controlled substances, and items apparently connected with the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">A federal grand jury indicted Glover for the Winn Dixie robbery and five other offenses based on the evidence seized in the above searches. Glover moved the district court to suppress such evidence, contending that his arrest was unlawful because Boros lacked cause to believe that his violation of \u00a7 820.07(3) was a criminal offense;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> hence, he could not detain him and his truck could not be searched either at the scene or at the impoundment lot. The Government, in response, argued that the arrest was lawful \u2014 that it was inconsequential that Boros\u2019s citation was for a non-criminal offense because Boros had probable cause to arrest Glover for violating \u00a7 820.02(1),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a misdemeanor of the second degree,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by driving an unregistered vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The district court denied Glover\u2019s motion to suppress. Glover thereafter stood trial and the jury convicted him of five of the six offenses charged in the indictment: Count One, robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951; Count Two, using a firearm while committing the robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1); Count Three, possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a); Count Five, possession of a machine gun in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(o), 924(a)(2); Count Six, possession of an unregistered machine gun in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5841, 5861(d), 5871. After he was sentenced,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Glover took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Glover seeks the vacation of his convictions on the ground that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He maintains that, because he initially was cited under Fla Stat. Ann. \u00a7 320.07(3), a non-criminal violation, because his truck did not display a license tag, Boros had no lawful basis to place him under arrest, despite the fact that his citation was later changed to reflect a violation of \u00a7 320.02(1), a criminal violation for driving an unregistered vehicle. He maintains, moreover, that the inventory search of his truck violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments because the impoundment was not a reasonable necessity and the police did not abide \"with standard police procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress as a mixed question of law and fact. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). Rulings of law are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>while the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. Factual findings are reviewed in the light most favorable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the prevailing party in the district court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The Fourth Amendment protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. A warrantless arrest without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1253 (11th Cir.2005). Probable cause to arrest exists when a police officer has a reasonable belief that a suspect committed or was committing a crime, based upon facts and circumstances within their knowledge. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>969 F.2d 999, 1002 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">\u201cFor probable cause to exist, an arrest must be objectively reasonable based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Street, </em>472 F.3d 1298, 1305 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). \u201cThe officer\u2019s own subjective opinions or beliefs about probable cause are irrelevant, because it is an objective standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAlong with reliable or corroborated tips, the observations and experiences of the law enforcement officers working a case must be weighed as a part of the totality of the circumstances that might create probable cause for an arrest.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>969 F.2d at 1003. \u201cWhen an officer makes an arrest, which is properly supported by probable cause to arrest for a certain offense, neither his subjective reliance on an offense for which no probable cause exists nor his verbal announcements of the wrong offense vitiates the arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>476 F.2d 5, 7 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Florida state law requires that \u201cevery owner or person in charge of a motor vehicle that is operated or driven on the roads of this state shall register the vehicle in this state.... A registration is not required for any motor vehicle that is not operated on the roads of this state during the registration period.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 320.02(1). The district court did not err in denying Glover\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence recovered from his vehicle based on his allegedly unlawful arrest. Although Officer Boros initially cited Glover under \u00a7 320.07(3) for driving without a tag, at the time of traffic stop he had sufficient probable cause to support Glover\u2019s arrest for a second degree misdemeanor. Glover was driving a vehicle not registered as required by \u00a7 320.02(1); in fact, the registration had been cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment generally requires police to secure a warrant before conducting a search.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Dyson, </em>527 U.S. 465, 466, 119 S.Ct. 2013, 2014, 144 L.Ed.2d 442 (1999). The Supreme Court has held that inventory searches, conducted pursuant to an established procedure, but without a warrant, on legally impounded vehicles are valid under the Fourth Amendment. <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 372-73, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3098-99, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976). In <em>Colorado v. Bertine, </em>the Supreme Court further explained that \u201c[njothing ... prohibits the exercise of police discretion [in deciding to impound a vehicle,] so long as that discretion is exercised according to standard criteria and on the basis of something other than suspicion of evidence of criminal activity.\u201d 479 U.S. 367, 375, 107 S.Ct. 738, 743, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987). Even if an arrestee\u2019s vehicle is not impeding traffic or otherwise presenting a hazard, police officers may impound a vehicle, but the decision to impound a vehicle must be made in good faith, based upon standard criteria, and not solely based upon \u201csuspicion of evidence of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Sammons v. Taylor, </em>967 F.2d 1533, 1543 (11th Cir.1992) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>(involving a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for damages for unlawful impoundment and search of vehicle). Additionally, if law enforcement officials have the authority to conduct a valid impoundment, they are not constitutionally required to permit an ar-restee to make an alternative disposition of his vehicle. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Furthermore, inventory searches, in accordance with police policy administered in good faith, are also permissible. <em>Bertine, </em>479 U.S. at 374, 107 S.Ct. at 742. An inventory search permits a thorough search of property lawfully in police custody, as long as that search is consistent with the police caretaking function. <em>United States v. O\u2019Bryant, </em>775 F.2d 1528, 1534 (11th Cir.1985). In this context, \u201cthe legitimacy of the search ... turns on its reasonableness in light of the community caretak-ing functions that allow inventory searches.... [T]he reasonableness of the inventory search depends on the particular facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Laing, </em>708 F.2d 1568, 1571 (11th Cir.1983) (internal citation omitted). A war-rantless inventory search of an automobile made \u201cpursuant to standard police procedures\u201d and for the purpose of \u201csecuring or protecting the car and its contents\u201d is a reasonable police intrusion that does not offend Fourth Amendment principles. <em>Op-perman, </em>428 U.S. at 372-73, 96 S.Ct. at 3098-99. The Supreme Court had identified three distinct interests that justify the inventory search of an automobile: (1) protection of the owner\u2019s property while it remains in police custody; (2) protection of the police against claims or disputes over lost or stolen property; and (3) protection of the police from potential danger. <em>Id. </em>at 369, 96 S.Ct. at 3097. \u201cAn inventory search is not a surrogate for investigation, and the scope of an inventory search may not exceed that necessary to accomplish the ends of the inventory.\u201d <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 958 (11th Cir.1990). We have held that \u201cthe mere expectation of uncovering evidence will not vitiate an otherwise valid inventory search.\u201d <em>United States v. Roberson, </em>897 F.2d 1092, 1096 (11th Cir.1990) (quotation omitted). The government has the burden to show the requirements of an inventory search have been met. <em>Sammons, </em>967 F.2d at 1543 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The district court correctly held that the officers\u2019 decision to impound Glover\u2019s truck was valid and based on the police department\u2019s written policies because the officers had no viable alternative to impoundment. Moreover, because officers had the authority to impound Glover\u2019s vehicle, the subsequent warrantless inventory search of his vehicle also was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-12\">.
