Defendant Pablo Lorenzo was a salesman employed by defendant Compacstone, a company that sells marble and quartz to be installed in homes. Plaintiff Alexia Fodere is a professional photographer who brought a copyright infringement action against the defendants. She alleged that they used the \u201cOrange Kitchen\u201d photograph she sold them for $600.00 for advertising, without her permission. The summary judgment was based on a finding that the defendants met their burden of establishing as an affirmative defense that the parties had an oral agreement granting the defendants an exclusive license to use the photograph for advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-19\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>\u201cconstruing all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Baby Buddies, Inc. v. Toys R Us, Inc., </em>611 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate when the record, taken as a whole, establishes that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.; </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-20\">Having carefully reviewed and considered the briefs and relevant parts of the record, we conclude that summary judgment was proper. Although Fodere claims that the photograph she sold the defendants was intended to be used only for \u201cpublic relations, website, [and] collateral usage,\u201d we agree with the district court that the \u201cambiguous\u201d statements in Fodere\u2019s deposition are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants were entitled to use the Orange Kitchen photograph for advertising purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
