Baltazar-Morale argues that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. Baltazar-Morale, a citizen of Mexico, was convicted of bank fraud, and in February 2010, Baltazar-Morale was deported from the United States on three years of supervised release subject to the condition that he refrain from reentering the United States without permission. In June 2010, Baltazar-Morale reentered the United States using a false identity, and later he received a sentence of three years of imprisonment for that crime. Baltazar-Morale argued for leniency based on his youth, his lack of education, and his need to support family in Mexico, but the district court was \u201cstruck by [Baltazar-Mo-rale\u2019s] series of determined and unhesitating violations, despite ... admonitions from\u201d the court and \u201chis agreement to abide by those obligations.\u201d The district court reasonably determined that a sentence of ten months of imprisonment that ran consecutive to Baltazar-Morale\u2019s three-year sentence for his illegal reentry would best address the \u201cpersistence of his offenses\u201d and his \u201cdisregard for the law,\u201d and would provide \u201cenhanced deterrence and ... protect the public.\u201d Baltazar-Morale\u2019s sentence, which is within the guideline range and falls well below the statutory maximum sentence, is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">We AFFIRM Baltazar-Morale\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
