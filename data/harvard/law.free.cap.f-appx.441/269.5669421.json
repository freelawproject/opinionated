He argues that his forty-six-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. Although he acknowledges that the presumption of reasonableness attaches to his within-guideline sentence, he contends that he can rebut the presumption because his sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a). He maintains that the sixteen-level increase to his offense level is excessive, given that his burglary conviction was long ago, in 1990. In support of his argument, he cites extra-circuit precedent and a proposed 2011 amendment to the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). Cavazos Carreon\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of his sentence does not rebut the presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Willingham, </em>497 F.3d 541, 544-45 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Rodarte-Vasquez, </em>488 F.3d 316, 322 (5th Cir.2007). Cavazos Carreon\u2019s alternative argument that his sentence is not presumptively reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is penologically flawed and not the result of empirical evidence or study is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Mondragortr-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">Cavazos Carreon also argues that the district court plainly erred in convicting, sentencing, and entering judgment against him under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), because he was not deported following a conviction for an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). He contends that the sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing or, in the alternative, for reformation of the judgment. The government agrees that the judgment erroneously reflects a conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), but the government states that the appropriate remedy is for this court to reform the judgment to reflect a conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">As Cavazos Carreon acknowledges, his claim is reviewed for plain error, because he did not raise it in the district court. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 368. The judgment does incorrectly cite to \u00a7 1326(b)(2) in light of the fact that Cavazos Carreoris burglary-of-a-habitation conviction, for which he received a sentence of deferred adjudication probation, does not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). <em>See Mondra-goiu-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 369. Cavazos Carreon acknowledges, however, that he cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights, given that the sentence is within a correctly calculated guideline range and does not exceed the statutory maximum of \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the judgment of sentence is AFFIRMED but REFORMED to reflect con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>viction and sentencing under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
