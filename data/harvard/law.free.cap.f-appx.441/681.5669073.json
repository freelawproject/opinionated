First, Sherman contends for the first time on appeal that the court erred when it impermissibly speculated he would be admitted to the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP) when it imposed his sentence. Second, Sherman asserts that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm Sherman\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">Upon a violation of supervised release, a district court may impose a sentence of incarceration after consideration of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), and (a)(4)-(7). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Specifically, the court may consider the need for the sentence \u201cto provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(2)(D); <em>see also United States v. Cook, </em>291 F.3d 1297, 1302 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">The district court did not plainly err when it considered Sherman\u2019s rehabilitative needs during sentencing. <em>See United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000) (noting that when a party does not first raise an issue before the district court, we review for plain error). The alleged error was not plain because precedent does not directly foreclose considering a defendant\u2019s rehabilitative needs when imposing a sentence upon revocation of his supervised release. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2005) (recognizing there is no plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>error if our precedent, or that of the United States Supreme Court, does not directly resolve the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1329. A sentence is substantively unreasonable if, after considering the totality of the facts and circumstances, \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d so that the sentence falls \u201coutside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), cert,. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Sherman\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable. The court based its sentence primarily on its perception of Sherman\u2019s dependency issues, his need to obtain substance abuse treatment and his inability to receive or successfully complete such treatment on his own. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). Sherman was initially incarcerated for a crack cocaine offense. He violated his subsequent supervised release by using cocaine or marijuana on at least three occasions, failing to submit to a drug test, and failing to successfully complete a substance abuse treatment program. When imposing this sentence, the court also considered the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence, and protect the public. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when sentencing Sherman.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
