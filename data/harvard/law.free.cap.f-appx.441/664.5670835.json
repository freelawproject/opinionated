The appellees removed the ease to the district court, and on appel-lees\u2019 motions to dismiss filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court dismissed Taylor\u2019s action as time-barred by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(4)(d), the two-year statute of limitations applicable to wrongful death actions. Taylor now appeals the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">\u2022 Taylor argues on appeal that the <em>res judicata </em>findings from <em>Engle v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>945 So.2d 1246, 1256 (Fla.2006), a Florida class-action suit against the appellee tobacco companies, tolled the statute of limitations until the discovery of the fraudulent concealment of the dangers of smoking. In <em>Engle, </em>the Florida Supreme Court upheld certain findings \u2014 regarding nicotine addiction, fraudulent concealment, and the effects of smoking \u2014 to be given <em>res judicata </em>effect in independent actions brought by class members against the tobacco companies. Taylor also contends that his claim was approved by the <em>Engle </em>Trust Fund, which demonstrates his membership in the <em>Engle </em>class, such that the district court\u2019s order dismissing his case was in direct conflict with the trustee\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, <em>Speaker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>623 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010), and the district court\u2019s application of state law in a diversity case, <em>Pendergast v. Sprint Nextel Corp., </em>592 F.3d 1119, 1132 n. 11 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">As the district court properly observed, the Florida statute of limitations for a wrongful-death action is two years. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(4)(d). <em>Engle </em>was filed in the Miami-Dade County Circuit Court in 1994; it was a class action against the appellee tobacco companies for injuries caused by smoking. <em>See id., </em>945 So.2d at 1256. The case came to the Florida Supreme Court from the Florida District Court of Appeal, <em>Liggett Group, Inc. v. Engle, </em>853 So.2d 434 (Fla. 3d DCA 2003). <em>Engle, </em>945 So.2d at 1254. <em>See also Brown v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>611 F.3d 1324, 1326-30 (11th Cir.2010) (providing a summary of the history of the <em>Engle </em>litigation). The Florida Supreme Court held that the class-action treatment of the case was not feasible and remanded the case with the instruction that the class be decertified. The court also held that the class members could file individual actions within one year of its mandate, with certain findings to be given <em>res judicata </em>effect. <em>Engle, </em>945 So.2d at 1276-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">In its analysis of the class certification, the Florida Supreme Court upheld the District Court of Appeal\u2019s reversal of the judgment the Miami-Dade County Circuit Court had entered in favor of a class-representative Frank Amodeo, because his claims had been time-barred by the statute of limitations prior to the filing of <em>Engle. Id. </em>at 1276; <em>see also Liggett Group, Inc. v. Engle, </em>853 So.2d 434, 455 n. 23 (Fla. 3d DCA 2003) (holding that Amodeo\u2019s claims were time barred under \u00a7 95.11(3)\u2019s four-year statute of limitations because he knew or should have known more than four years prior to the filing of the litigation that he was addicted to smoking and that his cancer could have been caused by smoking).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">The district court did not err in dismissing Taylor\u2019s complaint because his wrongful-death claim was barred by Fla. Stat. 95.11(4)(d). Additionally, as Taylor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>not a class member in <em>Engle, </em>he did not qualify for its one-year filing period.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
