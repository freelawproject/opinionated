(\u201cAUC\u201d) appeals from final orders of the district court denying AUC\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and motion for reconsideration of that denial. The district court denied AUC\u2019s motions after granting summary judgment in favor of AUC and against Defendants Wyckoff Heights Medical Center (\u201cWyckoff\u2019) and Brooklyn Queens Healthcare, Inc. (\u201cBQHC\u201d), jointly and severally, in the amount of $4,915,948.75 plus interest, in a breach of contract action arising out of a promissory note agreement (\u201cthe Note\u201d) lending money to Caritas Healthcare, Inc. (\u201cCaritas\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of BQHC, which also operates Wyckoff. On appeal, AUC argues that the district court erred in denying its motions because it failed to read the Note as a whole. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation of a contract\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee provision. <em>Frakenmuth Mut. Ins. Co. v. Escambia Cnty., </em>289 F.3d 723, 728 (11th Cir.2002). When attorney\u2019s fees are authorized, we review the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny them for abuse of discretion. <em>Davis v. Nat\u2019l Med. Enters., Inc., </em>253 F.3d 1314, 1318-19 (11th Cir.2001). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Cliff v. Payco Gen. Am. Credits, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 1113, 1121 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In this case, AUC, as the prevailing party in the underlying lawsuit, seeks attorney\u2019s fees from Defendants BQHC and Wyckoff based on the Note. In pertinent part, \u00b6 14 of the Note provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAF\">The Borrower, and each of them, if more than one, jointly and severally, promises and agrees to pay in the event of Default, all costs and expenses incurred in the collection of this Note Agreement, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">[D.E. 100 at 22], The Note identifies the relevant parties as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-11\">Caritas Healthcare Planning, Inc. (\u201cCar-itas\u201d or \u201cBorrower\u201d) [is] a New York corporation with offices located at 374 Stockholm Street, Brooklyn, New York 11237, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brooklyn Queens Healthcare, Inc. (\u201cBrooklyn Queens\u201d).... Brooklyn Queens also operates Wyckoff Heights Medical Center (\u201cWyckoff\u2019)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-12\"><em>{Id. </em>at 16].</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">Paragraph 17 of the Note further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-14\">Borrower and all sureties, endorsers and guarantors of this Note Agreement hereby ... (e) agree that, notwithstanding the occurrence of any of the foregoing (except the express written release by Lender or any such person), they shall be and remain jointly and severally, directly and primarily, liable for all sums due under this Note Agreement, and any other documents securing this Note Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-15\"><em>[Id </em>at 23].</p>\n<p id=\"b671-16\">As the district court found, the Note unambiguously forces only \u201cthe Borrower\u201d to pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs spent on collecting upon the Note. The Note further defines the \u201cBorrower\u201d only as Caritas, and not Wyckoff or BQHC. Because Florida law, the applicable law here, requires contractual provisions for attorney\u2019s fees to \u201cunambiguously state that intention and clearly identify the matter in which the attorney\u2019s fees are recoverable,\u201d <em>Sholkoff v. Boca Raton Comm,. Hasp., Inc., </em>693 So.2d 1114, 1118 (Fla.Dist. Ct.App.1997) (requiring parties to \u201cmanifest in some clear way\u201d an agreement to indemnify for attorney\u2019s fees through express language evidencing a \u201cmeeting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the minds\u201d), we cannot say that the Note unambiguously provides that AUC can recover attorney\u2019s fees from Wyckoff or BQHC. AUC therefore is not entitled to fees. <em>See Fla. Patient\u2019s Compensation Fund v. Rowe, </em>472 So.2d 1145, 1148 (Fla.1985) (\u201c[Attorney fees may be awarded by a court only when authorized by statute or by agreement of the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">AUC argues that by signing the Note, BQHC and Wyckoff became \u201csureties, endorsers and guarantors\u201d of the Note, and thereby agreed to pay any attorney\u2019s fees as a \u201csum due under this Note,\u201d pursuant to \u00b6 17. However, Florida law recognizes the \u201cdoctrine of expressio unius est exclu-sio alterius,\u201d which \u201cinstructs that when certain matters are mentioned in a contract, other similar matters not mentioned were intended to be excluded.\u201d <em>In re Celotex Corp., </em>487 F.3d 1320, 1334 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted); <em>accord Shumrak v. Broken Sound Club, Inc., </em>898 So.2d 1018, 1020 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005). The Note did not include BQHC or Wyckoff in the attorney\u2019s fees provision, \u00b6 14, even though it discussed the parties by their defined names in \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3, 4, 5, and 19\u2014 suggesting that if the parties had intended BQHC or Wyckoff to be liable for attorney\u2019s fees, they would have been expressly listed in that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Moreover, even assuming that the Note was referring to BQHC and Wyckoff as \u201csureties, endorsers and guarantors\u201d in the general \u201call sums due\u201d provision, \u00b6 17, this provision did not make any reference to attorney\u2019s fees. Because \u201c[a] contract provision specifically dealing with a particular subject controls over a general provision dealing with that same subject,\u201d <em>Colonial Bank, N.A. v. Taylor Morrison Serv., Inc. </em>10 So.3d 653, 655-56 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009), we cannot presume that the parties intended BQHC or Wyckoff to be liable for the attorney\u2019s fees listed in \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In short, reading the Note as a whole, we cannot agree with AUC that it is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees from BQHC or Wyckoff, based solely on a general contractual provision, when the specific attorney\u2019s fees provision made no reference to these parties. The district court therefore did not err in denying fees to AUC, or in denying its motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
