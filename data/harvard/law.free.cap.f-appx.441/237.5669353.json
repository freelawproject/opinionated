He argues on appeal that his sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-21\">When, as here, the district court has imposed a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Review is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-22\">We have considered and rejected Leonardo\u2019s argument that the Sentencing Guidelines overstate the seriousness of his offense by using a prior conviction to increase both his offense level and his criminal history score. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). His assertion that his illegal reentry was simply an international trespass is likewise unavailing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Leonardo properly acknowledges that his challenge to his sentence based on the lack of a \u201c \u2018fast track\u2019 \u201d program in the El Paso Division of the Western District of Texas is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-64 (5th Cir.2008). He has not shown that the sentencing court considered any irrelevant or improper factors or that the court made a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). Accordingly, Leonardo has failed to demonstrate that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
