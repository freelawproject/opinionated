Fuentes contends that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to articulate sufficient findings to support its length. His sentence fell at the top of the applicable 57-71 month Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">We review a sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This Court will not reverse a district court so long as the district court\u2019s ruling does not constitute a clear error of judgment. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). Ordinarily, we expect sentences within the recommended Guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-16\">The record here shows that Fuentes\u2019s argument is without merit. The district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and clearly articulated its reasoning for concluding that a sentence at the high-end of the Guidelines range was necessary to comply with the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
