The resolution of this appeal depends upon a question of law, namely whether an understatement of income resulting from an overstatement of the tax basis of sold property can qualify as an omission from gross income giving rise to the extended six-year period for tax assessment. Based upon a decision of this Court, <em>Burks v. United States, </em>633 F.3d 347 (5th Cir.2011), the Tax Court answered that question in the negative and granted the taxpayer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Commissioner agrees that <em>Burks </em>controls the law in the circuit on that question and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the Tax Court correctly applied that law, but took this protective appeal in an effort to obtain a review by the Supreme Court. We are, of course, bound by <em>Burks </em>and therefore affirm the judgment of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In 1998, Robert Nalley (\u201cNalley\u201d) began the process of selling stock that he owned in four companies and terminating his rights in a deferred compensation program. To avoid tax liability on the gains stemming from those actions, Nalley, as part of what is known as a \u201cBasis Enhancing Transaction,\u201d formed R and J Partners (\u201cthe Partnership\u201d). Nalley transferred the stock to the Partnership, and the Partnership sold it. That sale artificially enhanced Nalley\u2019s basis in the Partnership, which led to an understatement of the Partnership\u2019s capital gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In 2006, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment (\u201cFPAA\u201d) with respect to the Partnership\u2019s 1998 tax year. The Partnership filed a petition with the Tax Court, asserting that the FPAA was issued after the expiration of the normal three-year assessment period and was therefore invalid. The Commissioner argued that the overstatement of Nalley\u2019s basis in the Partnership triggered \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provides for an extended six-year assessment period when a taxpayer \u201comits from gross income an amount properly includable therein which is in excess of 25 percent of the amount of gross income stated in the return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">The Tax Court granted the Partnership\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that an overstatement of basis did not qualify as an omission from gross income under I.R.C. \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A) and therefore did not trigger the extended limitations period. The Tax Court relied both on its own precedent and on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Burks v. United States, </em>which held that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Colony, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>357 U.S. 28, 78 S.Ct. 1033, 2 L.Ed.2d 1119 (1958), is controlling as to the current Tax Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">This appeal by the Commissioner followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-15\">We apply the same standard of review to appeals of tax court decisions as apply to federal district court decisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the court below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-17\">This appeal concerns a pure question of law: whether an overstatement of basis qualifies as an omission from gross income. As both parties acknowledge, that question was recently answered in the negative by this Court in <em>Burks v. United States, </em>633 F.3d 347 (5th Cir.2011). In <em>Burks, </em>this Court held that the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Colony </em>decision, holding that an overstatement of basis cannot qualify as an omission from gross income, applies to the 1954 Tax Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>as well as its 1939 predecessor and is therefore controlling precedent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court in <em>Burks </em>also held that recent Treasury regulations interpreting omissions from gross income as including overstatement of basis are not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference, because the statutory language that those regulations purport to interpret is unambiguous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The circuits are split on this question. A pre-regulation Ninth Circuit decision held that <em>Colony </em>is controlling, but did not foreclose the possibility of reasonable Treasury regulations interpreting the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Fourth Circuit recently agreed with our reasoning that the <em>Colony </em>decision is controlling, and that the Treasury regulations are not entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Four circuits have adopted the Commissioner\u2019s view, holding either that <em>Colony </em>does not apply to the 1954 Code<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or that the statute is ambiguous and we must defer to the regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">This Court, however, is bound by the decisions of the Circuit and we, therefore, AFFIRM the judgment of the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
