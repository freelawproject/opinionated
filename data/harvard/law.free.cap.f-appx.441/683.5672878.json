Meeks alleges MAG violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681 <em>et seq., </em>and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1691, <em>et seq., </em>and Regulation B, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 202.1, <em>et seq. </em>(ECOA). Meeks argues the district court erred: (1) when it construed the credit contract signed by Meeks and MAG; and (2) when it applied the FCRA, the ECOA, and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned December 15, 2010, opinion. The district court did not err when it construed the credit contract signed by Meeks and MAG, nor did it err when it applied the FCRA, the ECOA, and the TILA to Meeks\u2019 claims. The district court was correct that MAG acted with a permissible purpose under the FCRA in each of the credit pulls at issue in this case and that MAG was not obligated to provide Meeks with a notice of adverse action under the ECOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Further, insofar as Meeks argues MAG violated \u00a7 1681 b(f)(2) of the FCRA, she failed to raise this argument before the district court and we will not consider it now. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cThis Court has repeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d) (quotations omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\">. Meeks also argued the district court erred by failing to find two Florida statutes unconstitutional, but then expressly withdrew this argument in her Reply Brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-22\">.
