Simmons argues that the affidavit in support of the search warrant failed to provide probable cause to search his home, the warrant \u201cfail[ed] to state with any particularity\u201d the items to be seized, and the search of his home exceeded the scope of the search warrant. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">The district court did not err when it denied Simmons\u2019s motion to suppress. The affidavit provided probable cause to conclude that Simmons had used a cellular telephone to threaten to kill officers of the Birmingham Police Department and that the cellular telephone was located inside Simmons\u2019s residence. <em>See United States v. Kapordelis, </em>569 F.3d 1291, 1310 (11th Cir.2009). The affidavit stated that Simmons had made the threat that morning \u201cfrom a cellular phone ... number (714) 213-1425\u201d that Simmons \u201cdid not have ... in his possession\u201d when he had been arrested, and that officers had observed Simmons go \u201cto and from [his] residence since the phone call was received and before his arrest.\u201d Because of the open-ended nature of Simmons\u2019s threat, the warrant, which permitted officers to seize \u201cany and all evidence of the crime of a terrorist threat from a cellular phone ... number (714) 213-1425,\u201d was \u201cas specific as the circumstances and the nature of the activity under investigation permitted],\u201d <em>United States v. Blum, </em>753 F.2d 999, 1001 (11th Cir.1985). The warrant gave the officers lawful access to Simmons\u2019s house and permitted them to make \u201ca search ... [as] extensive as reasonably necessary ... to locate\u201d Simmons\u2019s cellular telephone and any object that he could use to effectuate his threat. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>120 F.3d 1226, 1228 (11th Cir.1997). Based on that warrant, Officer Carla Bing-ham was permitted to search a duffle bag that she observed lying open on the floor and inside which she discovered components used to make a pipe bomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">We AFFIRM Simmons\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
