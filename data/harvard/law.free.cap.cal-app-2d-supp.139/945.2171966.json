In this agreement respondent declared: \u201cAll my tools and \u00e9quipment are the property of Oscar Hagele until this amount (above), is paid in full. Upon full payment tools and equipment will be returned to me. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">Five and one-half weeks later the agreement was modified and the then remaining indebtedness ($297.42) was represented by a promissory note for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">This promissory note contained the following language: \u201cAll my mechanical tools and equipment remain the property of O. Hagele until note is paid in full, and are loaned to me. .'. .\u201d This note was signed by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">The alleged detention of which respondent complained' was from September 8, 1954, to October 19, 1954. During that period of time the title to the property was in the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number><em>Second: </em>The measure of damages for the loss of the use of personal property is the reasonable value of the use thereof during the period of detention. This is not the measure used by the trial court or by respondent in his pleading. <em>Dunlop </em>v. <em>Farmer, </em>64 Cal.App. 691 [222 P. 640].</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\"><em>Third: </em>The parties agreed upon the amount of any credit or offset to which the respondent might be entitled when they settled the $400 obligation dated September 11, 1954, by crediting respondent with the sum of $102.58 and giving and accepting a note for $297.42 on October 19, 1954, which was over one month after the $400 amount was agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">The parties must be presumed to have arrived at the later sum after a full weighing of their respective demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">The judgment is modified as follows: the appellant shall and does have judgment against the respondent for the sum of $287.42, principal; for the sum of $27.57, interest; for the sum of $50 as and for attorney\u2019s fees; and for his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Coughlin, P.
