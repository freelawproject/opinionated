We decided that the words might reasonably be construed to evidence a legislative intent to prohibit a representation that one who rendered architectural services without a license was, in fact, licensed to do so under the act. (\u00a7 5500.) By such construction we decided the constitutionality of the act was saved. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>131 Cal.App.2d Supp. 853 [281 P.2d 384].) It is conceded for the purposes of the present appeal that defendant has not violated the act otherwise, and this includes the giving of written notice to his employer before he rendered the particular services authorized by section 5537.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">The People contend that the initials A.I.A. attached to defendant\u2019s name, when used in conjunction with the word \u201cdesign,\u201d amounted to a false advertisement that defendant was licensed as an architect under the act. The argument is made that since the initials A.I.A. mean membership in the American Institute of Architects, a designer who makes known the fact of his membership in this American institute is somehow or to some extent representing that he is licensed by the state. Under our federal system each of Us is aware that he is a citizen of the nation at large, an American, as well as a citizen of the state where he may be domiciled. The use of the word American seems to suggest a national rather than a state institution.  There is no evidence in the whole or any part of the Architects\u2019 Act that the state forbids a designer or owner\u2019s agent to be a member of the American Institute, but there is in section 5537 conditional provision for designers to draw plans and specifications and render other architectural services though not licensed by the state. We hold that with the authority goes the right to inform the public. What the defendant has said in this regard is both true and forthright and constitutes no violation of section 5536.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">Turrentine, P. J., and Glen, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
