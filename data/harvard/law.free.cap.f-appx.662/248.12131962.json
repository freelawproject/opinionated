(\u201cClarke\u2019s\u201d) brought a suit in federal district court, seeking to vacate or modify an arbitration award granted in favor of Defendant-Appellee Rail Source Fuel, L.L.C. (\u201cRSF\u201d). On RSF\u2019s motion, the district court confirmed the award in full. Clarke\u2019s now appeals. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">In 2011, RSF contracted with Clarke\u2019s to convert its tie-grinding operation from a diesel to an electric-powered system. A short while after the conversion project began, several problems arose and many component parts needed to be either repaired or replaced. Dissatisfied with Clarke\u2019s service and equipment, RSF decided to use another company for its conversion project, ultimately paying Clarke\u2019s only $916,850.77 of the $1,072,351.18 contract price. As a result, Clarke\u2019s brought a mechanic\u2019s lien enforcement action in a Texas state court for the remaining $155,500.41. RSF then removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Once in federal district court, citing the contract\u2019s arbitration clause and bringing breach of contract, fraud, lost profits, and negligent misrepresentation counterclaims, RSF moved for the ease to be sent to arbitration. Pursuant to the contract, the district court transferred the case to the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">After reviewing the contract\u2019s provisions, several affidavits, and the relevant case law, the AAA arbitrator found in favor of RSF, awarding it $916,850.77, the price paid under the contract, but denied RSF\u2019s fraud, lost profits, and negligent misrepresentation claims. Moreover, in awarding this amount, the arbitrator denied Clarke\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien, finding it lacked merit. Thereafter, RSF moved for Clarke\u2019s to pay attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Finding that RSF had failed to provide him with contemporaneous time records, the arbitrator concluded that RSF was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. The arbitrator did, however, find that RSF was entitled to $193,352.59, the reasonable costs associated with defending against Clarke\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-18\">On January 6, 2015, RSF moved for the federal district court to confirm the arbitration award. On February 6, 2015, Clarke\u2019s moved to vacate or modify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>award. The district court granted RSF\u2019s motion in full, denying Clarke\u2019s. Clarke\u2019s appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s confirmation of an arbitrator\u2019s award de novo. <em>Timegate Studios, Inc. v. Southpeak Interactive, L.L.C., </em>713 F.3d 797, 802 (5th Cir. 2013). In reviewing the district court\u2019s \u2022judgment, however, we afford the arbitrator\u2019s award great deference. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Executone Info. Sys., Inc. v. Davis, </em>26 F.3d 1314, 1320 (5th Cir. 1994)). The court must refrain from analyzing an arbitrator\u2019s decision on the merits. <em>Major League Baseball Players Ass\u2019n v. Garvey, </em>532 U.S. 504, 509, 121 S.Ct. 1724, 149 L.Ed.2d 740 (2001) (citing <em>Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 36, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987)). Similarly, even if the arbitrator applied the governing law incorrectly, that alone is not grounds for setting the award aside. <em>Kergosien v. Ocean Energy, Inc., </em>390 F.3d 346, 356 (5th Cir. 2004). If the \u201c \u2018arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,\u2019 the fact that \u2018a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Garvey, </em>532 U.S. at 509,121 S.Ct. 1724 (quoting <em>E. Associated Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers of Am., </em>531 U.S. 57, 62, 121 S.Ct. 462, 148 L.Ed.2d 354 (2000)). To vacate or modify an arbitration award, the arbitrator\u2019s award must be \u201cso unfounded in reason and fact, so unconnected with the wording and purpose <em>of </em>the [contract,] as to \u2018manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator.\u2019 \u201d <em>Timegate Studios, </em>713 F.3d at 803 (quoting <em>Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v. Cent. of Ga. Ry., </em>415 F.2d 403, 415 (5th Cir. 1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\u2022 Clarke\u2019s raises three issues on appeal: that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by granting RSF (1) an unauthorized rescission remedy, (2) a remedy that conflicted with the terms of the underlying contract, and (3) unsegregated costs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Clarke\u2019s argues that by awarding what it characterizes as a \u201crescission remedy,\u201d the arbitrator awarded damages for which RSF did not ask, thereby exceeding his authority in violation of .9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10(a)(4) and 11(b). RSF counters by asserting that the arbitrator\u2019s award was not a rescission remedy, but rather damages \u201cconsisting of the undisputed amounts paid to Clarke\u2019s,\u201d a point the-arbitrator stressed in his final award. RSF further notes that, although it did not request a <em>rescission, </em>it did request damages for Clarke\u2019s breach of contract, including any amounts RSF paid to Clarke\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">in making his final award, the arbitrator found that, because Clarke\u2019s work was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>many ways defective, RSF rightfully rejected the work as a whole, citing to OR. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 72.3160(2) and noting that RSF had not waived the warranty of merchantability. In rendering his $916,850.77 award, the arbitrator noted that this was the total amount RSF paid Clarke\u2019s. Thus, the arbitrator did not award an improper rescission remedy, but rather damages that \u201carguably constru[e] or appl[y] the contract.\u201d <em>Garvey, </em>532 U.S. at 509, 121 S.Ct. 1724 (quoting <em>E. Associated Coal Corp., </em>531 U.S. at 62, 121 S.Ct. 462). Accordingly, we will not overturn the award on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The second issue Clarke\u2019s raises is that the arbitrator\u2019s damages award directly conflicts with the terms of Clarke\u2019s agreement with RSF, which limits damages for breach of warranty to the repair and replacement of any defective equipment. Further, Clarke\u2019s contends that Oregon law regarding construction contracts, not the Oregon Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d), should govern here. RSF, on the other hand, asserts that the arbitrator\u2019s application of the Oregon UCC was propel', as its contract with Clarke\u2019s is titled \u201cAgreement For The Sale Of Goods With Installation Services,\u201d and the contract outlines the manufacture, sale, and installation of the equipment Clarke\u2019s agreed to supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Under Oregon law, \u201c[wjhere circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in the [UCC].\u201d <em>Young v. Hessel Tractor &amp; Equip. Co., </em>99 Or.App. 262, 782 P.2d 164, 167 (1989) (quoting Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 72.7190). Because the arbitrator found that the exclusive remedy listed in Clarke\u2019s contract with RSF failed of its essential purpose, revocation of acceptance became an available remedy, <em>see id. </em>a remedy rationally infera-ble from the' purpose of .the underlying agreement. <em>See Timegate Studios, </em>713 F.3d at 802; <em>Executone, </em>26 F.3d at 1325 (\u201c[T]he remedy lies beyond the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction only if there is no rational way to explain the remedy handed down by the arbitrator as a logical means of furthering the aims of the contract.\u201d (citation omitted)). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s confirmation of the damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Finally, Clarke\u2019s argues that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in awarding RSF unsegregated costs. RSF counters by pointing out that the expenses associated with bringing its breach of contract claim against Clarke\u2019s\u2014a claim under which RSF is not entitled to expenses\u2014served \u201cdouble duty\u201d in defending against Clarke\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien claim\u2014a claim pursuant to which RSF <em>is </em>entitled to fees and expenses. Thus, RSF argues, the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in awarding RSF $193,352.59 in expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">The arbitrator determined that because Clarke\u2019s did not recover on its mechanic\u2019s lien, RSF was entitled to costs and expenses associated with defending that claim. After noting that, under Texas law, claimants must segregate fees between recoverable and unrecoverable claims, the arbitrator explained that some fees associated with multiple claims can serve double duty, in that the claims\u2019 \u201cprosecution or defense entail[] proof or denial of essentially the same facts.\u201d <em>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, </em>212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006) (quoting <em>Flint &amp; Assocs. v. Intercontinental Pipe &amp; Steel, Inc., </em>739 S.W.2d 622, 624-25 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 1987, writ denied)). Concluding that \u201cthe work necessary to defend the mechanic\u2019s lien was inextricably intertwined with the efforts to handle the claims for breach of contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>and misrepresentation,\u201d the arbitrator found that RSF was entitled to reasonable costs. Because the arbitrator\u2019s award is based on the essence of RSF and Clarke\u2019s contract and does not amount to manifest infidelity, we affirm the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>See Timegate Studios, </em>713 F.3d at 802-03.</p>\n<p id=\"A24\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the arbitration award in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-6\">. Clarke\u2019s also brings several evidentiary challenges, alleging that the evidence before the arbitrator did not support the award. Clarke's does not, however, allege that the arbitrator made these determinations in bad faith. Because \"[w]hen an arbitrator resolves disputes regarding the application of a contract, and no dishonesty is alleged, the arbitrator\u2019s \u2018improvident, even silly, factfinding\u2019 does not provide a basis for a reviewing court to refuse to enforce the award,\u201d we need not address these issues. <em>Major League Baseball Players Ass'n v. Garvey, </em>532 U.S. 504, 509, 121 S.Ct. 1724, 149 L.Ed.2d 740 (2001) (quoting <em>Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S, 29, 38, 108 S.Ct 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987)); <em>see also </em>Christopher D. Kratovil, <em>Judicial Review of Arbitration Awards in the Fifth Circuit, </em>38 St. Mary's L.X 471, 478 (2007) (\u201d[N]one of the four FAA statutory grounds for vacating an arbitration award is designed to correct a good-faith error of fact or law by the arbitrator, no matter how egregious.\u201d (citing <em>Garvey, </em>532 U.S. at 509, 121 S.Ct, 1724)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
