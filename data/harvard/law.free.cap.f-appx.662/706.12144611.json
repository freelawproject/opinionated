After review, we deny Murphy\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-20\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b725-21\">A. Murphy\u2019s Overstay and Federal Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b725-22\">Murphy, a native and citizen of Jamaica, entered the United States in December 1990 on a one-year tourist visa and has remained in the United States ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-23\">In December 2003, Murphy obtained a Florida driver\u2019s license in the name of \u201cDarien Dukelly.\u201d Murphy\u2019s application for the driver\u2019s license indicated that \u201cDukelly\u201d was born in the United States Virgin Islands. The Department of Motor Vehicles also received a copy of a U.S. Virgin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Islands birth certificate in the name of Darien Dukelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">In December 2005, Murphy applied for and received several credit cards using a false social security number. In January 2006, Murphy secured a vehicle loan using the same false social security number and purchased a truck for his landscaping business. As a result of these activities, in August 2010, Murphy pled guilty to, and was convicted in federal court of, false use of a social security number, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B), and aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A. Murphy served a 24-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">B.Notice to Appear</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Murphy was placed in removal proceedings in February 2010. After Murphy completed his federal sentence, the Department of Homeland Security served him with an amended Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d). The NTA alleged that Murphy (1) was admitted to the United States on or about December 20,1990, as a nonimmi-grant visitor for pleasure (B2 visa) with authorization to remain in the United States for a maximum period not to exceed one year; (2) remained in the United States longer than one year; (8) in December 2003, represented himself to be a citizen of the United States for the purpose of obtaining a Florida driver\u2019s license by presenting a U.S. Virgin Islands birth certificate to the Florida Department of Motor Vehicles (\u201cDMV\u201d); and (4) in December 2010, was convicted of false use of a social security number and aggravated identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Accordingly, the NTA charged Murphy with these three grounds of removability: (1) under INA \u00a7 237 (a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as an alien who remained in the United States longer than permitted; (2) under INA \u00a7 237(a)(3)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D), as an alien who made a false claim of citizenship; and (3) under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony theft offense, as defined in INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(G), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). Murphy, through counsel, admitted all of the NTA\u2019s factual allegations, except that he had misrepresented his citizenship to the Florida DMV. Murphy also conceded removability for overstaying his visa, the first ground, but denied the second and third grounds, falsely claiming U.S. citizenship and being convicted of an <em>aggravated </em>felony theft offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">C. Applications for Adjustment of Status and Waiver of Inadmissibility</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">In July 2011, Murphy filed an 1-485 application for adjustment of status to lawful permanent residence under INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a), along with an 1-601 application for waiver of inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1182(h), based upon his marriage to his U.S. citizen wife, with whom he has four U.S.-born children.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">D. Merits Hearing Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">At a 2013 merits hearing, the IJ heard testimony from Murphy, his wife, a neighbor and friend, and a therapist who had treated Murphy\u2019s family and prepared an expert report opining on the hardships Murphy\u2019s family faced if he were removed from the United States. Relevant to this appeal, Murphy testified, inter alia, that in 2003 he paid a man named Patrick $1,500 to get him a Florida driver\u2019s license. Murphy gave Patrick the made-up name Dar-ien Dukelly, a birth date, and photographs of himself he had taken at a CVS store. Two weeks later, Patrick delivered the Florida license in an envelope. Murphy claimed he did not go to the DMV himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>did not submit the U.S. Virgin Islands birth certif\u00edcate to the DMV, and did not represent to the DMV that he was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Approximately a year later, Murphy went to the DMV to obtain a replacement driver\u2019s license and had a new picture taken, but he was not required to fill out any paperwork or submit any forms and was not asked if he was a U.S. citizen. At some point, Murphy also obtained a Florida identification card with the name Darien Dukelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The DHS submitted the Florida DMV information for Darien Dukelly, which listed Dukelly\u2019s state of birth as the U.S. Virgin Islands and indicated that Dukelly was a U.S. citizen. The DMV information also contained a copy of a U.S. Virgin Islands birth certificate in the name of Darien Dukelly. According to the DMV information, Murphy obtained a replacement driver\u2019s license in the name Darien Dukelly on March 10, 2005, and a duplicate driver\u2019s license on January 25, 2007. On October 17, 2007, he obtained another duplicate driver\u2019s license and an original identification card in the name Darien Dukelly, which also indicated he was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">E. IJ\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The IJ found Murphy\u2019s account of how he obtained the Florida driver\u2019s licenses and identification card implausible and not credible. The IJ noted that, under Florida law, an applicant must indicate his country of birth to obtain an identification card and that Florida DMVs records indicated Dar-ien Dukelly was a U.S. citizen. The IJ found that it was likely Murphy had represented himself as a U.S. citizen to the DMV to obtain the identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">As to removability, the IJ noted that Murphy had conceded removability for overstaying his visa. The IJ rejected the NTA\u2019s charge that Murphy was removable based on his aggravated identify theft conviction, concluding that this conviction did not qualify as an aggravated felony theft offense under INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(G), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). However, the IJ sustained the NTA\u2019s charge of removability for making a false claim of citizenship under INA \u00a7 237(a)(3)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D), because Murphy went in person to the DMV, knowingly represented himself to be a U.S. citizen on his application, and certified that the information on his application was true in order to obtain a Florida identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">The IJ denied Murphy\u2019s applications for adjustment of status and waiver of inadmissibility. The IJ concluded that Murphy had failed to carry his burden to show he was admissible or, if inadmissible, eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility. In particular, the IJ found that Murphy was inadmissible because (1) he had been convicted of false use of a social security number, which was a crime involving moral turpitude; and (2) he had falsely represented himself as a U.S. citizen to obtain a benefit. Because the second ground for inadmissibility cannot be waived, the IJ concluded that Murphy had failed to show he was statutorily eligible to adjust his status. The IJ ordered Murphy removed from the United States to Jamaica.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">F. BIA\u2019s Final Order</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Because Murphy conceded removability for overstaying his visa, the BIA \u201cdeclined to consider [Murphy\u2019s] arguments regarding his false claim of United States citizenship inasmuch as it relates to his deportability,\u201d and instead \u201cexamine[d] whether [Murphy] carried his burden of proof in establishing his admissibility to the United States for purposes of obtaining relief from removal in the form of adjustment of status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>As to Murphy\u2019s eligibility for adjustment of status, the BIA found the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not clearly erroneous. The BIA noted that the IJ \u201cfound [Murphy\u2019s] account of events to be implausible, as it was undermined by the DMV\u2019s standard practice of taking pictures on-site in issuing licenses and identification documents.\u201d The BIA concluded that the IJ reasonably relied upon Florida\u2019s statutorily mandated requirements for receiving identification cards. Because the BIA found no clear error in the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Murphy did not meet his burden to establish he was not inadmissible for making a false claim of U.S. citizenship, for which no waiver of inadmissibility was available. Therefore, the BIA concluded, Murphy was also statutorily ineligible for an adjustment of sta-' tus.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The BIA rejected Murphy\u2019s argument that the IJ violated his due process rights by, inter alia, impermissibly shifting the burden of proof to Murphy. The BIA explained that Murphy conceded his remova-bility for overstaying his visa and carried the burden to establish his admissibility and eligibility for adjustment of status. The BIA also rejected Murphy\u2019s suggestion that the IJ showed bias or acted im-permissibly when he discussed Florida\u2019s statutory requirements for obtaining a state identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">A. Removability and Adjustment of Status</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">An alien is removable if the alien is within one or more classes as specified by the INA. See INA \u00a7 237 (a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a). Those classes include staying longer than permitted and making a false claim of U.S. citizenship. See INA \u00a7 237 (a)(1)(B) &amp; (a)(3)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) <em>&amp; </em>(a)(3)(D). The government bears the burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the alien is removable. INA \u00a7 240(c)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A); see also Woodby v. INS, 385 U.S. 276, 277, 87 S.Ct. 483, 484, 17 L.Ed.2d 362 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">The Attorney General, at her discretion, may adjust the status of an alien to that of lawful permanent resident if, among other requirements, the alien is admissible for permanent residence, INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a)(2). An alien who falsely represented himself as a U.S. citizen in order to obtain a benefit under state or federal law is not admissible. INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii)(I). Furthermore, the INA does not authorize a waiver in these circumstances. See INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(iii); see also INA \u00a7 212(h), (i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), (i). Thus, an alien who falsely claims U.S. citizenship is not eligible for an adjustment of status. See IblA \u00a7 245(a)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"ALx\">An alien applying for adjustment of status has the burden of proving he satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements. INA \u00a7 240(c)(4)(A)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A)(i). If the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply, the alien has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8; see also INA \u00a7 240(c)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A) (\u201c[I]f the alien is an applicant for admission,\u201d then the alien has the burden of establishing \u201cthat the alien is clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-14\">B. Murphy\u2019s Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b728-15\">In his petition for review, Murphy does not challenge the BIA\u2019s conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>that he is removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for having overstayed his visa. Instead, Murphy argues that the BIA was required to also address whether he was removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(3)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D), for making a false claim of U.S. citizenship before addressing his application for adjustment of status and that its failure to do so improperly shifted the burden of proof to Murphy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Murphy\u2019s claim .as to the burden of proof lacks merit. Murphy conceded his removability for overstaying his visa. Accordingly, the government\u2019s burden to prove removability had been met. The BIA\u2019s decision not to address Murphy\u2019s arguments regarding another ground for removability\u2014falsely claiming U.S. citizenship\u2014did not shift the government\u2019s burden of proof as to removability to Murphy. Rather, because Murphy conceded remov-ability, the BIA turned to Murphy\u2019s request for relief from removal in the form of adjustment of status, an issue for which Murphy properly bore the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d), Murphy argues that the burden of proof should not have shifted to him. Murphy misreads \u00a7 1240.8(d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">(d) Relief from removal. The respondent shall have the burden of establishing \u25a0 that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege and that it should be granted in the exercise of discretion. If the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply, the alien shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARB\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d) (emphasis added). As the provision clearly states, Murphy had the burden to show he satisfied the applicable eligibility requirements for the relief from removal he requested. Section 1240.8(d) is consistent with the INA, which squarely places the burden upon an applicant for adjustment of status to prove he is eligible, .including that he is not inadmissible. See INA \u00a7 240(c)(2)(A), (4)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A), (4)(a)(i); INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">Furthermore, the government presented evidence that Murphy had' made a false claim of U.S. citizenship, namely documents from the' Florida DMV indicating he had obtained an identification card listing his place of birth as the U.S. Virgin Islands. Although Murphy disputes this evidence, the evidence indicated that a mandatory ground for denial of his application for adjustment of status may apply, and thus under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d), quoted above, Murphy had the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the ground indicated did not in fact apply. Stated simply, Murphy had the burden to show that he did not make a false claim of U.S. citizenship. In sum, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s allocation of the burdens of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-15\">C. IJ\u2019s Adverse Credibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b729-16\">Murphy contends that the BIA erred in relying upon the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because it failed to comply with INA \u00a7 240(c)(4)(C), 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>\u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(C). We disagree. When the IJ is considering an application for relief from removal under \u00a7 1229a(e)(4), the IJ may base any credibility determination on, among other -things, \u201cthe inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s or witness\u2019s account.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(4)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(C). That is what the IJ did here in discrediting Murphy\u2019s account of how he obtained his Florida driver\u2019s license and identification card in the name of Darien Dukelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Moreover, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. gee Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 547 F.3d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir. 2008). Murphy testified that he provided his own pictures for the Darien Dukelly driver\u2019s license, which was inconsistent with the DMV\u2019s standard practice of taking pictures on-site and in person. Murphy complains that the BIA ignored articles he submitted to the BIA indicating that a black market exists for obtaining . DMV credentials. The BIA acknowledged this evidence, but concluded that it did not \u201ccompel a factual determination that [Murphy] testified plausibly that he obtained his driver\u2019s license in the manner in which he claimed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In any event, Murphy also testified that he went in person to the DMV to obtain a Florida identification card, but maintained that he never provided his place of birth or country of citizenship in securing the card. Murphy\u2019s testimony, however, was contrary to the DMV documents and the Florida statutory requirements for obtaining an identification card, both, of which the IJ was entitled to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Under Florida Statutes \u00a7 322.051, an individual seeking an identification card from the DMV must complete an application that includes, inter alia, the applicant\u2019s country of birth. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 322.051(l)(a)(l). The applicant must present proof of identity based on certain documents, such as a certified copy of a U.S. birth certificate. Id. \u00a7 322.051(l)(a)(3)(b). And, the applicant must verify and sign the application before a person authorized to administer an oath. Id. \u00a7 322.051(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Murphy admitted he went to the DMV to obtain the Darien Dukelly identification card. The DMV records indicated that, at that time, Murphy asserted U.S. citizenship in his application and presented as proof of his identity a U.S. Virgin Islands birth certificate. These documents, in addition to the process prescribed by statute, contradict Murphy\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">For this reason, there is no merit to Murphy\u2019s argument that the BIA relied solely on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding to conclude he was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status. The government submitted DMV records, which, as noted above, indicated that Murphy asserted U.S. citizenship and presented a U.S. Virgin Islands birth certificate when he applied for a Florida identification card in the name of Darien Dukelly on October 17, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">In sum, based on the IJ\u2019s fact finding that Murphy made a false claim of U.S. citizenship to the Florida DMV in order to obtain a driver\u2019s license and an identifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tion card, Murphy was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii). Furthermore, his ground for inadmissibility could not be waived under INA \u00a7 212(h), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). As such, Murphy failed to carry his burden under INA \u00a7 240(c)(4)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A)(i), to show he was statutorily eligible for an adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). For these reasons, the BIA did not err in denying Murphy\u2019s applications for a waiver of inadmissibility and for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-11\">. While we do not have jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions to deny an application for adjustment of status, we have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law, including non-discretionaiy legal determinations as to statutory eligibility for discretionary relief. See Alvarado v. U.S. Att'y Gen., 610 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir. 2010); see also INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Therefore, we have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determination that Murphy was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-6\">. Murphy also argues that the IJ improperly compared the signatures on the Darien Dukelly driver\u2019s license and the Darien Dukelly identification card, which he claims violated his due process rights. However, the BIA noted in its decision that it did not rely on any handwriting comparisons by the IJ. Given that the BIA did not adopt this portion of the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we have no occasion to review it. See Ruiz v. Gonzales, 479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
