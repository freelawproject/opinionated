Clemons, as the personal representative of the estate of Rodney Mitchell, and Dorian Gilmer appeal the summary judgment in favor of Sheriff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Thomas M. Knight and his two deputies, Troy Sasse and Adam 'Shaw, After the deputies stopped Mitchell for a traffic violation, Mitchell shifted his jeep into drive and drove toward Sasse, who was standing near the front of Mitchell\u2019s jeep. Both deputies fired shots at the jeep, and after one of the bullets struck Mitchell in the head and killed him, the jeep crashed into a nearby building and injured Gilmer, Clemons and Gilmer complained that the deputies\u2019 use of deadly force was excessive, that the Sheriff failed to train his deputies adequately, and that he was vicariously liable for the deputies\u2019 allegedly tortious conduct. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.19. The district court ruled that Sasse and Shaw were entitled to qualified immunity and that the complaints against the Sheriff failed as a matter of law because the deputies\u2019 use of force was reasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">While on patrol around 9:30 p.m. on June 11, 2012, Shaw noticed a jeep traveling in the opposite direction on U.S. Highway 301. Shaw observed that the driver, Mitchell, was not wearing a seatbelt, so Shaw turned around, radioed for assistance while pursuing Mitchell, and activated his siren and lights to cause Mitchell to stop. Mitchell continued down the highway, made a u-turn, and then made two right turns before stopping. Sasse heard Shaw\u2019s radio transmission and joined the pursuit. Both Sasse and Mitchell\u2019s passenger, Gilmer, recalled that Shaw activated his lights and siren after Mitchell made his first right turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Mitchell stopped alongside the curb on Washington Court and kept his foot on the brake and the jeep in drive. Shaw parked his patrol vehicle behind the jeep and approached Mitchell\u2019s door. Sasse parked his vehicle approximately 10 to 15 feet in front of the jeep and walked to the front of the vehicle. Later, Sasse and Gilmer recalled that Sasse positioned himself near the front driver\u2019s side tire.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Shaw ordered Mitchell several times to put his hands on the steering wheel, and eventually Mitchell complied. Shaw asked Mitchell why he had failed to stop earlier and ordered him to produce his license, but Mitchell ignored Shaw. Mitchell also ignored Shaw\u2019s instructions to shift the gear to park. Mitchell was \u201clooking around\u201d and refused to make eye contact with the deputies, and Sasse sensed that Mitchell \u201cmight be taking off.\u201d Finally, Mitchell shifted into park, but he left his hand on the gear shift. Sasse could not see Mitchell\u2019s hand and, fearing that he might reach for a weapon, Sasse stepped backwards, drew his firearm, and ordered Mitchell to display his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">When Mitchell shifted the jeep back to drive, Shaw ordered Mitchell to stop. As Shaw reached across Mitchell toward the gear shift, Mitchell stepped on the accelerator. Sasse, who thought that he was about to be struck, shot at the jeep twice and fell to the ground. One bullet struck the pillar in front of Mitchell\u2019s door. Shaw saw Sasse \u201cfalling out of the way\u201d and thought that the jeep was going to run over him, so Shaw drew his firearm and shot twice toward Mitchell. A bullet struck Mitchell in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">Mitchell\u2019s jeep traveled over the median, across the lane for oncoming traffic, and crashed into a structure in front of a Suno-co gas station.. When Shaw arrived at the gas station, Mitchell was slumped over and Gilmer was gone. Mitchell was pronounced dead at the scene. Gilmer later reported that he had been injured by broken glass and lead shrapnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">Gilmer thrice confirmed that Mitchell\u2019s jeep moved as the deputies discharged their firearms. During his statement to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>investigator, Gilmer stated that Mitchell shifted to park, but then turned his steering wheel to the right and shifted back to drive, which caused the jeep to lurch. And as the vehicle \u201cjerked forward,\u201d Gilmer heard gunshots and saw a flash of light to his left. Eleven days after the incident, Gilmer, in the presence of his parents and his attorney, responded affirmatively when asked if he \u201cheard the shots ... [when Mitchell] goes to take off\u2019 and if Mitchell \u201cwas ... going to take off fast to get, get away from everybody.\u201d Gilmer later wrote in a college essay that Mitchell \u201cpulled over to talk to the officers\u201d and, \u201cin an instance he tried to pull off, turning the car away from the officers\u201d and \u201cthen the officers open[ed] fire into the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a summary judgment and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Singletary v. Vargas, </em>804 F.3d 1174, 1180 (11th Cir. 2015). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no' genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Clemons and Gilmer raise two issues on appeal. First, Clemons and Gilmer argue that the district court disregarded evidence that the deputies\u2019 use of deadly force was excessive. Second, Clemons and Gilmer argue that, the Sheriff failed to implement policies and training to prevent his deputies from using excessive force and that the Sheriff was vicariously liable for his deputies\u2019 violations of state daw. Our resolution of the first issue necessarily resolves the second issue too.</p>\n<p id=\"ASI\">\u201c[I]t is constitutionally permissible for an officer to use deadly force when [he] \u2018has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carr v. Tatangelo, </em>338 F.3d 1259, 1268 (11th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)); <em>e.g., Singletary, </em>804 F.3d at 1181; <em>Robinson v. Arrugueta, </em>415 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir. 2005). Reasonableness is determined based on all the circumstances known to the officer on the scene. <em>Singletary, </em>804 F.3d at 1181; <em>Terrell v. Smith, </em>668 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir. 2012). That approach permits officers to \u201cdispel [the] threat\u201d of, not merely respond after the infliction of, a serious injury. <em>Singletary, </em>804 F.3d at 1181 (citing <em>McCullough v. Antolini, </em>559 F.3d 1201, 1206 (11th Cir. 2009)); <em>see Montoute v. Carr, </em>114 F.3d 181, 185 (11th Cir. 1997). For that reason, \u201cwe have consistently upheld an officer\u2019s use of force ... where a decedent used or threatened to use his car as a weapon to endanger officers ... preceding the officer\u2019s use of deadly force.\u201d <em>Terrell, </em>668 F.3d at 1253 (quoting <em>McCullough, </em>559 F.3d at 1207 (alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">We agree with the district court that the deputies acted reasonably in response to a threat of serious physical harm to Sasse. Viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the evidence established that Sasse faced the threat of serious physical injury because he was standing near the front of the jeep as Mitchell attempted to flee from the traffic stop. The deputies and Gilmer recalled that Sasse was positioned near the front driver\u2019s side corner of Mitchell\u2019s jeep and that the jeep moved before the deputies shot toward Mitchell. Both deputies also stated that they feared the jeep would hit Sasse.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">The situation that confronted the officers is materially indistinguishable from <em>Singletary, </em>in which we concluded that an officer was immune from liability for shooting a passenger in a vehicle whose driver was attempting to evade apprehension in a fast-paced drug bust. 804 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>1182-84. The officer did not use excessive force by shooting at the car, we reasoned, because he was standing near the front of the oncoming vehicle and was acting in self-defense. <em>Id. </em>at 1181. That outcome, we explained, was consistent with our precedents that upheld the use of deadly force \u201cwhere the officer reasonably believed his life was endangered by a suspect who used or threatened to use his car as a weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1181-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">- The deputies\u2019 use of deadly force did not violate Mitchell\u2019s and Gilmer\u2019s constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment. In the light of Mitchell\u2019s evasive behavior and Sasse\u2019s presence near the front of Mitchell\u2019s jeep, both deputies reasonably feared that Mitchell\u2019s use of the jeep created an imminent danger of serious injury to Sasse. <em>See id. </em>at 1181. The deputies were entitled to fire their guns to protect Sasse. <em>See id. </em>at 1181-84; <em>Terrell, </em>668 F.3d at 1253 (discussing cases in which officers were granted qualified immunity when the defendant used or threatened to use a vehicle as a weapon). Because the officers were justified in responding to the danger created by the jeep with deadly force, the deputies were immune from liability for Gilmer\u2019s injuries and for Mitchell\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Clemons and Gilmer argue that three witnesses who were standing \u201cacross U.S. 301\u201d stated that the \u201cgunshots preceded the sound of the engine accelerating,\u201d but those witnesses\u2019 accounts fail to create a material factual dispute about the sequence of the events. <em>See Valderrama v. Rousseau, </em>780 F.3d 1108, 1113-14 (11th Cir. 2015). The first witness, Chadrick Garner, stated that he \u201cwasn\u2019t really paying that much attention\u201d to the traffic stop \u201ca little bit up the road\u201d from his vantage point at the Sunoco gas station and that he heard gunshots followed by the \u201cloud noise\u201d of Mitchell\u2019s jeep speeding toward him at the station. Garner did not refute the facts that Mitchell\u2019s jeep at least moved before the deputies fired their shots. Garner instead offered the unremarkable observation that he heard the jeep accelerate as it came closer toward him. The second witness, Oscar Higdon, who also was at the gas station, stated that he heard \u201cthree [gun]shots\u201d and \u201cthe Jeep didn\u2019t accelerate right away,\u201d but he immediately contradicted himself and stated that the Jeep accelerated \u201cright when [he] heard the gunshots.\u201d Jesus Torres, the third witness, made conflicting statements about whether the jeep was moving at the time of the gunshots and testified that the deputies \u201cnever shot\u201d at Mitchell. According to Torres, the deputies \u201cwere approaching [Mitchell] when he pulled [out] a gun and ... [fired] two shots into the air,\u201d one deputy \u201cthrew himself down to the ground,\u201d and Mitchell\u2019s \u201ccar stai-t[ed] to go ... again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Clemons and Gilmer also argue that their expert witnesses\u2019 testimonies established that Sasse was \u201cout of harm\u2019s way,\u201d but the experts\u2019 opinions do not contradict the evidence that Sasse was at least near the front of the jeep. David Balash, a crime scene investigator, opined that Sasse was \u201cat least 3-5 feet, or further, to the left of the Jeep\u2019s front fender and in no danger of being struck,\u201d but' Balash also testified that Sasse could have been 3 feet 11 inches from the jeep when he fired his gun. And Balash estimated that the bullet that lodged in the pillar of Mitchell\u2019s door was shot at a 25 to 30 degree angle, which he testified would have meant that Sasse was standing more in front of than beside the jeep. Although Melvin Tucker, an expert in police procedures, opined that Sasse \u201cwas not in danger of being struck\u201d because he had \u201cbacked away from the [jeep] to create distance,\u201d Tucker testified that he \u201c[didn\u2019t] think anybody [could]\u201d determine how far Sasse was from the jeep. And Tucker acknowledged that Sasse was \u201cby the left front tire of the vehicle.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>As the district court ruled, the experts\u2019 opinions did not \u201ccreate a disputed issue of [material] fact\u201d regarding \u201cwhether a reasonable officer could have perceived that Mitchell\u2019s vehicle posed a danger to Sasse when it suddenly accelerated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">The complaint against the Sheriff fails for related reasons. Because his deputies\u2019 actions did not violate Mitchell\u2019s and Gil-mer\u2019s constitutional rights, the Sheriff cannot be faulted for inadequate supervision or training. <em>See Hicks v. Moore, </em>422 F.3d 1246, 1253 (11th Cir. 2005). And the district court correctly ruled that the Sheriff was not vicariously liable for battery because the deputies\u2019 use of force was not excessive or for wrongful death because Mitchell\u2019s death was not \u201ccaused by a wrongful act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Deputies Shaw and Sasser and Sheriff Knight.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
