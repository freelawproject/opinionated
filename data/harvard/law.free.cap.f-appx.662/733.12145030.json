After review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and an order denying a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>See Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., </em>291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir. 2002); <em>Equity Inv. Partners, LP v. Lenz, </em>594 F.3d 1338, 1342 (11th Cir. 2010). A district court abuses its discretion if it makes a clear error of judgment or applies an incorrect legal standard. <em>See Peat, Inc. v. Vanguard Research, Inc., </em>378 F.3d 1154, 1159 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">The FMLA grants eligible employees the right to \u201c12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period ... [b]ecause of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D). The FMLA \u201ccreates two types of claims: interference claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer denied or otherwise interfered with his substantive rights under the Act, ... and retaliation claims, in which an employee asserts that his employer discriminated against him because he engaged in activity protected by the Act.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Water Works and Sewer Board, </em>239 F.3d 1199, 1206 (11th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>\u201cTo state a claim of interference with a substantive right, an employee need only demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to the benefit denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1206-07 (citations omitted). \u201cA prima facie case of retaliation under .the FMLA,\u201d on the other hand, \u201crequires a showing that (1) the employee engaged in statutorily protected conduct, (2) the employee suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) there is a causal connection between the two.\u201d <em>Krutzig v. Pulte Home Corp., </em>602 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Because we write for the parties, we assume their familiarity with the underlying facts and recite only what is necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">For the past twenty years, Ms. Lopez, a former police sergeant with the City, has suffered from a permanent medical condition known as severe endometriosis. Ms. Lopez\u2019s suit against the City initially involved gender discrimination and retaliation claims under Title VII (Counts I and IV), and discrimination and retaliation claims under the Americans with Disability Act (Counts II and V). These claims were dismissed without prejudice by the district court as a Rule 11 sanction against Ms. Lopez for misrepresenting that she had exhausted her administrative remedies with the EEOC. <em>See </em>D.E. 110 at 1-11. Ms. Lopez does not appeal this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">In the only remaining claim (Count III), Ms. Lopez alleged that the City interfered with, restrained, or denied her the right to exercise (or attempt to exercise) her FMLA rights. And although not pled as a separate claim, Ms. Lopez also alleged that the City discriminated against her, and ultimately discharged her, for exercising her FMLA rights. The district court construed that allegation as an FMLA retaliation claim. <em>See </em>D.E. 110 at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">After dismissing Ms. Lopez\u2019s Title VII and ADA claims, the district court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Ms. Lopez\u2019s FMLA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">The district court rejected the City\u2019s first argument\u2014that Ms. Lopez did not provide adequate notice of her need to take FMLA leave. The district court concluded that Ms. Lopez had not given proper notice in August of 2014 by her filing of a grievance and a doctor\u2019s note, because-neither indicated the need, timing, or duration of the FMLA leave Ms. Lopez might need. <em>See </em>D.E. 110 at 16. Nonetheless, the district court found Ms. Lopez provided sufficient notice in her WH 380-E Certification, which she submitted to the City Manager in October of 2014 and which specified that she needed one to two days of medical leave per month. <em>See id. </em>In spite of finding adequate notice, however, the district court concluded the City was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">First, as to the FMLA interference claim, the district court found no evidence that Ms. Lopez was denied a benefit to which she was entitled under the FMLA because, seven days after she submitted her WH 380-E Certification, she was placed on paid administrative leave\u2014 \u201cwhich [was] more generous than FMLA leave, which is unpaid\u201d\u2014pending the resolution of an internal affairs investigation which began in July of 2014. <em>Id. </em>at 17. The district court also ruled that Ms. Lopez had not shown that her termination was an interference with her FMLA rights because \u201cthe undisputed evidence show[ed] that the internal affairs investigation ultimately leading to [Ms. Lopez\u2019s] termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>nation began long before she ever requested FMLA leave,\u201d and Ms. Lopez was ultimately terminated due to the internal affairs investigation, and not because of her FMLA request. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Second, as to the FMLA retaliation claim, the district court held that Ms. Lopez did not provide sufficient evidence of a causal connection between her request for FMLA leave and her termination. The district court found a lack of temporal proximity between her request for leave in October of 2014, and her termination in January of 2015. <em>See id. </em>at 18. In addition, the district court concluded that, even if there was temporal proximity, Ms. Lopez \u201cfail[ed] to show any evidence that Chief [of Police Nelson] Andreu, the person who terminated her employment, was aware of her [WH 380-E] Certification of Health Care Provider, which was submitted to the City Manager.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The district court entered final judgment on the same day it granted summary judgment for the City. <em>See </em>D.E. 111. But because Ms. Lopez did not have notice that the district court would be deciding her FMLA retaliation claim on the basis of causation, the court gave her an opportunity to submit a motion for reconsideration on that issue. <em>See </em>D.E. 110 at 19 n.9. In response, Ms. Lopez submitted a nine-page brief with ten exhibits. <em>See </em>D.E. 113. For reasons we discuss in detail below, the district court held that its previous order granting summary judgment to the City would not be disturbed and denied Ms. Lopez\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Ms. Lopez raises four arguments on appeal. We address each one separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Ms. Lopez contends that the district court erred by failing to recognize that the City violated the FMLA when Ms. Lopez took intermittent leave on June 30, 2014. Ms. Lopez argues that she informed Chief Andreu of that leave on July 2, 2014, and within hours of this notification, Captain Carlos Avila began an internal affairs investigation against Ms. Lopez which \u201cwas orchestrated because [Captain] Avila and [Chief] Andreu, and probably [City Manager Yolanda] Aguilar, wanted [Ms.] Lopez out of the department but she refused to quit.\u201d Br. for Appellant at 16. Ms. Lopez also argues the district court abused its discretion by determining that she was amending her FMLA claim through her motion for reconsideration. <em>See id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">Based on our review of the proceedings below, the district court was correct in concluding that Ms. Lopez was improperly attempting to amend her complaint when she moved for reconsideration. The motion for reconsideration was the first time Ms. Lopez relied on the June 30, 2014, request for leave date. It was also the first time Ms. Lopez argued she was entitled to intermittent FMLA leave and that the internal affairs investigation was a retaliatory act initiated against her in response to her request for such leave. Prior to her motion for reconsideration, Ms. Lopez had consistently argued that she first requested FMLA leave in August of 2014, and it was the City\u2019s delay in processing that request, as well as her ultimate termination in January of 2015, that formed the factual basis for her interference and retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">As background, Ms. Lopez\u2019s initial <em>pro se </em>complaint did not include an FMLA claim. In her amended complaint, filed by counsel, Ms. Lopez alleged simply that she \u201crequested family leave time based upon her medical condition,\u201d the City \u201cfailed and refused to respond to her request,\u201d and that \u201c[f]ailure to timely respond ... consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>tute[d] a denial of her request, and a violation of the FMLA.\u201d D.E. 30 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The second amended complaint contained a section titled \u201cfacts specific to Lopez\u2019[s] FMLA claim\u201d and contained more detailed allegations. D.E. 45 at 9. Ms. Lopez alleged that in August of 2014 she received written counseling for taking sick leave. She filed a grievance and met with Chief Andreu and Captain Avila on August 20, 2014, \u201cat which time she provided them with a letter from her doctor ... which stated that she suffered from chronic pain syndrome which required her to occasionally miss work, work less hours and to avoid prolonged sitting positions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 28. She explained that \u201c[although [she] asked the Chief for medical leave at that time, he did not acknowledge her request.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Next, Ms. Lopez alleged that on August 28, 2014, she met with City Manager Aguilar and \u201cexplained to [him] the need to take a medical leave of absence under the FMLA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 29. The City Manager told Ms. Lopez that she had to make a formal request for FMLA leave on forms provided by the United States Department of Labor. <em>See id. </em>According to Ms. Lopez, the City interfered with her request for FMLA leave when it \u201ckept putting off [the] meeting\u201d to provide her with the FMLA request forms and by requesting a second opinion as to Ms. Lopez\u2019s medical condition from a doctor of their choice. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 33. \u201cTo Lopez\u2019[s] knowledge, the City never even bothered to obtain a copy of their chosen doctor\u2019s reports in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at I 35.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">When the City moved for summary judgment on the FMLA interference claim, Ms. Lopez responded in two paragraphs. Consistent with her complaint, she argued that her \u201cFMLA requested [sic] started in early August 2014\u201d and \u201c[fin-stead of dealing with it the City attempted to discipline Lopez for it.\u201d D.E. 92 at 10. Ms. Lopez argued that she met with the City Manager on August 28, 2014, and provided the City Manager with her doctor\u2019s letter and requested FMLA leave. <em>See id. </em>In response, the City Manager \u201cdid [his] part\u201d and \u201ccontinually stalled Lopez\u2019[s] FMLA request until she was terminated, and then denied it as a moot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. \u201cIt is Lopez\u2019[s] position that doing nothing is doing something\u2014it is denying her request for FMLA leave.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Therefore, when the district court was presented with Ms. Lopez\u2019s motion for reconsideration\u2014propounding the argument that Ms. Lopez was entitled to intermittent FMLA-protected leave in the summer of 2014, and that her June 30, 2014 leave request led to an internal affairs investigation being commenced against her just hours later\u2014it concluded that the factual basis she presented was \u201centirely new\u201d and was an improper attempt to \u201creformulate her FMLA retaliation claim and test an alternative theory\u201d in response to the district court\u2019s order on summary judgment. D.E. 130 at 2 &amp; 3. The district court declined to \u201centertain [Ms. Lopez\u2019s] motion for reconsideration based on a completely new theory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">On this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ms. Lopez\u2019s motion for reconsideration. A \u201cmotion for reconsideration cannot be used to reliti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>gate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment. This prohibition includes new arguments that were previously available, but not pressed.\u201d <em>Wil-chombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., </em>555 F.3d 949, 957 (11th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). That is what Ms. Lopez attempted to do here.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We are also not persuaded by Ms. Lopez\u2019s argument that she \u201cdid not inject any new facts into the case\u201d because \u201cthe events of June 30-July 2, 2014 were alleged, <em>albeit, </em>under the wrong section of the complaint.\u201d Br. for Appellant at 28. Notably, Ms. Lopez has not provided any paragraph citations in her complaint to support this argument. At summary judgment, the City \u201cproperly responded to, and the district court properly relied on, [Ms. Lopez\u2019s] [FMLA] count as it was pled.\u201d <em>Lightfoot v. Henry County Sch. Dist., </em>771 F.3d 764, 779 (11th Cir. 2014) (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to construe plaintiffs ADA retaliation claim as being based on different facts than the ones actually pled in her ADA count). <em>See also Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald &amp; Co., </em>382 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir. 2004) (\u201cLiberal pleading does not require that, at the summary judgment stage, defendants must infer all possible claims that could arise out of facts set forth in the complaint.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We also reject Ms. Lopez\u2019s argument that, assuming there was an attempt to amend the complaint, leave should have been freely given because \u201cthis was summary judgment proceedings and not trial.\u201d Br. for Appellant at 28. \u201cA plaintiff may not amend her complaint through argument in a brief opposing summary judgment,\u201d <em>Gilmour, </em>382 F.3d at 1315, let alone in a motion for reconsideration after summary judgment has been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">All of Ms. Lopez\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal stem from her reformulated FMLA retaliation claim and the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration. They fail to persuade for the same reasons previously discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Ms. Lopez argues that the district court \u201cerred by limiting [her] showing that [Chief] Andreu was aware that she was making an FMLA claim to proof that he was aware that [she] submitted a formal medical certification [the WH 380-E], to [City Manager] Aguilar.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 25. She asserts that, assuming Chief Andreu was not aware that Ms. Lopez submitted this particular FMLA request form to the City Manager, there was \u201cample other evidence that [Chief] Andreu knew that [Ms.] Lopez was pursuing FMLA relief,\u201d including that \u201cshe told him so in lay terms\u201d at their July 2, 2015 meeting and also because he \u201cknew of [Ms.] Lopez\u2019s condition for years.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Ms. Lopez\u2019s argument is not entirely clear. Chief Andreu\u2019s knowledge of Ms. Lopez\u2019s FMLA request was relevant to the district court\u2019s ruling on the retaliation claim. If Ms. Lopez is claiming\u2014as she did in her motion for reconsideration\u2014that she exercised FMLA leave for her medical condition on June 30, 2014, and Chief An-dreu knew of this as of July 2, 2014, and retaliated against her by initiating the internal affairs investigation and, ultimately, terminating her, this argument fails for the same reasons explained above.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">Alternatively, Ms. Lopez may be arguing that Chief Andreu (and the City) knew of her medical condition for years and that she qualified for intermittent FMLA leave all along. Such an argument may be more appropriately directed to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ward an FMLA interference claim, as opposed to a retaliation claim. <em>See Cruz v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., </em>428 F.3d 1379, 1383 (11th Cir. 2005) (\u201cAn employee is not required to assert expressly her right to take leave under the FMLA.\u201d (citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 825.302(c), 825.303(b))); <em>Strickland, </em>239 F.3d at 1209 (\u201cOnce an employee taking unforeseeable leave informs his employer that potentially FMLA-qualifying leave is needed, the regulations place on the employer the burden of ascertaining whether the employee\u2019s absence actually qualifies for FMLA protection.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted). It does little to rebut the district court\u2019s finding that there was a lack of temporal proximity between her FMLA request and her termination. It is also a theory for relief under the FMLA that was not timely and properly raised in district court, as already discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Next, Ms. Lopez argues that the district court \u201cerred by refusing to apply \u2018negative inferences\u2019 arising from the City\u2019s spoliation of evidence to her FMLA case and ignoring [Chief] Andreu\u2019s lack of credibility.\u201d Br. for Appellant at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">In the district court, Ms. Lopez filed a motion for discovery sanctions against the City. She claimed that the City delayed in producing certain patrol report^ and, when these reports were eventually produced to her, some entries had been deleted and the rest were presented in such a convoluted manner as to make it near impossible for her to make sense of them. <em>See id. </em>In her motion, Ms. Lopez argued that these reports were necessary for her to prove her Title VII claim and show that the City terminated her for having variances in her reported start and stop times, which was the same conduct engaged in by her male counterparts. <em>See </em>D.E. 72. She requested an adverse inference that the reports \u201cwould show as a matter of fact that [Sergeant] Valencia [a purported male comparator] committed the same violations as [Ms.] Lopez during the same time period; and he received no discipline for it; and a finding that the City deliberately and intentionally tamped [sic] with the Sky Patrol Reports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. The district court denied Ms. Lopez\u2019s motion for sanctions as moot in light of its dismissal of her Title VII claim. <em>See </em>D.E. 110 at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Ms. Lopez raises the argument she first raised in her motion for reconsideration, She argues that the negative inference from the tampered reports is not solely limited to her Title VII claim, but is. also relevant to her FMLA claim because it bears on Chief Andreu\u2019s credibility if he \u201ctestifies that he doesn\u2019t really recall that Lopez had a serious medical condition, or whether she discuss\u00e9d it with him on July 2, 2014.\u201d D.E. 113 at 8. Again, this argument stems from Ms. Lopez\u2019s belated attempt to reformulate her FMLA retaliation claim and argue that she first requested leave on June 30, 2014, and fails for the same reasons discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the City on Ms. Lopez\u2019s FMLA claims, as well as the district court\u2019s denial of Ms. Lopez\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-7\">. It is undisputed that Ms. Lopez formally requested the forms from the City Manager on September 4, 2014, obtained the FMLA forms from the City on September 19, 2014, and submitted the completed forms (the WH 380-E Certification) along with a note from her doctor on October 3, 2014. <em>See </em>D.E. 82 (Defendant\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in Support of Summary Judgment) at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11, 12; D.E. 93 at 2 (\"Lopez does not dispute the City's Facts.\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
