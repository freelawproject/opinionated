The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>BIA\u2019s denial was based on alternative findings that Figueroar-Lopez\u2019s testimony was not credible and that, even if credible, it failed to demonstrate the required nexus between his feared persecution and a statutorily protected ground. On appeal, Figueroa-Lopez argues that the BIA erred because it incorrectly analyzed the claim using his fear of gang recruitment and reprisal, rather than his membership in the Evangelical Christian Church, as the basis for evaluating his membership in a recognized social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment unless the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir. 2007). When the BIA explicitly agrees with the findings of the IJ, we will review the decision of both the BIA and the IJ as to those issues. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir. 2010). Where, as here, the BIA does not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, to the extent the BIA agreed with the IJ, we will review both. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The BIA and the IJ must consider all evidence that an applicant has submitted. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir. 2006). However, where the BIA has given reasoned consideration to the petition and made adequate .findings, we will not require that the BIA address specifically each claim made by the petitioner or each piece of evidence presented. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATqj\">On appeal from the BIA\u2019s decision, we review legal questions, including whether the BIA gave reasoned consideration to an applicant\u2019s claim, <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1374. Factual findings, including credibility determinations, are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2006). Under this highly deferential test, we affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Factual findings will only be reversed when the \u201crecord compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). We view \u201cthe record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">When the IJ makes an adverse credibility finding, the IJ must provide \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for the decision. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). A credibility determination may be based on the totality of the circumstances, including: (1) the applicant\u2019s demeanor, candor, or responsiveness; (2) the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account; (3) the consistency between the applicant\u2019s written and oral statements; (4) the internal consistency of each statement; (5) the consistency of the statements with other evidence; and (6) any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements. INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). An adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies,- or falsehoods, regardless of whether they relate to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255. We have held that even a single inconsistency can support an adverse credibility determination. <em>Xia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>608 F.3d 1233, 1240 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Even if credible, an applicant for asylum must meet the INA\u2019s definition of refugee. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-12\">Any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality .., who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), Thus, to establish asylum eligibility the applicant must, \u201cwith specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1257 (quotation omitted). The applicant must demonstrate that one of those enumerated grounds \u201cwas or will be at least one central reason\u201d for the alleged persecution. INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">To the extent that Figueroa-Lopez\u2019s arguments present a question of whether substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of his asylum claim, we deny the petition for review. The record does not compel a finding either that he is credible or that, if credible, he demonstrat\u2022ed the required nexus between his feared persecution and a ground protected under the INA. Regarding his credibility, Figueroa-Lopez\u2019s testimony about his fear of persecution was inconsistent with his sworn statement to border patrol officers that he came to the United States to work and did not fear returning to Guatemala. Additionally, his testimony that he was threatened by the Maras gang on August 29,2012 was inconsistent with (1) his statement at his credible fear interview that he was threatened on August 28,2012; and (2) the statement in his father\u2019s affidavit that Figueroa-Lopez was subjected to threats from multiple gangs, only one of which was the Maras. Given that even a single inconsistency can support an adverse credibility determination, we see nothing in the record that would compel a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">Turning to the basis of his application for asylum, Figueroa-Lopez\u2019s primary argument is that the- BIA failed to give reasoned consideration to his claim because it did not adequately consider evidence that he was persecuted on account of his membership in the Evangelical Church. As an initial matter, this argument must fail because prior to this petition Figueroa-Lopez never argued that his asylum application was based on his membership in the Evangelical Church. Therefore, any failure to expressly address the argument is not a failure of reasoned consideration. <em>See Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1374. Conversely, the BIA did sufficiently address' the evidence and arguments actually put forth by Figueroa-Lopez regarding his religion as a basis for resisting gang recruitment and, accordingly, gave the requisite consideration to the arguments raised and the evidence presented. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Moreover, substantial evidence, including Figueroa-Lopez\u2019s testimony, supports the BIA\u2019s determination that the gangs threatened him with serious harm or death because of his refusal to join them and because he reported them to the police, not because he was an Evangelical Christian, Indeed, the letter from the pastor of Figueroa-Lopez\u2019s church failed to mention any other members that had been threatened or harmed, and Figueroa-Lopez\u2019s own testimony acknowledged that he was the only one he knew of who had been threatened. Simply put, the record does not compel a finding that one central reason for the gang members\u2019 threats towards Figueroa-Lopez was his membership in the Evangelical Church. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Upon \u2022 review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 appellate briefs, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
