On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions, the district court\u2019s admission of evidence under Rule 404(b), Fed. R. Evid., and the court\u2019s calculation of his guideline range\u2014 specifically the part of that range based on the number of counterfeit tablets for which he was held responsible and the value of the tablets. The government confesses error on a related sentencing issue. After careful review, we affirm Beuschel\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>victions and his sentencing challenges, but we vacate and remand for resentencing pursuant to the government\u2019s confession of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">\n<em>A. Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Beuschel with conspiracy to traffic in a counterfeit drug in or around April or May 2014, and trafficking in a counterfeit drug in June 2014, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320(a)(4) and (b)(3). Beuschel pled not guilty and proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Before trial, the government noticed its intent to admit evidence under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. This evidence consisted of a chain of emails from January and February 2013 between Beuschel and another person regarding a prior sale of purported Viagra. In the government\u2019s view, the emails were relevant to show Beuschel\u2019s knowledge of the counterfeit nature of the Viagra. Over Beus-chel\u2019s objections, the district court found the evidence admissible to show knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">At trial, the district court denied Beus-chel\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case and at the close of the evidence. A jury returned a verdict finding Beuschel guilty on both counts charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">The district court sentenced Beuschel to concurrent terms of 63 months of imprisonment, to be followed by concurrent three-year terms of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\"><em>B. Trial </em>Evidence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">This case is about a package of counterfeit Viagra that Beuschel shipped from New Jersey to a cooperating source (\u201cCS\u201d) in South Florida in June 2014. The CS was working with the United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). Beuschel never disputed that he sent the package, but he claimed to believe that the Viagra was authentic and that he was simply returning what had been mistakenly sent to him by Frank Fiore, a former business partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">The June 2014 shipment developed out of meeting a couple of months earlier between the CS, an undercover agent, and Fiore, who was under investigation for trafficking in counterfeit drugs. At this April 2014 meeting, the CS asked for and received Fiore\u2019s blessing to do business with Beuschel. Fiore and Beuschel had done business together before, but things had turned bad between them. Fiore believed that Beuschel had once cheated him out of money, and Beuschel claimed that Fiore and the CS still owed him over $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">On May 7, 2014, about two weeks after the April meeting, Beuschel sent an email to Fiore with the subject line, \u201ccandy: skittles 2710 boxes $6775 if more is needed i\u2019m sure we can accommodate your request.\u201d Beuschel later confirmed to law enforcement that \u201cskittles\u201d was a reference to Viagra. Fiore forwarded the email to the CS, who, in turn, forwarded the email to Maximillian Trimm, a Special Agent with the FDA. At Agent Trimm\u2019s direction, the CS wired about half the funds, which the CS received from the government, to Beuschel.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-17\">Once he received the money from the CS, Beuschel notified Fiore by email on May 26 that he would be coming down from New Jersey, where he lived, to meet them in South Florida. Fiore, who for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>warded the email to the CS, told Beuschel that Fiore was not necessary for the meeting. Beuschel responded that he wanted Fiore there to discuss \u201cpayments received and when we are getting the balance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Beuschel traveled to South Florida and met with the CS on May 30, 2014. Before the meeting, the CS notified the FDA, which provided him a recording device to use during the meeting. The jury heard the recording at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">During the recorded conversation, Beus-chel explained to the CS that he did not bring the \u201cstuff that I have for you\u201d because he did not think he could carry it on the plane, and he also did not mail it because he was not sure if he could. He indicated that he planned to drive down the next week with some equipment, so he was \u201cgonna stick it in -with the tools.\u201d Beuschel stated that he had 2,800 \u201cpieces,\u201d or boxes, that each box contained four tablets, and that he paid $2 per tablet.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Beuschel also discussed other goods he could provide the CS, and he indicated that he could create custom labeling and packaging for drugs. He stated, \u201cyou give me a label that you want to put it under, whatever the name is that you want to put it under, we can make it whatever you want\u201d; and \u201cI can make a bilingual box so they could read it as both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Beuschel went on to advise the CS that he could \u201cget Cialis or Viagra any day.\u201d Beuschel stated, \u201cLike if you told me, I need ten thousand boxes, that\u2019s forty thousand pills.... I can have them to you in probably two weeks.\u201d Beuschel asked if the CS wanted \u201corange\u201d (Cialis, a mustard-yellow tablet) or \u201cblue\u201d (Viagra, a blue tablet), and the CS said both. Beus-chel responded, \u201cI\u2019ll make the phone call to the guy. He\u2019s in Brooklyn. I\u2019ll make the phone call to the guy that manufactures them.... \u201d Beuschel said he would introduce the CS to the \u201cguy\u201d in Brooklyn. The CS assured Beuschel that he could send the Viagra through UPS without issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">On June 17, 2014, Beuschel shipped a package to the CS from a UPS store in New Jersey. Beuschel signed the shipping forms in the name of \u201cFrank Fiore\u201d and gave a return address in Boca Raton, Florida. In an email, Beuschel told the CS that \u201cFrank Fiore\u201d had sent the package. The CS received the package and delivered it to Agent Trimm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">The package contained 681 boxes that were labeled \u201cViagra.\u201d Each box contained a \u201cblister pack\u201d of four tablets that appeared to be 100-mg doses of Viagra. The word \u201cPfizer\u201d and its logo were on the outside of the boxes and on the blister packs and the words \u201cPfizer\u201d and \u201cVGR\u201d were embossed directly on the tablets. The boxes and blister packs were labeled with an April 2014 expiration date. \u201cPfizer,\u201d its logo, \u201cViagra,\u201d and \u201cVGR\u201d were all trademarks of Pfizer, Inc., in use at the time of Beuschel\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">The tablets were tested and determined to be counterfeit. While the false tablets had the same markings, shape, and general color as real Viagra, they were larger and \u201cnoticeably darker\u201d than real Viagra. In addition, a chemical analysis revealed that the false tablets contained sildenafil citrate, the active ingredient in Viagra, but at around half the potency of real Viagra. The packaging was likewise determined to be counterfeit. The packaging used real but outdated or inconsistent artwork and security features and an incorrect bar code, among other features. The wholesale price of Viagra was around $38 for a 100-mg tablet as of June 1, 2014, well above the $2 per tablet Beuschel paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">On July 6, 2014, about two weeks after the shipment, Beuschel emailed the CS asking for payment for the \u201ccandy.\u201d He stated, \u201cpayments owed next week $10,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>.past debt and $3,000 for candy, please make deposit Monday, July 7th!!\u201d The CS responded that the \u201ccandy had all expired dates.\u201d Beuschel replied, \u201cIt\u2019s all good take them out of the box that\u2019s the only dating.\u201d In a separate email, Beuschel told the CS that he would put the CS in touch with \u201cAnderson,\u201d the guy in Brooklyn, \u201cdirectly on the candy as stated.\u201d On July 21, 2014, Beuschel again stated that the CS owed $8,000 and that he wanted to introduce the CS to Anderson \u201cfor additional inventory and stick sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">After Beuschel\u2019s name appeared in a criminal complaint against Fiore, Beuschel, through counsel, requested a meeting with prosecutors. During the interview, Beus-chel explained that he was in the business of \u201copportunity buys,\u201d meaning that he would purchase outdated or about-to-expire products at a discount and sell them for profit. He also stated that he manufactured dietary or nutritional supplements, including \u201cClavine,\u201d a natural supplement used to treat erectile dysfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"AHI\">Beuschel explained during the interview how he came to send the package of Viagra to the CS in June 2014. According to Beuschel, he had asked Fiore at some point after 2012 to return some business proposals that Fiore had in his possession. Fiore sent him two boxes. Beuschel did not look in the boxes until May 2014, when Fiore called to tell him that one contained \u201cproduct\u201d by mistake. At that point, Beus-chel looked in the box and saw that it contained Viagra. He agreed to send the box to the CS in exchange for approximately $6,000, as partial payment for the more than $160,000 they owed him as a result of two failed business deals. He shipped the package to the CS under Fiore\u2019s name because it belonged to Fiore.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Beuschel also claimed in the interview that he had never dealt in pharmaceuticals before. After Agent Trimm testified about that statement at trial, the government admitted, through Rule 404(b), Fed. R. Evid., a chain of emails between Beuschel and Fiore in 2013 discussing a sale of \u201cskittles\u201d and \u201cm&amp;ms.\u201d In the emails, Beuschel stated that he had \u201cthe allocation ready based on your say so,\u201d to which Fiore responded, \u201cso far 5000 blue skittles and most likely the orange as well so I will take the full skittles order but let me get payment on thurs/fri.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">\n<em>C. Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">L Relevant Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Before sentencing, a probation officer prepared Beuschel\u2019s revised presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The PSR included as \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3, facts from 2012 arising out of a police investigation into Walter Jacovcic in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. Following Jacovcic\u2019s arrest, officers searched his phone and found text messages between Jacovcic and Beuschel discussing the purchase of \u201cblue\u201d and \u201corange\u201d \u201ccandies.\u201d During an interview with officers about the texts in April 2013, Beuschel confirmed that, in November or December 2012, he had obtained Viagra and Cialis (the blue and orange candies) from Jacov-cic to sell or give to others, because \u201cpeople don\u2019t take anything that isn\u2019t real so they are looking at it to make sure they are getting something real.\u201d Beuschel claimed to officers that he bought 140 tablets each of Viagra and Cialis for $2 per tablet, but the texts indicated that Beus-chel had bought 140 \u201cfour-packs,\u201d or 560 tablets, each. Samples of Viagra and Cialis seized from Jacovcic in December 2012 were found to be counterfeit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>The PSR also included as relevant conduct Beuschel\u2019s offer to sell Viagra and Cialis to Fiore in early 2013, as reflected in the emails the government introduced at trial under Rule 404(b). The PSR found that Beuschel offered to sell 10,000 tablets each of Viagra and Cialis.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">2. PSR\u2019s Guideline Calculations</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In criminal copyright-infringement cases, the base offense level is 8. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3(a). Then, the offense level is increased based on the \u201cinfringement amount,\u201d which, in cases where the infringement amount exceeds $5,000, is determined by reference to the loss table for fraud and theft offenses found in \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B5.3(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Beuschel\u2019s PSR calculated a total infringement amount of $621,067.27, based on the following conduct: (1) 2,724 tablets he sold to the CS in June 2014; (2) 20,000 tablets he offered to sell to Fiore in early 2013; and (3) 1,120 tablets he bought from Jacovcic in December 2012. The PSR multiplied the number of tablets by the \u201cwholesale acquisition cost\u201d of each tablet at the relevant time to determine the infringement amount. The \u201cwholesale acquisition cost,\u201d the PSR states, is the price at which the manufacturer sells the drugs to wholesale distributors. Based on the infringement amount, the PSR applied a 14-level increase to the offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">With two additional two-level enhancements, the PSR assigned Beuschel a total offense level of 26. Beuschel had zero criminal-history points, placing him in criminal-history category I. This established a guideline sentencing range of 63 to 78 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">3. Beuschel\u2019s Objections to the PSR and the Government\u2019s Position</p>\n<p id=\"AE9d\">Among other objections to the PSR, Beuschel contended that the infringement amount should be zero. He argued that the tablets he shipped to the CS had no value because they were expired, and that the Jacovcic and Fiore transactions should be excluded as relevant conduct because the evidence was insufficient to show that he knew the tablets were counterfeit. He also asserted that there was no evidence that the deal with Fiore had been consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">While the government agreed, that expired Viagra has no retail value, it argued that Beuschel\u2019s position did not make sense as an interpretation of the guideline. Under \u00a7 2B5.3, the government noted, the infringement amount is \u201cthe retail value of the infringed item, multiplied by the number of infringing items,\u201d in cases where the infringing item is, or appears to a reasonably informed purchaser to be, identical or substantially equivalent to the infringed item. Reasoning that the \u201cinfringed item\u201d is \u201cthe item that the defendant is trying to mimic,\u201d the government asserted that \u201cthe infringed item in this case is legitimate salable Viagra,\u201d not expired Viagra. The government asserted that Beuschel\u2019s comments after the CS complained about the expiration dates\u2014telling the CS to take the tablets out of the packaging\u2014confirmed that he was \u201cattempting to infringe on Viagra that still has its retail value.\u201d Thus, in the government\u2019s view, the trial evidence established that Beuschel was attempting to sell counterfeit Viagra that, to a reasonably informed purchaser, could easily be mistaken for unexpired Viagra, so he should be accountable for those tablets.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>As for Beuschel\u2019s other objections, the government responded that there was sufficient evidence to uphold the PSR\u2019s inclusion of Beuschel\u2019s conduct in 2012 and 2013 as relevant conduct. The government cited, among other things, Beuschel\u2019s use of the same coded language in these transactions as in the offense of conviction as well as the similar price well below wholesale.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">4. District Court\u2019s Rulings</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The district court overruled Beuschel\u2019s objections to the infringement amount and upheld the 14-level enhancement. The court determined that the counterfeit Viagra Beuschel sent to the CS in 2014 had value despite being \u201cexpired,\u201d and that Beuschel knew that the \u201cViagra\u201d and \u201cCialis\u201d involved in the 2012 Jacoveic transaction and the 2013- Fiore transaction were' counterfeit. As additional support for these findings, the court adopted the written statements of the prosecutor and the probation officer in response to Beuschel\u2019s objections, which were consistent with the government\u2019s arguments at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The district court denied Beusehel\u2019s remaining objections and sustained the government\u2019s objection to the application of a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3(b)(6)(A). Beuschel\u2019s base total offense level was reduced to 24, establishing a guideline range of 51 to 63 months. The district court sentenced Beuschel to two concurrent terms of 63 months of imprisonment. Beuschel now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Beuschel first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions, an issue we review <em>de novo. United States v. Rutgerson, </em>822 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir. 2016). \u201cWe are required to affirm [a] conviction if <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original). So, to prevail, the defendant must do more than put forth a reasonable hypothesis of innocence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Bowers, </em>811 F.3d 412, 424 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 2401, 195 L.Ed.2d 772 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">When reviewing for evidentiary sufficiency, we construe the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Rutgerson, </em>822 F.3d at 1232. No distinction is made between the weight given to either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Bowers, </em>811 F.3d at 424. Guilty knowledge\u2014here, knowledge of the counterfeit nature of the Viagra\u2014may, and often must, be inferred from the \u201csurrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>698 F.2d 1168, 1170 (11th Cir. 1983). But where the government relies on circumstantial evidence, the jury\u2019s verdict must be supported by reasonable inferences and not mere speculation. <em>Bowers, </em>811 F.3d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">\n<em>A. Trafficking in a Counterfeit Drug</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AY_\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320(a)(4), it is illegal for someone to intentionally \u201ctraffic[ ] in a drug and knowingly use[] a counterfeit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>mark on or in connection with such drug.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320(a)(4); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320(f)(1), (5)-(6) (defining the terms \u201ccounterfeit mark,\u201d \u201ctraffic\u201d and \u201cdrug\u201d). There is no dispute in this case that counterfeit marks\u2014the various trademarks held by Pfizer for \u201cPfizer,\u201d its logo, \u201cViagra,\u201d and \u201cVGR\u201d\u2014were used in connection with trafficking a drug. The only issue is whether Beuschel knew that the Viagra was counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"A2H\">Here, sufficient evidence supports Beuschel\u2019s conviction for the substantive offense of trafficking in a counterfeit drug. Although Beuschel never himself identified the Viagra as \u201cbogus\u201d or \u201ccounterfeit,\u201d the government presented ample circumstantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could have inferred that Beuschel knew that the Viagra was counterfeit. This evidence included, most notably, the recorded conversation between Beuschel and the CS in May 2014, in which Beuschel described his source of Viagra tablets as a guy in Brooklyn who \u201cmanufactures them.\u201d In addition, Beuschel told the CS that he could get him 40,000 tablets in two weeks, without suggesting that the two-week, time frame was contingent on, for example, a shipment of outdated but authentic Viagra or Cialis coming in. Beuschel also paid $2 per tablet, far below the wholesale price of around $38 per tablet at the time. All of these facts indicate that Beuschel knew that the tablets were not legitimate Viagra manufactured by Pfizer. <em>See United States v. Zayyad, </em>741 F.3d 452, 462-63 (4th Cir. 2014) (evidence that pills \u201ccame at a very low price, in enormous volumes, from sources that one would not normally expect to have legitimate pills ... indicate that the pills were illegitimate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Other aspects of the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d provide additional evidence of Beuschel\u2019s guilty knowledge. <em>See Perez, </em>698 F.2d at 1170. For example, Beuschel took efforts to conceal his behavior, which, in turn, suggests knowledge of wrongdoing. <em>See Zayyad, </em>741 F.3d at 463 (concealment implies consciousness of guilt). He used coded language in emails, referring to the Viagra as \u201cskittles\u201d or \u201ccandy\u201d; he expressed reluctance about sending the tablets by mail for fear of detection; and he initially planned to transport the tablets to South Florida by hiding them in some tools on a truck, before the CS reassured him that he would have no issues sending the tablets through UPS. Beuschel also falsely told prosecutors that he had never dealt in pharmaceuticals before, when pri- or emails showed that Beuschel previously had offered to sell Fiore \u201cskittles.\u201d These additional facts further support an inference that Beuschel knew that the Viagra tablets were counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">It is not enough for Beuschel to offer a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, assuming he has shown even that much. <em>See Bowers, </em>811 F.3d at 424. His hypothesis of innocence\u2014that he was simply returning what Fiore sent him mistakenly\u2014was presented to and rejected by the jury, and it was inconsistent with other evidence presented at trial, including the May 2014 recorded conversation and his emails to Fiore and the CS. In addition, the government did not need to present direct proof that the terms \u201ccandy\u201d and \u201cskittles\u201d referred to counterfeit Viagra. The use of coded language was just one piece of the surrounding circumstances that supported an inference of guilty knowledge. Viewing the evidence as a whole, a reasonable jury could have inferred from the circumstantial evidence that Beuschel knew the counterfeit nature of the Viagra. <em>See Rutgerson, </em>822 F.3d at 1231-32; <em>Bowers, </em>811 F.3d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">\n<em>B. Conspiring to Traffic in a Counterfeit Drug</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320(a), it is unlawful to \u201cattempt[ ] or conspire[ ] to violate\u201d any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>of the four substantive offenses listed in subsection (a), including trafficking in a counterfeit drug. In general, to sustain a conviction for conspiracy, the government must prove the following: (1) an agreement existed between two or more persons to achieve an unlawful objective; (2) the defendant knew the essential objective of the conspiracy and voluntarily agreed to join it; and (3) an overt act occurred in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Toll, </em>804 F.3d 1344, 1355 (11th Cir. 2015); <em>United States v. Guerra, </em>293 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir. 2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The existence of a conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence and may be inferred from concert of action. <em>Guerra, </em>293 F.3d at 1285. An individual can be convicted of conspiracy with unknown persons referred to in the indictment, even if those individuals are not brought to trial. <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>720 F.2d 1239, 1245 n.8 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Beuschel argues that his conspiracy conviction cannot stand because the only person he could have conspired with was Frank Fiore, given that the CS was working with the government, and no evidence shows that he and Fiore agreed to traffic in counterfeit Viagra. The government responds that the evidence shows that Beus-chel and Fiore conspired to sell counterfeit Viagra to the CS.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">While the evidence shows that Fiore may have been involved in an agreement to purchase counterfeit Viagra from Beus-chel, there is little to show the presence of \u201can agreement with the same joint criminal objective\u2014here the joint objective of [trafficking in] drugs.\u201d <em>See United States v. Dekle, </em>165 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir. 1999) (\u201cThis joint objective is missing where the conspiracy is based on an agreement between a buyer and a seller for the sale of drugs.\u201d). Arguably a reasonable jury could have inferred that Fiore, along with the CS, bought the counterfeit Viagra for the purpose of re-sale, which may support the existence of a conspiracy, but other than the emails from early 2013, the government did not present evidence to establish the existence of a continuing relationship between Fiore and Beuschel or to show what Fiore planned to do with drags. <em>See Guerra, </em>293 F.3d at 1286 (stating that \u201cthe buyer-seller rule is inapposite to [a] commercial supplier-dealer relationship\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>889 F.2d 1032, 1035-36 (11th Cir. 1989) (\u201cIn the case of a purchaser of narcotics, we have held that agreement may be inferred when the evidence shows a continuing relationship that results in the repeated transfer of illegal drags to the purchaser.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Nevertheless, the government presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Beuschel conspired with Anderson, the \u201cguy\u201d in Brooklyn, to traffic in counterfeit Viagra. Such a conspiratorial agreement may be inferred from Beuschel\u2019s comments during the May 2014 recorded conversation with the CS, which reflect that Beuschel obtained the counterfeit Viagra tablets from Anderson, who manufactured them, and then sold the tablets to others, such as the CS. <em>See Figueroa, </em>720 F.2d at 1244-45 (\u201cVega\u2019s admission that he obtained the drags from an unnamed Colombian and that he was engaged in drag trade warrants an inference of an agreement to \u2018possess [the drags] with intent to distribute\u2019 so as to sustain the conviction for conspiracy.\u201d). The existence of a \u201ccommercial supplier-dealer relationship\u201d between Beuschel and Anderson is also supported by Beuschel\u2019s statements that he could get 40,000 tablets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>from Anderson in two weeks and that he would put. the, CS directly in touch with Anderson. <em>See Guerra, </em>293 F.3d at 1286. The fact that Anderson was not indicted or brought to trial does not preclude a jury from concluding, consistent with the indictment, that Beuschel conspired with others \u201cunknown to the grand jury to intentionally traffic in a counterfeit drug.\u201d <em>See Figueroa, </em>720 F.2d at 1245 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Because sufficient evidence supports both of Beuschel\u2019s convictions, we affirm the district court\u2019s denials of his motions for judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">III. RULE 404(b) EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Beuschel next challenges the district court\u2019s admission under Rule 404(b), Fed. R. Evid., of a chain of emails wherein Beuschel and Fiore discussed a sale of \u201cskittles,\u201d or Viagra, in early 2013. We review a district court\u2019s admission of evidence under Rule 404(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>959 F.2d 1535, 1538 (11th Cir. 1992) <em>(en bane).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Rule 404(b) prohibits the admission of \u201c[ejvidence of a crime, wrong, or other act ... to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). Other-crimes evidence' may be admissible, however, for other purposes, such as to prove intent, knowledge, or absence of mistake or accident. <em>Id. </em>\u201cRule 404(b) is one of inclusion which allows extrinsic evidence unless it tends to prove only criminal propensity.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>668 F.3d 1298, 1314 (11th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">We use a three-part test to determine whether evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b): (1) the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than character; (2) sufficient proof must exist for a jury to find that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; and (3) the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, and the evidence must otherwise satisfy Rule 403. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1280 (11th Cir. 2003). Limiting instructions to the jury may \u201ccure[ ] any possible unfair prejudice posed by the 404(b) evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>665 F.3d 1239, 1248 (11th Cir. 2011) (alteration adopted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Anl\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the earlier emails. First, the emails were relevant to something outside of Beuschel\u2019s character, namely, his knowledge that the Viagra tablets were counterfeit, which he disputed. The emails were relevant to the government\u2019s showing that Beuschel consistently used coded language in circumstances where there was a possibility that the communication might be intercepted or read by someone else, such as in emails, but not in an ostensibly private setting, such as the meeting with the CS, during which Beuschel openly referred to Viagra and Cialis. In addition, Beuschel\u2019s statement that the \u201cskittles\u201d were \u201cmade\u201d for him was relevant to show his knowledge of counterfeit Viagra.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Second, the' government presented sufficient proof that Beuschel sent the emails. Beuschel does not challenge this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Third, the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice. Because Beuschel maintained that he believed the Viagra was authentic, the emails were probative of Beuschel\u2019s guilty knowledge. Beuschel has not provided any persuasive explanation of how he was unfairly prejudiced by the admission of the emails. Indeed, as he points out, the emails do not clearly involve the sale of counterfeit Viagra, and they contain the same coded language already before the jury through other evidence. In any case, the district court gave the jury a limiting instruction, which reduced the risk of any prejudice posed by the Rule 404(b) evidence. <em>See Brown, </em>665 F.3d at 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of the emails between Beuschel and Fiore from early 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">IV. SENTENCING GUIDELINES</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Finally, Beuschel challenges the court\u2019s calculation of the \u201cinfringement amount\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3. He contests both the number of counterfeit tablets for which he was held responsible and the value attributed to those tablets.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">With respect, to Sentencing Guidelines issues, we review purely legal questions <em>de novo, </em>a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and, in most cases, a district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts with due deference. <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir. 2010). We review the application of the relevant-conduct guideline for clear error. <em>United States v. Siegelman, </em>786 F.3d 1322, 1332 (11th Cir. 2015), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 798, 193 L.Ed.2d 765 (2016). We broadly interpret the provisions of the relevant-conduct guideline. <em>United States v. Behr, </em>93 F.3d 764, 765 (11th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">At sentencing, the district court is entitled to rely on undisputed factual statements in the PSR. <em>United States v. Beetles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 844 (11th Cir. 2009) (\u201cFacts contained in a [PSR] are undisputed and deemed to have been admitted unless a party objects to them before the sentencing court with specificity and clarity.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Further, the court may base its factual findings on evidence heard during trial. <em>United States v. Polar, </em>369 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">A. defendant who is convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320 is sentenced pursuant U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3, which provides for a base offense level of 8. Then, the offense level is increased based on the \u201cinfringement amount.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3(b)(l). If the infringement amount exceeds $5,000, the increase is determined by the table in \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">In broad terms, the infringement amount is calculated by multiplying the (1) number of \u201cinfringing items\u201d by (2) the retail value of either (a) the \u201cinfringed item\u201d or (b) the infringing item, depending on the circumstances. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3 cmt. n.2. The infringed item means the copyrighted item \u201cwith respect to which the crime against intellectual property was committed,\u201d while the infringing item means \u201cthe item that violates the copyright ,.. laws.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B5.3 cmt. n.l. So, here, the counterfeit drugs are the infringing items. We address the number, of infringing items first, and the question of value second.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-15\">\n<em>A. Number of Infringing Items</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b846-16\">The district court based the number of infringing items on the following conduct: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>(1) 2,724 counterfeit Viagra tablets Beus-chel shipped to the CS in June 2014; (2) 10,000 counterfeit Viagra tablets and 10,-000 counterfeit Cialis tablets he offered to sell to Fiore in early 2013; and (3) 560 counterfeit Viagra tablets and 560 counterfeit Cialis tablets he bought from Jacovcic in December 2012. Beuschel contends that the 2012 and 2013 transactions should not have been included as relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Sentencing courts must consider all relevant conduct, as defined in \u00a7 1B1.3, when calculating a defendant\u2019s guideline range. <em>Siegelman, </em>786 F.3d at 1332. Under \u00a7 1B1.3, relevant conduct includes \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant\u201d \u201cthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l), (2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n.3; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n.9 (defining \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d and \u201csame course of conduct\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relevant conduct may include both uncharged and acquitted conduct that is proven at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Siegelman, </em>786 F.3d at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Although Beuschel\u2019s arguments on appeal are less than precise, he does not appear to dispute that the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable was part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, Beuschel argues that the evidence was not sufficient to show that the tablets at issue were counterfeit or that he knew they were counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in determining the number of infringing items. First, sufficient evidence supports the court\u2019s inclusion of the 2012 transaction involving Jacovcic. According to undisputed statements in the PSR, Beuschel used the same coded language to refer to the Viagra and Cialis tablets (\u201cblue and orange candies\u201d and \u201cskittles\u201d), he bought the tablets for a similar price as the offense of conviction, which was well below wholesale, and samples of Viagra and Cialis seized from Jacovcic in December 2012, shortly after Beuschel purchased the \u201cfour-packs\u201d from him, were tested and found to be counterfeit. Based on these facts and their similarity to the trial evidence, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Beuschel knowingly trafficked counterfeit Viagra and Cialis in 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">Second, the district court appropriately held Beuschel responsible for a total of 1,120 tablets based on the 2012 transaction. Although Beuschel stated to the police that he bought 140 tablets each of Viagra and Cialis, his text messages with Jacovcic indicated that he purchased 140 \u201cfour-packs\u201d of each. In addition, Beuschel did not object to the PSR\u2019s statement that he bought a total of 1,120 tablets, so the court properly relied on that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">Third, sufficient evidence supports the district court\u2019s inclusion of the 2013 transaction involving Fiore. Again, this transaction involved the same use of coded language and the same low price per tablet. In addition, Beuschel stated that the tablets were \u201cmade for\u201d him, indicating his knowledge that the tablets were not legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>mate. Thus, the district court did' not err in finding that Beuschel knew the tablets were counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Beuschel\u2019s reliance on <em>Guerra </em>is misplaced. In <em>Guerra, </em>we agreed with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s holding that \u201cthe number of infringing items should correspond to the number of completed or nearly completed counterfeit goods.\u201d <em>Guerra, </em>293 F.3d at 1293. On that basis, we held that the district court erred in basing the number of infringing items on the number of cigar labels seized, when the counterfeit good was a completed cigar and the court did not make any \u201cdetermination as to the extent to which defendants had a reasonable likelihood of actually completing the goods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1293-94. Here, however, the emails reflect that Beuschel had \u201cthe allocation ready,\u201d suggesting that the counterfeit tablets were in existence and ready for shipment. Thus, they were properly considered as infringing items.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Finally, the government states that Beuschel was improperly held accountable for a total of 20,000 tablets, instead of 10,000 tablets, based on the 2013 transaction. According to the government, this error improperly increased his guideline range by two levels. We accept the government\u2019s confession of error and vacate and remand for sentencing to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">\n<em>B. Value of Infringed Items</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">The relevant \u201cretail value,\u201d for purposes of determining the infringement amount, is based either on the infringed item or the infringing item, depending on the circumstances. According to the commentary to \u00a7 2B5.3, courts should use the retail value of the <em>infringed </em>item if the 'case involves, among other situations listed in the commentary, an infringing item that \u201cis, or appears to a reasonably informed purchaser to be, identical or substantially equivalent to the infringed item.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3 cmt. n.2(A)(i). In a case not covered by one of the commentary\u2019s listed situations, courts should use the retail value of the <em>infringing </em>item. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B5.3 cmt. n.2(B). \u201cRetail value\u201d is defined as \u201cthe retail price of that item in the market in which it is sold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B5.3 cmt. n.2(C). In general, according to the commentary to \u00a7 2B5.3, \u201cthe sentences for defendants convicted of intellectual property offenses should reflect the nature and magnitude of the pecuniary harm caused by their crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B5.3 cmt. backg\u2019d.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Here, the district court adopted the government\u2019s position that the \u201cinfringed item\u201d in the offense of conviction was authentic, unexpired Viagra, and that the counterfeit Viagra \u201cis, or appears to a reasonably informed purchaser to be, identical or substantially equivalent to the infringed item.\u201d In support of its position, the government noted that the expiration date was difficult to see; that Beuschel directed the CS to remove the packaging, which showed that Beuschel was attempting to infringe on Viagra that still had retail value; and that the trial evidence established a substantial equivalence between the infringed and infringing items. Beuschel does not challenge any of these findings as clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Lozano, </em>490 F.3d 1317, 1322 (11th Cir. 2007) (reviewing the court\u2019s determination of the appropriate retail value for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">In light of these uncontested findings, the district court properly based the retail value on authentic, unexpired Viagra. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3 cmt. n.2(A)(i). Beuschel asserts that \u201c[t]he Government never produced any evidence of what the price of an expired Viagra pill was in the marketplace when it was sold and without this evidence, the Tidal Court could not factually conclude the proper infringement value.\u201d But the \u201cprice of an expired Viagra pill\u201d was not relevant to the court\u2019s infringement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>calculations, because the court determined that the \u201cinfringed item\u201d was authentic, unexpired Viagra, Overall, we are not persuaded that the court clearly erred in determining the values of the drugs at issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">In sum, we hold that sufficient evidence supports Beuschel\u2019s convictions for trafficking in counterfeit drugs and conspiring to traffic in counterfeit drugs and that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence under Rule 404(b). We therefore affirm Beuschel\u2019s convictions. We also conclude that Beuschel has not shown that the district court erred in calculating the infringement amount, and we affirm on these issues as well. Pursuant to the government\u2019s confession of error, however, we vacate and remand for resentencing to correct the limited error identified by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-12\">.

As for the evidentiary issues, they were not raised below and were not properly raised on appeal. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins.
