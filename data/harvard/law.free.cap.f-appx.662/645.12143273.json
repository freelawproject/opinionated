L. No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161, \u00a7 1 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, historical note). The Service denied Daniel\u2019s CAA application because, although he was statutorily eligible for adjustment, of status, significant adverse factors were present \u201cwhich show[ed] that discretion should not be exercised in [his] favor.\u201d Thereafter, Daniel timely filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Service denied in a short, written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AqIT\">In his complaint filed in federal district court, Daniel alleged that the Service committed procedural error in denying his motion for reconsideration, and he requested that his case be remanded to the Service for further consideration. Daniel specifically alleged that the Service failed to explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>the basis for denying his motion for reconsideration, which, he asserted, was required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.3(a)(l)(i) (\u201cWhen a Service officer denies an application or petition filed under \u00a7 103.2 of this part, the officer shall explain in writing the specific reasons for denial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The government<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> moved to dismiss the complaint on two grounds: (1) to the extent that Daniel was challenging the underlying discretionary denial of his CAA application, the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precluded review of immigration decisions committed to the discretion of the Attorney General or the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) Secretary, and, by extension, the Service; and (2) Daniel\u2019s stand-alone procedural challenge, which the government did not dispute could be brought, was merit-less because the Service adequately explained its reasons for denying Daniel\u2019s motion for reconsideration. In response, Daniel conceded that review of the discretionary denial of his CAA application would be barred by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) \u201c[bjecause Mr. Daniel\u2019s [CAA application] is under the purview of the Attorney General\u2019s discretion.\u201d But, he asserted, the bar did not apply to his complaint because he was challenging only the Service\u2019s alleged procedural error in ruling upon his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In granting the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court found that Daniel, despite his claim to the contrary, was indirectly attempting to obtain review of the underlying discretionary denial of his CAA application, as well as the discretionary denial of his motion to reconsider. His claim of procedural error, the court stated, was nothing more than a \u201cgame of semantics\u201d aimed at circumventing the jurisdictional bar. Thus, the court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In the alternative, the court found that, even if it exercised jurisdiction solely to review the alleged procedural error, Daniel failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted because the decision adequately complied with the procedural regulation relied upon by Daniel. Daniel now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, whether for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or for failure t\u2018o state a claim. <em>See Perez v. U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Servs., </em>774 F.3d 960, 965 (11th Cir. 2014). To avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">The APA permits persons aggrieved by final agency action to obtain judicial review in federal court where \u201cthere is no other adequate remedy in a court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702, 704. An agency action is final when the action .both (1) marks the end of the agency\u2019s decision-making process and (2) determines rights or obligations or has legal consequences. Perez, 774 F.3d at 965. A reviewing court shall, among other things, set aside agency action found to be \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d or \u201cwithout observance of procedure required by law.\u201d 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (D). However, the APA \u201cexpressly excepts review under its provisions where \u2018statutes preclude judicial review,\u2019 or \u2018agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perez, </em>774 F.3d at 965 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">This case implicates a question of first impression: whether the jurisdictional bar on review of discretionary decisions of the Attorney General or the DHS Secretary, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), applies to discretionary adjustment-of-status determinations under the CAA. We discuss this issue briefly, but, ultimately, we need not and do not resolve the matter because the issue is not properly before us on appe'al.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Cuban nationals may apply for and obtain adjustment of status under the CAA rather than 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255, the general statute governing adjustment-of-status decisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Provided that the Cuban applicant meets the statutory-eligibility requirements of the CAA, <em>see Toro v. Sec\u2019y, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>707 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir. 2013) (listing these requirements), the Attorney General may, in her discretion, adjust the applicant\u2019s status to that of a permanent resident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Perez, </em>774 F.3d at 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), courts do not have jurisdiction to review \u201cdiscretionary decisions or actions of the Attorney General or DHS Secretary.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because \u201c[t]he ultimate decision whether to grant adjustment of status under the CAA is discretionary,\u201d <em>Perez, </em>774 F.3d at 965, section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) would appear to bar review of discretionary decisions under the CAA, an understanding shared by both parties before the district court. That statutory bar, in turn, would preclude review under the APA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a) (APA review not available where \u201cstatutes preclude judicial review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Daniel argues, for the first time on appeal, that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) applies to the INA only, not to the separate CAA. Daniel\u2019s argument hinges on the somewhat anomalous status of the CAA, which is codified in the U.S. Code as a \u201chistorical note\u201d to \u00a7 1255. <em>See Perez, </em>774 F.3d at 967; <em>Toro, </em>707 F.3d at 1226. For \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to apply, the authority for the decision must be \u201cspecified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.\u201d \u2018\u201c[T]his subchapter\u2019 refers to Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>II, of the United States Code, codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151-1381 and titled \u2018Immigration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 239 n.3, 130 S.Ct. 827, 832 n.3, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010); <em>Zafar v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1361 (11th Cir. 2006). Thus, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) bars review of decisions that are specified by Congress in Subchap-ter II to be within the discretion of the Attorney General or DHS Secretary. <em>Za-far, </em>461 F.3d at 1361. While it is obvious that Congress has committed adjustment-of-status decisions under the CAA to the Attorney General\u2019s discretion, Daniel contends that the CAA is not part of Subchap-ter II and therefore falls outside the ambit of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s jurisdictional bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">We do not resolve this issue because Daniel expressly conceded to the district court that the discretionary denial of his CAA application was unreviewable under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Specifically, Daniel asserted in response to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) applied \u201c[bjecause Mr. Daniel\u2019s [CAA application] is under the purview of the Attorney General\u2019s discretion.\u201d He cannot now be heard to complain that the district court committed an error that he invited the court to make. <em>See Pensacola Motor Sales Inc. v. E. Shore Toyota, LLC, </em>684 F.3d 1211, 1231 (11th Cir. 2012) (\u201cA party that invites an error cannot complain when its invitation is accepted.\u201d). Consequently, to the extent Daniel\u2019s challenge to the Service\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration necessarily implicated review of the underlying discretionary denial of his CAA application, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Turning to Daniel\u2019s stand-alone claim of procedural error regarding the denial of his motion for reconsideration, we again must address our jurisdiction to review the issue. Daniel sought judicial review under the APA, which, as explained above, permits review of final agency action for which no other adequate remedy in court is available. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. These requirements appear to be satisfied here. The denial of Daniel\u2019s motion for reconsideration was the final decision of the Service relating to his CAA application, and it had legal consequences for his immigration status. <em>See Perez, </em>774 F.3d at 965. Daniel also may have no other adequate remedy to challenge that denial because, by regulation, the underlying denial of his application for adjustment of status under the CAA is non-appealable. <em>See id. </em>at 966. And \u201c[i]t is rudimentary administrative law that discretion as to the substance of the ultimate decision does not confer discretion to ignore the required procedures of decisionmaking.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 172, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 1166, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(D) (a reviewing court \u201cshall hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be without observance of procedure required by law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">In light of the \u201cstrong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action,\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 298, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2278, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), and the absence of any apparent bar to our exercise of jurisdiction, we find that jurisdiction exists under the APA and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 to review Daniel\u2019s limited claim of procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Daniel asserts that the Service\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration violated 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.3(a)(l)(i), which states that when a Service officer denies an application or petition filed to obtain benefits or adjust status, \u201cthe officer shall explain in writing the specific reasons for denial.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.3(a)(l)(i). However, while \u00a7 103.3(a)(l)(I) applied to the denial of his CAA application, Daniel is incorrect that this regulation applied to the denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>his motion for reconsideration. Instead, motions for reconsideration or reopening are governed by a separate regulation, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 108.5, which states that \u201c[t]he provisions of \u00a7 103.3(a)(2)(x) ... apply to decisions on motions.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.5(a)(7). And \u00a7 103.3(a)(2)(x), in turn, merely requires that \u201c[t]he decision must be in writing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.3(a)(2)(x). Accordingly, to comply with the applicable regulation, the Service\u2019s denial of Daniel\u2019s motion for reconsideration simply needed to be in writing, which it was. So, no procedural error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">But even if \u00a7 103.3(a)(l)(I) applied, Daniel still has not stated a plausible claim. The decision denying his motion for reconsideration succinctly but adequately explained the \u201cspecific reasons for the denial.\u201d The Service (a) summarized the reasons for the initial denial of his CAA application, (b) stated that it had \u201cthoroughly and carefully reviewed [his] Motion and supporting documents,\u201d (c) stated that it had \u201cdetermined that no new facts, or documentary evidence was filed,\u201d (d) and found that the \u201coriginal decision denying adjustment of status appears to be correct and supported by case law.\u201d Daniel has pointed to no regulation requiring the Service to address his motion for reconsideration in detail or to explicitly respond to each of his arguments. And Daniel cannot, as the district court recognized, obtain review of the merits of the decision through the guise of claiming \u201cprocedural\u201d error. In sum, no plausible basis exists to conclude that the Service failed to comply with its procedural obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">.
