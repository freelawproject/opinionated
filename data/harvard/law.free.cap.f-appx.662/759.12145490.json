Mr. Cacciamani and his wife, Nora Cacciamani, now appeal the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Target. Previously, the district court granted summary judgment on the merits in favor of Target. The Cacciamanis appealed that decision, and this Court affirmed. The district court then awarded Target its attorney\u2019s fees. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">A. The Past Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b778-15\">On February 28, 2014, the Cacciamanis brought suit against Target.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 25, 2014, the district court granted Target\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on all counts. The Cacciamanis appealed, and, on July 14, 2015, this Court affirmed. Cacciamani v. Target Corp., 622 Fed.Appx. 800 (11th Cir. 2015) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-16\">' During that first appeal, Target filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees in this Court. The motion asked only for .attorney\u2019s fees for the litigation of the appeal. We denied that motion in a footnote in our opinion, stating, in full: \u201cWe deny defendant Target\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees before this Court. Nothing herein should be construed as addressing the issue pending before the district court.\u201d Cacciamani, 622 Fed.Appx. at 805 n.6. Target filed a similar motion for attorney\u2019s fees in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-17\">B. Florida Statute \u00a7 768.79</p>\n<p id=\"b778-18\">To review the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees, we first must outline the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>relevant Florida statute and then the settlement offers. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Florida Statute \u00a7 768.79 provides that a defendant, who makes an offer of judgment that the plaintiff rejects, \u201cshall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred\u201d if the judgment in the case is one of no liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3C\">In any civil action for damages filed in the courts of this state, if a defendant files an offer of judgment which is not accepted by the plaintiff within 30 days, the defendant shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred by her or him or on the defendant\u2019s behalf pursuant to a policy of liability insurance or other contract from the date of filing of the offer if the judgment is one of no liability or the judgment obtained by the plaintiff is at least 25 percent less than such offer, and the court shah set off such costs and attorney\u2019s fees against the award. Where such costs and attorney\u2019s fees total more than the judgment, the court shall enter judgment for the defendant against the plaintiff for the amount of the costs and fees, less the amount of the plaintiffs award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.79(1). The statute further provides that, once a party is entitled to recover costs and attorney\u2019s fees under that section, a court may \u201cdetermine that an offer was not made in good faith\u201d and \u201cmay disallow an award of costs and attorney\u2019s fees\u201d if the offer was not made in good faith. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.79(7)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">At the time of the offer, \u201c[t]he obligation of good faith merely insists that the offeror have some reasonable foundation on which to base an offer.\u201d McMahan v. Toto, 311 F.3d 1077, 1083 (11th Cir. 2002) (quotation marks omitted). A lack of good faith \u201cis the sole basis on which the court can disallow an entitlement to an award of fees.\u201d TGI Friday\u2019s, Inc. v. Dvorak, 663 So.2d 606, 612 (Fla. 1995). \u201c[T]he reasonableness of the rejection is irrelevant to the question of entitlement\u201d to an award of attorney\u2019s fees and may only bear on the reasonableness of the amount of the award. Id. at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.442 provides, among other things, for the service, form, and content of a proposal for settlement, as well as for the court to determine the existence of good faith and the amount of reasonable fees. See generally, Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">C. Settlement Offers</p>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">On February 22, 2013, before this lawsuit was refiled, Target proposed a settlement to Mr.' Cacciamani for the total amount of $44,000, pursuant to Florida Statute \u00a7 768.79 and Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.442. The settlement agreement includes language stating that Mr. Cacciamani was not a Medicare beneficiary. It provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-13\">The Releasor, Christian Cacciamani, affirms that he is not currently a Medicare beneficiary and has never received any Medicare benefits arising out of or related to this claim. The parties further acknowledge that the Releasor\u2019s representation about his Medicare beneficiary status is material and is a condition precedent to settling this claim....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af2K\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArJ\">... [Tjhe parties agree that there is no risk of shifting future medical expenses to the Medicare program after the settlement of this claim because the Relea-sor, Christian Cacciamani, hereby acknowledges that no further medical treatment is needed, warranted or required with regard to any alleged injuries sustained or arising out of this accident, occurrence or claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-15\">Taking into account the various factors of 'this claim including the Relea-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>sor\u2019s alleged injuries, claimed economic losses, and claimed pain and suffering, no portion of this settlement is allocated for future medical expenses and is therefore not a settlement contemplated by the Medicare Secondary Payer Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQF\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-4\">... In addition, any future medical treatment relating to body parts allegedly injured, sustained or arising out of this accident, occurrence or claim, or expenses incurred by the Releasor for like or similar injuries, are the sole responsibility of the Releasor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Because Medicare can seek to recoup its medical payments, insurers often want to know that Medicare will not be an issue later.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">On February 22, 2013, Target also served a separate settlement proposal to Mrs. Cacciamani for the amount of $1,000. This proposal contains language regarding confidentiality of the agreement before listing the monetary terms of the agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">Plaintiff and her counsel must agree to maintain the confidentiality of the settlement terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">TOTAL AMOUNT OF PROPOSAL:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-9\">One Thousand Dollars ($1,000)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">AMOUNT ATTRIBUTED TO PUNITIVE DAMAGES:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">None.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-12\">PROVISIONS FOR ATTORNEY FEES:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-14\">Included in settlement amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">D. District Court Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b780-16\">On February 25, 2016, the district court granted Target\u2019s Motion for Attorney\u2019s Fees. Mr. Cacciamani argued that the release within his proposed settlement was void against public policy or tantamount to fraud. The district court rejected that argument because Mr. Cacciamani provided no explanation for his position. The district court concluded that Target\u2019s offer was \u201cmade before the parties had a full understanding of the nature and scope of the damages\u201d and was made in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-18\">Mrs. Cacciamani argued that the confidentiality clause in her proposed settlement is ambiguous and that therefore it was reasonable for her to reject the offer. The district court disagreed because the terms of the settlement are straightforward and appear immediately following the confidentiality language. The district court also concluded that this Court\u2019s denial of a similar motion for attorney\u2019s fees did not require the district court to do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-19\">After considering the statutory factors for determining a reasonable amount of attorney\u2019s fees, the district court awarded Target $76,401.50 in attorney\u2019s fees and the additional amounts of $13,691.49 and $8,995.57 for costs incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-20\">The Cacciamanis filed a motion for reconsideration of the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which the district court denied. The Cacciamanis argued that agreeing in the release that \u201cno further medical treatment is needed\u201d amounted to fraud and thus the proposed settlement required Mr. Cacciamani to commit fraud and was not made in good faith. The district court disagreed because (1) whether an offer is made in good faith is judged based on the information known to the offeror (Target) at the time the offer is made and (2) Target was not made aware of Mr. Cacciamani\u2019s ongoing medical care until during discovery, more than a year after Target made the settlement offer. The district court thus concluded that it had not erred in finding that Target offered the proposed settlement in good faith based on the information available to it at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>With respect to Mrs. Caceiamani, \u25a0 the district court found that she did not raise any new facts or arguments in her motion for reconsideration and declined to consider new arguments and cases she presented only in her reply supporting her motion. The district court reiterated that this Court was clear in its opinion that the district court need not follow our ruling in denying the motion for attorney\u2019s fees. The district court denied the motion for reconsideration. The Cacciamanis\u2019 appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ASB\">A. The Law of the Case Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The Cacciamanis argue that this Court\u2019s prior opinion bars Target from receiving attorney\u2019s fees. This argument is frivolous. The district court correctly concluded that this Court\u2019s prior opinion did not have any binding effect on its adjudication of Target\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">We certainly recognize that \u201c[t]he law of the case doctrine bars relitigation of issues that were decided, either explicitly or by necessary implication, in an earlier appeal of the same case.\u201d United States v. Jordan, 429 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir. 2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cUnder the \u2018law of the case\u2019 doctrine, the findings of fact and conclusions of law by an appellate court are generally binding in all subsequent proceedings in the same case in the trial court or on a later appeal.\u201d Transamerica Leasing, Inc. v. Inst. of London Underwriters, 430 F.3d 1326, 1331 (11th Cir. 2005) (quotation marks omitted). The mandate rule is a specific application of the law of the case doctrine and dictates that a trial court receiving the mandate of an appellate court \u201cmust enter an order in strict compliance with the mandate\u201d and is bound to follow the appellate court\u2019s express and implied holdings, although it may address issues not disposed of on appeal. Id (quotation marks omitted),</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">Here, our previous opinion explicitly stated that we did not address the issue of attorney\u2019s fees. We made no findings of fact or conclusions of law and did not decide, that issue. Given the express language in our opinion, the law of the case doctrine and the mandate rule do not bar Target\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees in the district court. If anything, the law of this case is that the district court was free to address the issue on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">B. Mr. Cacciamani\u2019s Settlement Offer</p>\n<p id=\"b781-14\">With respect to Mr. Caceiamani, the district court properly examined only whether Target made its settlement offer in good faith and not whether it was reasonable for Mr. Caceiamani to reject the offer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> .</p>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">We agree with the district court that Mr. Caceiamani has not met his \u201cburden to prove that the offeror acted in bad- faith.\u201d Mr. Caceiamani points to no evidence showing that Target knew,, at the time it made the offer, that the statement \u201cno further medical treatment is needed\u201d was incorrect. Indeed, the only evidence Mr. Caceiamani points to indicating that Target knew about his ongoing medical treatment was a response to interrogatories from June 2014, over a year after the settlement offer was made.</p>\n<p id=\"AxWm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>It may have been reasonable for Mr. Caeciamani to reject the settlement offer and to refuse to stipulate that he would no longer need medical care because he knew he would need continuing care. That, however, is not the relevant inquiry. Instead, we look to whether Target acted in good faith and had a reasonable foundation to make the offer. Target\u2019s offer was for $44,000, a far from nominal sum, and a significant amount in light of the fact that Target was found not liable. Target did not find out about Mr. Cacciamani\u2019s ongoing medical treatment until over a year later. In light of these circumstances, and without any contrary evidence, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that Target acted <em>in </em>good faith and is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Florida\u2019s \u201cshall\u201d rule in \u00a7 768.79.</p>\n<p id=\"AoXs\">C. Mrs. Cacciamani\u2019s Settlement Offer</p>\n<p id=\"AjH\">With respect to the offer to Mrs. Caeciamani, the issue is whether the confidentiality provision is impermissibly ambiguous. We agree with the district court that it is not.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rule 1.442 requires a proposal for settlement to \u201cstate with particularity any relevant conditions\u201d and \u201cstate with particularity all nonmonetary terms of the proposal.\u201d Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.442(c)(2)(C)-(D). A settlement proposal must \u201cbe sufficiently clear and definite to allow the offeree to make an informed decision without needing clarification\u201d or else it is ambiguous and unenforceable. Alamo Fin., L.P. v. Mazoff, 112 So.3d 626, 629-30 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"A3h\">The confidentiality provision in the proposed settlement to Mrs. Caeciamani is not impermissibly vague. It indicates who is bound by the provision\u2014Mrs. Caeciamani and her attorney\u2014and it is immediately followed by the key monetary terms of the agreement. Clearly, the agreement would require Mrs. Caeciamani and her counsel to keep confidential the amount of the settlement as well as the terms of the release incorporated therein. The district court correctly concluded that the confidentiality provision is straightforward. The entire proposal and attached release are only a few pages long and the terms are limited. It is unclear what greater specification would be necessary for Mrs. Cac-ciamani to make an informed decision. The confidentiality provision is unambiguous, and Target\u2019s proposed settlement agreement satisfies the requirements of Rule 1.442(c)(2)(C)-(D). Mrs. Caeciamani has shown no error in the district court\u2019s ruling in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"A9mo\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"A5R\">For the foregoing reasons, we must affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that Target is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 768.79 in a total amount to be 'determined by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"AGfB\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-10\">.
