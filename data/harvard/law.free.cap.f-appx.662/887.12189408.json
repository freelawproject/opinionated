The district court affirmed. After careful review, we also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">This appeal presents a discrete issue arising out of a group of cases that have been litigated around the world for almost a decade.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Little Rest once operated a restaurant in New York City. A group led by Zeltser and a group led by Patricia A. Redmond disputed who was authorized to represent Little Rest. Their dispute stemmed from a larger conflict over Little Rest\u2019s ownership.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ownership issue was pending before both a New York state court and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida, which was presiding over a related Chapter 11 action. During the pendency of these actions, Zeltser filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on behalf of Little Rest in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Redmond immediately moved for and was granted a transfer of the Chapter 7 action to the Florida bankruptcy court. Two weeks later, the trustee moved to dismiss the Chapter 7 action because of the pending Chapter 11 action against the same debtor. The Florida bankruptcy court dismissed the Chapter 7 action but sua sponte reserved its jurisdiction to award sanctions against Zeltser for filing the Chapter 7 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-9\">After Redmond moved for sanctions, the bankruptcy court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> found that \u201cit is clear ... that Mr. Zeltser acted improperly and in bad faith in filing the voluntary chapter 7 bankruptcy case for [Little Rest].\u201d The bankruptcy court determined that Zeltser knew of the ownership and control dispute, as he had even asked the bankruptcy court to decide that dispute in the Chapter 11 action. This of course cast doubt on his authority to file for Chapter 7 for Little Rest. Further, the bankruptcy court found the Chapter 7 filing \u201cwas for the improper purpose of delaying [] imminent adverse ruling[s] on ownership and control of [Little Rest].\u201d It emphasized that Zeltser forum shopped, orchestrating the filing of the Chapter 11 action in Florida, the filing of the Chapter 7 action in New York, and attempting to unsuccessfully remove a case. Finally, the bankruptcy court found Mr. Zeltser \u201csimply not believable\u201d and gave no weight to his \u201cex post facto argument[s]\u201d to avoid sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">After an evidentiary hearing, the bankruptcy court awarded Little Rest $100,586 in attorney\u2019s fees and expenses incurred \u201cas a result of the frivolous filing.\u201d In that order, the bankruptcy court noted that this action is part of \u201cone of the most complex and difficult cases pending in the Southern District of Florida,\u201d awarding sanctions \u201cin the context of the forum shopping litigation spawned by Mr. Zeltser\u201d and the \u201cjurisdictional morass\u201d he created. It added that \u201cthe complexity of these matters!] require[ed] numerous hours of research, drafting, and preparation.\u201d To arrive at the $100,586 amount, the bankruptcy court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>applied a twenty-percent reduction volunteered by Little Rest to account for any duplication even though the bankruptcy court \u201cspecifically [found] Mr. Zeltser responsible for\u201d those funds as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">\u201cFederal courts, including bankruptcy courts, have the inherent power to impose sanctions on parties and lawyers.\u201d In re Walker, 532 F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). \u201cTo impose sanctions under these inherent powers, the court first must find bad faith.\u201d Id. We review an award of sanctions for abuse of discretion and a finding of bad faith for clear error. In re Porto, 645 F.3d 1294, 1303-04 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">Zeltser argues for the first time in this case that the bankruptcy court was required to support its finding of bad faith by clear and convincing evidence. However, he cites no binding precedent for that proposition. We have held \u201c[a] finding of bad faith is warranted where an attorney knowingly or recklessly raises a frivolous argument,\u201d or where an attorney delays or disrupts litigation. Walker 532 F.3d at 1309 (quotation omitted). But \u201ca court must do more than conclude that a party acted in bad faith; it should make specific findings as to the party\u2019s conduct that warrants sanctions.\u201d Porto, 645 F.3d at 1304 (quotation omitted). As detailed above, the bankruptcy court marshalled specific evidence to support its finding of bad faith. It supported its finding with evidence of Zeltser\u2019s delay, forum shopping, and knowledge that his authority to file actions for Little Rest was in question. Thus, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in finding bad faith. Zeltser\u2019s remaining arguments attack the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings. We discern no clear error in those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">Zeltser also attacks the monetary award as \u201cgrossly excessive.\u201d \u201cWe review for abuse of discretion the [trial] court\u2019s imposition of sanctions in a certain amount.\u201d Martin v. Automobili Lamborghini Exclusive, Inc., 307 F.3d 1332, 1336 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam). \u201cA [trial] court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, follows improper procedures in making the determination, or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">Zeltser attempts to dispute line items on the billing records produced by Little Rest\u2019s counsel as duplicative, \u2022 unreasonable, and excessive. The bankruptcy court held the \u201cnumerous hours of research, drafting, and preparation\u201d were a result of \u201cthe jurisdictional morass created by Mr. Zeltser.\u201d It also granted a twenty-percent reduction in fees that it did not believe Zeltser deserved. The district court added that Zeltser was warned' supplemental briefing could increase the fee award against him. Again, there are no clear errors in these findings.-</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">. This opinion focuses on the sanctions issue.
