After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-23\">In his complaint, Garcia alleged that despite the fact that he worked more than 40 hours in each week he was employed by Yachting Promotions, he was not appropriately compensated for his overtime work. Yachting Promotions argued that Garcia was not entitled to the time-and-a-half overtime pay otherwise mandated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>FLSA because he had agreed to be paid according to the fluctuating workweek method. Indeed, on March 2, 2007, Garcia signed a form that read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-4\">This will confirm that beginning on March 2nd the Company will continue to pay your weekly base salary for all hours worked in a workweek. You understand that your weekly hours will fluctuate and that this base salary will compensate you for any and all hours worked. In order to reward you for those times when your supervisor approves work greater than 40 hours in any given workweek all eligible salaried non-exempt employees will begin receiving at least an additional half-time for those hours greater than 40 in a workweek. To monitor this compensation program, the Company requires [you] to maintain the current practice of: (a) keeping a daily record of the number of hours worked and submitting it to your corresponding office\u2019s record keeper; and (b) having received authorization from your supervisor before working more than 40 hours in any given workweek.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-5\">This salary method of payment may be changed or modified as deemed appropriate by the Company. If you have any questions regarding this feel free to contact me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">I have read and understand the above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARN\">Moreover, Garcia acknowledged in his deposition that he understood he was paid on a salary basis, so that he received $779.48 of base pay each week. But Garcia, a native Spanish speaker, argues that he did not understand the document he signed and only did so because he was told that he had to in order to keep his job. He also asked his supervisors on multiple occasions how his pay was calculated, but never received a clear answer. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Yachting Promotions, finding that Garcia had a clear understanding of how he was to be compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, taking all of the facts in the record and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Bioux v. City of Atlanta, 520 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2008); Skop v. City of Atlanta, 485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th Cir. 2007). Summary judgment is proper where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \u201cA factual dispute is genuine \u2018if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u2019 \u201d Hinkle v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc., 827 F.3d 1295, 1300 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Generally, the FLSA requires employers to pay an employee one and one-half times the employee\u2019s \u201cregular rate\u201d for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). The \u201cregular rate\u201d is the hourly rate at which the employer pays the employee for normal, non-overtime hours in a 40-hour workweek. See Walling v. Youngerman-Reynolds Hardwood Co., 325 U.S. 419, 65 S.Ct. 1242, 89 L.Ed. 1705 (1945). But FLSA implementing regulations provide for an alternative way to calculate the compensation of certain salaried employees: the fluctuating workweek method. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114. The fluctuating workweek method of payment allows an employee whose hours fluctuate from week to week to be compensated at a fixed amount per week as straight-time pay irrespective of the number of hours worked, whether few or many. Id. Payment for overtime hours under this method is at one-half time regular-rate instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>of the standard one and one-half time rate because, in theory, the straight-time rate already includes compensation for all hours worked. Notably, the fluctuating workweek method is merely one way to meet the FLSA\u2019s overtime requirements\u2014 it is not an exception to those requirements. Lamonica v. Safe Hurricane Shutters, Inc., 711 F.3d 1299, 1311 (11th Cir. 2013). Thus, the employee bears the burden of proving that the employer failed to properly administer the payments. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The Department of Labor\u2019s regulations permitting the fluctuating workweek to be implemented require that four criteria be met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">(1) the employee clearly understands that the straight-salary covers whatever hours he or she is required to work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">(2) the straight-salary is paid irrespective of whether the workweek is one in which a full schedule of hours are worked;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">(3) the straight-salary is sufficient to provide a pay-rate not less than the applicable minimum wage rate for every hour worked in those workweeks in which the number of hours worked is greatest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-9\">(4) in addition to straight-salary, the employee is paid for all hours in excess of the statutory maximum at a rate not less than one-half the regular rate of pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114. The only point at issue here is the first prong, whether Garcia had a clear understanding of how he was to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">The fluctuating workweek method of payment applies only if there is a clear mutual understanding of the parties that the fixed salary is compensation for however many hours the employee may work in a particular week, rather than for a fixed number of hours per week. See Clements v. Serco, Inc., 530 F.3d 1224, 1230 (10th Cir. 2008); see also Valerio v. Putnam As-socs. Inc., 173 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 1999) (same). One way that clear mutual understanding can be achieved directly is by employers working to educate their employees. See Samson v. Apollo Res., Inc., 242 F.3d 629, 637 (5th Cir. 2001). An employee does not have to understand every contour of how the fluctuating workweek method is used to calculate salary, so long as the employee understands that his base salary is fixed regardless of the hours worked. Clements, 530 F.3d at 1230; Samson, 242 F.3d at 636-37; Valerio, 173 F.3d at 40. Crucially, the employee must \u201cclearly understand[] that the salary covers whatever hours the job may demand in a particular workweek and the employer pays the salary even though the workweek is one in which a full schedule of hours is not worked.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114(c). As the Fourth Circuit has explained, \u201cthe existence of a clear mutual understanding under \u00a7 778.114 can be based on the implied terms of one\u2019s employment agreement if it is clear from the employee\u2019s actions that he or she understood the payment plan in spite of after-the-fact verbal contentions otherwise.\u201d Monahan v. Cty. of Chesterfield, Va., 95 F.3d 1263, 1281 (4th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Here, there is no genuine dispute of material fact that Garcia had a clear understanding that his base salary remained the same regardless of how many hours he worked, be it over or under 40 hours a week. For starters, the memorandum he signed regarding Yachting Promotions\u2019 adoption of the fluctuating workweek method of calculating his pay provided that \u201cthe Company will continue to pay [his] weekly base salary for all hours worked in a workweek\u201d and that he understood that \u201c[his] weekly hours will fluctuate and that this base salary will compensate [him] for any and all hours worked.\u201d (Emphasis added). But even if we assume that Garcia did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>not comprehend English well enough to understand the memorandum, it is clear from the record that Garcia understood that the fluctuating method would be used. In his deposition, Garcia admitted that during the relevant time period, he was not paid on an hourly basis, but was paid \u201cby [a] salary\u201d of $779,84 per week. Moreover, Garcia submitted evidence indicating that as early as 2006, one supervisor had explained to him that he was a \u201csalary employee who did receive overtime,\u201d and another instructed that he be told that he was \u201ca salary employee\u201d and was paid a \u201cweekly salary,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">As for Garcia\u2019s claim that his supervisors gave confusing answers to his questions about how his overtime pay was calculated, we are unpersuaded. As many courts have said, an employee does not have to understand every contour of how the fluctuating workweek method is used to calculate salary, so long as the employee understands that his base salary is fixed regardless of the hours worked. Clements, 530 F.3d at 1230; Samson, 242 F.3d at 636-37; Valerio, 173 F.3d at 40. Garcia has put forth no evidence that he did not understand what the term \u201csalary\u201d meant, nor is there anything in the record to suggest that he did not understand that his salary would be paid even if he worked less than the \u201cfull schedule of hours\u201d for the week. Thus, we cannot say that there is any dispute of fact about whether Garcia clearly understood that the fluctuating workweek method applied to him. Accordingly, because no other issues are in dispute, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment in favor of Yachting Promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
