CareM-inders contends that the district court should have vacated the award under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(3), because the arbitrator engaged in misconduct by failing to postpone a hearing when both sides had .agreed to postpone it. The plaintiffs contend that CareMinders\u2019 appeal is not only wrong, but also frivolous, and they have moved for sanctions on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">This case arose out of a contract dispute. The plaintiffs asserted claims against Car-eMinders for breach of contract, and they demanded to arbitrate those claims as required by their contracts. After months of initial proceedings, the arbitrator scheduled a final five-day evidentiary hearing for December 8-12, 2014, in Atlanta. When. a scheduling conflict arose, both sides requested a new date, and the arbitrator rescheduled the hearing for February 9-13, 2015. When yet another scheduling conflict arose, both sides again requested a new date, and the arbitrator again rescheduled the hearing, this time for March 9-13, 2015. What happened next is the main source of the parties\u2019 dispute on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">On Friday, February 27, 2015, CareMin-ders\u2019 attorney sent an email to the arbitrator, advising him that one of the company\u2019s key witnesses, Gary Kneller, was in the midst of a family emergency. The attorney explained that Kneller\u2019s mother, who lived in Chicago, \u201chad been battling serious health issues the past few weeks,\u201d and that Kneller had \u201cbeen flying between Chicago and Atlanta to split time caring for his mother\u201d while also preparing for the hearing. That morning, Kneller\u2019s mother had suffered a second stroke that would require surgery and her doctors had scheduled the. surgery for the same week as the final hearing in March. CareMinders\u2019 attorney explained that because \u201cthere are no other family members who can be with his mother that week,\u201d Kneller \u201cmust be in Chicago to care for her during that time.\u201d As a result, CareMinders asked the arbitrator to immediately postpone the hearing and to inform the parties of his availability during the period of May to September so that they could reschedule. CareMinders also noted that the plaintiffs had \u201cagreed this hearing should be rescheduled so that Mr. Kneller can attend to his mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The arbitrator responded to CareMin-ders\u2019 email on the same day and set a conference call for Monday, March 2,2015, to discuss rescheduling the hearing. The arbitrator also stated that he was \u201cnot yet agreeing to reschedule,\u201d and that he wanted to discuss \u201cwhether there is a way not to postpone, notwithstanding Mr. Kneller\u2019s family situation.\u201d He explained that while he was \u201ccertainly sympathetic to Mr. Knel-ler\u2019s situation,\u201d he was \u201calso concerned that this case has already been rescheduled twice before, and now may not be heard for 6 months beyond the originally scheduled hearing dates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">The conference call took place as scheduled on March 2. During the call, Kneller \u201cexplained the grave and ongoing nature of his mother\u2019s condition, that there were no other friends or family available in Chicago to care for his mother, and that he was a critical witness for CareMinders and needed to attend the hearing in person.\u201d CareMinders\u2019 attorney also advised the arbitrator \u201cthat postponing the hearing only a few days would be insufficient, since it was likely that Mr. Kneller and his mother would be in the same circumstances for at least the next several days.\u201d The arbitrator asked whether it would be possible for Kneller to attend the hearing remotely, by telephone or video conference, but CareM-inders\u2019 attorney claimed that option was not feasible. According to CareMinders\u2019 attorney, the arbitrator \u201cremained firm that the hearing must take place in the month of March\u201d and \u201cdirected the parties to agree on alternative dates in March or to otherwise be prepared to attend the hearing as scheduled on March 9.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">The parties conferred by email and sent proposed dates to the arbitrator. Based on the dates the parties provided, the arbitrator rescheduled the hearing for March 18-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>21, 2015, reducing it from five days to four days. In his revised scheduling order, the arbitrator explained that he had changed the dates of the hearing \u201cdue to a family health emergency for Mr. Kneller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The final hearing took place as re-re-rescheduled. Kneller attended all four days of the hearing and testified at length. Five days after the hearing ended, Kneller\u2019s mother passed away.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The arbitrator issued a standard award, without a written explanation, finding in favor of the plaintiffs and awarding damages. After that, the plaintiffs filed a motion to confirm the award in federal court. CareMinders responded by filing a motion to vacate the award under the FAA, contending that the arbitrator engaged in misconduct by refusing to postpone the hearing when both parties had agreed to it. In support of its motion, CareMinders submitted an affidavit by Kneller in which he stated that \u201c[d]uring the arbitration, [he] was making and receiving phone calls from the hospital in Chicago, getting updates on [his] mother\u2019s condition and making decisions about life support.\u201d He maintained that those circumstances rendered him \u201cill-prepared for the arbitration\u201d and that, as a result, he did not present \u201c[s]ome evidence and material information\u201d at the hearing and that the evidence he did present \u201cwas not presented in the same way or in the same order that it would have been, had [he] been able to mentally and physically present and focused in the days leading up to the arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The district court denied the motion to vacate, finding that \u2018CareMinders had failed to show that the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to postpone the hearing amounted to misconduct or that it sufficiently prejudiced the company\u2019s ability to mount a defense. The court later issued an order confirming the award, which CareMinders appeals here. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. Gianelli Money Purchase Plan &amp; Trust v. ADM Investor Servs., Inc., 146 F.3d 1309, 1311 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">The FAA permits a court to vacate an arbitration award \u201cwhere the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(3). To establish misconduct, the party moving for vacatur must show that there was no reasonable basis for the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to postpone the hearing. See Johnson v. Directory Assistants, Inc., 797 F.3d 1294, 1301 (11th Cir. 2015). In deciding whether there was any reasonable basis for an arbitrator\u2019s decision to refuse a request for a postponement, we are mindful of federal policy favoring the \u201cexpeditious handling\u201d of arbitration cases, and also that a rescheduled hearing would have to not only \u201cmeet the convenience of both parties and their witnesses,\u201d but the convenience of the arbitrator as well. Schmidt v. Finberg, 942 F.2d 1571, 1574 (11th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">We may vacate an award on these grounds only if the arbitrator\u2019s choice \u201cprejudice[d] the rights of the parties and denie[d] them a fair hearing.\u201d Robbins v. Day, 954 F.2d 679, 685 (11th Cir. 1992), disapproved on other grounds by First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). Prejudice might occur when, for example, the arbitrator\u2019s choice not to postpone a hearing entirely prevents a party from presenting a key witness\u2019 material, noncumulative testimony. See Tempo Shain Corp. v. Bertek, Inc., 120 F.3d 16, 20-21 (2d Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">CareMinders contends that the arbitrator\u2019s decision about postponing the final hearing warrants vacatur under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>FAA. The arbitrator did grant a postponement, but not the one CareMinders wanted. CareMinders requested that the arbitrator postpone the hearing until sometime between May and September 2015. He instead postponed the hearing to March 18-21, 2015, to avoid the conflict with the scheduled surgery. So CareMinders\u2019 actual argument is that the arbitrator engaged in misconduct by granting a postponement that was shorter than the one it had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">CareMinders\u2019 argument fails. To begin with, it cannot show that there was no reasonable basis for the arbitrator\u2019s choice. See Johnson, 797 F.3d at 1301. As the district court aptly noted, the arbitrator was faced with \u201cthe unenviable predicament of trying to accommodate Kneller\u2019s unfortunate situation while also trying to ensure the expeditious resolution of the case.\u201d The arbitrator attempted to serve both of those competing interests by granting a nine-day postponement, which allowed Kneller to be in Chicago for his mother\u2019s surgery, while also ensuring that the arbitration would proceed expeditiously. CareMinders challenges the accuracy of the arbitrator\u2019s statement that, if he had chosen to further postpone the hearing, the matter \u201cnow may not be heard for 6 months beyond the originally scheduled dates.\u201d But that statement is accurate enough. CareMinders itself suggested to the arbitrator that the hearing could be rescheduled to dates as late as August or September 2015, which would be well over six months past the originally scheduled dates in December 2014. We cannot say that, under those circumstances, the arbitrator\u2019s decision to grant the shorter postponement lacked any reasonable basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">We also reject the CareMinders\u2019 contention that ah arbitrator\u2019s refusal to grant a postponement when the parties have mutually agreed to one is per se unreasonable and mandates vacatur. An arbitrator is entitled to consider not only \u201cthe convenience of both parties and their witnesses,\u201d but his convenience as well. Schmidt, 942 F.2d at 1574. And he is entitled to take into consideration the need to ensure the expeditious resolution of the case. See id. A per se rule would undermine those considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">CareMinders has also failed to show that the arbitrator\u2019s refusal to postpone the hearing prejudiced its rights or deprived it of a fair hearing. See Robbins, 954 F.2d at 685. The arbitrator\u2019s decision did not prevent Kneller from testifying at the hearing altogether. To the contrary, he provided hours of testimony. While Car-eMinders baldly asserts that Kneller \u201ccould have done a much better job\u201d had he been given more time to prepare, it fails to explain how he would have done so. CareMinders contends that \u201c[i]t is not reasonable to expect, as there is no realistic way for Mr. Kneller to prove, what he would have done differently.\u201d But CareM-inders could have told us what material testimony Kneller would have provided that he did not, or what he would have said differently. It has not done so, leaving nothing but speculation that things might\u2014just might\u2014have been different. That simply is not enough to establish prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">We have stated in other contexts that litigants generally are entitled to fair proceedings, not perfect ones. See United States v. Espinosa-Orlando, 704 F.2d 507, 514 (11th Cir. 1983) (\u201cThe Constitution mandates fair, not perfect, trials.\u201d). The same holds true for arbitration. CareMin-ders was entitled to a fair arbitration proceeding, not a perfect one. See Rosensweig v. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Inc., 494 F.3d 1328, 1333 (11th Cir. 2007) (explaining that while parties are entitled to a \u201cfundamentally fair hearing\u201d in arbitration, \u201carbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tors are not required to follow all the niceties observed by the federal courts\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). Because Car-eMinders got a fair proceeding, we will not vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The plaintiffs move for sanctions on the ground that CareMinders\u2019 appeal is frivolous. See Fed. R, App. P. 38 (authorizing a court of appeals to impose sanctions when it \u201cdetermines that an appeal is frivolous\u201d). We have expressed our exasperation with \u201cthose who attempt to salvage arbitration losses through litigation that has no sound basis in the law applicable to arbitration awards.\u201d B.L. Harbert Int\u2019l, LLC v. Hercules Steel Co., 441 F.3d 905, 914 (11th Cir. 2006), abrogated on other grounds by Frazier v. CitiFinancial Corp., 604 F.3d 1313 (11th Cir. 2010). We have also warned that \u201cit may be that we can and should insist that if a party on the short end of an arbitration award attacks that award in court without any real legal basis for doing so, that party should pay sanctions.\u201d Id. at 913. \u201cA realistic threat of sanctions may discourage baseless litigation over arbitration awards and help fulfill the purposes of the pro-arbitration policy contained in the FAA,\u201d Id. at 913-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In this case, however, we believe sanctions are not called for. This is not a case where the arbitration loser is simply quarreling with the merits of the arbitrator\u2019s decision-. See, e.g., id. at 911-13, Our review of our precedents reveals few decisions that discuss in any detail motions to vacate an award under the FAA based on an arbitrator\u2019s failure to postpone a hearing. See, e.g., Johnson, 797 F.3d at 1301; Scott v. Prudential Sec., Inc., 141 F.3d 1007, 1016-17 (11th Cir. 1998), overruled in part by Hall Street Assocs., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 128 S.Ct. 1396, 170 L.Ed.2d 254 (2008); Robbins, 954 F.2d at 684-85. None of those decisions clearly establishes that CareMinders\u2019 appeal was destined to fail. Accordingly, we cannot say that the appeal was entirely baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">The district court\u2019s order confirming the arbitration award is AFFIRMED. The plaintiffs\u2019 motion for sanctions is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
