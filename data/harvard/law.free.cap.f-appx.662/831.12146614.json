Rights Act, \u25a0\u2019 Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.01 <em>et seq. </em>She asserts that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her ADA and FCRA claims because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to her qualifications. She also argues that the grant of summary judgment on her Title VII and ADEA claims was improper because she presented evidence of her supervisor\u2019s alleged dislike of women and older workers. Following review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">Ms. Perry began working for the City of Avon Park in 1999 as a meter reader for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>the water department. In 2009, she was reassigned to an inventory control position. In September of that year, the City hired Julian Deleon as the Public Works Director. At the time of Mr. Deleon\u2019s hiring, the City was in debt $7.5 million and borrowing from its infrastructure funds to stay operational.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Mr. Deleon instituted significant changes. He cut several positions and combined others, revising a significant number of job descriptions for City employees. For example, he reduced trash pickup to one day per week and assigned the sanitation workers other tasks, such as landscaping on the days they were not collecting trash. As pertinent here, Mr. Deleon significantly altered Ms. Perry\u2019s position. Her job now consisted of outdoor activities like cleaning and painting fire hydrants and the water maintenance facilities, as well as maintaining hedges and shrubbery and pulling weeds. Mr. Deleon\u2019s restructuring efforts resulted in 50 of 103 City employees having their positions terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Mr. Deleon was named City Manager in April of 2011. A short time prior to Mr. Deleon\u2019s promotion, in January of 2011, Ms. Perry was diagnosed with breast cancer. Ms. Perry took time off to treat her illness. After successful treatment, she returned to work, but had to continue taking medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">In April of 2012, Mr. Deleon revised Ms. Perry\u2019s job description and title to reflect the outdoor work she had done the past three years. Her new title was maintenance technician/assistant, and the updated job description stated that the position consisted primarily of outdoor field work and limited indoor office duties. Her tasks in this position were to perform field job functions associated with the preventative maintenance of facilities in hot or cold weather.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">In July of 2012, Ms. Perry sought temporary medical leave for mental health reasons. She returned with a doctor\u2019s note stating that she was not to work more than four hours per day outside, and that she could not work in hot or cold temperatures. When the City asked for clarification, the doctor responded that Ms. Perry was to avoid direct sunlight, and was to work no more than four hours outside in temperatures that were above 50 degrees but below 80 degrees. Ms. Perry was given a thermometer and instructions to return to City Hall once the temperature exceeded her threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Because the City is located in South Florida, the temperature thresholds were exceeded almost immediately. The City then inquired if there was any other way that Ms. Perry could be accommodated to perform her previous tasks. Ms. Perry\u2019s doctor\u2019s stated that there was no way for Ms. Perry to perform her previous work unless the temperature conditions were met. Mr. Deleon considered Ms. Perry\u2019s duties and the restrictions set by her doctor, deemed that Ms. Perry was no longer qualified to perform her previous work, and administratively terminated her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de </em>novo, applying the same legal standard used by the district court and drawing all factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>See Johnson v. Bd. of Regents, </em>263 F.3d 1234, 1242-43 (11th Cir. 2001). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits ... show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the nonmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Celotex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number><em>Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (internal quotation omitted). In order to overcome a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must present more than a mere scintilla of evidence supporting its position, and instead must make a sufficient showing that a jury could reasonably find for that party. <em>See Brooks v. Cty. Comm\u2019n of Jefferson Cty., Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Ms. Perry first argues that the district court erred in entering summary judgment in the City\u2019s favor on her ADA and FCRA claims. We review ADA and FCRA disability-discrimination claims under the same framework, so we consider both claims together. <em>See D\u2019Angelo v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., </em>422 F.3d 1220, 1224 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Ms. Perry asserts that there was \u00e1 genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was qualified for the position she was terminated from. The record does not support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The ADA provides that no covered employer \u201cshall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability on the basis of disability in regard to ... discharge\u201d and any of the \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Disability-discrimination claims brought under the ADA and based on circumstantial evidence are generally examined under the burden shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). The plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) is qualified to perform the job at issue with or without reasonable accommodation; (3) has suffered some adverse employment action; and (4) was treated differently from someone outside of her protected class. <em>See Holland v. Gee, </em>677 F.3d 1047, 1055 (11th Cir. 2012). If the defendant provides a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action, the plaintiff must then show that the reason provided by the defendant was pretextual. <em>See Cleveland v. Home Shopping Network, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">The dispute here turns on whether Ms. Perry was qualified to perform her job. Under the ADA, a qualified individual is a person with a disability who can, with or without reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of the employment position that the individual holds or desires. <em>See D\u2019Angelo, </em>422 F.3d at 1229. An individual who cannot perform the essential job functions, even with accommodation, is not qualified and therefore not covered under the ADA. <em>See id. </em>Whether a particular job duty constitutes an essential function is a case-by-case factual inquiry. <em>See Holly v. Clairson Indus., L.L.C., </em>492 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir. 2007). We look to the employer\u2019s judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, including the written description of the position. <em>Id. </em>at 1257. We give the employer\u2019s view substantial, but not controlling, weight. <em>Id. </em>at 1258. We also consult the ADA\u2019s implementing regulations as a guide for what functions are central'to the performance of a job. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(n) (describing factors to consider in determining whether a job function is essential, including, the employer\u2019s judgment, the written job description, the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, and the work experience of past incumbents in the job or current incumbents in 'similar jobs).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">The record demonstrates that Ms. Perry was not qualified for her position. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>The written description for Ms. Perry\u2019s job description stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-5\">1) Inspects and restores City facilities by performing preventative maintenance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-6\">2) Maintains, enters data, orders materials relating to inventory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\">3) Helps with non-complex office duties such as data entry and answering phones, taking messages[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-8\">4) Helps coordinate field work as assigned by supervisor[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-9\">. 5) Performs routine inspection and preventive maintenance on assigned equipment or city facilities and takes action to correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-10\">6) Cleans and paints equipment.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-11\">7) Operates light and medium-sized equipment, including the water truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-12\">8) Performs all duties in conformance to appropriate safety and security standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">The description also stated that Ms. Perry would perform additional work as needed. <em>See </em>D.E. 65-2 at 8-9. This description was issued to Ms. Perry in April of 2012 and in October of 2012 at the request of her doctor. The duties listed are consistent with the outside work she had been performing when her job changed in 2009. Only two of her eight duties involved indoor office work, indicating that the majority of Ms. Perry\u2019s work was performed outdoors.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-14\">Ms. Perry\u2019s own deposition testimony demonstrates that her primary duties as an employee took place outside doing manual labor. Ms. Perry testified that as of March of 2012, she was assigned to work outside for more than two days in a week. <em>See </em>D.E. 56-2 at 65. <em>See also id. </em>at 41 (\u201cI had assignments for each day, and they were all working outside.\u201d). Mr. Deleon similarly stated in his sworn affidavit that from October of 2009 forward, Ms. Perry\u2019s position \u201cprimarily entailed outside duties, with limited inside office duties or inventory control functions.\u201d D.E. 57 at 8. Any discrepancies concerning how much time Ms. Perry spent outside during a given period are immaterial\u2014both parties testified that since Mr. Deleon was hired, Ms. Perry had spent most of her time performing physical labor outside. Although Ms. Perry also helped out in the office on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis, <em>see </em>D.E. 56-2 at 277, and on some weeks she spent half of her time indoors, <em>see id. </em>at 64, that limited work did not negate the fact that the core of her duties consisted primarily of outside work. The ability to perform outdoor work was therefore an essential function of Ms. Perry\u2019s position. <em>See Holly, </em>492 F.3d at 1258-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-16\">Ms. Perry put forward two accommodations that she says would have allowed her to perform her essential job functions. The first proposed accommodation was to disregard her previous duties, and to assign her primarily office tasks. This proposal, however, would have resulted in changing' her job description and eliminating one of her essential job functions, which the City was not required to do. <em>See D\u2019Angelo, </em>422 F.3d at 1229-30. The second accommodation was to follow her doctor\u2019s restrictions\u2014working a maximum of four hours per day in temperatures that did not go below 50 degrees or above 80 degrees. As noted, however, the City is located in South Florida, where temperatures often exceed 80 degrees year round. The City attempted to accommodate these restrictions, but after three consecutive days of Ms. Perry being unable to work, it determined that Ms. Perry would be unable to handle her duties for any extended amount of time in the heat of the Florida sun. In short, the accommodations recommended by Ms. Perry\u2019s doctor proved to be unman<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>ageable. If those medical instructions were followed, Ms. Perry would not be able to perform the essential functions of her job on a consistent basis. <em>See D\u2019Angelo, </em>422 F.3d at 1229 (\u201cIf the individual \u2018is unable to perform an essential function of [her] ... job, even with an accommodation, [she] is, by definition, not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d and, therefore, not covered under the ADA. In other words, the ADA does not require [the employer] to eliminate an essential function of [the plaintiffs] job.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">We conclude that Ms. Perry was not qualified to perform the essential functions of her job, even taking into account the proposed accommodations, and therefore she did not make out a prima facie case of discrimination. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on the ADA and FCRA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">With respect to her Title VII and ADEA claims, Ms. Perry asserts that summary judgment was improper because there was evidence that Mr. Deleon discriminated against her because of her gender and because of her age. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Title VII provides that it is unlawful for an employer \u201cto ... discriminate against any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s ... sex.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Similarly, under the ADEA it is unlawful for an employer to discharge or otherwise discriminate against any employee who is at least 40 years old on the basis of age. <em>See </em>29 UiS.C. \u00a7\u00a7 623(a)(1), 631(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Both Title VII and ADEA claims may be proven through either direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1527 (11th Cir. 1997) (Title VII); <em>Mazzeo v. Color Resolutions Intern., LLC, </em>746 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir. 2014) (ADEA). Where, as here, a plaintiff proffers circumstantial evidence, we are again guided by the burden-shifting <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, which requires that the plaintiff first make a prima facie case in order to trigger the defendant\u2019s burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. <em>See Carter v. Three Springs Residential Treatment, </em>132 F.3d 635, 642-43 (11th Cir. 1998) (Title VII); <em>Mazzeo, </em>746 F.3d at 1270 (ADEA). If the employer satisfies this burden, then the employee must provide sufficient evidence that the proffered reason is merely a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">In order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination under Title VII, a plaintiff must show that she (1) is a member of a protected class; (2) was qualified for the position; (3) suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) was \u201creplaced by a person outside [her] protected class or was treated less favorably than a similarly-situated individual outside [her] protected class.\u201d <em>Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Div. of Universities of Florida Dep\u2019t of Educ. ex rel. Univ. of S. Florida, 342 F.3d </em>1281, 1289 (11th Cir. 2003). Similarly, a plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case under the ADEA by showing that (1) she was a member of the protected group of persons between the ages of forty and seventy; (2) she was subject to adverse employment action; (3) a substantially younger person filled the position from which she was dis-charg\u00e9d; and (4) she was qualified to do that job. <em>Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., </em>135 F.3d 1428, 1432 (11th Cir. 1998). Age discrimination claims also require that the plaintiff ultimately show that age was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the adverse employment decision. <em>See Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>557 U.S. 167, 177, 129 S.Ct. 2343, 174 L.Ed.2d 119 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">The record evidence demonstrates that Mr. Perry was no longer able to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>form the objective duties of her position as a result of her medical condition. Ms. Perry, however, was a \u201clongtime employee\u201d of the City and held her current position for over a year before her discharge. Generally, \u201cif a plaintiff has enjoyed a long tenure at a certain position, we can infer that he or she is qualified to hold that particular position.\u201d <em>Liebman v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>808 F.3d 1294, 1299 (11th Cir. 2015). Even assuming Ms. Perry established a <em>prima facie </em>case of age and gender discrimination, however, she has failed to sufficiently demonstrate that the City\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her termination\u2014that Ms. Perry\u2019s medical condition prevented her from fulfilling the essential functions of her position\u2014was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Ms. Perry first argues that Mr. Deleon\u2019s alleged statement to City employee Richard Conklin that women do not belong in the workplace is direct evidence of Mr. Deleon\u2019s negative attitude toward women. <em>See </em>D.E. 65-4 (\u201cI was in Mr. Julian Deleon\u2019s office talking to him, while he was contemplating on where to place a female employee. He proceeded to tell me that \u2018a woman\u2019s place is in the home taking care of children and not being in the work place.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Direct evidence is evidence that, \u201cif believed, would prove the existence of a fact without inference or presumption.\u201d <em>Carter v. City of Miami, </em>870 F.2d 578, 581-82 (11th Cir. 1989). \u201c[0]nly the most blatant remarks, whose intent could be nothing other than to discriminate ... will constitute direct evidence of discrimination.\u201d <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Florida, Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1359 (11th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have generally held that \u201cremarks unrelated to the decisionmaking process itself are not direct evidence of discrimination.\u201d <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1330 (11th Cir. 1998) (citing <em>E.E.O.C. v. Alton Packaging Corp., </em>901 F.2d 920, 924 (11th Cir. 1990)). <em>See also Dixon v. The Hallmark Companies, Inc., </em>627 F.3d 849, 854-55 (11th Cir. 2010) (comment\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re fired, too. You\u2019re too religious\u201d\u2014uttered by supervisor while terminating employees constituted direct evidence of religious discrimination); <em>Caban-Wheeler v. Elsea, </em>71 F.3d 837, 843 (11th Cir. 1996) (statement by black deci-sionmaker to white employee that he wanted a black person to have the white employee\u2019s job constituted direct evidence that the employee was terminated for racially discriminatory reasons); <em>Haynes v. W.C. Caye &amp; Co., Inc., </em>52 F.3d 928, 930-31 (11th Cir. 1995) (comments to female employee that \u201cwomen were simply not tough enough to do the job\u201d from which employee had been removed and that it would \u201crequire a man to do [that] job\u201d was direct evidence of gender discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Mr. Deleon\u2019s alleged comment that women do not belong in the workplace was not made in relation to Ms. Perry\u2019s termination\u2014indeed, it was made in 2009, three years prior to his decision to fire Ms. Perry. Although this comment may have reflected a gender bias generally, the finder of fact would be required to draw further inference that Mr. Deleon\u2019s sentiments expressed while determining the placement of a female employee motivated his later decision to terminate Ms. Perry. <em>See Damon, </em>196 F.3d at 1359 (comment by supervisor immediately after employee\u2019s termination that the company \u201cneeded ... aggressive <em>young </em>men ... to be promoted\u201d required inference that interest in promoting young men motivated decision to terminate employee) (emphasis in original); <em>Burrell v. Bd. of Trustees of Georgia Military Coll., </em>125 F.3d 1390, 1393 n. 7 (11th Cir. 1997) (decisionmaker\u2019s comment regarding his unwillingness to <em>promote </em>a female to the second-highest office in management was not direct evidence because a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>factfinder would have to draw inferences that decisionmaker also intended to later <em>terminate </em>female employees because they were female).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Given this precedent, Mr. Deleon\u2019s alleged statement does not constitute direct evidence of discrimination. Nor does Mr. Deleon\u2019s remark, by itself, constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish that the proffered reason for termination was mere pretext for discrimination, particularly in light of the fact that this statement was made three years prior to Ms. Perry\u2019s termination in 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">In support of her ADEA claim, Ms. Perry cites to the City\u2019s assertion that all City employees laid off during Mr. Deleon\u2019s restructuring within the Public Works Department were male and most were younger than Ms. Perry. She argues that of those six terminated employees specifically identified by the City, only one was under the age of 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">It is undisputed, however, that during Mr. Deleon\u2019s tenure, he reduced the City\u2019s workforce from approximately 103 employees to less than 50 in'2013. Ms. Perry\u2019s implied pattern of age discrimination\u2014 based solely upon the City\u2019s own citation to its termination of five employees over the age of forty\u2014-without more, is insufficient to establish pretext. <em>Cf. Damon, </em>196 F.3d at 1361 (termination within a one-year period of four older, highly experienced store managers out of a total of seven managers, with each replaced by an employee under forty years old, constituted probative circumstantial evidence of age discrimination, which was further underscored by direct testimony),</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Ms. Perry has failed to provide sufficient evidence that the City\u2019s proffered reason for her termination is merely pretext for gender or age discrimination. Accordingly,we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">For the foregoing reasons we affirm the district .court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
