On appeal, he argues that: (1) the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress on the grounds that the officer who arrested him lacked probable cause to initiate his traffic stop, and the officer unreasonably prolonged the traffic stop to conduct a dog sniff; and (2) Wilson\u2019s guideline sentence was calculated improperly. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">First, we are unpersuaded by Wilson\u2019s claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence as a mixed question of law and fact. United States v. Lewis, 674 F.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2012). Rulings of law are reviewed de novo, while the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. Id. at 1302-03. We may affirm the denial of a motion to suppress on any ground supported by the record. United States v. Caraballo, 596 F.3d 1214, 1222 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">A traffic stop is a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, which protects against \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979); U.S. Const, amend. IV. To satisfy constitutional concerns, a traffic stop requires either probable cause to believe a traffic violation occurred or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. United States v. Harris, 526 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir. 2008). We view the existence of probable cause or reasonable suspicion from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police, officer. United States v. Chanthasouxat, 342 F.3d 1271, 1276 (11th Cir. 2003). An unreasonable mistake of law cannot provide the basis for probable cause. See Heien v. North Carolina, 574 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 530, 539, 190 L.Ed.2d 475 (2014). However, a seizure is lawful when facts known to the officer give probable cause, even if the officer\u2019s subjective, intent does not give probable cause. See Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.S. 146, 154-155, 125 S.Ct. 588, 160 L.Ed.2d 537 (2004). In Devenpeck. an officer arrested an individual for tape recording his conversation with the officer\u2014conduct the officer erroneously believed to be unlawful. Id. at 150, 152, 125 S.Ct. 588. However, the arresting officer also suspected that the arrested individual was impersonating a police officer; he simply chose not to charge the individual with that offense as a matter of policy against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>stacking charges. Id. at 150, 125 S.Ct. 588. The Supreme Court explained that when the circumstances, viewed objectively, would justify a detention, the officer\u2019s subjective reason for the detention will not invalidate it. See id. at 153, 125 S.Ct. 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">When two views of the evidence are permissible, the fact finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous. United States v. De Varon, 175 F.3d 930, 945 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Whether a witness was credible is \u201ctypically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, 289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir. 2002). We must accept the version of events adopted by the district court \u201cunless it is contrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">In this case, Tallahassee Police Officer Patrick Coney had probable cause to initiate the traffic stop. While Coney\u2019s belief that Wilson had made an illegal turn constituted an unreasonable mistake of law and could not provide probable cause to conduct the stop, Officer Coney also testified that he observed Wilson exceeding the speed limit. Coney added that he would have pulled Wilson over for speeding even if he had not believed that the turn was illegal, but that his typical practice is to write only one ticket, even when there are multiple violations. Further, in a supplemental report drafted by Coney, the officer made no mention of Wilson exceeding the speed limit, but he did use the phrase \u201chigh rate of speed.\u201d Coney explained that he would not have used that phrase unless he believed that Wilson was actually speeding. The district court credited all of Coney\u2019s testimony, found that Coney had witnessed Wilson speeding, and that Coney had probable cause to believe that Wilson was speeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Wilson claims that certain factors cast doubt on Officer Coney\u2019s observation that he was speeding\u2014including that Coney made the estimate at night, that he decided not to cite Wilson for speeding, that he was moving while making the estimate, and that his estimate of the time it took Wilson to cross the intersection was too quick\u2014since there was no corroboration of Wilson\u2019s speed. However, Officer Coney testified that he was radar certified, had practiced a number of visual estimates of vehicle speed in 2010, and was generally accurate in his estimates, and that using radar on traffic patrol every day involved an element of guessing speeds, which was a sort of training. In addition, we have never held that an officer\u2019s visual observation of a motorist\u2019s speed cannot provide probable cause. In fact, other courts have held that visual estimation of speed can provide the basis for probable cause, gee United States v. Ludwig, 641 F.3d 1243, 1247 (10th Cir. 2011) (persuasive authority); United States v. Gaffney, 789 F.3d 866, 870 (8th Cir. 2015) (persuasive authority). Finally, we cannot say that Coney\u2019s testimony was \u201ccontrary to the laws of nature,\u201d or so improbable that no reasonable fact finder could accept it. See Ramirez-Chilel, 289 F.3d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Since Officer Coney provided plausible testimony, the court\u2019s acceptance of it could not be clearly erroneous. See De Var\u00f3n, 175 F.3d at 945. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that the traffic stop was lawful because Officer Coney had probable cause to believe that Wilson was speeding. Further, because Coney had probable cause to believe Wilson had committed a traffic violation, the officer\u2019s mistake of law regarding Wilson\u2019s turn did not render the stop un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>lawful. See Devenpeck, 543 U.S. at 154-155, 125 S.Ct. 588 (2004); see also Harris, 526 F.3d at 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Nor do we agree with Wilson\u2019s claim that the officer unreasonably prolonged the traffic stop to conduct a dog sniff. An officer\u2019s actions during a traffic stop must be reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop. United States v. Purcell, 236 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir. 2001). However, investigations falling outside that scope do not render the stop unlawful, as long as the investigation does not measurably extend the duration of the stop. United States v. Griffin, 696 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir. 2012). Conversely, a traffic stop becomes unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete the mission. Rodriguez v. United States, 575 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1609, 1612, 191 L.Ed.2d 492 (2015). A dog sniff that does not unreasonably prolong the traffic stop is not a search subject to the Fourth Amendment, and the Supreme Court has therefore rejected the notion that a traffic stop becomes unlawful based on the mere act of a dog sniff that was not supported by reasonable suspicion. Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 408-09, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">We\u2019ve said that when all computer background checks have been performed, the citation is written, and the police officer returns the driver\u2019s license, the traffic violation investigation is complete and the driver is free to go. See United States v. Boyce, 351 F.3d 1102, 1106-07 (11th Cir. 2003). However, we\u2019ve also cautioned that \u201c[rjigid time limitations and bright-line rules\u201d are inappropriate to determine reasonableness. Purcell, 236 F.3d at 1279. Rather, we look to the totality of the circumstances when determining whether a traffic stop was a reasonable seizure. Id.; see also United States v. Hernandez, 418 F.3d 1206, 1212 n.7 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">When an officer issues a warning citation during a traffic stop, the stop is not unreasonably prolonged if the officer takes time to explain the citation to the motorist. Cf. United States v. Harris, 928 F.2d 1113, 1117 (11th Cir. 1991) (holding that an officer\u2019s momentary detention after issuing a warning citation did not violate the Fourth Amendment). During a lawful traffic stop, an officer may order the occupants to exit the vehicle. United States v. Spoerke, 568 F.3d 1236, 1248 (11th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Here, the dog sniff did not violate the Fourth Amendment because it occurred during the course of a lawful traffic stop. As the record reveals, the canine unit arrived just after Officer Coney initiated the stop, while Coney was engaged in the procedures reasonably necessary for the completion of its purpose\u2014issuing a warning citation to Wilson. The dog sniff occurred while he was explaining the citation, a task that was reasonably related to the purpose of the stop. Cf. Harris, 928 F,2d at 1117. Officer Coney testified that he prefers that people exit the car for officer safety while he explains their ticket, which is not unlawful. Spoerke, 568 F.3d at 1248. Thus, although the dog sniff was'unrelated to the initial traffic stop, it did not render the stop unlawful, because it did not measurably extend the duration of the stop. See Griffin, 696 F.3d at 1361. Likewise, the dog sniff itself was lawful, because a dog sniff that does not unreasonably prolong a traffic stop is not a search subject to the Fourth Amendment. See Caballes, 543 U.S. at 408-09, 125 S.Ct. 834. We, therefore, affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the dog sniff occurred during the reasonable course of a lawful traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Finally, we reject Wilson\u2019s claim that his Guideline sentence was calculated improperly. For starters, when the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>says that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of its decision on a particular Sentencing Guidelines issue, any error in deciding that Guidelines issue is harmless because it \u201chad no effect on\u201d the reasonable sentence imposed. United States v. Overstreet, 713 F.3d 627, 639 n.15 (11th Cir. 2013). Moreover, in this circuit, the vagueness doctrine applied by the Supreme Court in Johnson v. United States, \u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), is inapplicable to the advisory Guidelines. United States v. Matchett, 802 F.3d 1185, 1195-96 (11th Cir. 2015). In Matchett, we held that the holding in Johnson is limited to criminal statutes that define elements of a crime or fix punishments. Id. at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Because Wilson\u2019s sentence was enhanced pursuant to 'the Sentencing Guidelines\u2014which are not subject to Fifth Amendment vagueness challenges, see id. at 1195-1196\u2014Wilson\u2019s claim fails. Furthermore, even if Johnson did apply to the Sentencing Guidelines, the use of the residual clause would constitute harmless error. As the record shows, the district court said that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the calculation at issue, observing that \u201c[e]ven if I had taken the guideline range down to 77 to 96 ... I would impose a 10-year sentence. I think the sentence needs to be 10 years. That\u2019s the statutory maximum, and it needs to be that long.\u201d Thus, any error in the guidelines calculation \u201chad no effect on\u201d the reasonable sentence the district court imposed. See Overstreet, 713 F.3d at 639 n.15. And, Wilson does not argue that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Wilson\u2019s sentence as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
