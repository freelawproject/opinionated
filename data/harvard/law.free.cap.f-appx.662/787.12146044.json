On appeal, Langston argues that his 33-month sentence on Count 1 is substantively unreasonable and that the district court erred in imposing a consecutive 84-month sentence on Count 3. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AzP\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">The factual proffer supporting Lang-ston\u2019s guilty plea and the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) contain these undisputed facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">Langston and his codefendant, Dalton Armster, entered the One Stop Mini Mart, approached the counter, and asked for a pack of cigars. Armster clipped a magazine into a machine firearm,, pointed the firearm at the store clerk, and ordered the clerk to give him all the money in the store\u2019s cash register. Simultaneously, Langston jumped over the counter to get to the cash register. The store clerk immediately opened the register and put up his hands. Langston took approximately $5,000 in cash from the register and a Glock .22 caliber firearm located underneath a shelf by the register. The store\u2019s video security cameras captured the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">Following the robbery, the store clerk called 911 and informed law enforcement officers that he recognized the assailants as previous patrons of the store, but did not know the assailants by name. Law enforcement received anonymous tips identifying the two assailants as Armster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>and Langston. Ultimately, the store clerk identified Armster in a photo lineup as the assailant who held the firearm and identified Langston in a photo lineup as the assailant who jumped over the counter and took the money from the register. Armster was arrested and admitted that he and Langston had robbed the Mini Mart. Langston was arrested approximately one month later.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">B. Indictment and Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">A federal grand jury indicted Langston on charges of conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (Count 1); committing Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a) and 2 (Count 2); brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, specifically Counts 1 and 2, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) and 2 (Count 3); and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 2 (Count 5). Count 1 charged that Armster and Langston conspired and agreed to rob an employee at the Mini Mart \u201cagainst the will of that person, by means of actual and threatened force, violence, and fear of injury to said person.\u201d Count 3 charged that during the crime of violence in Count 1, the firearm was brandished, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) and 2 (aiding and abetting).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Langston pled guilty to Counts 1 and 3. He also executed a factual proffer containing the offense conduct outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">Before accepting Langston\u2019s guilty plea, the district court conducted a colloquy and reviewed with Langston the elements of the crimes to which he was pleading guilty. With regard to Count 1, the district court informed Langston that he was pleading guilty to (1) agreeing to commit a Hobbs Act robbery, which would involve \u201cacquiring someone else\u2019s property against the person\u2019s will using actual threats, force or violence or causing the victim to fear harm\u201d; (2) knowing of the plan to commit the robbery; and (3) voluntarily participating in and helping to achieve the goal of committing the robbery. Langston affirmed that he understood the elements of Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">With regard to Count 3, the district court informed Langston that he was pleading guilty to committing the robbery offense charged in Count 1, which was characterized as a crime of violence, and to brandishing a firearm in furtherance of that crime. Langston affirmed that he understood the elements of Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">The district court explained to Langston that by pleading guilty, he was waiving his right to have the government establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by proving each and every element of the crimes he was charged with committing, and Langston affirmed that he understood that waiver. Langston admitted that the facts in the proffer were true and that the government could prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. After reviewing the provisions of the written plea agreement with Langston, the district court accepted his guilty pleas and adjudicated him guilty on Counts 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">C. PSI</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">In addition to the facts recounted above, the PSI indicated that both Armster and Langston were equally culpable in committing the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">As to Count 1, the PSI recommended: (1) a base offense level of 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(a); a one-level increase in the offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(6), because a firearm was taken during the offense; and (3) a three-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), for acceptance of responsibility. This resulted in a total adjusted offense level of 18 for Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The PSI assigned Langston four criminal history points and calculated a criminal history category of III because he had 2004 Florida convictions for grand theft and resisting an officer without violence and 2012 Florida convictions for burglary, arson, and criminal mischief. The PSI included several prior adult convictions and juvenile adjudications for which no criminal history points were scored, including convictions for resisting an officer with violence, trespass to a structure or conveyance, and cocaine possession in 1999; loitering in 2001; cocaine possession in 2002; and driving without a valid, driver\u2019s license in 2008. The PSI also described eight other instances of juvenile and adult criminal conduct for which Langston was not prosecuted, including possession of a concealed firearm by a minor, armed robbery, and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">With a total offense level of 18 and a criminal history category of III, the PSI recommended an advisory guidelines range for Count 1 of 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment. The statutory maximum for Count 1 was 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">As to Count 3, the PSI stated that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(a)(ii) and (D)(ii), the mandatory minimum sentence was seven years, to be served consecutive to any other sentence. As such, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(a) also required a consecutive sentence of 84 months. Langston did not file any objections to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">D. Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">At sentencing, Langston did not object to the factual allegations or guidelines calculations in the PSI. The district court adopted the PSI in its entirety and concluded that the advisory guidelines range for Count 1 was 33 to 41 months and that Count 3 carried a mandatory minimum 84-month sentence to be served consecutively to any other sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">Langston requested a downward variance on Count 1, arguing that Armster, Langston\u2019s codefendant who had pled guilty to the same charges, had received a 100-month sentence and that the district court had granted Armster a downward variance to reach that sentence. Langston contended that the district court should impose a sentence that was equal to or less than Armster\u2019s sentence to avoid an unwarranted sentencing disparity and because Armster had planned the robbery, recruited and directed Langston, and went into the store armed and pointed his gun at the store clerk and thus was more culpable. Langston also argued that he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol when Armster recruited him, had never adequately been treated for his substance abuse problems, and was essentially homeless at the time he committed the offense. Langston asked the district court to vary downward 17 months to a 100-month total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">The government recommended a low-end guidelines sentence on Count 1 and argued that, because of Langston\u2019s criminal history category of III, it was appropriate for him to receive a higher sentence than Armster, who had a criminal history category of II. The government noted that, according to both the video of the robbery and the PSI, both Langston and Armster played equal roles in the offense and were equally culpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">The district court stated that it had considered the statements of all parties, the PSI, and the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a). The district court acknowledged Lang-ston\u2019s mitigating arguments, his supportive family, and desire to participate in a substance abuse program. However, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>trict court expressed concern about Lang-ston\u2019s past criminal conduct, including three instances of unprosecuted criminal conduct listed in the PSI: possession of a concealed weapon at age 14, armed robbery, and battery. Addressing the differences between Armster and Langston, the district court noted that it was focusing not on the difference between their respective criminal history categories, but on \u201cthe content and nature of the past transgressions.\u201d The district court concluded that the low-end guidelines sentence recommended by the government was appropriate. The district court sentenced Lang-ston to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 1 and a consecutive 84 months as to Count 3, for a total 117-month sentence. Langston did not object to the district court\u2019s findings of fact or the manner in which the sentence was pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">A. Substantive Reasonableness of 33-month Sentence on Count 1</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence\u2014whether inside or outside the applicable guidelines range\u2014is subject to a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. United States v. Tome, 611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir. 2010).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">For the reasons discussed below, Lang-ston\u2019s mandatory minimum seven-year (84-month) sentence on Count 3 was required by statute. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), (D)(ii). Thus, Langston\u2019s substantive reasonableness argument relates solely to his 33-month sentence on Count 1, which was at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 33 to 41 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Langston has not met his burden of establishing that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court explicitly noted that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded that the downward variance Langston requested was not warranted. In reaching this conclusion, the district court focused particularly on Langston\u2019s criminal history, which it found concerning. The district court\u2019s concern was supported by the record, which showed that Langston had multiple prior convictions and had engaged in other violent behavior that did not result in criminal convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">Langston argues that the 17-month disparity between his sentence and that of his codefendant Armster makes his sentence unreasonable. But, Langston has not shown that the disparity between his sentence and the sentence the district court imposed on Armster was unwarranted because, although they pled guilty to identical charges, they did not have \u201csimilar records\u201d and thus were not similarly situ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>ated defendants. See United States v. Docampo, 573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir. 2009) (explaining that sentencing disparities are unwarranted only where the defendants are similarly situated); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). The court recognized this when it stated that \u201cthe content and nature of the past transgressions\u201d of the two defendants led it to conclude that a low-end guidelines sentence was appropriate in Langston\u2019s case, even though it had granted Armster\u2019s request for a downward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Langston\u2019s complaint that the district court primarily relied upon prior criminal behavior that went unprosecuted likewise is without merit because the sentencing court was entitled to consider those acts as relevant to Langston\u2019s background and character in imposing its sentence. See United States v. Tome, 611 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir. 2010) (stating that a district court appropriately considered a withheld adjudication in considering a defendant\u2019s background, character, and conduct). Moreover, because Langston failed to object to the PSI\u2019s descriptions of those nolle grossed charges, those facts were admitted for sentencing purposes. See United States v. Patterson, 595 F.3d 1324, 1326 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"AqKi\">In any event, even if we assumed ar-guendo that the 17-month disparity between Langston and Armster was \u201cunwarranted,\u201d this would-not render Langston\u2019s sentence substantively unreasonable because he has failed to demonstrate that the alleged disparity outweighed the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors that the district court considered. The need to avoid sentencing disparities is only one of several factors the district court considered. The district court was entitled to give more weight to other factors\u2014such as Langston\u2019s history and characteristics\u2014in making its sentencing decision. See United States v. Clay, 483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir. 2007). Thus, Langston has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Finally, the district court\u2019s 33-month sentence on Count 1 represented the lowest sentence under the applicable guidelines range of 33 to 41 months, which this Court would ordinarily expect to be reasonable. See United States v. Hunt, 526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir. 2008). The sentence was also well-below the 20-year statutory maximum for Count 1, a further indication of its reasonableness. See United States v. Gonzalez, 550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">Based on the foregoing, Langston has not shown that his 33-month sentence on Count 1 was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">B. Consecutive Sentence on Count 3</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">Under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), if the defendant used or carried a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, or possessed a firearm in furtherance of such crimes, the district court must impose a separate consecutive sentence. And, if, as here, the defendant brandished the firearm, the consecutive sentence is \u201cnot less than 7 years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">For purposes of \u00a7 924(c), a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined as a felony offense that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-14\">(A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property ' of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-16\">(B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-17\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3). The former clause is referred to as the \u201cuse-of-force clause,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>and the later clause as the \u201c\u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) residual clause.\u201d In re Saint Fleur, 824 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">A separate but similar sentencing provision, the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), defines the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d as any crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The first prong of this definition is sometimes referred to as the \u201celements clause,\u201d while the second prong contains the \u201cenumerated crimes\u201d and, finally, what is commonly called the \u201cresidual clause.\u201d United States v. Owens, 672 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">In 2015, before Langston was sentenced, the Supreme Court in Johnson v. United States held that the residual clause of the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague. 576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2563, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). In holding that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause is void, the Court clarified that it did not call into question the application of the elements clause or the enumerated crimes of the ACCA\u2019s definition of a violent felony. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Here, Count 3 in the indictment, to which Langston pled guilty, expressly charged, inter alia, that the crime of violence was the Hobbs Act conspiracy in Count 1 and that the firearm was brandished during the crime of violence. As noted earlier, Langston was charged with aiding and abetting the brandishing of the firearm. Further, during the plea colloquy, Langston acknowledged that the pertinent crime of violence was the Hobbs Act conspiracy charged in Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">Now, for the first time on appeal, Lang-ston argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to a consecutive 84-month term on Count 3 because, in light of Johnson, conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery cannot serve as a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-14\">While we ordinarily review de novo whether a specific offense is a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c), we review Lang-ston\u2019s newly raised claim only for plain error. See United States v. Rodriguez, 751 F.3d 1244, 1257 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S. Ct. 310, 190 L.Ed.2d 225 (2014). For an error to be plain, it must be \u201ccontrary to explicit statutory provisions or to on-point precedent in this Court or the Supreme Court.\u201d United States v. Hoffman, 710 F.3d 1228, 1232 (11th Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Lejarde-Rada, 319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">Here, Count 3 of the indictment alleged that Langston used and carried a firearm \u201cduring and in relation to a crime of violence\u201d and possessed the firearm \u201cin furtherance of a crime of violence\u201d as charged in Count 1. Langston then acknowledged, in both the factual proffer and during the plea colloquy conducted by the district court, that the government could prove each element of Count 3 beyond a reasonable doubt. As the district court explained and Langston acknowledged, those elements were (1) that he committed conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, a crime of violence, and (2) that he brandished a firearm in furtherance of that crime of violence. Langston\u2019s knowing, unconditional, and voluntary plea constituted an admission as to every element of Count 3. See McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1171, 22 L.Ed,2d 418 (1969). Langston therefore admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery was a crime of violence and thus arguably waived any defect in his sentencing arising out of the fact that it was classified as such. See United States v. Patti, 337 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir. 2003); see also United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 569, 109 S.Ct. 757, 762, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989) (stating that \u201c[a] plea of guilty and the ensuing conviction comprehend all of the factual and legal elements necessary to sustain a binding, final judgment of guilty and a lawful sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">However, we need not decide that waiver issue because Langston cannot show that the alleged error was plain. The district court did not indicate under which \u00a7 924(c)(3) clause that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery qualified as a crime of violence. Nor did the district court have to because Langston agreed that it qualified as a crime of violence. So, we would need to examine if the crime qualified under either of the clauses in \u00a7 924(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has extended Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 924(e) residual clause ruling to conclude that the \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. See In re Pinder, 824 F.3d 977, 978-79 (11th Cir. 2016) (noting that \u201c[o]ur Court hasn\u2019t decided if Johnson applies to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\u201d and that \u201cthe law is unsettled\u201d as to whether Johnson even invalidates any sentences imposed pursuant to the \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) residual clause). Therefore, the district court did not plainly err because it is not obvious and clear under current law that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence under either the use-of-force clause or the \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Likewise, neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has concluded that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery cannot categorically qualify as a crime of violence under the use-of-force clause. See id. at 979 <em>&amp; </em>n.l. Moreover, this Court has concluded that a conviction for the substantive offense of Hobbs Act robbery qualifies as a crime of violence under the use-of-force clause after Johnson. See In re Saint Fleur, 824 F.3d at 1340; see also In re Colon, 826 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 2016) (concluding that a \u201cconviction for aiding and abetting a Hobbs Act robbery qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) use-of-force clause, without regard to the \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) residual clause\u201d). In Saint Fleur, we explained that the defendant was charged with, and pled guilty to, committing the Hobbs Act robbery \u201cby means of actual and threatened force, violence, and fear of injury\u201d and that these elements \u201cas replicated in the indictment, require the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against \u2018against the person or property of another\u2019\u201d required by \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\u2019s use-of-force clause. 824 F.3d at 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Given that there is no direct precedent from this Court or the Supreme Court directly resolving the issue of whether conspiracy to commit that substantive Hobbs Act robbery qualifies a crime of violence under either clause, any alleged error cannot be plain. See Hoffman, 710 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">For these reasons, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s decision to treat Langston\u2019s Hobbs Act robbery conspiracy, charged in Count 1, as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3), and impose a consecutive 84-month sentence on Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">.
