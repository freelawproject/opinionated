(\u201cHansaWorld\u201d) brought claims of civil conspiracy and violations of Florida\u2019s Civil Remedies for Criminal Practice Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 772.101 (\u201cFlorida RICO\u201d) against Defendant-Appellee Damon Carpenter (\u201cCarpenter\u201d). Thereafter, Hansa-World moved to amend its complaint, attempting to add civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c)\u2014(d) (\u201cFederal RICO\u201d) and malicious interference claims, which the district court denied as futile. After discovery, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi granted Carpenter\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissing HansaWorld\u2019s claims. HansaWorld now appeals. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b278-18\">HansaWorld\u2019s former employee, Kim-berlee Davenport (\u201cDavenport\u201d), hired Carpenter as her attorney after Hansa-World terminated her employment. Thereafter,' Carpenter represented Davenport for approximately two weeks \u201cfor the purpose of negotiating with [HansaWorld] ... to secure the most favorable terms possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ble resulting from [her] departure from that employment.\u201d HansaWorld alleges that during the course of her relationship with Carpenter, Davenport attempted to extort HansaWorld and unlawfully converted its property. After winning its case against Davenport, HansaWorld sought judgment against Carpenter in connection with his representation of Davenport.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">HansaWorld initially brought the instant matter in a Florida state court in February 2015. Carpenter then removed the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, which on Carpenter\u2019s motion, transferred the case to the court below in May 2015. In its original complaint, HansaWorld brought Florida RICO and civil conspiracy claims, alleging that Carpenter conspired with Davenport to extort payments from it by: (1) making false employment discrimination and income tax withholding allegations, (2) conspiring with Davenport to shut down HansaWorld\u2019s phone lines, and (3) advising Davenport to delay returning the company car. On October 1, 2015, the district court denied Han-saWorld leave to amend its complaint to include charges of malicious interference with business relations and Federal RICO claims, finding that it had not pleaded a prima facie case for either claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">On March 8, 2016, the district court granted Carpenter\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that HansaWorld could not establish an enterprise or pattern of continuing racketeering activity and had faded to show that Carpenter\u2019s actions went beyond the scope of his representation or that he had any personal stake in the outcome of Davenport\u2019s dispute with HansaWorld.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">HansaWorld filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">il. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">This court ordinarily reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for leave to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion. <em>City of Clinton v. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp., </em>632 F.3d 148,152 (5th Cir. 2010). If, however, the court below denied the motion \u201cbased solely on futility, we apply a de novo standard of review identical, in practice, to the standard used for reviewing a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Wilson v. Bruks-Klockner, Inc., </em>602 F.3d 363, 368 (5th Cir. 2010)). Under a Rule 12(b)(6) analysis, a complaint must allege enough facts that, if taken as true, \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). A complaint that contains no more than \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements\u201d or presents a \u201clegal conclusion couched as a factual allegation\u201d is insufficient. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">Similarly, when reviewing a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we review the district court\u2019s ruling de novo. <em>Robinson v. Orient Marine Co., </em>505 F.3d 364, 365 (5th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Summary judgment is warranted when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a); <em>Robinson, </em>505 F,3d at 366 (citation omitted). \u201cUnsubstantiated assertions, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation are not sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Brown v. City of Houston, </em>337 F.3d 539, 541 (5th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). \u201c[Reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>inferences are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>505 F.3d at 366 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">HansaWorld raises two issues on appeal. First, it asserts that the district coui-t erred when it denied HansaWorld\u2019s motion to amend its complaint to include a malicious interference with business relations claim. Second, HansaWorld alleges that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of Carpenter on HansaWorld\u2019s Florida civil conspiracy claim. Both issues are discussed in turn.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">HansaWorld first argues that the district court erred when it denied Hansa-World\u2019s motion for leave to include a malicious interference with business relations claim against Carpenter. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In Mississippi,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a prima facie case for malicious interference requires a plaintiff to show that a person \u201cengage[d] in some act with a malicious intent to interfere [with] and injure the business of another, <em>and injury does in fact result.\u201d Par Indus, v. Target Container Co., </em>708 So.2d 44, 48 (Miss. 1998) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Cenac v. Murry, </em>609 So.2d 1257, 1271 (Miss. 1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The district court found that Hansa-World failed to allege it suffered any injury as a result of-Carpenter\u2019s actions. On appeal, HansaWorld argues that in stating in its original complaint that <em>\u201cDavenport </em>adversely impacted [HansaWorld\u2019s] ability to conduct business and its relationships with customers and partners\u201d suffices to meet the injury in fact requirement. Not so. Even construed liberally, this allegation cannot overcome 12(b)(6)\u2019s low bar, as it is merely \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Axion Logistics, L.L.C., </em>780 F.3d 304, 306 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1956)). Because Hansa-World failed to allege facts establishing a prima facie case for this claim, the district court\u2019s refusal to grant HansaWorld leave to amend was proper. <em>See Stripling v. Jordan Prod. Co., </em>234 F.3d 863, 872-73 (5th Cir. 2000) (\u201cIt is within the district court\u2019s discretion to deny a motion to amend if it is futile.\u201d). Accordingly, we find that the district court did not err in denying HansaWorld\u2019s motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-15\">We now turn to HansaWorld\u2019s argument that the district court erred when it granted Carpenter\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-16\">Under Florida law, an attorney cannot be found to have conspired with his client if his alleged bad conduct took place within \u2022the scope of his representation and he does not have a personal stake in the matter, separate and distinct from his client\u2019s interest. <em>Lipsig v. Ramlawi, </em>760 So.2d 170, 181 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2000) (holding that because \u201call of [the defendant\u2019s] activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>were within the scope of his agency as the ... family attorney\u201d and the defendant had no personal stake in the matter, he was entitled to a directed verdict on the plaintiffs civil conspiracy claim); <em>see also Rivers v. Dillards Dept Store, Inc., </em>698 So.2d 1328, 1333 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1997) (\u201c[A]bsent allegations that an employee acted in a personal capacity apart from his employee status, [a] corporation cannot conspire with its own ... employees.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Here, reviewing the facts in the light most favorable to HansaWorld, Carpenter\u2019s actions fell squarely within the con-f\u00ednes of his employment relationship with Davenport. HansaWorld\u2019s assertion that Carpenter exceeded the scope of his employment by \u201cconspiring with Davenport to commit crimes\u201d is speculative and unsupported by the record. <em>Brown, </em>337 F.3d at 541. Moreover, Carpenter did not have a personal stake in Davenport\u2019s wrongdoing, an issue HansaWorld fails to dispute on appeal. Finally, HansaWorld\u2019s argument that Carpenter\u2019s relationship with Davenport created a \u201cparticular power of coercion ,., [that] an individual acting alone does not possess\u201d also fails because the alleged bad acts that Davenport committed could have been done with or without Carpenter\u2019s assistance. Accordingly, we con-' elude that because HansaWorld has not shown that Carpenter exceeded the scope of his representation or had a personal stake in Davenport\u2019s dispute with Hansa-World, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Carpenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s rulings in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\">. Although the district court denied Hansa-World leave to add these two new allegations, pursuant to the same motion, the court did grant HansaWorld leave to amend its corn-plaint as it related to its Florida RICO allegations, including leave to add any additional facts in support thereof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b280-10\">. HansaWorld does not appeal the district court's dismissal of its Federal or Florida RICO claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b280-11\">. In the court below, Carpenter argued that Mississippi law, not Florida law, should apply to this case. The district court found through a conflict of laws analysis that Florida law controlled. The parties did not dispute, how- \" ever, that Mississippi law applied to Hansa-World\u2019s malicious interference claims; thus, the district court applied Mississippi law to \u2022 that claim. Because this issue is not before the court, we apply, as the district court did, Mississippi law to HansaWorld\u2019s malicious interference claims and Florida law to Hansa-World\u2019s civil conspiracy claims. <em>See Ferguson v. FDIC, </em>164 F.3d 894, 897 (5th Cir. 1999) (citing <em>Kucel </em>v. <em>Walter E. Heller &amp; Co., </em>813 F.2d 67, 74 (5th Cir. 1987)); <em>Wellogix, Inc. v. SAP Am., Inc., </em>58 F.Supp.3d 766, 775 (S.D. Tex. 2014), <em>aff'd, </em>648 Fed.Appx. 398 (5th Cir. 2016).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
