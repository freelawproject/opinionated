Dail and wife, by deed duly executed and acknowledged, granted and conveyed, in consideration of the sum of five thousand dollars, to Richard H. Dixon, of Dorchester County, a lot of ground and improvements mentioned and referred to in the deed, situated on High street, in the town of Cambridge. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>deed was not recorded until the 6th. day of March, 1899. On the 17th day of January, 1907, Richard ,H. Dixon, \u201cin consideration of five dollars, and other good and valuable considerations,\u201d granted and conveyed the property to his wife, Helen Y. Dixon. This deed was recorded among the Land Records of Dorchester.County on January 18th, 1907. The deed also conveyed to her all household and kitchen furniture in his dwelling on High street. Helen Y. Dixon, the grantee in .the deed, was the second wife of Richard H. Dixon. He was married to her in November, 1885, and she is the sole defendant in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">By three deeds dated, respectively, April 27th, 1909, December 28th, 1909, and December 6th, 1910, Helen V. Dixon, and Richard H. Dixon, her husband, granted and conveyed to certain persons named in the deeds parts of the property conveyed to the defendant by the deed of January 17th, 1907, \u2014 these parts being <em>k </em>portion of the lot conveyed to Richard H. Dixon by the deed from Dai-1 and wife, above referred to. The aggregate sum realized from these sales was $3,350.00. This purchase money was received by the defendant, except the sum of $450.00 \u2014 'being the purchase price of the portion sold to Delia Bayly Orem. This sum was received by her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">About the year 1855, Richard ,H. Dixon married his first wife, Eliza Stewart. She was the only daughter and heir-at-law of John H. Stewart, who was considered to be a prosperous farmer of Dorchester County and who died intestate in the year 1856, leaving surviving him his wife, Rebecca H. Stewalrt, and his daughter, Eliza S. Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">John H. Stewart was the owner of two farms in Dorchester County, upon one of which he resided at the time of his death. The total appraised value of his personal estate, as shown by the inventory filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Dorehesiter County on Eebruary 26th, 1856, was $4,723.30, consisting of household and kitchen furniture and farming implements -appraised at $1,723.00, and nine slaves appraised at $3,000.00. The slaves subsequently became the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>of Richard H. Dixon and were afterwards emancipated. The account of the administrator shows the distribution of the estate as follows: \u201cTo Rebecca IT. Stewart, widow of deceased, one-third of balance, $1,541.02/3; to Eliza, wife of Richard TI. Dixon and only child of deceased, two-thirds of balance, $3,000.00.\u201d The estate was evidently distributed in kind \u2014 Mrs. Dixon receiving the slaves.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Upon the death of John TI. Stewart, his real estate passed by descent to Eliza S. Dixon, subject to the dower interest of her mother, Rebecca IT. Stewart. On the twenty-fourth day of October, 1856, Eliza S. Dixon and Richard TI. Dixon conveyed said real estate to Rebecca TI. Stewart, and on the stale day Rebecca TI. Stewart reconveyed said property (being the farms mentioned and all the land owned by John IT. Stewart at the time of his death) to Eliza S. Dixon for life, and after her death to Richard TI. Dixon in fee. Each of said deeds recited a consideration of $10,000.00 current money. So far as disclosed by the record this real estate and the property shown by the final distribution comprised the whole estate received by Rebecca IT. Stewart and Eliza S. Dixon from John IT. Stewart, and it is not shown that they were then possessed of any other property or money.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The father of Dr. Richard H. Dixon was James Dixon, of Dorchester County, who died about two years after the marriage of his son to Miss Stewart. The evidence shows that he was a man of considerable means. Prior to his son\u2019s marriage he purchased for him and had conveyed to him a farm called \u201cIndian Purchase,\u201d which Dr. Dixon afterwards called \u201cSunnyside.\u201d It also appears that he furnished the necessary live stock and farming implements for conducting the farm work.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">Under the will of his father, Dr. Dixon was devised his father\u2019s interest in some property called Goose Creek Lands, and a legacy of $2,000.00, consisting of securities to be taken by his executors for the purchase price of his real estate vyhich he directed them to- sell. He was bequeathed certain slaves appraised at $2,100.00, and other personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>appraised at $175.00. The slaves and the personal property were distributed in kind to Doctor Dixon in July, 1860, and the second distribution account filed August 1st, 1860, shows the payment of the legacy of $2,000.00. Dr. Dixon was one of the executors of his father\u2019s will, and the record shows that he received in legacies and commissions from his father\u2019s estate the sum of $5,766.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">After the dearth of John H. Stewart, Doctor Dixon and his family moved from Sunnyside, where he had lived from the time of his marriage, to the farm upon which Mr. Stewart lived at the time of his death. In September, 1863, he sold the Sunnyside farm to Joseph H. Wright for $5,000.00, to be paid in five equal instalments \u2014 the first falling due January 1st, 1864, and the others annually from the day of sale.' On September 21st, 1863, Mr. Wright, to secure the payment of the purchase money, confessed a judgment in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County. Credits were entered on this judgment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">1864, November 9th, by cash...............'$550.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">1865, January 30th, by cash............... 200.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">1866, January 18th, by &gt;eash............... 130.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">1866, April 4th, by cash................... 500.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">1867, January 11th, by cash................1100.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">and on March 15th, 1867, Dr. Dixon assigned the balance due on the judgment to Caleb S. Maltby.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">Dr. Dixon moved from the farm and took possession of the Dail property soon after its purchase, and occupied the dwelling house thereon until his death on April 15th, 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">Dr. Dixon\u2019s first wife died in 1867, leaving surviving her her husband and four children, the oldest of whom was about ten years old and the youngest about two years old. The family of Dr. Dixon consisted of his wife and four children, his mother and Rebecca TI. Stewart, his mother-in-law. Both his mother, who was possessed of considerable means and who appears to have been at all times ready to aid her son in a financial way, and Mrs. Stewart died before his marriage to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>One; of tlio children, Helen S. Dixon, left home in 1892, and lias never returned. Her father and the defendant, however have each rendered her financial aid. She is one of the plaintiffs in this suit, hut does not appear to have taken any active part in its prosecution. W. Lee Dixon continued, with unimportant intervals, to reside with his father until 1895, when, in consequence of serious financial embarrassments which involved his father and greatly distressed him, he left the State and did not return until after his father\u2019s death. The other two children, with slight exceptions, lived with their father until his death, and one of them, James S., lived in (he home for sometime after his father died. Dr. Dixon left two children hy his second wife: Robert 11. Dixon, Jr., born August 23rd, 1886, arid Marie Dixon, horn December 3rd, 1890.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">On the 23rd of April, 1913, the original bill in this case was filed. The substantial allegations of the bill were:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">1st. \u2014 That in or about the month of May, m the year 1865, a certain Eliza S. Dixon, wife of Richard 11. Dixon, both of Dorchester County, State of Maryland, being in possession of a large sum of money and desirous of purchasing a home ill Cambridge, in the county aforesaid and learning that one Thomas I. Dail wished to sell a house that suited her, and would take $5,000.00 therefor, intrusted her husband with that amount of money, with the request that he buy the said property for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">2nd. \u2014 That the said Richard H. Dixon piuceeded to* buy said property from the said Thomas I. Dail as directed, and ' paid for it with the said moneys furnished as aforesaid by said wife for that purpose, but instead of having the deed therefor made to his said wife, as both in law and in equity he was bound to do, he caused it to be made In himself as if he was the purchaser and not the said Eliza S. Dixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">3rd. \u2014 That having (1ms fraudulently secured the legal title to the said house and lot in himself, the said Richard H. Dixon secreted the said deed for over thirty-three years and never did reveal the fact of its existence until he filed it in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the office of the clerk of this Court- in the month of March, in the year 1899.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">4th. \u2014 That the said Eliza S. Dixon departed this life intestate in the year 1867, as aforesaid, leaving four infant children and her said husband surviving her, the said children being likewise the children of the said Richard TI. Dixon, and being the plaintiffs in this suit; that the plaintiffs were the sole heirs-at-law of their said mother, and upon her death, entitled to the said house and lot, subject to- the life estate therein of their said father.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">5 th.- \u2014 -That the plaintiffs and their father after the decease of the said Eliza S. Dixon continued to reside on and occupy said property until Helen S. Dixon went abroad to reside and W. Lee Dixon went to Virginia, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">6th. \u2014 That the said defendant, Helen V. Dixon, well apprised of the foregoing facts, or at least having ample information thereof to put her on inquiry, did, in the year 1907, wickedly induce and persuade her husband, who had become old and infirm, to execute to her without any real consideration a deed -of conveyance of all of said property in fee simpl\u00e9, though he well knew, ought ito have known, and could have known, that he had only a life estate to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">'7th. \u2014 That in the year 1909 the said defendant, in order, as your orators believe and therefore aver, that she might dispose of said property and pocket the proceeds before the death of her husband, and before the plaintiffs could lawfully intervene and assert their title and claim to the possession of the property because of her estate therein for the life of the said Richard H. Dixon, sold and conveyed portions of said property to certain persons named in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">8th.- \u2014 That the plaintiffs are advised,- and therefore allege, that by reason of the foregoing facts the defendant is not an innocent purchaser of said property for value; that she only held an estate for the life time of Richard H. Dixon, and should be compelled by decree to vacate s'aid dwelling house and lot and convey the same to the plaintiffs, and also to pay over to them in the proportions to- which they are entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the money she lias received from her sale of the portions of said property.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The relief prayed for was that, a decree be passed requiring the defendant to \u201cvacate the dwelling house and lot aforesaid, and convey the same to your orators, and also to pay over to them the moneys received by her from the aforesaid sales of their property, and that a multiplicity of suits may he avoided; and that your orators may have such further and other relief, as the case may require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">An answer was filed by the defendant. It is unnecessary to discuss its averments with any particularity. It is sufficient to say that it is full and complete, and specifically denies all the essential allegations, of the bill, and in addition, relies upon laches and limitations as a bar to the relief prayed. On October 9th. 1913, the plaintiffs asked leave to amend the hill and stated in the petition filed for that purpose: \u201cThat they cannot sustain by proof their allegation in paragraph 8 of their bill that the defendant gave to her husband as a reason for a conveyance ito her a fee simple title to the property in dispute, that he could prevent the creditors of W. Lee Dixon, for whom he was surety, from selling the property, and they desire to withdraw said allegation, and to that end make an amendment to the bill by striking out the said \u20188th\u2019 paragraph, and renewing the same by omitting said allegation and making other changes in the verbiage necessitated by the amendment, but in no way affecting the substance and object of the bill.\u201d They prayed leave to amend by striking out the 8th paragraph of the bill, and substituting the following paragraph in lieu thereof: \u2018That the said Helen <em>Y. </em>Dixon, well advised of the foregoing facts, or at least having ample information to put her on inquiry by which she could have discovered the same, did, in the year <em>1907, </em>induce and persuade her husband, the said Richard II. Dixon, to execute to her without any valuable consideration a deed of conveyance of all of said property in fee simple, though he knew, and she knew or ought to have known, and could have known, that he had only a life estate to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>vey, but whether she knew it or not he did so convey to her the said property in which there was a resulting trust in favor of the said Eliza S. Dixon originally, and at her death in favor of her heirs-at-law, the plaintiffs in this action, and by reason of all the aforesaid, the said Helen V. Dixon, she being a volunteer, took the said property impressed with said trust.\u2019 \u201d The bill was amended as prayed under an order of Cqurt. A replication was filed and the testimony of the parties was taken before an examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">After full argument the learned judge in the Court below filed an elaborate and well-considered opinion in which he, after reviewing the facts and the law of the case, concluded that the property conveyed by D\u2019ail and wife to Richard IT. Dixon by the deed of May 9th, .1865, was impressed with a trust for the benefit of the plaintiffs as heirs-at-law of Eliza S. Dixon. This conclusion was based upon the fact, as found by him, that she furnished the consideration for the deed. In conformity to this opinion the following decree was passed: \u201cThis case standing ready for hearing.and being submitted, the counsel for the parties were heard and the proceedings read and considered, and it clearly appearing to the Court that Eliza S. Dixon, mother of the plaintiffs, furnished the money therewith to purchase the certain property described in the deed, of which the Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. T is a copy, offered in evidence, though the said deed names her husband, Richard H. Dixon, as grantee therein; and it further appearing that said property was conveyed to the defendant, Helen V. Dixon, under a voluntary deed, of which the Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No.- 2 is a copy, offered in evidence; and it further appearing that subsequent to the execution and delivery as a gift of the said last named deed, the defendant conveyed certain parts of said property unto innocent purchasers of said parts and received from said innocent purchasers the sum of $900.00, as of the 28th day of December, 1909, and the further sum of two thousand as of the 6th day of December, 1910, which sums were converted by her to her own uses and purposes; and it further appearing that the said Richard H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Dixon departed this life before the institution of this suit, and 'the said Eliza S. Dixon likewise departed this life in the year 1867, leaving the plaintiffs as her sole heirs-at-law. It is thereupon, this 1st day of September, in the year 1913, hy the Circuit 'Court for Dorehester County, in Equity, adjudged, ordered and decreed that the plaintiffs are entitled to relief in the premises, and that the defendant, Helen Y. Dixon, hy a good and sufficient deed to he executed and acknowledged and recorded, agreeable to law, shall convey unto said plaintiffs and their heirs the land and premises in the proceedings mentioned and described, as conveyed hy the aforesaid Richard H. Dixon to the said defendant by deed dated the 17th day of January, 1907, except so much of said property as was afterwards conveyed by the said defendant, and Richard H. Dixon unto Delia Bayly Orem by deed bearing date the 27th day of April, 1909, and to Oarrie W. Ross by deed bearing date the 28th day of December, 1909, and to Ivy L. Leonard by deed bearing date the 6th day of December, 1910, mentioned in these proceedings, and all the right, title, interest and estate of the defendant in and to the same so remaining in her under said deed bearing c\u00edate the 17th day of January, 1907; or, on default thereof on the part of said defendant and the delivery of said deed unto the plaintiffs on or before the 1st day of November, 1913, that Clement Sullivane be, and he is hereby, appointed trustee with full power and authority, by good and sufficient deed to be executed and acknowledged and recorded according to law, to convey to the said plaintiffs and their heirs the said property and estate clear and discharged of all claim from said defendant and of those claiming hy or under her, or the said Richard IJ. Dixon, or either of them; and it is further adjudged, ordered and decreed that the defendant forthwith pay, or bring unto this Court to he paid, unto the plaintiffs the aforesaid sum of $900.00, with interest from the aforesaid 28th day of December, 1909, the same being the proceeds received by her from the sale to Carrie W. Ross mentioned in these proceedings, and the further aforesaid sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>$2,000.00, with interest from the aforesaid 6th day of December, 1910, the same being the proceeds received by her from the sale to Ivy L. Leonard in the proceedings mentioned, and the plaintiffs\u2019 costs of snit to be taxed by the clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">This decree was on September 15th, 1913, modified so far as it required the defendant to pay interest upon the sales from the respective dates thereof, and that in lieu of such payment of interest it was decreed that \u201cthe defendant be and she is hereby required and adjudged to pay forthwith to the plaintiff, as well as the principal sum or sums of said proceeds as provided in said former decree, as also interest thereon from the said 15th day of April, 1912, and that in all other respects and particulars the defendant shall and do abide by and perform the said former decree, dated the first day of September, 1913, as fully and effectually as if the same were incorporated herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Brorn each of these decrees the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The record contains 1104 pages, and includes many exhibits and exceptions filed by the respective parties. In many respects, it is a most remarkable record. It was\u00b0 to be expected that in a family contest such as this the display of deep feeling, violent antagonism, and the usual conflict of testimony between interested parties upon material facts, would be found. \u201cThe little contentions, factions and debates\u201d which filled up the principal drama of the family life of the parties could not be expected to be wholly excluded from the record. The record in such a contest is apt to exhibit the greed of some parties, the delusions of self-interest and partisanship, and a melancholy perversion of truth on the part of some witnesses. But it was not to be expeeted that the record should contain, as it does, a great mass of conflicting evidence upon matters which have nothing whatever to do with the questions presented by the pleadings. We feel safe in saying that all the material testimony or the witnesses in the case could be embraced in 300 pages of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The plaintiffs by their original and amended bill seek to establish a resulting trust in their favor as to the property embraced in the deed from Thomas I. Dail and wife to Richard II. Dixon, and it becomes necessary to state briefly, first, tbe principles of law as to the creation of resulting trusts; secondly, the character of proof required to establish them; thirdly, the admissibility of evidence to establish such a trust in a ease like this. After ascertaining the general principles of law and evidence applicable and controlling in this case, the facts disclosed by the record will then be examined in tbe light of those principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The general rule is well settled that when the purchase price is paid by one person and the title is taken in the name of another a resulting trust arises in favor of the person paying the purchase money, and the holder of the legal title becomes a trustee for him. There are, however, exceptions, to this general rule: Thus, where a person purchases land and</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">pays the consideration with his own money, but causes the title to he placed in the name of one to whom the purchaser is under a natural or moral obligation to provide, such as in the case of parent and child, or husband and wife, no presumption of a resulting trust will arise, but it. will be regarded <em>prima facie </em>as a gift or an advancement for the benefit of the nominal purchaser. In either case, the presumption is one of fact and not of law, and the real intention of the parties to the transaction may be shown, and the Court will give it effect if it does not contravene some rule of property or the policy of the law. If a husband purchases real estate in his own name with money furnished by his wife from her separate estate, a resulting trust in her\u2019 favor arises by implication of law. Tbe authorities are practically unanimous in support of these propositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>Clarke et al., </em>4 H. &amp; J. 551, a case frequently cited upon this subject, the Court said: \u201cIf a man purchases an estate and pays the purchase money, hut takes the deed in the name of another, a trust results by construction of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>to the man who paid the money; and if the nominal purchaser refuses to execute -a declaration of trust, the payment of the consideration money may be proved by parol, as before the statute. The payment of the money is the foundation of the trust,\u201d and in <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Standiford, </em>49 Md. 182, the Court adopted the following rule announced by the lower Oourt in that case: \u201cThere is, perhaps, no principle more clearly settled by numerous authorities than tnat if a husband purchases an estate with the money of his wife, there is a resulting trust, and the husband holds the property as trustee for the benefit of his wife.\u201d In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>96 Md. 144, Judge Jones said: \u201cWhere one party purchases an estate and pays the money, and the deed is taken in the name of another, a trust results by construction of law to the party who paid the money, and such payment may be proved by parol.\u201d <em>Witts </em>v. <em>Horney, </em>59 Md. 584. \u201cIf only a part of the purchase money be paid by a third party, there will be a resulting trust in his favor <em>pro tanto.\" </em>4 Kent. 306 (Marg. 11th ed). The rule of law thus laid down is subject, however, to this qualification: \u201cIf the person in whose name the conveyance of property is taken be one for whom the . party paying the purchase money is under a natural or moral obligation to provide, no equitable presumption of trust arises from the fact of the payment of the money, but, on the contrary, the transaction will be regarded, <em>prima, facie, </em>as an advancement for the benefit of the nominee. In that case, therefore, it will be for the party who seeks to establish a trust in behalf of the payer of the purchase money to displace, by sufficient evidence, the presumption that exists in favor of the legal title.\u201d Accordingly, it is held th\u00e1t: \u201cIf a parent should purchase in the name of his son, the purchase would be deemed, <em>prima facie, </em>as intended as an advancement so as to rebut the presumption of a resulting trust. But this presumption that it is an advancement may be rebutted by evidence manifesting a clear intention that the son shall take as trustee\u201d; but it \u201cought not to be frittered away by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>nice refinements.\u201d \u201cA like presumption exists in the case of the purchase by a husband in the name of his wife. Indeed, the presumption is stronger in the case of a wife than of a child: for she cannot at law be the trustee of her husband.\u201d <em>Mutual Fire, Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>18 Md. 26, and authorities there cited. In 1 <em>Perry on Trusts, </em>sec. 147, it is said that \u201cwhether, in the class of eases last mentioned, the purchase is to be considered as an advancement or settlement or not is a question of pure intention, though presumed, in the first instance to he a provision and settlement.\u201d A clear exposition of the doctrine is found in the case of <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Dobbins et al., </em>67 Neb. 548; S. C. 93 N. W. 687, in which the Court said: \u201cGenerally speaking, where the purchase money of land is paid hy one person, and the title is taken in the name of another, the party taking the title is presumed to hold it in trust for him who pays the purchase price. The reason given for this rule i's that the party wbo pays the money is presumed to intend to become the owner of the property, and the benefit of title follows such intention. This presumption, however, does not arise where the legal title is taken in the name of some person for whom the purchaser is under a legal or moral obligation to provide. In such case the presumption arises that the conveyance was intended as an advancement to the nominal purchaser. The foregoing will be recognized as elementary. Whether the conveyance be to a stranger, or to one for whom the purchaser is bound to provide, the presumption arising therefrom is not of law, hut of fact, which may be rebutted by evidence tending to show that the intention of the purchaser was different from that to be inferred from the bare fact of such conveyance. This, also, is elementary. Hence, in either case, when it appears that the purchase money has been paid by one person, and a title taken in the name of another, the question is whether it was intended that one to whom the conveyance was made should take the entire estate, or that the one paying the purchase price should hold the equitable title to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>property. When the intention in that behalf is ascertained. the Courts will give it effect, if possible.\u201d. In Walsh v. <em>McBride, </em>72 Md. 45, it is stated that: \u201cIn all species of resulting trusts, intention is an essential element, although that intention is never expressed by any words of direct creation. 3 <em>Pomeroy\u2019s Eq., </em>sec. 2031. As the trust results to the real purchaser by operation of law, which is merely an arbitrary implication in the absence of reasonable proof to the contrary, the nominal purchaser is at liberty to rebut the presumption by the production of parol evidence, showing-the intention of conferring the beneficial interest. The trust will not be raised in opposition to the declaration of the person who advances the money; nor in opposition to the agreement of the parties on which the conveyance is founded; nor to the obvious purpose and design of the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201cPayment or -advance of the purchase money by the party claiming the trust, before or at\u2018the time of the purchase, is-indispensable.\u201d <em>Hays et al. </em>v. <em>Hollis, </em>8 Gill, 357; <em>Hollida v. Schoop, </em>4 Md. 465; <em>Brawner </em>v. <em>Staup, </em>21 Md. 328. \u201cIt is held in all the cases that the payment, which is the foundation of the trust, must be made out by plain, direct, and unequivocal evidence.\u201d <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Keller, </em>45 Md. 269; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Standiford, </em>49 Md. 181; <em>Greer </em>v. <em>Baughman, </em>13 Md. 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">When the plaintiff relies upon mere parol evidence to establish the trust the \u201cCourt should view with the greatest caution such evidence impeaching, as it does, solemn instruments, the evidence of title to land. The authorities,\u201d say the Court in <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>4 H. &amp; J. 557, \u201c'are clear that the payment of the money by the <em>cestui que ti'ust </em>must be-clearly proved; otherwise, you render insecure titles depending upon deeds and other written instruments.\u201d <em>Faringer </em>v. <em>Ramsay, </em>2 Md. 365. Testimony of witnesses, based merely upon memory as to oral statements made by persons since-deceased should be received with great caution, and if a longtime has elapsed since Ihe alleged statements, such testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>is held to be most unsatisfactory and inconclusive. In many cases the Courts have spoken of the caution with which such evidence should be accepted as correct, and have stated the reasons therefor. In an elaborate note to <em>Wilbur </em>v. <em>Toothaker, </em>18 Am. &amp; Eng. Anno. Cas. 1190, the weight to be given to testimony based on memory or oral statements is considered, and many cases in England and America are cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Ii is a general rule that declarations of a grantor or vendor, made after the conveyance, arc not admissible in evidence to impeach the title of the grantee. This general rule is elementary. But there is an except ion to it in cases where creditors are seeking to annul the conveyance upon the ground of fraud. In such cases, where evidence is offered tending to show a <em>prima facie </em>case of combination or conspiracy between the grantor and the grantee to defraud the creditors, the declarations of the grantor, after the deed, may be admitted. <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>8 Fed. Rep. 566; <em>Taylor Com. Co. </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>62 Ark. 26; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Mulgrew, </em>102 Cal. 547; <em>Walcott </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>22 N. H. 196; <em>Piedmont Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>138 N. C. 274. But this exception cannot be applied in this case, because in the aspect in which it is presented the rights of creditors are not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">All admissions of Dr. Dixon made after the deed to the defendant are not admissible to establish a trust; nor can the subsequent declarations of Mrs. Eliza S. Dixon in favor of her own title be received for that purpose. They were, besides, made out of the presence of Dr. Dixon, and upon no principle of evidence could they be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">While general reputation as to the ownership of the property in dispute, under the facts and circumstances of the case, might be admissible as reflecting upon the question of laches, it cannot be received to prove title to the land, or to establish the trust asserted by the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">It follows that, under the principles stated, all the testimony containod in the record of written and oral declarations of Dr. Dixon made after the deed to the defendant, and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the testimony of general reputation as to the ownership of the property, and all the testimony as to the declarations of Eliza S. Dixon as to her purchase aud ownership of the property, must he disregarded, because inadmissible to prove title. The evidence in the case upon which the plaintiffs must chiefly rely <em>to </em>establish the trust is that of certam witnesses who have testified as to oral statements or admissions alleged to have been made by Dr. Dixon before the conveyance to the defendant. The case, therefore, -resolves itself into a pure question of fact. It must turn upon the probative value of \u25a0 testimony, based exclusively upon memory as to wbat Dr. Dixon said: The real question is: Is this testimony of sufficient probative force, under tbe principle stated to warrant a decre\u00e9 establishing the trust as prayed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The general character of this parol testimony will now be adverted to. 'Charles <em>W. </em>Stewart-, 68 years old, -who described bimself as <em>\u201ca. </em>gentleman of leisure,\u201d and whose memory is not as good as it used to be, and who gave certain testimony calculated to affect somewhat the credibility of liis evidence, testified to certain statements made to him by Dr. \u2022Dixon twenty-five years or more ago as to tbe, ownership of the property. The witness gave three statements of wbat Dr. Dixon said. The first and third are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">First. \u201cI said to him, Doctor, you will soon have children large enough to look out for your interest, but it looks like, Doctor, you ought to have married a woman nearer your age \u2014a young woman. He said, Stewart, widowers do strange things sometimes. I said, Doctor, you know you married a young woman; it looks like there will be another family of children. He said, Stewart, if I have any more children, my first children are all fixed for this property here; he said, as we got off together, it was my first <em>wife\u2019s </em>property and <em>her </em>children will certainly get. it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Third. \u201cComing up the street I got <em>to </em>boning him about getting married a second time, and told him I thought he ought to have got a woman more of his age as he had children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>coming on and very likely lie would have another set, marrying a young woman. Well, he says to me, Stewart, widowers do strange things sometimes. I said to him that where there are two sets of children there was apt to he squabbling or trouble over tbe property, especially where the man dies and leaves a widow there is mighty apt to he a squabble. He says to me, Stewart, Ibis property here <em>is my </em>wife's, and belongs to <em>her </em>children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Lydia Ilughlett is no doubt a very honest and well intentioned lady. She testified that Dr. Dixon, after the death of his first wife, wanted to marry her, but that she would not marry him because be had no property. She was engaged to three men when she was married. Beaux were nothing to her. She had all she wanted. She testified that forty odd years ago Dr. Dixon told her \u201cthe house belonged to his children, that his wife bought it and paid for it.\u201d But the cross-examination of this witness discloses glaring inaccuracies and misstatements of facts, undoubtedly due to the infirmity of her memory, which weakened very greatly the value of her evidence. For example, she testified that in the same conversation in which Dr. Dixon told her his wife had bought and paid for the property, she said that he told her that the only property he owned was Sumiyside. The record shows that Dr. Dixon at that very time had a good deal of valuable property in fee simple, but that Sunnyside bad been sold six or eight years before.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">James H. Fisher, a colored man, testified that he asked Dr. Dixon why he did not paint Ms house, and the Doctor said \u201cIt belongs to' the children.\u201d He afterwards said, \u201cThe reply was, the home did not belong to him; it belongs to the children.\u201d Mary Heid testified that her husband rented a farm from Dr. Dixon, that be came to the farm and asked her to put up some pickles. \u201cWhen he asked me to put up those pickles I asked him if he was going to get married. I asked him how old the lady was. lie said about- thirty-five. I asked him if she had any money. He said four or five thou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>sand dollars. Then I said, Doctor, you had better be careful; those girls marry old men for their money. Then he looked at me and laughed, and said That belongs to my children when I am through with it.\u2019 \u201d There is other testimony in the case of a similar character. It is upon this kind of evidence, taken in connection with the supposed ability of Mrs. Eliza S. Dixon to pay for the Dail property at the time of its purchase, that the Court must act. Whether Mrs. Eliza S. Dixon was possessed of sufficient money to buy the property is a matter of speculation or conjecture; that she was possessed of the amount of money necessary for that purpose does not satisfactorily appear. The evidence, however, shows that Dr. Dixon was amply able to have raised sufficient money to pay for the property. There is no one produced who has any personal knowledge of the facts attending the purchase of the property on the payment of the purchase money. There is no writing or memorandum to throw light upon the transaction. The deed from Dail and* wife to Dr. Dixon is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of his ownership. He claimed to be the owner and dealt with the property in a manner* inconsistent with the belief on his part that he held it in trust. He conveyed it to his wife and afterwards joined with her in the sale of portions of the property, and nearly fifty years after the transaction, and after all the parties are dead, his four children charge him with fraud and breach of trust, and the Court is asked to sustain this charge upon alleged admissions and statements of the character alluded to. The cases referred to hold such evidence, unsupported and uncorroborated by any fact or circumstance throwing light upon the transaction, to be insufficient to establish the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In 39 <em>Cyc. </em>164, it is said: \u201cAs a general rule, evidence of mere verbal admissions or statements of persons since dead, or of the alleged <em>cesiui que </em>trust, or of mere loose expressions or admissions by the purchaser of property, such as that the purchase money was furnished by another, or that he was purchasing or holding for another, particularly after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>death of such purchaser or a long lapse of time, and uncorroborated by other evidence, is insufficient to establish a resulting trust, as such evidence is most unsatisfactory, on account of the facility with which it may be fabricated, the impossibility of contradiction, and tbe consequences which the slightest mistake or failure of memory may produce. But if such admissions or declarations are plain and consistent and especially if they are corroborated by evidence of other circumstances, as where a statement that a purchase is made for another is corroborated by proof that tbe purchase money was paid by such other, or by proof of a prior agreement to so purchase, they may he sufficient to establish a resulting trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">It was said in <em>Greer </em>v. <em>Baughman, supra: </em>\u201c'The cases on this subject are examined by Chancellor Kent, with his usual ability, in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>1 John. Ch. 582. lie there says: \u201cThe cases uniformly show that the Courts have been deeply impressed with the danger of this kind of proof as tending to perjury and the insecurity of paper title; and they have required the payment by the <em>cestui que trust </em>to he clearly proved.\u201d Although he states that the rule has been established by the weight of authority, which allows parol proof of a resulting trust, yet it is evident that if the point-had been <em>res </em>integra, he would have been inclined to think that \u201csuch evidence is too dangerous in its consequences,\u201d and he speaks of <em>Gascoigne </em>v. <em>Thwing, </em>1 Vern. 366, as being a salutary admonition \u201cin regard to the caution with which such proof ought to be examined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The decision in <em>Boyd </em>v. McLean, <em>supra, </em>was in support of the resulting trust. But it was upon strong and convincing proof, such as the Chancellor considered \u201cdecidedly in favor of the charges contained in the bill. Three witnesses declared they were present when the parties, being together, made or acknowledged the alleged agreement. In addition to this testimony as to the original transaction the contentions of the defendant to the same facts were proved by a number of other witnesses, and there were corroborating circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>of considerable moment. But notwithstanding all this weight ' of evidence before him, the \u25a0 Chancellor considered it proper to examine the ease with much care and minuteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In <em>Lench </em>v. Lench, 10 Ves. 517, where the material evidence came from the trustee, who had been made a competent witness by a release, Sir William Grant, as Master of the Bolls, says: \u201cShe swears to no fact or circumstance capable of being investigated or contradicted, but merely a naked declaration, supposed to be made by the husband- himself, admitting that- the purchase was made with, the trust money. This is, in all cases, most unsatisfactory evidence, on account of the facility with which it may be fabricated, and the impossibility of contradicting it. Besides, the slightest mistake or failure of recollection may totally alter the effect of the declaration.\u201d And again, on page 519, it is said: \u201cIf evidence of this sort could be proceeded upon, standing unsupported, -and, in some degree, contradicted by the circumstances, it ought to stand wholly uncontradicted by other evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The case of <em>P\u2019Pool </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>8 S. W. 198, is in many respects strikingly alike the case before us. It appeared that in 1859, a Mr. Miller conveyed to C. C. Thomas a tract of land in Kentucky containing 200 acres. Thomas and his wife, Mary Anne, moved upon the land in 1859, and resided thereon as their home. In 1876 Mrs. Thomas died, and in the same year O. C. Thomas married Amanda C. Thomas, with whom he lived until 1885, when he died. By Amanda C. Thomas he had two children, one of whom is living. C. O. Thomas left a will by which he devised to Amanda C. Thomas said tract of land during her life and the remainder to his children by Amanda O. Thomas and Mary Anne Thomas. Amanda C. Thomas renounced the provisions of the will and claimed a homestead in the said land which, not being worth over $1,000.00, was alloted to her as a homestead. The children of O. O. Thomas by his first wife, Mary Anne, instituted a suit in equity against Amanda C. Thomas and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tor child by O. O. Thomas for the purpose of setting aside the deed, and having the said land conveyed to them, upon the ground that O'. O. Thomas purchased and paid for said land with money belonging to Mary Anne Thomas, by an agreement with her that the purchase was to he made for her and the deed taken to her and her heirs, but that he violated said agreement, and had the deed made to himself. The bill was dismissed and upon appeal the Court said: \u201cThere is proof in the case which tends to show that C. C. Thomas agreed with his wife, Mary Anne Thomas, to use the money which she was to receive from her father\u2019s estate in the purchase of a home in this State and have the deed made to her and her bodily heirs; that after the purchase of the land in controversy, he paid for it with the money that ho received from her father\u2019s estate; that he often promised her to make her a deed to the land, and that but a short time before her death told her that he had done so. On the other hand, there is proof -in the case that he said that he had paid for the land with the proceeds of a crop or crops of tobacco he had raised on the farm. The proof of the agreement consists in the recollections of the witnesses, 26 years after it is alleged to have been made, of what they heard O. O. Thomas and Mary Anne Thomas, his wife, sav about it; and tbe proof of these witnesses does not clearly establish the fact of the agreement, but at most the evidence is moderately pursuasive that such an agreement was made. As to the payment for the land with Mary Anne Thomas\u2019 money, the proof, while it tends in' that direction, by no means clearly establishes the fact, and when it is considered in connection with the proof that C. O. Thomas claimed that he had paid for the land with the proceeds of his tobacco, the dubiousness as to the trust of the matter is still more serious. While it is the established law of this State that a resulting trust may he established by parol evidence, yet it is equally well established that the evidence establishing such trust should be clear and satisfactory. It was formerly beld that parol evidence was not admissible to prove that the holder, of the legal title to lands, purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>the same with trust money and took the conveyance to himself in violation of a verbal agreement with the person for whom he was acting, whereby to raise a trust as to a title in the <em>cestui que trust; </em>but this Court, as well as others, has departed from this rigid rule and allows such trust to be established by parol evidence; but such evidence must establish a trust clearly and satisfactorily. <em>Snelling </em>v. <em>Utterback, </em>1 Bibb. 609; <em>Letcher </em>v. <em>Letcher, </em>4 J. J. Marsh. 593. The facts of this case illustrate the wisdom of this rule, for here, after a lapse of twenty-six years, and nearly ten years after the death of Mary Anne Thomas, and after O. O. Thomas had married again and died, leaving his second wife and only child by her, the appellants attempt to establish the trust by their own proof of the admissions of O. O. Thomas, which belongs to that class of evidence denominated as the weakest in law, which admissions at most are in general terms, and do not show with reasonable certainty that the agreement was made with his wife or that her money was actually used to pay for the land, both of which facts must concur in order to establish such a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">After a careful review of all the evidence, properly to be considered, we are of the opinion that it does not establish the allegations of the bill with that degree of certainty required by the law. The decree will, therefore, be reversed and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed and bill dismissed, the appellees to pay\u25a0 the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
