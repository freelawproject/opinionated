An absolute and unconditional renunciation of his rights against the principal debtor made at or after the maturity of the instrument discharges the instrument. But a renunciation \u25a0 does not affect the rights of a holder in due course without notice. A renunciation must he in writing, unless the instrument is delivered up to the person primarily liable thereon.\u201d In view of this provision the Court below declined to submit for determination as an issue of fact the question whether there had been an <em>oral </em>agreement for the release of the defendant as an endorser of the promissory note in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The judgment below was in favor of the National Exchange Bank of Baltimore City, the present appellee, for a balance, including interest, of $3,331.90 on a promissory note of the Boxbury Distilling Company for the original sum of $9,000.00, dated October 13, 1908, payable on demand to the appellee\u2019s order, and endorsed by the appellant and others before delivery. It is shown by the proof that this note was given as a substitute for a time note to the bank which had been executed by the same parties. At the inception of the last mentioned note the Distilling Company had deposited with one of the endorsers, for their common indemnification, eighteen bonds of the company of the par value each of $1,000. After the substituted demand note had been in existence for about a year, it was reduced by a payment of $5,000, and the bonds just referred to^ were delivered to the bank as collateral security for the remainder of the indebtedness. This occurred in November, \u25a0 1909. Interest was paid on the note to December 31st of that year, after which no further payments of any kind were made until August, 1913, when a dividend of $335.95 upon the collateral bonds was paid by the receivers of the Distilling Company, and this was followed by another of $135.31 from the same source on the note itself in December, 1913. The defendant endorser testified that the sum. paid on the note in 1909 represented the amount realized by the Distilling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Company from a salo of $5,000 worth of whiskey to the defendant which was made in pursuance of an arrangement for such an application of the proceeds. The money required for this purchase was obtained by the defendant upon a mortgage of a portion of his property. It was through his action that the bonds hold as an indemnity for the endorsers were delivered to the bank as collateral. The- defendant states that these results were accomplished by him under an agreement with Air. Waldo .Newcomer, .President of the National Exchange Hank, that in consideration of this service the defendant should be released from further liability on his endorsement. This testimony is met by Mr. Newcomer\u2019s express denial that there was any such agreement; hut the defendant claims the right to have the disputed question of fact submitted, under a prayer for that purpose, to the finding of the Court sitting as a, jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The theory advanced by the defendant is that tho provision we have quoted from the Negotiable Instruments Act applies only to renunciations made without consideration, and that it has no reference- to releases of liability under agreements which operate by way of accord and satisfaction. In view of the general policy of the statute wo are; unwilling to restrict its application by adopting the construction suggested. Assuming that the transaction described hy the defendant, and upon which he relies, would furnish a sufficient basis for an accord and satisfaction with respect to his liability as an endorser, we are of the opinion that under tho plain and comprehensive- language of the Act the only mode of proving the alleged release is by a renunciation in writing. Undoubtedly the word \u201crenunciaton,\u201d as used in the section quoted, appropriately describes the act of surrending a right or claim without recompense, but it can be applied with equal propriety to the- relinquishment of a demand upon an agreement supported by a consideration. It is defined 'as meaning: \u201cThe act of renouncing or giving up- something possessed,\u201d <em>Websters international Dictionary; </em>\u201cThe act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>of giving up a right,\u201d <em>Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictioncui'y </em>(15th ed.) ; \u201cThe legal act by which a person abandons a right acquired, but without transferring it to another,\u201d <em>Century Dictionary. </em>These definitions are practically the same as those given in the same authorities for the word \u201crelease,\u201d as follows: \u201cA giving up or relinquishment as of a right or claim,\u201d <em>Webster; </em>\u201cThe giving up or abandoning a claim or right to the person against whom the claim exists or the right is to be exercised or enforced,\u201d <em>Bouvierj </em>\u201cA surrender of a right,\u201d <em>Century. </em>Both the terms thus similarly defined are classed as synonyms of <em>\u201crelinquishment.\u201d </em>There can be no doubt that the word we are interpreting is sufficiently broad in its meaning to include the release of a claim by virtue of an accord and satisfaction as well as a waiver of liability, made gratuitously. If we were to accept the defendant\u2019s theory, it is evident that the result would be to restrict the term to a portion only of the transactions to Avhich it is capable of being applied. We see no occasion to thus narrow its effect, and there is cogent reason for duly regarding its plain and com- . prehensive significance. The statute in which it is used was enacted upon the recommendation of the Commission representing Maryland in the movement to promote uniformity of legislation. The same measure has been adopted as a part of' the statutory law of a number of the States of the Union. The primary purpose of its enactment was to secure uniformity in the law governing negotiable instruments. <em>Vanderford v. The Farmers and Mechanics\u2019 National Bank of Westminster, </em>105 Md. 164. In order that this object may be realized it is important that differences of judicial construction as to its application should be avoided so far as may be reasonably practicable. This end can best be attained by allowing to the language of the statute the full effect to which it is legitimately entitled. The surest means of producing an opposite tendency would be the attempt to introduce possible but unnecessary distinctions and qualifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>for the purpose of restricting the scope and meaning of the terms employed in this well considered legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Supreme Court of Washington has had occasion to' construe the uniform Negotiable Instruments Act, which is in force in that State, in reference to the identical question we have now under review. In <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>41 Wash. 416. 83 Pac. 724, it was held that an agreement hy the payee of a note to release the surety, while supported hy a sufficient consideration, was ineffective because the renunciation was not in writing as required hy the Act. After quoting the section already set forth in this opinion the Court observed: \u201cThis plainly provides that the renunciation of a debt must be in writing where the debt is evidenced by a negotiable instrument, and, if \u2018renunciation\u2019 is used therein in the sense of \u2018release,\u2019 there can he no question that the appellant must show a written renunciation in order to prove the allegations of his answer. Counsel for the appellant argues that the word is used in a sense different from that of release, and that, while a renunciation must he by a writing, a release may he proved hy parol. But we cannot think the statute permits of this distinction. The words, \u2018the holder may expressly renounce his right against any party to the instrument,\u2019 must refer to the release and discharge of a party to the instrument from his obligation to pay it, else they can have no legitimate meaning.\u201d This ruling was followed in the later ease of <em>Pitt </em>v. <em>Little </em>(Wash.), 108 Pac. 941. In <em>Leash </em>v. <em>Dew, </em>102 App. Div. (N. Y.) 529; affirmed in 184 N. Y. 599, the provision in question was applied to a gratuitous relinquishment, as was also the case in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>L. R, 2 Ch. 157, (1896) and <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>L. R. 44 Ch. Div. 627 (1890), where a similar clause in the English Bills of Exchange Act was considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">It is contended that the construction we are adopting is inconsistent with Section 138 of the statute, which specifies the acts hy which a negotiable instrument is discharged, as follows: \u201c1. By payment in due course by or on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the principal debtor; 2. By payment in due course by the party accommodated, where the instrument is made or accepted for accommodation; 3. By the intentional cancellation thereof by the holder; 4. By any other act which will discharge a simple contract for the payment of money; 5. When the principal debtor becomes the holder of the instrument at or after maturity in his own right.\u201d The argument is that inasmuch as accord and satisfaction is a method of discharging a simple contract for the payment of money and admits of proof by parol at common law, and as Section 138 does not require that an extinguishment of the debt by any of the methods it mentions shall be evidenced in writing, it could not have been intended by Section 141 that the provision as to the proof of \u201crenunciation\u201d should apply to such a defense as the present. It is to be noted that Section 138 is confined to a, designation of <em>ads </em>which discharge the instrument, and does not purport to prescribe the character of proof by which they must be established. Section 141 deals specifically with the subject of. discharge by renunciation and provides in effect that an extinguishment of liability to be thus accomplished must be evidenced in writing, unless the instrument is delivered up to- the party primarily liable. The earlier section relates generally to <em>causes </em>of discharge, while the later refers in part 'to the mode of proof as to a particular method of producing such a result. To the extent that acts which \u201cwill discharge a simple contract for the payment of money,\u201d as mentioned in Section 138, may be included in the category of \u201crenunciations*\u201d the intent of the statute is that they must be proven by the holder\u2019s written declaration. There is no such inconsistency with Section 138 involved in the construction we have placed on Section 141 as to require or justify the restriction of its scope and operation within narrower limitations than its plain terms import.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
