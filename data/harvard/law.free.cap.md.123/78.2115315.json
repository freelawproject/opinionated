He is not an insurer of the safety of persons attending, but he is bound to use ordinary care for their safety and protection, and if an injury results from a breach of this duty he is liable. There is no dissent to this proposition in any of the cases. The law applicable to this class of cases was carefully considered in <em>Agricultural and Mechanical Association </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>118 Md. 600, in which Judge Stockbridge said, adopting the principle announced in <em>Schofield </em>v. <em>Wood, 170 </em>Mass. 415: \u201cA person erecting and maintaining a place of public exhibition must use reasonable care in the construction, maintenance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>and management of it, having regard to the character of exhibitions given therein and the customary conduct^of spectators who witness them, and he cannot escape liability if be is negligent in the manner in which the guard rail in front of the gallery was constructed and maintained, and if a spectator who is injured by the. falling of a guard rail during an exhibition was in the exercise of due care, on the ground that other persons may have contributed to the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In a large number of cases the terms employed to designate the duty of the owner are \u201cdue care,\u201d \u201cordinary care,\u201d or \u201creasonable care.\u201d Thus this Court said in <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>66 Md. 337, \u201che who solicits and invites the public to his resorts, must have them in a reasonably safe condition, and not in a condition to risk the lives and limbs of his visitors.\u201d See also 29 <em>Cyc. </em>453; <em>Swords </em>v. <em>Edgar, </em>59 N. Y. 28; <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Agricultural Society, </em>97 Me. 108; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Wisconsin State Agricultural Society, </em>60 Wis. 401; <em>Kann </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>88 Md. 551; <em>Texas State Fair </em>v. <em>Brittain, </em>118 Fed. 713; <em>Marti </em>v. <em>Texas State Fair Association, </em>69 S. W. 432; <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Boston Music Hall Association, </em>135 Mass. 414; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Southern Kennebec Agricultural Society, </em>47 Me. 275; 74 Am.

A. 754; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Mineral Park Association, </em>128 Iowa., 32. \u201cYet in each one of the cases where the measure of care or dirty is defined by tbe use of the adjectives \u201cdue, ordinary, or reasonable,\u201d the application has been the same as in the cases of <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Buffalo Park, </em>21 N. Y. App. Div. 321, and <em>Schofield </em>v. <em>Wood, supra.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The plaintiff offered evidence tending to prove the following facts: That on the afternoon of Yovember 29th, 1912, she went to the defendant\u2019s theatre where vaudeville and moving picture shows are given; that she was accompanied by ber sister, Miss Mamie Griffin, and Mrs. Benjamin R. Johnson; that after purchasing tickets of admission at the box office they were admitted to the front row of seats in the theatre, and that an usher in attendance showed them to their seats. The plaintiff had visited the theatre before. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>orchestra or musicians\u2019 pit, into which the plaintiff fell, is lower than the main floor of the theatre leading down to it\u2014 one witness said it was \u201cabout a foot lotyer, probably more or less,\u201d and another,' who said he had measured it, testified that \u201cit is just 3% inches from the floor to the bottom of the pit.\u201d The distance between the front seats, and the pit is 25% inches when the seats are up, and 15% inches when the seats are down. On her prior visits to the theatre the plaintiff saw that the pit was g\u2019uarded by a rope which ran around it, but on the occasion in question this guard rope had been removed, as testified to by the manager of the theatre \u201cfor the purpose of one act going through the audience,\u201d but the plaintiff was not aware that the guard had been removed. The plaintiff testified that \u201cshe did not know the rail had been removed at the0 time of the accident.\u201d She further stated that she was not warned about the danger of the pit by anything in the theatre that afternoon. At the time of the accident she was trying to reach a seat in the front row next to the orchestra. \u201cIt is very narrow and there is not room enough for people to sit with their feet comfortably outside of anybody walking along there.\u201d When she fell she was right at the end of the aisle and about turned around on the front row to take the seat that was vacant. This seat that she was attempting to taire was the third from the aisle. This aisle was the right-hand aisle going toward the stage, and the seat was to the right of this aisle. \u201cAs I was stepping towards that seat, I went down in the orchestra pit; I attempted to catch hold of the rope, knowing positively that it had been there,\u201d she had been to the theatre many times and had seen the- rope. \u201cAt the time of the accident there was a moving-picture on, and it was extremely dark, and coming- from the light, you know, made it seem that much darker. I suppose that the musicians had their lights lit.; but I had to get. down to the pit to see that. The other part of the theatre was totally dark * *\u25a0 *. The theatre was crowded and many were standing.\u201d When she fell she went \u201chead first and fell on my feet, and that is when I sprained, my ankle. She was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>helped out hy her two companions and Mr. E'itchen.\u201d \u201cHe caught me up bodily under the arms because I could not move. They then led me over into the box, and I stayed in the box.\u201d Her ankle wms hurting badly at the time, but she did not examine it until she got home and look off her shoe, when her foot began to swell and .she sent for her doctor, Albert Chambers. M. I). \u201cT was off my feet for eight weeks and 1 cannot get along very well with it now, so I don\u2019t know how long I will he laid up.\u201d The sprain was very painful, \u201cI never suffered so much pain.\u201d Her ankle still pained her. She said that she fell when in the act of turning from the aisle to the seat; that- she fell before she realized where she was; that she was not able to see very much. It was, she further testified, \"very dark,\u201d and she thought she would catch hold of the rail and rope, but that they had been removed without her knowledge. The testimony of the plaintiff was corroborated by that of Mrs. Johnson and Miss Griffin upon material points and upon the darkness pervading the theatre at the time-.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">I)r. Albert IV. Chambers testified that he was called to alten d the plaintiff on the 2nd of December, 1912, and that he found her suffering with a sprained ankle and a sprained foot: that, she had quite a good deal of swelling about the ankle and the foot; a considerable amount of dislocation, and was suffering a good deal of pain; that she was still having pain, and that \u201cwhatever disability she now has is likely to be permanent.\u201d He further testified that: \u201cThe probable results of a badly sprained ankle and foot are more likely to be the impairment of the functions, a certain weakness about the ankle: the ankle will not he as strong as it was before, and the smaller joints between the different bones in the feet arc apt to be weak and painful. A bad sprain can cause a falling arch, but I am not willing to say that that will be the result in this case. I am not willing to say that is going to happen. The pain and the impairment of ilie functions are there now and they are liable to stay there, and any impairment, from this time on is apt to be permanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The defendant offered evidence to the effect that there were sufficient lights burning at the time of the injury to show any object in the house or any obstruction and that the light from the moving picture was sufficient to enable one .to see anything within five rows back. At the conclusion of the case the Court granted three prayers on behalf of the plaintiff and four on the part of .the defendant. There were no special exceptions filed. These prayers, which the reporter is requested to set out in the report of the case, correctly submitted the questions of primary and contributory negligence to the jury, and also advised the jury as to the correct measure of damages. The first prayer of the defendant asked the Court to decide that there was no evidence in the case legally sufficient to entitle the- plaintiff to recover. This prayer was refused, and the verdict and judgment being in favor of the plaintiff; the defendant has prosecuted this appeal. Assuming, as we must do, in passing upon this prayer the truth of the testimony offered by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, we are of opinion that the prayer was properly refused. It is a matter of common knowledge and observation that a depression in a floor of the depth of the one described is sufficient to cause one to fall under the circumstances testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, and the defendant might have reasonably anticipated that a patron might have fallen In attempting to reach one of the front seats in the darkness. The jury might well have concluded that by placing a guard rope around the pit, the defendant recognized the danger of leaving it unprotected. To have left this pit unguarded and unprotected under the circumstances might well have been regarded by the jury as an act of negligence; nor could the Court have decided, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. The questions of primary and contributory negligence were properly left to the jury under the prayers granted. In <em>Knecht </em>v. Mooney, 118 Md. 583, it was said by Judge Thomas : \u201cIt is said in <em>United Railways </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>92 Md. 425, that \u2018negligence is usually a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>for the jury to decide upon all the facts of the case\u2019; <em>Shipley's Case, </em>31 Md. 368; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>29 Md. 252; and \u2018when it can only be correctly determined by considering all the attending and surrounding circumstances of the transaction, it falls within the province of the jury to pass upon and characterize it\u2019; and in the same case Juno\u00ae Pase said that \u2018unless the uncontradicted evidence in the case proves such a glaring act of carelessness on the part of the appellee as to amount in law to contributory negligence, it is the duty' of the Court to submit the matter to the jury.\u2019 In the case of <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Baltimore Traction Co., </em>80 Md. 551, this Court held that the uncontradicted evidence in the case must establish some distinct, prominent and decisive act, about which ordinary minds would not differ, in order to justify the Court in pronouncing the plaintiff\u2019s conduct such contributing negligence in law as to prevent a recovery.\u2019 \u201d We find in this record no such decisive act of negligence on the part of the plaintiff as would have warranted the Court in directing a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">During the course of the trial the defendant reserved five exceptions to rulings on evidence. The second and fifth exceptions were abandoned in this Court, and we find no reversible error in any of the other rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed,, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
