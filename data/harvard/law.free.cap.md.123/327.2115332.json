The residuary clause included the declaration of the testator, that it was \u201cin trust and confidence nevertheless that they will invest the same, so far as the same may be uninvested, and collect and invest the rents, issues and profits thereof, in such manner as to increase the corpus or principal thereof.\u201d In a subsequent clause it was provided that \u201cfor the purpose of enabling the trustee, hereinbefore named, the better to execute the several trusts, hereinbefore provided, I hereby authorize and empower ihein to invest the trust funds in their hands in such good and sufficient securities as they, or a majority of them shall select, and to sell again, and convey for the purpose of any investment or distribution, as- often as in their judgment or that of a majority of them, it shall be wise to do so.\u201d A proceeding for specific performance was instituted by the trustees requiring a purchaser to complete the purchase and pay for certain leasehold property, a part of the residuary estate, which the trustees had sold; on appeal it was held that the provision in the will empowering the trustees to invest the trust funds in their hands in order the better to execute the several trusts thereinbefore provided, gave them full power to sell the property and estate irrespective of whether or not the title to that particular portion had been held by the testator in his life time, and that, by the use of the words \u201cso far as the same may be uninvested\u201d tbe testator did not intend to limit the -\u00a1tower of the trustees to invest. p. 331</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b369-8\">\n<em>Decided May 14th, 1914.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Appeal from the Circuit Court of Baltimore City.

Slater, the trustees had power to make sale of the leasehold property, the subject of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">By will' Thomas W. Slater left a large estate to three trustees. After, by different clauses thereof, bequeathing certain definite sums to the trustees for certain trusts therein set out, he devised and bequeathed all the rest and residue of his estate to the trustees to execute the trusts, therein set out, for the benefit of his son and his son\u2019s children, upon the contingencies therein set out. The trustees named were also named as executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">In March, 3 896, upon application, the parties thereto being all the parties in interest who were <em>in esse </em>at the time, the Circuit Court of Baltimore City assumed jurisdiction of the trusts, and an auditor\u2019s account was passed, setting apart certain portions of the estate, to be'held by the trustees in divisions, under the different clauses of the will. Held under the residuary clause was the leasehold property which is the subject, of the sale in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">In April, 1913, the trustees, the appellees herein, entered into an agreement with Julian S. Carter for the sale of the said leasehold property, subject to the ratification thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>by the Court. Said sale was reported and duly ratified without objection. In said report it was stated that Julian S. \u25a0Carter was acting as the agent of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Thereafter, upon the purchaser refusing to pay the purchase price upon the tender of a deed by the trustees, the trustees filed a petition praying that the purchaser be compelled to comply with the terms of sale. Julian S. Carter and the Manor Real Estate and Trust Company answered, \u2022disclosing that the said Carter was acting as agent for the Manor Real Estate and Trust Company in the purchase, and '\u25a0claiming that the trustees had no power under the will of Thomas W. Slater to make sale of the said property, and, therefore, the Court was without jurisdiction io ratify the same; and denying that the Court could ratify the sale under its general chancery jurisdiction, since the requirements of ihe Act of 1868, Chapter 273, or of section 198 of Article 16 of the Code (Bagby\u2019s Code, sec. 228, Art. 16) had not been complied with. The Court, thereupon, decreed, that ihe said Carter and the Manor Real Estate and Trusi Company pay the amount of purchase money, and the trustees \u25a0convey the property; and upon the failure of the purchaser to comply, before a certain day, that the writ of <em>fieri facias </em>issue. This appeal was thereupon prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">So much of the residuary clause, as is important for the purpose of a determination of this question, is as follows: \"In trust and confidence nevertheless that they will invest the same, so far as the same may be uninvested, and collect and invest the rents, issues and profits thereof in such manner as to increase the corpus, or principal thereof.\u201d Tn a subsequent clause there is this provision: \u201cEor the purpose of enabling the trustees hereinbefore named, the better 10 exe\u2022cute the several' trusts, hereinbefore provided, I hereby authorize and empower them to invest the trust funds in their hands in such good and sufficient securities as they, or a majority of them shall select, and the same to sell again and convey for the purposes of re-investment or distribu\u00ed ion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>as often as in their judgment, or that of a majority of them, it shall he wise to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">This Court has so recently, in two carefully considered cases, reviewed the authorities on the question here involved and announced the law applicable, that we deem an extended discussion unnecessary. The appellants contend that by the last clause \u201cthe testator had reference only to the income, which he had already given them power to invest so as to increase the corpus, and the moneys he had bequeathed for investment by them,\u201d and did not refer to that part of the coi\u2019pus which was invested in the lifetime of the testator. In the case of <em>Schloendorn </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>115 Md. 74, the same\u2019 contention was made. \u201cIt is contended by the -appellee that the power conferred upon the trustees in this case, under the will of Frederick W. Schloendorn To invest and reinvest said rest,, residue and remainder of my estate, in their judgment and discretion, and to pay the net income, etc.,\u2019 has reference only to the Trust moneys coming into the hands of the trustees\u2019 and confers no power upon them To sell the-real estate of which the testator took title during his lifetime\u2019 and which forms a part of The rest, residue and remainder\u2019 of' the estate.\u201d After a thorough review of the authorities the opinion concludes: \u201cWe, therefore, think that it can be-inferred from the power given, under the will, to the trustees To invest and re-invest,\u2019 in their judgment and discretion the said rest, residue and remainder of his estate, that it was the intention of the testator to confer upon such trustees the power to sell, in their judgment and discretion, the-property of the estate, real or personal, including the property of which the testator died seized and possessed, as well as any property thereafter acquired by the trustees.\u201d To the same effect is the case of <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Safe Deposit and Trust Co., </em>116 Md. 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">When, therefore, the testator, for the purpose of enabling-the trustees \u201cthe better to execute the <em>several tnists </em>herein-before provided,\u201d empowered them to invest the \u201ctrust funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>in their hands,\u201d we think, upon the authority of the above cases, tbat it is clear that his intention was to arm them with full powers to sell the property of the estate, irrespective of whether or not the title to that particular portion had been held by the testator in bis lifetime. Tbat the words used were \u201ctrust funds\u201d instead of trust estate, we do not think indicates that he intended that only money accruing by way of income was to be used for investments, for all through the will the words are used in the same sense adopted by us. A study of the language of the whole will shows, that by the use of the language \u201cso far as the same may be uninvested\u201d the testator did not intend to limit the power of the trustees to invest, and even though it should appear tbat be had done so, yet it becomes apparent tbat such was not his intention, when, in the effort to remove any doubt that might arise from the expressions used in the different clauses, he adds the general clause to enable them the better to execute the several trusts \u2014 not all but the one under the residuary clause, but \u201cthe several trusts hereinbefore provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The ease of <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Safe Deposit and Trust Co., </em>92 Md. 503, relied upon by the appellants is readily distinguishable, from the fact tbat in the will in that case the testator expressly said tbat the property in question was not to be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Since the appointment by will bad been sanctioned by the Court upon assuming jurisdiction, it was. proper and necessary tbat the sale should have been made subject to the ratification by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The decrees appealed from will, therefore, be affirmed, but under the circumstances of this case we think it proper that the costs of these proceedings in this Court be paid by the trustees out of the estate in their bauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, appellees to pay the costs in this Court.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
