The Examiner of Interferences refused registration, on the ground that the mark merely has geographical significance, applicable to any business house located in France, and that, as applied to a house not located in France, it is deceptive. Responding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>to this Office action, the applicant did not assert that its goods were made in France, but alleged that, as applied to the dresses and other articles of clothing upon which it was used, it was suggestive of that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZO\">\u201cgood taste, style, line, and blend of colors which is essentially French, and is not merely significant of any \u2018business house in France.\u2019 * * * Since, therefore, Paris has been considered the acme of. perfection in style, a trademark such as applicant\u2019s suggesting the emulation of French lines and style as the distinguishing feature- of applicant\u2019s goods, would act to create a demand for his goods, and therefore accomplish the purpose of the trade-mark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">The Assistant Commissioner, in disposing of the case, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-5\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s mark is believed to clearly indicate to the average purchaser that the wearing apparel, gowns, waists, etc., were imported from a business house in France. The use of the word \u2018house\u2019 to indicate a coiamercial or importing house is well known. When such word is applied to wearing apparel, the inference is at once drawn that the apparel came from that commercial or business place. When the statement is added that this is a commercial place of France, the conclusion is fairly reached 'by the average purchaser in this country that the clothing was imported from a business house located in France. In this sense, therefore, the mark would he clearly deceptive, unless such were the fact. The whole meaning of the mark is geographical as to origin of the goods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">That \u201cHouse,\u201d as used in this mark, indicates an individual, firm, or corporation, is clear. The words \u201cHouse of France,\u201d therefore, as clearly indicated French firm or a branch of a French firm. Appellant is neither, and, even if it was, would have no right to the exclusive appropriation of a term equally available to every real house of France doing business in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">For the reasons stated in detail by the Patent Office, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
