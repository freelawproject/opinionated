Smith\u2019s patent discloses no pioneer invention, and the single claim in suit is for a combination of a coin receptacle having a <em>\u201cstationery </em>shell and a rotary bottom,\u201d and an \u201copening in the wall of the shell\u201d to expose said bottom, with a \u201cgate spanning said opening.\u201d The other elements of the claimed combination relate to the control and counting of coins after they escape from the revolving receptacle bottom, and need not be recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Considering the state of the art, and the language of the claim, no wide range of equivalents can be asserted for this patent; it may be assumed as valid within the exact scope of its disclosure, but the claim cannot be broadly read without invalidation by older patents. We are wholly unable to agree with appellant that \u201cSmith gave the art the first commercially successful coin-counting machine of the centrifugal disc type\u201d; on the contrary, we do not think that plaintiff\u2019s commercial machine is the device of the patent. That device had no commercial success.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Measuring the defendant\u2019s alleged infringing machine by the claim, as explained by the specification, we entirely agree with Campbell, District Judge, that, first, defendant\u2019s device has no <em>\u201cstationery </em>shell\u201d; and, second, it has no \u201cgate,\u201d such as is disclosed. Gates generically were old. Smith has no monopoly in any other gate than the one he invented. Consequently infringement is absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
