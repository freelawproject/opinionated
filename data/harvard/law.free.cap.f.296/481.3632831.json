Some time after the horses were loaded, and at night, the plaintiff went into the freight depot and there applied to .defendant\u2019s freight agent for information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>concerning the location of the car in which the horses were, and was told by the agent that the car was on track No. 7, and \u201cpointed down across diagonally out of the depot,\u201d and said, \u201cIt is right over there.\u201d The plaintiff testified that he went \u201cthe way\u201d he was told, and in doing so stepped from a paved driveway into an open culvert, and fell to the bottom of a ditch a distance of seven or eight feet. <em>,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The defendant offered evidence in conflict with that for the plaintiff, but it is unnecessary to state it, because the error relied on is that the trial court-erred in refusing to direct a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The argument for reversal is that plaintiff\u2019s evidence fails to show an express invitation to go upon the railway company\u2019s property at the place where he was injured. It is said that the evidence fairly construed does not disclose that the freight agent did more than to indicate the general direction which the plaintiff was invited to take. ' We are unable to agree to this construction of plaintiff\u2019s evidence. Jt appears to us to be to the effect that defendant\u2019s agent pointed out particularly the way the plaintiff should go, and that the latter followed out the direction given him, and in doing so was injured. According to plaintiff\u2019s evidence the invitation was express, and therefore he was not a licensee or trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
