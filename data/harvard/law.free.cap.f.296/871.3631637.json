Pritchard Bros, agree to ship to the company all of the lumber manufactured or produced by or for them (except such lumber as they may sell to local consumers) during the continuance of this contract, shipping either on orders furnished by the company, or, in the absence of such orders, placing the lumber in transit, and the company agrees <em>to </em>handle all such lumber as hereinafter provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-9\">\u201cSecond. Pritchard Bros, agree to operate their mills to capacity, except when prevented by inclement weather, breakdowns, or other conditions beyond their control, manufacturing all stock in a skillful and workmanlike manner, placing the same on sticks for drying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-10\">\u201cThird. Pritchard Bros, agree to deliver all of said lumber on board cars at the railroad'as rapidly as possible, and continue so to do so long as this contract may remain in force, as orders are placed by the <em>company, </em>or <em>as </em>transit shipment may be directed by the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-11\">\u201cFourth. Pritchard Bros, agree to forward to the company, at least once a month, a stock list, showing all material on hand, a.nd the quantity thereof, in shipping condition. . '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-12\">\u201cFifth.

Pritchard Bros, agree that if, during the existence of this contract, they acquire any other timber or timber rights, the same shall come within the terms of this contract in all respects, as is provided with reference to the McCullough timber, and, where reference is made in the preceding paragraph to the McCullough timber, it shall be held to include such other acquired timber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-9\">\u201cTwelfth. Pritchard Bros, agree that they, or either of them, will not, during the existence of this contract, produce, or have produced for them, or either -of them, any lumber not contemplated by this contract, or have any interest in any firm or corporation producing such lumber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-10\">\u201cThis agreement is executed to correct and make more definite and certain an agreement executed by the parties hereto on the 1st day of December, 1915, and is executed nunc pro tunc as of that date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">The petition contained allegations to the following effect: The parties to the contract (herein referred to by their designations in the court below) operated thereunder for about two years, until on or about November 12, 1918, when defendants notified plaintiff that they had sold their mills, logging railway, tools, and appliances, and all tracts of timber and timber rights, including the \u201cMcCullough timber\u201d mentioned in contract, and that they would make no more shipments under the contract. Thereafter defendants failed and refused to proceed further under the contract. When the contract was so breached, there remained standing on the \u201cMcCullough tract\u201d in excess of 12,000,000 feet of merchantable timber. Plaintiff has performed all obligations imposed upon him by the contract, and at all times has been able, ready, and willing to continue to perform his obligations thereunder. The defendants demurred to the declaration on grounds including the following: That the contract sued on is void for uncertainty; that the contract sued on is void for want of mutuality; that said alleged contract is void, as being what is termed a will, wish, or want contract, in that it relates only to such lumber, manufactured for or by the defendants out of the McCullough or other timber during the time necessary to cut the -McCullough timber, unless sooner terminated by death, as defendants might not, in the exercise of their own unrestricted will or wish, dispose of to others, to wit, local consumers; that the averments of the declaration do not show any basis for the computation of recoverable damages. The demurrer was sustained. That action of the court is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">By its terms the contract was to remain in force \u201cuntil all of the McCullough timber\u201d on identified land \u201cis cut and converted into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>lumber and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this contract,\u201d and defendants agreed to cut that timber and convert it'into lumber as expeditiously as possible. The contract was not lacking in mutuality, on the ground that the plaintiff did not obligate himself to handle all lumber furnished by defendants during the continuance of the contract. The first numbered clause of the contract is explicit to the effect that the plaintiff so bound himself. The concluding words of that clause, \u201cas hereinafter provided,\u201d relate only to the method of handling, and cannot properly be given the effect of making plaintiff\u2019s obligation less than one to handle all lumber furnished by the defendants; the latter, on their part, obligating themselves to ship on orders furnished by plaintiff, or, in the absence of such orders, to place in transit all lumber manufactured or produced by or for them during the continuance of the contract, except such lumber as they may sell to local consumers. The obligation imposed on the plaintiff by the just mentioned provision was not lessened by anything contained in the third or any other clause of the contract. The exception of \u201csuch lumber as they may sell to local consumers\u201d did not entitle the defendants to withhold, from the plaintiff any lumber produced by or for them, except what they actually sold to Ideal consumers. The extent to which that provision relieved the defendants of their obligation to furnish lumber to the plaintiff was capable of being shown by evidence. In the absence of allegation or proof on the subject, it is not to be presumed that all the lumber that would have been produced by or for the defendants, if they had continued performance, would or could have been actually sold by them, not to dealers, but to consumers in the locality of the place or places of production:</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The language of the contract sufficiently shows that an effect of it was to make the plaintiff a lumber selling agent for the defendants; the word \u201chandle\u201d being used in such connection as to indicate that it referred to the activities of such an agent. In the absence of any stipulation as to prices the plaintiff was obligated to sell at prices obtainable by the exercise of good faith and reasonable diligence. On no ground urged was the contract lacking in requisite certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The averments of the petition sufficiently show that at the time it was filed plaintiff had sustained recoverable damages in consequence qf the alleged breach of the' contract by the defendants. The demurrer was not effective to evoke a,decision as to the amount of damages recoverable by the plaintiff. We conclude that the above-mentioned ruling was erroneous. Because of that error the judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
