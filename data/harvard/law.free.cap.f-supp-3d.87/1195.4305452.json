(\u201cMTD\u201d), ECF No. 75. Having considered the parties\u2019 submissions, the relevant law, and the record in this case, the Court GRANTS Defendants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-15\">This is a consolidated class action brought by former employees alleging antitrust claims against their former employers, various animation studios with principal places of business in California.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs contend that Defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix and suppress employee compensation and to restrict employee mobility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-16\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-17\">The Court draws the following factual background from the uncontroverted allegations in the Consolidated Amended Complaint (\u201cCAC\u201d), and from judicially noticed documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unless otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>noted, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are presumed to be true for purposes of ruling on Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">1. The Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Defendants include the following animation and visual effects studios: Blue Sky Studios, Inc. (\u201cBlue Sky\u201d), a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Greenwich, CT; DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. (\u201cDreamWorks\u201d), a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Glendale, CA; Ima-geMovers LLC, a California corporation with its principal place of business in Los Angeles, CA; ImageMovers Digital LLC, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Burbank, CA; Lucas-film Ltd., LLC (\u201cLucasfilm\u201d), a California corporation with its principal place of business in San Francisco, CA;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pixar, a California corporation with its principal place of business in Emeryville, CA;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sony Pictures Animation, Inc. and Sony Pictures Imageworks, Inc. (collectively, \u201cthe Sony Defendants\u201d), California corporations with their principal places of business in Culver City, CA; and The Walt Disney Company (\u201cDisney\u201d) is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Burbank, CA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> CAC \u00b6\u00b6 21-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-7\">Plaintiffs Robert A. Nitsch, Jr., Georgia Cano, and David Wentworth (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), are artists and engineers that were previously employed by four of the named Defendants. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-20. Nitsch worked for Sony Picture Imageworks in 2004 and DreamWorks from 2007 to 2011. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 18. Cano worked for Walt Disney Feature Animation from 2004 to 2005, Im-ageMovers Digital in 2010, and at various other visual effects and animation studios. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 19. Wentworth worked at ImageM-overs Digital from 2007 to 2010. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 20. Nitsch is a resident of Massachusetts, and Cano and Wentworth are residents of California. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-12\">Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-13\">All persons who worked at any time from 2004 to the present for Pixar, Lu-casfilm, DreamWorks Animation, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Walt Disney Feature Animation, Blue Sky Studios, Digital Domain, ImageMovers Digital, Sony Pictures Animation or Sony Pictures Imageworks in the United States. Excluded from the Class are officers, directors, senior executives and personnel in the human resources and recruiting departments of the Defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-14\"><em>Id. </em>\u00b6 113.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-15\">2. <em>In re High-Tech Employees Litigation </em>and the Department of Justice Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-16\">There is significant factual overlap between Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations and the related action <em>In re High-Tech Employees Litigation, </em>No. 11-CV-02509-LHK, as well as the civil complaints filed by the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) against several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>Silicon Valley technology companies, Pixar, and Lucasf\u00edlm. As both the factual and procedural history of the related action, <em>In re Highr-Tech, </em>and the DOJ investigations and complaints are relevant to the substance of Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the Court briefly summarizes the background of that litigation below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">From 2009 to 2010, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ investigated the employment and recruitment practices of various Silicon Valley technology companies, including Adobe Systems, Inc., Apple, Inc., Google, Inc., Intel Corp., and Intuit, Inc. <em>See In re High-Tech Employees Litig., </em>856 F.Supp.2d 1103, 1109 (N.D.Cal.2012). In September of 2010, the DOJ then filed civil complaints against the above-mentioned technology companies, in addition to Pixar and Lucasf\u00edlm. <em>Id. </em>The DOJ filed its complaint against Adobe, Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, and Pixar on September 24, 2010. <em>Id. </em>On December 21, 2010, the DOJ filed another complaint against Lu-casfilm and Pixar. CAC \u00b6 94. The defendants, including Pixar and Lucasf\u00edlm, stipulated to proposed final judgments in which they agreed that the DOJ\u2019s complaints had stated claims under federal antitrust law and agreed, to be \u201cenjoined from attempting to enter into, maintaining or enforcing any agreement with any other person or in any way refrain from ... soliciting, cold calling, recruiting, or otherwise competing for employees of the other person. 856 F.Supp.2d at 1109-10. (quoting Adobe Proposed Final Judgment at 5). The D.C. District Court entered the stipu-' lated proposed final judgments in March and June of 2011. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">The <em>Highr-Tech </em>plaintiffs filed five separate state court actions between May and July of 2011. Following removal, transfer to San Jose to the undersigned judge, and consolidation, the <em>High-Tech </em>plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on September 13, 2011. <em>Id. </em>at 1113. In their complaint, the <em>High-Tech </em>plaintiffs alleged antitrust claims against their employers, claiming that the defendants had conspired \u201cto fix and suppress employee compensation and to restrict employee mobility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1108. More specifically, the <em>Highr-Tech </em>plaintiffs alleged a conspiracy comprised of \u201can interconnected web of express bilateral agreements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1110. One agreement, the \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreement involved one company placing the names of the other company\u2019s employees on a \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d list and instructing its recruiters not to cold call the employees of the other company. <em>Id. </em>In addition to the \u201cDo Not Cold Call\u201d agreements, the <em>Highr-Tech </em>plaintiffs also alleged, that Pixar and Lucasf\u00edlm, defendants in both <em>Highr-Tech </em>and the instant action, entered into express, written agreements to (1) not cold call each other\u2019s employees, (2) to notify the other company whenever making an offer to an employee of the other company, and (3) not to engage in \u201cbidding wars.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-7\">3. Alleged Conspiracy in the Instant Action</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">Here, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants conspired to suppress compensation in two ways. First, Defendants allegedly entered into a scheme not to actively solicit each other\u2019s employees. CAC \u00b6 41. Second, Defendants allegedly engaged in \u201ccollusive discussions concerning competitively sensitive compensation information and agreed upon compensation ranges,\u201d which would artificially limit compensation offered to Defendants\u2019 current and prospective employees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">a. Anti-Solicitation Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-10\">According to Plaintiffs, \u201cDefendants agreed not to contact their coconspirators\u2019 employees to inform them of available positions unless that individual employee had applied for a job opening on his or her own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>initiative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 42. This solicitation,' also known as \u201ccold calling,\u201d is \u201ca key competitive tool in a properly functioning labor market, especially for skilled labor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 42. Plaintiffs aver that employees of competitor studios represent \u201cone of the main pools of potential hires,\u201d and that employees of competitor studios that are not actively searching for new employment are \u201cmore likely to be among the most sought after employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 43. Hiring an employee from a competitor studio \u201ccan save costs and avoid risks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Absent active solicitation, these employees are also difficult to reach. <em>Id. </em>Defendants\u2019 anti-solicitation scheme also allegedly included \u201cnotifying each other when an employee of one Defendant applied for a position with another Defendant, and agreeing to limit counteroffers in such situations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 44. Moreover, Defendants allegedly \u201coften refrained from hiring other Defendants\u2019 employees at all without the permission of the current employer,\u201d and would sometimes decline to make offers of employment to an unemployed prospective hire if that individual had an outstanding offer from another Defendant. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\"><em>Pixar and Lucasfilm: </em>According to Plaintiffs, \u201cthe roots of the conspiracy reach back to the mid-1980s,\u201d when George Lucas, the former Lucasfilm Chairman of the Board and CEO, sold Lucasfilm\u2019s \u201ccomputer division\u201d to Steve Jobs, who had recently left Apple. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 46. Jobs named his new company Pixar. <em>Id. </em>Pixar\u2019s President, Ed Catmull, Lucas, and \u201cother senior executives, subsequently reached an agreement to restrain their competition for the skilled labor that worked for the two companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pixar drafted the terms of the agreement, which both Defendants communicated to their senior executives and \u201cselect human resources and recruiting employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Lucas stated in an email that Pixar and Lucasfilm \u201chave agreed that we want to avoid bidding wars,\u201d and that the agreement prevented the two companies from \u201craiding] each other\u2019s companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Pixar and Lucasfilm allegedly agreed to the following terms: (1) not to cold call each other\u2019s employees; (2) to notify each other when making an offer to the other company\u2019s employee; and (3) that any offer by the other company would be \u201cfinal,\u201d i.e., neither Pixar nor Lucasfilm would engage in counteroffers. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46-48 (citing internal Pixar email sent on January 16, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-7\">Plaintiffs further allege that while the conspiracy originated with Pixar and Lu-casfilm, Catmull brought additional studios into the fold. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 49. In a 2005 email, then Vice President of Human Resources at Pixar, Lori McAdams, wrote \u201cWith regard to ILM, Sony, Blue Sky, etc., we have no contractual obligations, but we have a gentleman\u2019s agreement not to directly solicit/poach from their employee pool.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 50. Pixar also drafted an internal \u201ccompetitors list\u201d that \u201clisted anti-solicitation rules for each of the Defendants .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>According to Plaintiffs, Blue Sky, DreamWorks, ImageMovers Digital, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and Walt Disney Animation Studios were \u201call listed with directions not to \u2018recruit directly\u2019 or \u2018solicit or poach employees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as to each Defendants\u2019 alleged role and participation in the anti-solicitation scheme is detailed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\"><em>DreamWorks: </em>Jobs and DreamWorks CEO, Jeffrey Katzenberg, \u201cpersonally discussed DreamWorks joining into the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 52. In a February 18, 2004 email from Catmull to Jobs, Catmull stated that the mutual agreement \u201cworked quite well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A January 14, 2007 email from Catmull to Disney\u2019s Chairman Dick Cook, also provided that \u201cwe have an agreement with Dreamworks not to actively pursue each other\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>further emails between Catmull, Mc-Adams, and DreamWorks\u2019 head of human resources, Kathy Mandato, Pixar and DreamWorks reiterated their \u201cnon-poaching practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 53. When a Pixar recruiting email was sent to a Dream-Works employee, Mandato reached out to McAdams, and McAdams responded that she\u2019d \u201cput a stop to it!\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\"><em>Disney: </em>A 2005 Pixar email \u201cconfirmed that Pixar would not recruit workers out of Disney or other studios.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 56. In 2006, Disney purchased Pixar, and Catmull assumed responsibility for Walt Disney Animation Studios. <em>Id. </em>In communications between Disney Chairman Cook and Cat-mull, Cook agreed that \u201cavoiding] raiding each other\u201d was necessary to avoid \u201cseriously mess[ing] up the pay structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Cook allegedly promised to \u201creaffirm our position again\u201d with ImageMovers Digital, which Plaintiffs contend is a joint venture Disney launched with ImageMovers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In 2006, Disney\u2019s Director of Animation Resources apparently asked ILM, a division of Lucasfilm, to \u201cobserve \u2018the Gentlewomen\u2019s agreement\u2019 \u201d that ILM not recruit Disney digital artists. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\"><em>Sony Defendants: </em>Beginning in 2002, Sony Pictures Imageworks expanded significantly by offering higher salaries to lure workers away from other studios. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 58. In response, Catmull allegedly met with Sony executives in person in 2004 or 2005 to \u201cask[] them to quit calling our employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 59. Plaintiffs allege that Catmull reached an agreement with Sony at that time that the companies would not directly solicit or poach from each other. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Sony allegedly then began to \u201crestrain its relatively higher-wage practices to levels below what would otherwise have existed in a competitive market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\"><em>Blue Sky Studios: </em>Plaintiffs aver that Blue Sky \u201csimilarly entered the conspiracy,\u201d did not recruit from other studios, and requested that other studios not recruit from Blue Sky. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 63. In 2005, Blue Sky allegedly declined to pursue a Dream-Works employee that would have been \u201can amazing addition,\u201d because Blue Sky did not \u201cwant to be starting anything with [Katzenberg, the DreamWorks CEO] over one story guy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Blue Sky\u2019s Director of Human Resources, Linda Zazza, also allegedly spoke with Pixar\u2019s McAdams to discuss \u201cour sensitive issue of employee retention,\u201d and McAdams assured Blue Sky that Pixar was not attempting to poach Blue- Sky employees. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\"><em>ImageMovers </em>Defendants:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Ima-geMovers Defendants allegedly also joined the conspiracy. Catmull wrote in a January 2007 email to Disney Chairman Cook that Catmull knew ImageMovers would \u201cnot target Pixar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 65. Plaintiffs allege, however, that ImageMovers continued to recruit from other conspiring studios, including DreamWorks, by \u201coffering higher salaries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 66. Catmull then met with one of the founders of ImageM-overs, Steve Starkey. Starkey allegedly told Catmull that ImageMovers had in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>formed Lucas that ImageMovers would \u201cnot raid ILM.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 67. Catmull then contacted Disney Studio\u2019s President, Alan Bergman, and Senior Vice President of Human Resources, Marjorie Randolph, requesting that they require the ImageM-overs Defendants to comply with the anti-solicitation scheme. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 68. According to Plaintiffs, Randolph \u201cresponded that Disney had in fact gotten the ImageM-overs Defendants to agree to the \u2018rules\u2019 of the anti-solicitation scheme.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\"><em>Digital </em>Domain<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>: Digital Doman allegedly joined the conspiracy and had anti-solicitation agreements with \u201cat least\u201d DreamWorks, Lucasf\u00edlm/ILM and the Sony Defendants. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 69. According to Plaintiffs, starting in 2007, Digital Domain\u2019s Head of Human Resources was Lala Gavgavian, who had previously worked at Lucasf\u00edlm\u2019s ILM division \u201cin senior roles in talent acquisition ... during which time Pixar President Jim Morris explicitly informed her that Pixar and Lu-casf\u00edlm\u201d had an anti-solicitation/no-poaching agreement. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 70. Gavgavian and other senior personnel at Digital Domain allegedly \u201cspecifically instructed employees not to cold call or otherwise solicit other Defendants\u2019 employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">As to all Defendants, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants \u201crepeatedly sought to recruit\u201d new studios into the scheme, including a small studio in 2008. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 72.</p>\n<p id=\"Aee-\">b. Compensation Ranges</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">In addition to the anti-solicitation scheme, Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants \u201cdirectly communicated and met regularly to discuss and agree upon compensation ranges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 74. According to Plaintiffs, Defendants met at least once a year in California at meetings organized by the Croner Company, a third-party that apparently collects industry-specific salary information. At the official meetings, the Defendants \u201cset the parameters of a compensation survey\u201d that \u201cprovides wage and salary ranges for the studios\u2019 technical or artistic positions, broken down by position and experience level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 75. Senior human resources and recruiting personnel from DreamWorks, Pixar, Lucasfilm/ILM, Disney, ImageMovers Digital, the Sony Defendants, Blue Sky, and Digital Domain attended these survey meetings, in addition to other studios. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 76. Plaintiffs aver that Defendants used the Croner meetings to \u201cgo further than their matching of job positions across companies; they discussed, agreed upon and set wage and salary ranges during meals, drinks and other social gatherings that they held outside of the official Croner meetings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 77. Defendants\u2019 human resources and recruiting personnel also allegedly held \u201cside\u201d meetings at the Siggraph conference, a major visual effects industry conference, which senior personnel from Blue Sky, Pixar, DreamWorks, Lucasfilm, and Sony Picture ImageWorks attended. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-11\">Defendants\u2019 Directors of Human Resources also allegedly \u201cfrequently sought to create new relationships when one of their counterparts was replaced at a co-conspirator to ensure the efficacy of communications about the conspiracy,\u201d and met with each other one-on-one \u201con many occasions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-80. Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants regularly mailed each other with specific salary ranges. On May 13, 2005, DreamWorks requested that Disney provide salary information on three positions, and Disney promptly responded. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 81. The fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>lowing spring, DreamWorks also requested similar information from Pixar and Disney, and \u201cmade clear it was surveying multiple studios.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 82. On September 2, 2009, Blue Sky\u2019s Director of Human Resources requested salary range information from Pixar. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 83. In a 2007 email, DreamWorks\u2019 Head of Compensation explained that \u201cwe do sometimes share general camp information (ranges, practices) in order to maintain the relationships with other studios and to be able to ask for that kind of information ourselves when we need it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">According to Plaintiffs, Defendants\u2019 communications regarding salary ranges were not limited to bilateral \u201cone off\u2019 exchanges, but rather Defendants would \u201copenly email[ ] each other in large groups with competitively sensitive confidential current and future compensation information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 85. On November 17, 2006, Pixar\u2019s McAdams mailed senior human resources personnel at DreamWorks, Sony Pictures Imageworks, Lucas Film, Walt Disney Animation Studios, and others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALr\">Quick question from me, for those of you who can share the info.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1244-5\">What is your salary increase budget for FY '07? Ours is [REDACTED] but we may manage it to closer to [REDACTED] on average. Are you doing anything close, more, or less?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1244-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00b6 86. In January 2009, DreamWorks\u2019 Head of Production Technology mailed the heads of human resources at Pixar, ILM, Sony Pictures Animation, and Disney to \u201clearn how they handled overtime.\u201d More specifically, DreamWorks wanted to \u201csee if the other companies were \u2018as generous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-7\">Defendants\u2019 human resources and recruiting personnel also allegedly regularly communicated via telephone. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 89. Plaintiffs quote emails from Pixar\u2019s Mc-Adams to Sony Pictures Imageworks, ILM, DreamWorks, Disney, and Blue Sky \u201cin early 2007\u201d stating \u201c[c]hatting with all of you each day is really becoming a fun habit,\u201d and an email response from Walt Disney Animation Studios Vice President of Human Resources also commenting that \u201c[i]t is fun to hear from you all on a daily basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-9\">As Plaintiffs describe it, the Croner survey meetings, side meetings, emails, and telephone calls \u201cprovided the means and opportunities for Defendants to collude and to implement and enforce the conspiracy to suppress workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 91. Plaintiffs further allege that while press reports in 2009 noted that the DOJ was investigating anti-solicitation agreements among high-tech companies, including Google and Apple, there was no indication that the DOJ was also investigating Pixar, Lucasfilm, or any other animation company. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 95. Plaintiffs aver that September 17, 2010 marked the first news story naming Pixar as a company under investigation, but that there was no public disclosure that any other Defendant in the instant action was part of the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>According to Plaintiffs, Lu-casfilm was implicated in the Pixar investigation in December 2010, but until the Court unsealed certain filings in the <em>Highr-Tech </em>case, there was no public information that the other Defendants in this action had engaged in similar conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\">4. Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC contains three claims for relief under the following statutes: (1) Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1; (2) California\u2019s Cartwright Act, Cal.

Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">In light of the relationship between the instant case and the <em>Highr-Tech </em>case, the Court briefly summarizes the relevant procedural history in <em>High-Tech </em>in addition to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-6\">1. <em>High-Tech </em>Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">The <em>High-Tech </em>defendants removed the first state-court action on May 23, 2011. No. 112509, ECF No. 1. On April 18, 2012, the Court granted in part and denied in part the <em>High-Tech </em>defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss and denied Lucasfilm\u2019s motion to dismiss. No. 11-2509, ECF No. 119. On April 5, 2013, the Court granted in part and denied in part the <em>Highr-Tech </em>plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification with leave to amend. No. 11-2509, ECF No. 382. The Court granted the <em>Highr-Tech </em>plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental motion for class certification on October 24, 2013. No. 112509, ECF No. 531. On November 13, 2013, the <em>Highr-Tech </em>defendants filed a Rule 23(f) petition before the Ninth Circuit, requesting permission to appeal this Court\u2019s October 24, 2013 class certification order. No. 13-80223, ECF No. 1. The Ninth Circuit denied the defendants\u2019 petition on January 14, 2014. No. 13-80223, ECF No. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">In the interim, three of the <em>High-Tech </em>defendants, Intuit, Lucasfilm, and Pixar, reached an early settlement with the plaintiffs. On September 21, 2013, the <em>Highr-Tech </em>plaintiffs' filed a motion for preliminary approval of a proposed class action settlement as to defendants Intuit, Lucas-film, and Pixar. No. 11-2509, ECF No. 501. On October 30, 2013, the Court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement with Intuit, Lucasfilm, and Pixar. No. 11-2509, ECF No. 540. The Court granted final approval as to that settlement on May 16, 2014. No. 11-2509, ECF No. 915. The Court entered a final judgment with regards to Lucasfilm, Pixar, and Intuit on June 9, 2014. No. 11-2509, ECF No. 936. At the request of Intuit, the Court entered an amended final judgment on June 20, 2014. No. 11-2509, ECF No. 947.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-10\">The remaining <em>Highr-Tech </em>defendants, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel, filed individual motions for summary judgment, and joint motions for summary judgment and to strike certain expert testimony on January 9, 2014. No. 11-2509, ECF Nos. 554 (Intel), 556-57 (joint motions), 560 (Adobe), 561 (Apple), 564 (Google). The Court denied the <em>High-Tech </em>defendants\u2019 individual motions for summary judgment on March 28, 2014. No. 11-2509, ECF No. 771. On April 4, 2014, the Court granted in part and denied in part the <em>High-Tech </em>defendants\u2019 motion to strike, and denied the defendants\u2019 joint motion for summary judgment. No. 11-2509, ECF No. 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-11\">On May 22, 2014, the <em>High-Tech </em>plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement as to the remaining defendants. No.Tl-2509, ECF No. 920. On August 8, 2014, the Court denied the <em>High-Tech </em>plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary approval, concluding that the proposed settlement did not fall \u201cwithin the range of reasonableness.\u201d No. 11-2509, ECF No. 974, at 30. On September 4, 2014, the <em>Highr-Tech </em>defendants filed a petition for a writ of mandamus with the Ninth Circuit. No. 14-72745, ECF No. 1. On January 13, 2015, the <em>High-Tech </em>defendants filed correspondence with the Ninth Circuit referring to a new proposed settlement agreement. No. 14-72745, ECF No. 21. On January 30, 2015, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to dismiss the petition, which the Ninth Circuit granted on February 2, 2015. No. 14-72745, ECF Nos. 23, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-12\">On January 15, 2015, the <em>High-Tech </em>plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>approval of class action settlement as to the remaining defendants. No. 11-2509, ECF No. 1032. In this second proposed class action settlement, the parties had reached a settlement amount exceeding the previously rejected settlement by approximately $90.5 million dollars. <em>Id. </em>at 1. Following a fairness hearing on March 2, 2015, the Court granted preliminary approval to the January 2015 settlement agreement on March 3, 2015. No. 11-1509, ECF Nos. 1051, 1054. A final approval hearing is scheduled for July 9, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">2. Procedural Background in the Instant Action</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">Plaintiff Nitsch filed the first complaint against all Defendants but Blue Sky on September 8, 2014. ECF No. 1. The Court related Nitsch\u2019s action to <em>In re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, </em>No. 11-2509, on September 23, 2014. Plaintiff Cano filed the second complaint against all Defendants on September 17, 2014, which the Court related to <em>High-Tech </em>on October 7, 2014. <em>See </em>Case No. 14-4203, ECF Nos. 1, 9. Plaintiff Went-worth filed the third complaint against all Defendants but Blue Sky on October 2, 2014, which the Court related to' <em>High-Tech </em>on October 28, 2014. <em>See </em>Case No. 14-4422, ECF Nos. 1, 26. On November 5, 2014, the Court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to consolidate the above-mentioned three cases into a single action, <em>In re Animation Workers Antitrust Litigation. See </em>Case No. 14-4062, ECF No. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">Pursuant to the Court\u2019s case management order, Plaintiffs filed their CAC on December 2, 2014. ECF No. 63. On January 9, 2015, Defendants filed the instant joint motion to dismiss, and a request for judicial notice. ECF Nos. 75, 76. Defendants also filed an administrative motion to seal exhibits in support of their motion to dismiss. ECF No. 79. Plaintiffs filed a timely opposition, ECF No. 97, and Defendants replied, ECF No. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">Also pending before the Court is Defendants\u2019 January 9, 2015, motion to compel arbitration. ECF No. 71. As that motion is set for hearing on April 23, 2015, the Court does not address that motion in the instant order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">II. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-10\">A. Rule 12(b)(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-11\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Such a motion tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint. <em>Navarro v. Block, </em>250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir.2001). In considering whether the complaint is sufficient, the Court must accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. However, the Court need not accept as true \u201callegations that contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit\u201d or \u201callegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.\u201d <em>In re Gilead Scis. Secs. Litig., </em>536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). While a complaint need not allege detailed factual allegations, it \u201cmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a \u2018probability requirement,\u2019 but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has act<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>ed unlawfully.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">B. Rule 9(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">Claims sounding in fraud or mistake are subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which require that a plaintiff alleging fraud \u201cmust state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); <em>see Kearns v. Ford Motor Co., </em>567 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir.2009). To satisfy the heightened standard under Rule 9(b), the allegations must be \u201cspecific enough to give defendants notice of the particular misconduct which is alleged to constitute the fraud charged so that they can defend against the charge and not just deny that they have done anything wrong.\u201d <em>Semegen v. Weidner, </em>780 F.2d 727, 731 (9th Cir.1985). Thus, claims sounding in fraud must allege \u201can account of the time, place, and specific content of the false representations as well as the identities of the parties to the misrepresentations.\u201d <em>Swartz v. KPMG LLP, </em>476 F.3d 756, 764 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A plaintiff must set forth what is false or misleading about a statement, and why it is false.\u201d <em>In re GlenFed, Inc. Secs. Litig., </em>42 F.3d 1541, 1548 (9th Cir.1994) (en banc), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in Marksman Partners, L.P. v. Chantal Pharm. Corp., </em>927 F.Supp. 1297, 1309 (C.D.Cal.1996). However, \u201cintent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person\u2019s mind\u201d need not be stated with particularity, and \u201cmay be alleged generally.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">C. Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">If the court concludes that the complaint should be dismissed, it must then decide whether to grant leave to amend. Under Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires,\u201d bearing in mind \u201cthe underlying purpose of Rule 15 ... [is] to facilitate decision on the merits, rather than on the pleadings or technicalities.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Nonetheless, a district court may deny leave to amend a complaint due to \u201cundue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [and] futility of amendment.\u201d <em>See Leadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music Publ\u2019g, </em>512 F.3d 522, 532 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">Defendants move to dismiss on the following grounds: that (1) Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are barred under the relevant statutes of limitations; (2) Plaintiffs fail to sufficiently allege a <em>per se </em>antitrust claim based on wage-fixing agreements; (3) Plaintiffs fail to state plausible claims against Blue Sky, the Sony Defendants, and the ImageM-overs Defendants; (4) Plaintiffs\u2019 requested remedies are not unavailable under the UCL; and (5) Plaintiffs lack standing to seek injunctive relief. The Court begins by addressing whether Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-12\">A. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-13\">In the instant case, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are time barred. The parties agree that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are subject to a four year statute of limitations. The parties dispute when Plaintiffs\u2019 claims accrued, whether Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a continuing violation, and whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged fraudulent concealment so as to toll the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>As a threshold matter, the Court agrees that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Sherman Act, Cartwright Act, and UCL are all subject to a four year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b (Sherman Act); Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 16750.1 (Cartwright Act); Cal. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Prof. Code \u00a7 17208(UCL). The statute of limitations provision in the Sherman Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUgP\">Any action to enforce any cause of action under section 15, 15a, or 15c of this title shall be forever barred unless commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued. No cause of action barred under existing law on the effective date of this Act shall be revived by this Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b. The statute of limitations provision under California\u2019s Cartwright Act is functionally identical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-5\">Any civil action to enforce any cause of action for a violation of this chapter shall be commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued. No cause of action barred under existing law on the effective date of the amendment of this section at the 1977-78 Regular Session of the Legislature shall be revived by such amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">Cal. Bus. <em>&amp; </em>Prof. Code \u00a7 16750.1. California\u2019s UCL similarly provides for a four-year statute of limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-7\">Any action to enforce any cause of action pursuant to this chapter shall be commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued. No cause of action barred under existing law on the effective date of this section shall be revived by its enactment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17208(UCL). The Court begins by addressing the accrual rule applicable to Plaintiffs\u2019 Sherman Act claim, which the parties do not dispute would also apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>MTD at 4; Opp. at 10 n.36. The Court then addresses Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">1. Accrual Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-12\">As an initial matter, the parties dispute whether Plaintiffs\u2019 claims accrued at the time of Plaintiffs\u2019 injuries (the \u201cinjury rule\u201d) or at the time that Plaintiffs discovered, or reasonably should have discovered their injuries (the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d). Under controlling Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit authority, Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims began to accrue at the time -of injury.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-13\">Generally, [an antitrust cause] of action accrues and the statute begins to run when a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiff\u2019s business.... This much is plain from the treble-damage statute itself.... [E]aeh time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants a cause of action accrues to him to recover the damages caused by that act and that, as to those damages, the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>limitations runs from the commission of the act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\"><em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., </em>401 U.S. 321, 338, 91 S.Ct. 795, 28 L.Ed.2d 77 (1971); <em>see also </em>P. Areeda and H. Hovencamp, Antitrust Law \u00b6 320a-b. As the Ninth Circuit explained in <em>Beneficial Standard Life Insurance Co. v. Madariaga, </em>851 F.2d 271, 274-75 (9th Cir.1988), \u201cIn [antitrust] actions governed by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b, the plaintiffs knowledge is generally irrelevant to accrual, which is determined according to the date on which injury occurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">While Plaintiffs are correct that some of the authorities Defendants cite are discussing accrual rules in the civil RICO context, the Court concludes that the U.S. Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit have clearly held that claims under the Sherman Act are subject to an injury rule, rather than a discovery rule. For example, although <em>Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp., </em>521 U.S. 179, 117 S.Ct. 1984, 138 L.Ed.2d 373 (1997), addressed accrual rules in the civil RICO context, the <em>Klehr </em>Court explicitly noted that \u201cthe ordinary Clayton Act rule, applicable in private antitrust treble damages actions, [is where] a cause of action accrues and the statute begins to run when a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiffs business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 117 S.Ct. 1984. The <em>Klehr </em>Court explicitly distinguished the \u201cpure injury accrual rule ... [as] it applies in traditional antitrust cases,\u201d from the possible discovery accrual rules in the civil RICO context. <em>See id.; see also id. </em>at 191, 117 S.Ct. 1984 (\u201cThe use of a discovery rule may reflect the fact that a high percentage of civil RICO cases, unlike typical antitrust cases, involve fraud claims.\u201d). If there were any remaining doubts, Justice Scalia\u2019s concurrence in <em>Klehr </em>explicitly listed the potential accrual rules to be applied in RICO cases: \u201clast predicate act, injury discovery, and injury and pattern discovery ... [and] the fourth accrual rule \u2014 the Clayton Act \u2018injury1 rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197 n. 1, 117 S.Ct. 1984 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">Plaintiffs also take issue with Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Hexcel Corp. v. Ineos Polymers, Inc., </em>681 F.3d 1055 (9th Cir.2012). Plaintiffs contend that the Ninth Circuit did not apply an injury rule, but rather addressed whether the plaintiff had sufficient actual or constructive knowledge of its injuries so as to defeat its fraudulent concealment claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1060-61. What Plaintiffs fail to recognize, however, is that the Ninth Circuit began with the basic statement of law: \u2018We do not require a plaintiff to actually discover its antitrust claims before the statute of limitations begins to run.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1060 (citing <em>Beneficial Life Ins., </em>851 F.2d at 274-75). Plaintiffs may be correct in a hypertechnical sense that Defendants cite no Ninth Circuit authority explicitly \u201crejecting\u201d the discovery rule for antitrust claims, but that appears to be a function of the fact that the Ninth Circuit has consistently interpreted 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b as requiring an injury rule since 1950. <em>See Suckow Borax Mines Consol. v. Borax Consol., </em>185 F.2d 196, 208 (9th Cir.1950) (cited approvingly in <em>Zenith, </em>401 U.S. at 338, 91 S.Ct. 795). Simply put, both the Ninth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court have long assumed as a basic principle of antitrust law that antitrust claims accrue at the time of injury. In light of that established assumption, there has been no need for the Ninth Circuit to explain why a different accrual rule does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the general proposition that \u201cin general, the discovery rule applies to statutes of limitations in federal litigation,\u201d is unavailing. <em>See </em>Opp. at 6 (quoting <em>Mangum v. Action Collection Serv., Inc., </em>575 F.3d 935, 940 (9th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>2009)). In light of explicit, longstanding U.S. Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit authority specifically holding that antitrust claims accrue at the time of injury, the Court declines to rely on general policy justifications for the discovery rule. Moreover, while the Seventh Circuit may have applied the discovery rule to antitrust claims in <em>In re Copper Antitrust Litigation, </em>436 F.3d 782 (7th Cir.2006), this Court is bound by contrary Ninth Circuit authority. Insofar as Plaintiffs contend that the Ninth Circuit has not directly rejected the discovery rule, the Court further concludes that clear U.S. Supreme Court authority and the overwhelming majority of Circuits have explicitly held that antitrust claims are subject to a pure injury rule, not a discovery rule. <em>See Johnson v. Nyack Hosp., </em>86 F.3d 8, 11 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201cAn antitrust cause of action accrues as soon as there is injury to competition.\u201d); <em>Mathews v. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., Inc., </em>260 F.3d 239, 246 n. 8 (3d Cir.2001) (\u201c[Antitrust claims are subject to the less plaintiff-friendly \u2018injury occurrence\u2019 accrual rule\u201d as opposed to \u201ca more lenient \u2018injury discovery\u2019 rule\u201d); <em>Detrick v. Panalpina, Inc., </em>108 F.3d 529, 538 (4th Cir.1997) (agreeing that \u201cunder the antitrust accrual rule, the statute of limitations is triggered by the date of the injury alone\u201d); <em>Bell v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>847 F.2d 1179, 1186 (5th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe general rule in our Circuit is that an antitrust cause of action accrues each time a defendant commits an act that injures plaintiff.\u201d); <em>DXS, Inc. v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., </em>100 F.3d 462, 467 (6th Cir.1996) (holding that \u201c[f]or statute of limitations purposes ... the focus is on the timing of the causes of injury ... \u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Granite Falls Bank v. Henrikson, </em>924 F.2d 150, 153 (8th Cir.1991) (\u201c[AJecrual in antitrust actions depends on the commission of the defendant\u2019s injurious act rather than on the plaintiffs knowledge of that act or the resulting injury .... \u201d), <em>disapproved on other grounds by Rotella v. Wood, </em>528 U.S. 549, 120 S.Ct. 1075, 145 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2000); <em>Robert L. Kroenlein Trust ex rel. Alden v. Kirchhefer, </em>764 F.3d 1268, 1276 (10th Cir.2014) (noting that \u201cthe Clayton Act ... employs the injury-occurrence rule\u201d as opposed to the \u201cthe injury-discovery rule\u201d); <em>Connors v. Hallmark &amp; Son Coal Co., </em>935 F.2d 336, 342 n. 10 (D.C.Cir.1991) (\u201c[I]n the area of antitrust, ... the Supreme Court has held, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that a cause of action accrues at the time of injury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">Plaintiffs also rely on a recent decision from this District, <em>Fenerjian v. Nongshim Co., Ltd., </em>No. 13-CV-04115-WHO, 72 F.Supp.3d 1058, 2014 WL 5685562 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 4, 2014). While the <em>Fenerjian </em>court applied the discovery rule to Sherman Act claims, for the reasons stated above, this Court respectfully disagrees. In <em>Fenerjian, </em>the parties <em>did not dispute </em>that the discovery rule applied to Sherman Act claims, and the <em>Fenerjian </em>court therefore did not have the benefit of briefing on the question. <em>See </em>72 F.Supp.3d at 1077 n. 27, 2015 WL 5685562, at *12 n. 27 (\u201cDefendants do not dispute that the \u2018discovery rule\u2019 or fraudulent concealment are available to toll [the antitrust] statutes of limitation.\u201d). In the instant case, the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust claims began to accrue at the time Plaintiffs suffered their injury, regardless of whether or not Plaintiffs knew of their injury at the time it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">Moreover, the Court also concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim based on Defendants\u2019 alleged anticompetitive conduct also began to accrue at the time Plaintiffs suffered their injury. Plaintiffs assert that the discovery rule applies as a matter of law to their UCL claim under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number><em>Aryeh v. Canon Bus. Solutions, Inc., </em>55 Cal.4th 1185, 1196, 151 Cal.Rptr.3d 827, 292 P.3d 871 (2013). However, the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs mis-characterize the breadth of <em>Aryeh. </em>The <em>Aryeh </em>court held only that the UCL does not categorically <em>forbid </em>the application of the discovery rule under appropriate cir-. cumstances, not that the UCL requires application of the discovery rule to every cause of action.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1196-97, 151 Cal.Rptr.3d 827, 292 P.3d 871. More specifically, the <em>Aryeh </em>court explained that the \u201cUCL is a chameleon,\u201d and that the discovery rule might be appropriate for misrepresentation or fraud claims, but not in unfair competition claims. <em>See id. </em>(citing approvingly <em>M &amp; F Fishing, Inc. v. Sear-Pac Ins. Managers, Inc., </em>202 Cal.App.4th 1509, 1531-32, 136 Cal.Rptr.3d 788 (Ct.App.2012) (nature of UCL unfair competition claim rendered discovery rule inappropriate)). As Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim here is based purely on Defendants\u2019 alleged anticompetitive conduct, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claim is also subject to the injury rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">Here, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims began to accrue as early as 2004-05, when Plaintiff Cano worked for Defendant Disney and Plaintiff Nitsch worked for Sony. <em>See </em>CAC \u00b6\u00b6 19, 49-50, 56-57. At the latest, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims began to accrue in 2007 when Plaintiff Nitsch worked for DreamWorks and Plaintiff Wentworth worked at ImageM-overs Digital. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 20. As a result, the four-year statute of limitations ran on Plaintiffs\u2019 claims as early as 2008, and at. best in 2011. The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are time barred absent sufficient allegations that Defendants engaged in \u201ccontinuing violations\u201d after September 8, 2010, i.e., four years prior to the first-filed complaint in this consolidated action, or that Defendants\u2019 fraudulent concealment should toll the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-8\">2. Continuing Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-9\">Plaintiffs contend that even if the injury rule applies to antitrust claims, Plaintiffs have alleged that Defendants engaged in \u201ccontinuing violations,\u201d that would render Plaintiffs\u2019 claims timely. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Defendants took any \u201covert acts\u201d that would restart the statute of limitations. According to Defendants, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are both insufficient under <em>Twombly </em>and also implausible in light of the 2009 DOJ investigation and 2011 stipulated final judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-10\">Under the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine, \u201ceach overt act that is part of the [antitrust] violation and that injures the plaintiff ... starts the statutory period running again, regardless of the plaintiffs knowledge of the alleged illegality at much earlier times.\u201d <em>Klehr, </em>521 U.S. at 189, 117 S.Ct. 1984 (internal citations and quotations omitted); <em>Pace Indus. v. Three Phoe</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number><em>nix Co., </em>813 F.2d 234, 237 (9th Cir.1987) (\u201cA continuing violation is one in which the plaintiffs interests are repeatedly invaded and a cause of action arises each time the plaintiff is injured.\u201d)- In the Ninth Circuit, an overt act restarts the statute of limitations if it: (1) is \u201ca new and independent act that is not merely a reaffirmation of a previous act\u201d; and (2) \u201cinflict[s] new and accumulating injury on the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Pace, </em>813 F.2d at 237; <em>see also Samsung Elecs. Co., Ltd. v. Panasonic Corp., </em>747 F.3d 1199, 1202-03 (9th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Here, the Court concludes that the bald assertion that \u201cDefendants repeatedly invaded Plaintiffs\u2019 ... interests,\u201d is insufficient to show a continuing violation. <em>See </em>CAC \u00b6 123. Plaintiffs allege that \u201cDefendants\u2019 conspiracy was a continuing violation in which Defendants repeatedly invaded Plaintiffs\u2019 and class members\u2019 interest by adhering to, enforcing and reaffirming the anticompetitive agreements described herein.\u201d CAC \u00b6 123. A review of the specific factual allegations in Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC, however, reveals no alleged wrongful communications or specific conduct during the limitations period. The Court observes the rather conspicuous absence of specific dates for many of Plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations, but those allegations that do contain specific dates all predate 2009, with the vast majority occurring between 2004 and 2007. <em>See </em>CAC \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, 12-14, 48, 50, 52-73, 78, 82, 84-86, 90 (2004-2007 communications and conduct); <em>id. </em>\u00b6 83 (September 2, 2009 email); <em>id. </em>\u00b6 88 (January 2009 email). Plaintiffs do not allege that any Defendant abided by, attempted to enforce, or otherwise \u201creaffirmed\u201d the anti-solicitation scheme or salary range setting on or after September 8, 2010, i.e., four years prior to the first-filed complaint in this consolidated action. There are no allegations of any new or independent actions taken by the Defendants after September 8, 2010 that caused Plaintiffs any new or accumulating injury. <em>See Pace, </em>813 F.2d at 237. Plaintiffs fail to allege any new or accumulating injuries within the limitation period. The remainder of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in the \u201cStatute of Limitations\u201d portion of the CAC focus on Plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent concealment claim. <em>See </em>CAC \u00b6\u00b6 124-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">In opposition, Plaintiffs appear to concede that the CAC lacks factual allegations that Defendants engaged in any new and independent wrongful conduct after September 8, 2010, but instead rely on a price-fixing analogy. <em>See </em>Opp. at 20-21. Plaintiffs put forward the novel theory that because they entered into employment agreements with Defendants during the alleged conspiracy, and because Plaintiffs received artificially depressed compensation as a result, Plaintiffs suffered antitrust injury each time they received \u201cprice-fixed\u201d compensation. As Plaintiff Nitsch worked for DreamWorks through 2011, Plaintiffs\u2019 theory is that Nitsch continued to be injured through 2011. According to Plaintiffs, their injuries are no different than consumers who suffer antitrust injury when purchasing artificially higher priced goods as a result of a price-fixing conspiracy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">However, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cprice-fixed compensation\u201d theory, as put forth in Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition, satisfies the \u201covert act\u201d requirement. As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs need to do more than merely allege a continuing violation \u2014 they must also allege an overt act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-8\">A continuing violation is one in which the plaintiffs interests are repeatedly invaded and a cause of action arises each time the plaintiff is injured. <em>However, even when a plaintiff alleges a continuing violation, an overt act by the defendant is required </em>to restart the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>limitations and the statute runs from the last overt act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\"><em>Pace, </em>813 F.2d at 237 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs\u2019 bare allegation that their interests were \u201crepeatedly invaded\u201d is therefore insufficient as a matter of law. Rather, Plaintiffs must plead that Defendants engaged in an overt act, e.g., that Defendants engaged in a \u201cnew and independent act that is not merely a reaffirmation of a previous act,\u201d which \u201cinflict[ed] new and accumulating injury\u201d on Plaintiffs. <em>Id: </em>at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">Here, even assuming that Plaintiffs \u201cprice-fixed\u201d compensation theory is viable, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege that Defendants took any overt act that would restart the statute of limitations. Plaintiffs do not allege that their compensation was permanently depressed or otherwise continued to be affected by Defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct, which allegedly took place from 2004 to, at best, 2009. In other words, while Plaintiffs may have sufficiently pled facts showing Defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct from 2004 to 2009 prevented employees from receiving higher pay during that period of time, Plaintiffs have not pled any facts showing that Defendants continued to engage in the wrongful conduct which would have resulted in \u201cartificially depressed compensation\u201d on or after September 8, 2010. While Plaintiffs are correct that the Court generally takes as true factual allegations made in the complaint, <em>see Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, Plaintiffs have failed to allege any facts showing that their compensation was at &amp;11 impacted at any point after September 8, 2010. This is unsurprising in light of Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to allege any wrongful conduct post-2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">To be clear, the Court does not rely on Defendants\u2019 arguments regarding the plausibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations. For instance, Defendants\u2019 reliance on the fact that the DOJ chose not to bring complaints against certain Defendants is irrelevant on a motion to dismiss, as that goes to the weight and veracity of Plaintiffs\u2019 factual' allegations. <em>See Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. Nor does the fact that an expert in <em>High-Tech </em>assumed that the anti-solicitation agreements at issue in that litigation stopped affecting wages in 2010 affect the adequacy of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in the instant case. <em>See </em>MTD at 8 n.6. Whether or not Defendants continued to engage in anticompetitive behavior in the four year period preceding the filing of the first complaint in this action is a factual question that the Court does not resolve on a motion to dismiss. Rather, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to state any such allegations in the first instance. In opposition, Plaintiffs rely on a single paragraph in the CAC, where Plaintiffs allege: \u201cNor did DreamWorks make any changes to its practices in the wake of the entrance of the Lucasfilm consent decree in 2011 that might have alerted its workers to the company\u2019s prior misconduct.\u201d CAC \u00b6 129. Even construing this allegation broadly, the Court concludes this allegation has nothing to do with whether DreamWorks, or any other Defendant, continued to engage in anticom-petitive behavior within the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-10\">Furthermore, Plaintiffs cite <em>Oliver v. SD-3C LLC, </em>751 F.3d 1081, 1086-87 (9th Cir.2014), in support of their price-fixing analogy, but that case is distinguishable. As <em>Oliver </em>relied on the factual background of the related case <em>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. v. Panasonic Corp., </em>747 F.3d at 1201-02, the Court also relies on <em>Samsung. </em>In both <em>Oliver </em>and <em>Samsung, </em>the price-fixing conspiracy involved a group of defendants that had adopted two license agreements, in 2003 and 2006, which im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>posed royalties on non-group member manufacturers of flash memory storage cards (\u201cSD cards\u201d). <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, in late 2006, the defendants attempted to enforce the royalty term on the plaintiff, a non-group member. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Samsung, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that the defendants\u2019 2006 amended license agreement and the defendants\u2019 subsequent efforts to enforce the royalty agreement against the plaintiff constituted overt acts that restarted the statute of limitations, notwithstanding the fact that the alleged conspiracy began in 2003. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Oliver, </em>consumers of the SD cards sued the <em>Samsung </em>defendants, alleging, among other theories, a price-fixing conspiracy. 751 F.3d at 1086. The <em>Oliver </em>plaintiffs alleged that they purchased SD cards within four years of filing their complaint and that they had been injured by the unlawfully high priced sales at the time of purchase.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1086-87. Applying <em>Klehr, </em>the Ninth Circuit concluded that the <em>Oliver </em>plaintiffs had alleged both a continuing violation and an overt act within the limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 1086-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">Here, in contrast, there is no allegation that Defendants continued to compensate Plaintiffs at an artificially depressed rate.. Unlike in <em>Samsung </em>and <em>Oliver, </em>where the defendants had continued to enforce the allegedly anticompetitive agreement such that prices continued to be artificially high, the CAC is bereft of any allegations that Defendants continued to.abide by or enforce the anti-solicitation scheme or salary ranges such that compensation continued to be artificially low. The continuing violations doctrine requires <em>both </em>continuing invasions of a plaintiffs interests <em>and </em>an overt act by the defendant. \u201cAny other holding would destroy the function of the statute, since parties may continue indefinitely to receive some benefit as a result of an illegal act performed in the distant past.\u201d <em>Aurora Enterprises v. National Broadcasting Co., </em>688 F.2d 689, 694 (9th Cir.1982). Absent a showing that Defendants took some \u201cnew and independent act\u201d that \u201cinflict[ed] new and accumulating injury,\u201d the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege a continuing violations theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">As a result, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, as currently alleged, are time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-8\">3. Fraudulent Concealment</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final argument is that the statute of limitations should be tolled under the fraudulent concealment doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-10\">\u201cA statute of limitations may be tolled if the defendant fraudulently concealed the existence of a cause of action in such a way that the plaintiff, acting as a reasonable perspn, did not know of its existence.\u201d <em>Hexcel, </em>681 F.3d at 1060. The plaintiff bears the burden of pleading and proving fraudulent concealment. <em>Id.; see also Conmar Corp. v. Mitsui &amp; Co, (U.S.A.), Inc., </em>858 F.2d 499, 502 (9th Cir.1988). To plead fraudulent concealment, the plaintiff must allege that: (1) the defendant took affirmative acts to mislead the plaintiff; (2) the plaintiff did not have \u201cactual or constructive knowledge of the facts giving rise to its claim\u201d as a result of defendant\u2019s affirmative acts; and (3) the plaintiff acted diligently in trying to uncover the facts giving rise to its claim. <em>Hexcel, </em>681 F.3d at 1060; <em>see also Conmar, </em>858 F.2d at 502; <em>Beneficial Life Ins., </em>851 F.2d at 276. Moreover, allegations of fraudulent concealment must be pled with particularity. <em>Conmar, </em>858 F.2d at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>Here, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege any of the three elements of a fraudulent concealment claim. As the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege affirmative acts, the Court does not reach Defendants\u2019 arguments as to knowledge and diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">In the instant case, Plaintiffs contend that they have alleged three categories of conduct that satisfy the element of \u201caffirmative acts\u201d: (1) Defendants\u2019 secret meetings; (2) Defendants\u2019 efforts to \u201cminimize any written record of the conspiracy\u201d; and (3) Defendants\u2019 efforts to mislead the public through use of the Croner survey. As to Plaintiffs\u2019 three categories of conduct, the Court concludes that these allegations fail to show affirmatively misleading conduct \u201cabove and beyond\u201d the alleged conspiracy itself. <em>See Guerrero v. Gates, </em>442 F.3d 697, 706-07 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Santa Maria v. Pac. Bell, </em>202 F.3d 1170, 1176 (9th Cir.2000)).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the Ninth Circuit explained in <em>Conmar, </em>the fact that a defendant\u2019s acts are \u201cby nature self-concealing\u201d is insufficient to show that the defendant has affirmatively misled the plaintiff as to the existence of the plaintiffs claim. <em>See </em>858 F.2d at 505. In doing so, the <em>Conmar </em>court concluded that \u201c[p]assive concealment of information is not enough to toll the statute of limitations, unless the defendant had a fiduciary duty to disclose information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-8\">Here, the Court finds that the allegation that \u201cDefendants engaged in a secret conspiracy\u201d does not show that Defendants took \u201caffirmative steps to mislead.\u201d <em>See Volk v. D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., </em>816 F.2d 1406, 1415-16 (9th Cir.1987). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants\u2019 senior human resources directors and senior management discussed the conspiracy in small in-person group meetings, avoided memorializing the scheme in writing, and attempted to keep the conspiracy secret from Plaintiffs. In <em>Volk, </em>however, the Ninth Circuit held that merely \u201cpassively concealing]\u201d material information is insufficient to toll the statute of limitations. In the instant action, it may be the case that Defendants engaged in a secret conspiracy, but that allegation alone does not show that Defendants affirmatively and fraudulently concealed the existence of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. As in <em>Volk, </em>Plaintiffs have failed to \u201crepresent any facts indicating an affirmative effort on the part of any [defendant] to mislead them or to conceal the fraud.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-9\">Moreover, Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to aver any affirmative attempts to mislead \u201cabove and beyond\u201d the existence of the conspiracy itself is illustrated by <em>Conmar. </em>In <em>Con-mar, </em>the Ninth Circuit found that the defendant\u2019s creation and dissemination of false customs forms to mislead the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>tiff, and the \u201cdirect public denial of any wrongdoing\u201d could constitute affirmative actions to conceal anticompetitive behavioy. 858 F.2d at 505. Here, while Plaintiffs do provide detailed allegations of when and where certain Defendants met and conspired, these allegations do not support the conclusion that Defendants took active, affirmative steps to mislead Plaintiffs about the existence of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Instead, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations show only that Defendants engaged in a conspiracy, that \u201cby nature [is] self-concealing.\u201d <em>Conmar, </em>858 F.2d at 505. That Defendants did not affirmatively disclose the details of their allegedly unlawful conspiracy to Plaintiffs is neither surprising nor sufficient to constitute \u201caffirmative steps to mislead.\u201d <em>See id. </em>If the mere fact of a secret conspiracy were sufficient to toll the statute of limitations under the fraudulent concealment doctrine, there would be little point in imposing a period of limitation in the first instance. <em>See, e.g., </em>Areeda and Hoven-camp, Antitrust Law \u00a7 320e (\u201cOf course, regarding every secret conspiracy as sufficiently self-concealing to toll the statute would often force the courts to deal with stale, if not ancient, evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">Moreover, Plaintiffs cite <em>In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litigation, </em>No. 13-MD-2420, 2014 WL 309192, at *16 (N.D.Cal. Jan. 21, 2014), but that ease only highlights the insufficiency of Plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations. In <em>Lithium Ion, </em>the plaintiffs alleged both that the defendants had made \u201cpublic, putatively false statements ... affirming their compliance with applicable antitrust laws, as well as the existence of vigorous price competition in the ... market,\u201d on which plaintiffs could have reasonably relied, and that the defendants had taken affirmative steps to destroy evidence of the conspirators\u2019 secret meetings, avoided memorializing Conversations, and used secret codes to refer to coconspirators and topics. <em>Id.; see also In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., </em>586 F.Supp.2d 1109, 1119 (N.D.Cal.2008) (defendants provided \u201cnumerous specific pretextual reasons for inflated prices\u201d and also kept conspiracy secret); <em>In re Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., </em>738 F.Supp.2d 1101, 1024-25 (N.D.Cal.2010) (defendants gave \u201cpretextual reasons for price increases, and coordinated their misleading announcements\u201d and also kept conspiracy secret). These cases, <em>Lithium Ion, TFT-LCD, </em>and <em>Cathode Ray, </em>entailed affirmative, public misrepresentations by the defendants that they were not engaging in anticompetitive conduct, which allegedly rpisled the plaintiffs as to the existence of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. It was the combination of those misleading, pretextual statements <em>and </em>the affirmative efforts taken to destroy evidence of the conspiracy or otherwise keep the conspiracies secret that supported the respective plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent concealment allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">The above-mentioned cases also illustrate why Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations with regards to the Croner survey are lacking. In their opposition, Plaintiffs argue for the first time that because the Croner survey describes itself as providing \u201ccompetitive compensation information,\u201d when the survey actually reported \u201canticompetitive compensation,\u201d Defendants \u201cdeliberately misrepresent[ed] their suppressed compensation data as \u2018competitive.\u2019 \u201d Opp. at 17. However, the Court concludes that this allegation is qualitatively different from the public misrepresentations that the defendants made in <em>Lithium Ion, TFT-LCD, </em>and <em>Cathode Ray. See Lithium Ion, </em>2014 WL 309192, at *16 (noting \u201cpublic, putatively false statements by various defendants affirming their compliance with applicable antitrust laws\u201d); <em>TFT-LCD, </em>586 F.Supp.2d at 1119 (allegations that defendants provided \u201cnumerous specific pretextual reasons for the inflated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>prices\u201d); <em>Cathode Ray, </em>738 F.Supp.2d at 1024-25 (allegations that defendants used \u201cmisleading announcements\u201d and \u201cgave pretextual reasons for price increases\u201d). As a threshold matter, there are no allegations in the CAC that the compensation information in the Croner survey was publicly accessible, that Defendants were responsible for publishing the Croner survey, or that Defendants publicized the Croner survey as \u201caffirming their compliance with applicable antitrust laws.... \u201d <em>See Lithium Ion, </em>2014 WL 309192, at *16. Nor do Plaintiffs allege that Defendants\u2019 participation in the Croner survey involved the type of \u201cpublic statements\u201d at issue in <em>Cathode Ray, </em>where the defendants allegedly agreed \u201con what to tell customers about price changes,\u201d and published misleading or pretextual statements on \u201ccapacity and supply.\u201d 738 F.Supp.2d at 1025. At bottom, Plaintiffs simply offer no factual allegations with regards to the information in the Croner survey itself, or Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Moreover, to the extent Plaintiffs rely on the bare allegation that \u201cDefendants provided pretextual, incomplete or materially false and misleading explanations for hiring, recruiting and compensation decisions made pursuant to the conspiracy,\u201d CAC \u00b6 130, the Court finds this conclusory allegation insufficient under Rule 9(b). Plaintiffs offer no specific facts showing the \u201cwho, what, where, when\u201d of these alleged incomplete or materially false statements. <em>See Swartz, </em>476 F.3d at 764. This allegation would not satisfy <em>Twombly, </em>much less the heightened pleading standard in Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">In sum, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Defendants took affirmative steps to mislead Plaintiffs as to the factual basis for Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. While Plaintiffs are correct as a general matter that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Defendants attempted to avoid memorializing the anti-solicitation scheme in order to keep the conspiracy secret may be relevant to Plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent concealment claim, those allegations alone as currently pled are insufficient.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Here, the Court finds that Plaintiffs fail to allege facts showing that Defendants did more than passively conceal information. <em>See Volk, </em>816 F.2d at 1416.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">As Plaintiffs have failed to allege an essential element of fraudulent concealment, and the Court has also concluded that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, as currently alleged, are time barred, the Court grants Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC. This dismissal is without prejudice, as the Court concludes that amendment would not necessarily be futile, as Plaintiffs may be able to allege sufficient facts to support their continuing violations claim and their equitable tolling claim. <em>See Leadsinger, </em>512 F.3d at 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-10\">In light of this conclusion, the Court does not reach the remainder of Defendants\u2019 arguments in support of their motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 CAC.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>IY.

Evid. 201(d).</p>\n<p id=\"AoI\">The Court grants Plaintiffs\u2019 unopposed request for judicial notice, ECF No. 97 at 37, and has taken notice of the adjudicative facts contained therein. Plaintiffs request that the Court take judicial notice of two sealing orders from the <em>High-Tech </em>litigation and a media report. <em>See Lee, </em>250 F.3d at 689-90; <em>Von Saher, </em>592 F.3d at 960.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">. Plaintiffs aver that Industrial Light &amp; Magic (\"ILM\u201d) is a division of Lucasfilm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">. According to Plaintiffs, ILM, Lucasfilm, and Pixar have been owned by Defendant The Walt Disney Company since 2012. CAC \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1239-10\">. Disney also \"oversees the operations of\u201d Walt Disney Animation Studios, formerly known as Walt Disney Feature Animation. CAC \u00b6 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1239-18\">. Plaintiffs also allege that \"[t]he members of the Settlement Class under the September 20, 2013 Settlement Agreement with Pixar and Lucasfilm [in <em>High-Tech </em>] ... do not bring in this complaint any claims against Pixar, Lu-casfilm, and Disney that were released pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 114.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">. Defendants submit that Exhibit F in their request for judicial notice, consisting of Certificates of Corporate Formation and Amendment filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, Division of Corporations, disproves Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that ImageM-overs LLC was a party to the joint venture that created ImageMovers Digital. <em>See </em>ECF No. 76. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Ima-geMovers LLC from this action after Defendants filed their motion to dismiss and request for judicial notice. Consequently, the Court concludes that ImageMovers\u2019 involvement in the purported joint venture is not relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1242-11\">. Plaintiffs dismissed ImageMovers LLC without prejudice pursuant to a tolling agreement on January 14, 2015. ECF No. 83.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1243-8\">. Plaintiffs also dismissed Digital Domain 3.0 without prejudice pursuant to a tolling agreement. <em>See </em>CAC at 16 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">. As Defendants note, under California law the general accrual rule is the \"last element rule,\u201d where a claim accrues \" 'when [it] is complete with all of its elements\u2019 \u2014 those elements being wrongdoing, harm, and causation.\u201d <em>Pooshs v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., </em>51 Cal.4th 788, 797, 123 Cal.Rptr.3d 578, 250 P.3d 181 (2011) (quoting <em>Norgart v. Upjohn Co., </em>21 Cal.4th 383, 397, 87 Cal.Rptr.2d 453, 981 P.2d 79 (1999)). The \"discovery rule\u201d is an exception to the common law accrual rule. <em>Id. </em>In light of the fact that the discovery rule is an exception and not the default rule, the <em>Aryeh </em>court\u2019s holding that federal interpretation of the Sherman Act is instructive in interpreting the Cartwright Act, and the absence of any contrary argument from Plaintiffs, the Court focuses on the Sherman Act to resolve whether both Plaintiffs\u2019 Sherman and Cartwright Act claims are time barred. <em>See Aryeh v. Canon Bus. Solutions, Inc., </em>55 Cal.4th 1185, 1196, 151 Cal.Rptr.3d 827, 292 P.3d 871 (2013). Moreover, as stated above, the parties do not dispute that resolution of Plaintiffs\u2019 Sherman Act claim would also resolve Plaintiffs\u2019 Cartwright Act claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">. Plaintiffs cite this Court\u2019s order in <em>Plumlee v. Pfizer, </em>No. 13-CV-414-LHK, 2014 WL 695024, at *8 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 21, 2014), for the proposition that the delayed discovery rule applies to UCL claims as a matter of law. However, the UCL claims at issue in <em>Plumlee </em>were based on alleged fraudulent misrepresentations to consumers, precisely the type of UCL claim the <em>Aryeh </em>court recognized might be subject to the delayed discovery rule. <em>See Aryeh, </em>55 Cal.4th at 1195-96, 151 Cal.Rptr.3d 827, 292 P.3d 871. Thus in the fraud context, the Court observed that under <em>Aryeh, </em>the delayed discovery rule was <em>\"available </em>to toll the statute of limitations\u201d for a UCL claim. The Court did not hold that the discovery rule applied to all UCL claims. <em>See id. </em>at *8 n.6 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1251-12\">. The Court notes that Defendants contend that Blue Sky was not named in the first-filed complaint, the <em>Nitsch </em>complaint, but rather was only named on September 17, 2014 in the <em>Wentworth </em>complaint. <em>See </em>MTD at 4 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">. Plaintiffs also neglect to mention that the Ninth Circuit in <em>Oliver </em>explicitly held that the four year statute of limitation in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b did not apply to the plaintiffs' claims, as they sought only injunctive relief. 751 F.3d at 1084.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">. While Plaintiffs are correct that the Ninth Circuit overruled <em>Santa Maria </em>in <em>Socop-Gonzales v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1194-95 (9th Cir.2001), the Ninth Circuit did so on other grounds. In <em>Socop-Gonzales, </em>the Ninth Circuit held that <em>Santa </em>Maria\u2019s suggestion that \"courts should not apply equitable tolling in situations where a plaintiff discovers the existence of a claim before the end of a limitations period and the court believes that the plaintiff reasonably could have been expected to bring a claim within the remainder of the limitations period,\u201d was contrary to Supreme Court precedent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AlK\">The <em>Socop-Gonzales </em>court did not, however, overrule the general proposition that fraudulent concealment requires some affirmative acts of misconduct \"above and beyond\u201d the conduct inherent to the underlying claims themselves. The \"above and beyond\u201d language has been cited by the Ninth Circuit approvingly in subsequent cases as an element of fraudulent concealment claims. <em>See, e.g., Guerrero, </em>442 F.3d at 706-07; <em>Lukovsky v. City and Cnty. of San Francisco, </em>535 F.3d 1044, 1052 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Coppinger-Martin </em>v. <em>Solis, </em>627 F.3d 745, 751 (9th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">. Plaintiffs, in their opposition, raise for the first time the claim that some of the Defendants' requests to seal certain information in the <em>High-Tech </em>litigation constituted affirmative efforts to conceal information. As this theory is not pled anywhere in the CAC, the Court declines to entertain this new argument. <em>See Barnes v. Campbell Soup Co., </em>No. 12-05185, 2013 WL 5530017, at *2 (N.D.Cal. July 25, 2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1257-11\">. The Court notes that Defendants request that the Court dismiss or strike Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for wage-fixing in the event that the Court does not grant their motion to dismiss. MTD at 18 n.21. That request is denied. Moreover, the Court is concerned by Defendants\u2019 contention that \"the claim regarding wage-fixing .... should not proceed into the discovery phase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court has not stayed discovery in this action, and at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>initial case management conference on November 5, 2014, the Court explicitly denied both Plaintiffs\u2019 request to expedite discovery and Defendants' request to stay discovery. ECF No. 39. To the extent Plaintiffs have properly served discovery requests to Defendants regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 wage-fixing claims, Defendants must promptly respond.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
