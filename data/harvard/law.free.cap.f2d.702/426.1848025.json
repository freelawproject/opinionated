Plaintiff-appellants are the Township of Springfield, the Parkland Preservation Fund, and the Watchung Nature Club. Defendant-appellees are Drew Lewis, Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation (\u201cUSDOT\u201d); USDOT; Ray Barnhart, Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (\u201cFHWA\u201d); FHWA; John G. Bestgen, Jr., Regional Administrator of Region One of FHWA; John S. Kessler, Jr., Division Administrator of the New Jersey Division of FHWA; Louis J. Gambaccini, Commissioner of Transportation of the New Jersey Department of Transportation (\u201cNJDOT\u201d); and NJDOT. Appellants sued for declaratory and injunctive relief to compel appellees to stop work on the proposed highway until they held additional hearings and prepared additional reports allegedly required by federal and state law. The District Court for the District of New Jersey, in four written but unpublished opinions, granted summary judgment for appellees on all nine claims of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The case requires us to construe and apply three federal statutes: the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (\u201cNEPA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321-4370 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980); the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 (\u201cDOTA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1651-1659 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980); and the Federal-Aid Highway Act (\u201cFAHA\u201d), 23 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-156 (1976 &amp; Supp. V 1981). We also must construe and apply the New Jersey Relocation Assistance Programs Act, N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 27:7-66 to -68 (West 1982); the New Jersey Environmental Rights Act (\u201cERA\u201d), NJ.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2A:35A-1 to -14 (West 1982); and the New Jersey Action Plan (\u201cAction Plan\u201d), adopted pursuant to FAHA by FHWA and NJDOT. Appellants claim that appellees have violated each of these statutes and that the district court erred in not ruling, <em>inter alia, </em>(a) that appellees should have supplemented or redrafted the federally mandated Environmental Impact Statement (\u201cEIS\u201d); (b) that appellees should have held new public hearings before deciding upon the location of, and even the desirability of constructing, the highway;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (c) that appellees gave inadequate consideration to the environmental impact of and alternatives to the proposed roadway; and (d) that appellees improperly approved the advance acquisition of a quarry adjacent to the site of the future highway without holding public hearings or waiting for the EIS to be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that: (a) appellees were not required to redraft or supplement the EIS; (b) they were not required to hold additional location hearings; (c) they adequately evaluated alternatives to the proposed highway as well as that roadway\u2019s effect on the environment; and (d) they lack standing to sue to enforce the \u201cadvance acquisition\u201d regulations governing the purchase of the quarry. We therefore will affirm in full the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">Because of the complexity of the statutes and regulations involved in the case, we will begin our discussion with a survey of the three principal statutes at issue: NEPA, FAHA, and DOTA. Against this statutory background, we then will develop the extensive factual and procedural history of this litigation. Our discussion of the merits of appellants\u2019 numerous claims will follow. While we will accord some of those claims summary treatment, we will consider sever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>al of them \u2014 those dealing with redrafting the EIS, holding further hearings, evaluating alternatives to the proposal, and purchasing the quarry \u2014 at length because of the significance of the issues and the importance to the litigants of this highway project.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">1. <em>Statutory Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABq\">A. <em>NEPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">NEPA represents the culmination of legislative efforts to</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">declare a national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment; to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man; to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the Nation; and to establish a Council on Environmental Quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 (1976). The Act mandates that this environmental policy animate \u201cevery recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4332(2)(C), and provides that the \u201cresponsible official\u201d in charge of each such major action must file a \u201cdetailed statement\u201d (the EIS) discussing</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">(i) the environmental impact of\u2019 the proposed action,</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">(iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of man\u2019s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented. <em>Id. </em>The responsible federal official must \u201cconsult with and obtain the comments of any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved\u201d and must make available the EIS and the related comments thereon to the President, the Council on Environmental Quality (\u201cCEQ\u201d), and the public. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The official also must \u201cstudy, develop, and describe appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses of available resources.. .. \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4332(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-17\">The goal of NEPA, therefore, is \u201cto control the more destructive effects of man\u2019s technology on his environment....\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Environmental Council, Inc. v. Bartlett, </em>454 F.2d 613, 624 (3d Cir.1971). The EIS is the device that promotes the fulfillment of the statutory objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-18\">B. <em>DOTA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-19\">Section 4(f) of DOTA decrees:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-20\">It is hereby declared to be the national policy that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside and public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites. The Secretary of Transportation shall cooperate and consult with the Secretaries of the Interior, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, and with the States in developing transportation plans and programs that include measures to maintain or enhance the natural beauty of the lands traversed. After August 23, 1968, the Secretary shall not approve any program or project which requires the use of any publicly owned land from a public park, recreation area, or wildlife and waterfowl refuge of national, State, or local significance as determined by the Federal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>State, or local officials having jurisdiction thereof, or any land from an historic site of national, State, or local significance as so determined by such officials unless (1) there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land, and (2) such program includes all possible planning to minimize harm to such park, recreational area, wildlife and waterfowl refuge, or historic site resulting from such use.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653(f) (1976). Thus was engendered the \u201csection-4(f) statement,\u201d which usually accompanies the EIS and demonstrates that the Secretary has made the two determinations set out in the statute. The Secretary\u2019s scrutiny must not be cursory, for DOTA\u2019s compass is broad:</p>\n<p id=\"ALp\">Congress articulated in \u00a7 4(f) a disparate weighting against the use of parkland for highway projects. It said, don\u2019t use greenlands, but if you must do so, be practical and cut harm to the minimum. It did so in recognition of the fact that it is always easier to build highways through publicly owned parks because people and their homes, businesses, schools and churches will not have to be displaced and its acquisition costs little or nothing. This thumb-on-the-scale approach is required whenever the parkland is to be used. If courts were to interpret this section to permit an initial appraisal of whether the use was substantial, it would infuse consideration of elements (such as the degree of harm to the park, animal life, environment, etc.) which Congress did not want considered when it said, if there is another way, take it. <em>Any park use, regardless of its degree, invokes \u00a7 4(f).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\"><em>Louisiana Environmental Society, Inc. v. Coleman, </em>537 F.2d 79, 84 (5th Cir.1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">C. <em>FAHA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">FAHA establishes rules and standards to which federal and state officials must adhere before a highway may be planned and constructed with 90-percent federal funds as a part of the federal Interstate System.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act reiterates the environmental concerns expressed in DOTA,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>supra, </em>and provides that</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">(a) Any State highway department which submits plans for a Federal-aid highway project involving the bypassing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>of or, going through any city, town, or village, either incorporated or unincorporated, shall certify to the Secretary that it has had public hearings, or has afforded the opportunity for such hearings, and has considered the economic and social effects of such a location, its impact on the environment, and its consistency with the goals and objectives of such urban planning as has been promulgated by the community. Any State highway department which submits plans for an Interstate System project shall certify to the Secretary that it has had public hearings at a convenient location, or has afforded the opportunity for such hearings for the purpose of enabling persons in rural areas through or contiguous to whose property the highway will pass to express any objections they may have to the proposed locations of such highway. Such certification shall be accompanied by a report which indicates the consideration given to the economic, social, environmental and other effects of the plan or highway location or design and various alternatives which were raised during the hearing or which were otherwise considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">(b) When hearings have been held under subsection (a), the State highway department shall submit a copy of the transcript of said hearings to the Secretary, together with the certification and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">23 U.S.C. \u00a7 128 (1976).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These public hearings are of two types:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Both a <em>corridor public hearing </em>and a <em>design public hearing </em>must be held, or an opportunity afforded for those hearings, with respect to each Federal-aid highway project that:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">(1) Is on a new location; or</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">(2) Would have a substantially different social, economic, or environmental effect; or</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">(3) Would essentially change the layout or function of connecting roads or streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">23 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.5(a) (1980) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">Considered together, NEPA, DOTA, and FAHA thus require a complex of reports and studies \u2014 including an EIS, a section-4(f) statement, and public hearings \u2014 before a federally financed highway such as 1-78 can be built. Against this statutory and regulatory background, we now may consider the facts of the ease before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">II. <em>Factual and Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">1 \u2014 78 roughly parallels or replaces Route U.S. 22 and extends from the Holland Tunnel, in New York City, to Interstate Route <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>81, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a distance of approximately 160 miles. Except for the area upon which we shall focus and a proposed 36-mile section bypassing Phil-lipsburg, New Jersey, and Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton, Pennsylvania, 1-78 has been completed and is open to traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The subject of this case is a 5V\u00e1 mile gap (the \u201cWatchung Gap\u201d) in the New Jersey stretch of 1-78 between the Township of Berkeley Heights and the Borough of Wat-chung, on the west, and the Township of Springfield, on the east.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Final Environmental Impact Statement (\u201cFEIS\u201d) characterizes the area as</p>\n<p id=\"Aa-\">suburban residential, with several large campus type industrial establishments interspersed among well defined neighborhoods. Notable among the land uses within this area are: the Bell Telephone Laboratories, the John E. Runnells Hospital, the Governor Livingston Regional High School and the Watchung Reservation, a 2,000 + -acre public park operated by the County of Union Department of Parks and Recreation.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">2 FEIS at I-A-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The planning of 1-78 began in 1956, when Congress enacted legislation providing for an interstate system of highways. Detailed location studies for the section from Newark to Annandale, New Jersey, (including the Watchung Gap) commenced in 1958, and the authorities involved presented the selected location (the \u201coriginal alignment\u201d) at a public hearing held on June 30,1958. 2 FEIS at I-B-2 to -4. On January 23,1959, NJDOT wrote to the Bureau of Public Roads (now the FHWA) and requested its \u201cconcurrence and approval in the alignment as presented at the hearing.\u201d Letter from James J. Malloy to H.P. Beschenbossel (Jan. 23, 1959) (requesting location approval), App. at A556. The Bureau approved the original alignment on February 11, 1959, and instructed NJDOT to proceed with detailed design plans. Letter from H.P. Bes-chenbossel to J.J. Malloy (Feb. 11, 1959) (granting location approval), App. at A634. NJDOT received final Plan, Specifications and Estimate approval of its design and contract plans in December 1965 and March 1966, and NJDOT then completed the acquisition or condemnation of all of the highway\u2019s right-of-way except for that land located within the Watchung Reservation. 2 FEIS at I-B-l. NJDOT \u201cinvested several years in negotiating with the Union County Park Commission [hereinafter the \u201cPark Commission\u201d] in an attempt to acquire the Watchung Reservation [right-of-way].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">In July 1970, however, the project snagged: the Bureau of Public Roads rescinded its design approval because of lapse of time and because \u201csignificant design revisions required as a result of meetings with the . .. Park Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An agreement between NJDOT and the Park Commission was not executed until April 10,1972, by which time FHWA policy mandated that an EIS be prepared for any highway section \u201c \u2018which receives or received design approval ... on or after February 1,1971.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting FHWA Policy and Procedure Memorandum 90-1, Transmittal 202, Aug. 24, 1971). Moreover, FHWA determined that NJDOT would also have to file a section-4(f) statement, as section 4(f) of DOTA had been enacted pri- or to the rescission of design approval. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">NJDOT submitted its first Draft Environmental Impact Statement (\u201cDEIS\u201d) and section-4(f) statement<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to the CEQ and circulated it to the public in November 1973. Ensuing comments and technological changes revealed the need for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>study, and a new DEIS was distributed on May 17, 1976. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The 1976 DEIS studied the impact of the proposed highway segment on traffic, air quality, noise, water quality, flooding, and \u201csocio-economics.\u201d Also featured were analyses of nine principal alternatives, including a \u201cno-build\u201d alternative, as well as a series of design modifications introduced to mitigate adverse environmental impacts. 2 FEIS at I-B-5 to -7.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">NJDOT held public hearings on the project from June 27 through July 1, 1976, and continued to receive written comments for the official record until November 1, 1976. 2 FEIS at I-A-2. NJDOT then began to prepare the FEIS and included therein updated studies relating to air quality, noise, ecosystems, industrial impact, traffic, and engineering. <em>Id. </em>at I-B-7 to -8.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The period from January 1977 through August 1978 saw a steady stream of letters between NJDOT and FHWA, with NJDOT submitting further studies and revising the EIS in response to information or changes requested by FHWA. App. at A557-83. On September 25, 1978, NJDOT submitted copies of the FEIS to FHWA and requested \u201cearly approval to print.\u201d Letter from F. Howard Zahn to John J. Kessler, Jr. (Sept. 25, 1978) (requesting approval to print FEIS), App. at A584. FHWA was not yet satisfied, however, and further comments and revisions flowed between the parties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> App. at A585-626. FHWA granted conditional approval to print the FEIS, Letter from John J. Kessler, Jr., to J.F. Andrews (April 15,1980) (conditioning approval upon two revisions), App. at A635, and, on June 2, 1980, NJDOT transmitted to FHWA fourteen copies of the FEIS \u201cfor approval and adoption,\u201d Letter from F. Howard Zahn to John J. Kessler, Jr. (June 2, 1980) (requesting adoption of FHWA), App. at A105. Final approval was given on January 26, 1981. Letter from John J. Kessler, Jr., to Robert Innocenzi (Jan. 26, 1981) (approving FEIS), App. at A661.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">The construction of 1-78 through the Watchung Reservation, as approved by FHWA and USDOT, offers a number of benefits: the roadway is expected to improve the flow of vehicular traffic, saving both travel time and fuel; to reduce accident rates; and to lower \u201ctotal vehicle pollutant emissions\u201d because of smoother traffic flows and reduction in overall vehicle miles travelled. 1 FEIS at S-3 to -4. The adverse impacts, on the other hand, also are significant: the construction and presence of the six-lane highway will intrude upon the natural setting; will require the excavation of approximately 4.4 million cubic yards of rock and earth, mostly within the park; will necessitate the decimation of at least seventy acres of hardwood forest; will destroy animal habitat; will \u201ccause noise in much of the Reservation\u201d; will degrade water quality; will slightly increase flooding possibilities; will require the relocation of a stable; will split the park in two; and will have various impacts outside the Wat-chung Reservation as well. <em>Id. </em>at S -3 to -8.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">On January 19,1981, appellants filed suit in the District Court for the District of New Jersey to enjoin the construction of the disputed segment of 1-78 and the advance acquisition of the Houdaille Quarry, an inactive quarry adjacent to the proposed right-of-way intended to become a depository for the earth and rock moved during the construction of the highway. The complaint, as amended and supplemented on March 3, 1981, set forth nine claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">1. Appellees had violated NEPA by failing and refusing to redraft or supplement and recirculate the 1976 EIS;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-13\">2. Appellees had violated the New Jersey Action Plan and ERA by failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>and refusing to hold new public hearings on the route\u2019s location and to reconsider or modify the project;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">3. Appellees had violated NEPA by approving the project on the basis of an EIS that did not adequately discuss alternatives and environmental effects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">4.

The district court denied appellants\u2019 motion, granted summary judgment for appellees on claim 7, and granted partial summary judgment for appellees on claims 1 and 2. <em>Township of Springfield v. Lewis, </em>No. 81-123 (D.N.J. Aug. 31,1981) <em>(\"Springfield I\u201d). </em>The court also granted appellees\u2019 motion for a protective order and denied appellants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining the acquisition of the Houdaille Quarry.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Several months later, the district court granted summary judgment for the state appellees on claims 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, and summary judgment for all appellees on claim 1, <em>Township of Springfield v. Lewis, </em>No. 81-123 (D.N.J. Dec. 31, 1981) <em>(\u201cSpringfield II\u201d). </em>Summary judgment for the federal appellees on claims 3, 4, 5, and 9 followed thereafter. <em>Township of Springfield v.

We then will consider in a more summary manner the remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">III. <em>Should the DEIS Have Been Redrafted?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Appellants assert (claim 1) that appellees should have redrafted and recirculated the 1976 DEIS before commencing the project and that the failure to do so violates NEPA and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Central to appellants\u2019 arguments is 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.12(o) (1980) (emphasis added), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The draft EIS shall, <em>if necessary, </em>be revised unless the final EIS is submitted to FHWA for adoption within 3 years from the date the draft EIS was circulated. If the draft EIS is revised, it shall also be recirculated for comment. Such recirculation shall be in the same manner as an original draft EIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">NJDOT first circulated the DEIS on May 17, 1976; the agency did not request \u201capproval and adoption\u201d of the FEIS until June 2, 1980, <em>see </em>Letter from F. Howard Zahn to John J. Kessler, Jr. (June 2, 1980) (transmitting FEIS and requesting approval and adoption), App. at A105. Thus, conclude appellants, more than three years elapsed between the DEIS and the submission for adoption of the FEIS, and a revised DEIS therefore is needed to account for new information and changes in plans. Ap-pellees deny the need to revise the DEIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Assuming that appellants are correct in claiming that the FEIS was not \u201csubmitted to FHWA for adoption\u201d until June 2, 1980, we still must confront the express language of 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.12(o). We agree with the district court\u2019s reading of the regulation: section 771.12(o) would require redrafting and recirculating of the DEIS \u201conly if it is <em>\u2018necessary,\u2019\u201d Springfield I, supra, </em>slip. op. at 3 (emphasis added). We therefore must determine the existence <em>vel non </em>of such necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Appellants explicate the \u201cif necessary\u201d phrase in section 771.12(o) by referring to 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.14(i) (1980) (emphasis added), which provides that</p>\n<p id=\"AZV\">[t]he final EIS shall be reevaluated by [NJDOT] and the FHWA prior to proceeding with major project activities for the purpose of determining whether there has been a <em>substantial change </em>in the social, economic and environmental effects of the proposed action. If there are <em>substantial changes in the proposed action that would significantly affect the quality of the human environment, </em>a supplemental statement shall be prepared,</p>\n<p id=\"Ahr\">and 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.15 (1980) (emphasis added), which instructs that</p>\n<p id=\"ADC\">[a] draft EIS or final EIS may be supplemented at any time. Supplements will be necessary when <em>substantial changes </em>are made in the proposed action that will introduce a new or changed environmental effect <em>of significance </em>to the quality of the human environment or <em>significant new information </em>becomes available concerning the action\u2019s environmental aspects. The decision to prepare and process a supplement to the final EIS shall not void or alter FHWA approval actions given prior to the decision, or void or alter previously authorized development of the highway section not directly affected by the changed condition or new information. A supplement is to be processed in the same manner as a new EIS (draft and final).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">Adopting this exegesis of section 771.12(o), as did the district court, we will examine (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>whether there were \u201csubstantial changes in the proposed action that would significantly affect the quality of the human environment,\u201d and (b) whether \u201csignificant new information [became] available concerning the action\u2019s environmental aspects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">A. <em>Substantial Changes</em></p>\n<p id=\"ady-dedup-0\">Appellants focus on three design changes that were made after the preparation of the DEIS: the elimination of one proposed interchange at Glenside Road, a partial change in the interchange on Diamond Hill Road, and the narrowing of the width of the highway\u2019s median strip from 200 feet to 143 feet. The district court ruled that ap-pellees had acted reasonably in deciding not to revise the DEIS on the basis of these changes and granted summary judgment for appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">First, the court relied on a letter from FHWA to appellants\u2019 attorneys, in which FHWA addressed a host of concerns raised by appellants and expressed its opinion that a new DEIS was unnecessary because \u201c[t]he alignment was not substantially shifted, property taken or seriously harmed was not increased or changed in character, [and] environmental damages were not greater or of a different nature.\u201d Letter from John J. Kessler, Jr., to Robert C. Barrett at 2 (Nov. 13, 1980) (responding to Barrett\u2019s letter), App. at A631.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Second, the court noted that \u201cinterchanges are considered \u2018major design features,\u2019 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 795.2 (1980), and are more appropriately addressed at the design stage which follows the adoption of the final EIS by FHWA....\u201d <em>Springfield I, supra, </em>slip op. at 7 n. * Third, the court held that \u201c[w]hen changes made between the draft EIS and the final EIS unquestionably mitigate adverse environmental effects of the project, as is the case here, those changes generally do not require a supplemental EIS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Before discussing the substance of the district court\u2019s decision, we first must consider whether the court applied the correct standard of review. The district court believed its scope of review to be \u201cnarrow\u201d: \u201cthe agency\u2019s decision not to supplement the EIS in view of the changes in the project must be upheld if it was reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. To support its determination, the court relied on <em>Environmental Defense Fund v. Marsh, </em>651 F.2d 983, 992 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Warm Springs Dam Task Force v. Gribble, </em>621 F.2d 1017, 1024 (9th Cir. 1980); and <em>Green Mountain Grange No. One v. Lewis, </em>No. 80-265, slip op. at 18 (D.Vt. May 5, 1981), all of which adopted a reasonableness standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">This Court has reserved decision on the proper standard to apply in reviewing an agency decision not to prepare an EIS at all, <em>see Township of Lower Alloways Creek </em>v. <em>Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co., </em>687 F.2d 732, 741-42 (3d Cir.1982); <em>Concord Township </em>v. <em>United States, </em>625 F.2d 1068, 1073-74 (3d Cir.1980); <em>a fortiori, </em>we have not prescribed the standard to apply in reviewing a decision not to revise and recirculate an EIS already prepared. As Judge Adams said for the Court in <em>Township of Lower Alloways Creek:</em></p>\n<p id=\"AWL\">federal courts of appeals have differed as to whether an administrative decision not to prepare an EIS should be measured by the \u201creasonableness\u201d of that decision under the circumstances, or by the traditional \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard contained in the Administrative Procedure Act.... Judge Gibbons, writing for the Court [in <em>Concord Township, supra </em>], found it unnecessary for this Circuit to join either group of opposing ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>pellate courts. Instead, without deciding whether it was in fact the appropriate judicial standard, he proceeded to apply the \u201creasonableness\u201d test to the facts of the case for three reasons: first, because that test appeared to be prefefred by the district courts under our supervision; second, because there was \u201cmuch to be said in favor of subjecting these threshold determinations to the higher scrutiny on review,\u201d and finally, because the particular agency decision under consideration \u201cpass[ed] muster\u201d even under the \u201chigher\u201d measure of \u201creasonableness.\u201d [625 F.2d] at 1073-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">687 F.2d at 742 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We do not here reach the question reserved in <em>Township of Lower Alloways Greek </em>and <em>Concord Township, </em>for we will adopt the approach taken in those two cases:</p>\n<p id=\"AMHF\">we will assume, without deciding, that an agency\u2019s determination not' to [revise] an EIS must be \u201creasonable under the circumstances,\u201d <em>Minnesota Public Interest Research Group v. Butz, </em>498 F.2d 1314, 1320 (8th Cir.1974), when viewed \u201cin the light of the mandatory requirements and high standards set by [NEPA],\u201d <em>Wyoming Outdoor Coordinating Council </em>v. <em>Butz, </em>484 F.2d 1244, 1249 (10th Cir.1973). <em>Township of Lower Alloways Creek, supra, </em>687 F.2d at 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Applying this standard, we agree with the district court that appellees reasonably could have concluded that any changes made in the plans for 1-78 since the drafting and circulating of the 1976 DEIS were not substantial enough to necessitate revising and recirculating the DEIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">As we noted above, appellants complained principally of changes in two interchanges and in the width of the median strip. We agree with the district court that appellants\u2019 concerns about the interchanges may be expressed during the course of the design hearings mandated by 23 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 790.5 and 790.9, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, the elimination of one interchange and the narrowing of median-strip width will mitigate, rather than enhance, I-78\u2019s environmental impact. <em>See </em>Admin. Record, doc. 60 (reduction of medians will minimize right-of-way and preserve parkland);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>id., </em>doc. 62 (Township of Berkeley Heights, a plaintiff in the district court proceedings, recommended reducing median). While we sympathize with the contention that \u201cdangers . .. can occur when information appears in the final EIS for the first time,\u201d <em>Appalachian Mountain Club v. Brinegar, </em>394 F.Supp. 105, 122 (D.N.H.1975),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we believe that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>certain degree of judicial flexibility is required where \u201cadditional mitigation measures implemented represent essentially a \u2018specification and modification\u2019 ... of those discussed in the EIS, which \u2018merely further reduce\u2019 [the project\u2019s] adverse effects,\u201d and where \u201call of the changes implemented constitute <em>improvements </em>in the mitigation techniques involved,\u201d <em>Concerned Citizens on 1 </em>\u2014 190 <em>v. Secretary of Transportation, </em>641 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1981). Indeed, \u201cthe responsiveness to environmental concerns demonstrated by these changes reflects a commendable effort to comply with the spirit of NEPA. A requirement that a supplemental EIS be prepared each time such improvements were instituted would surely serve as a practical deterrent to just such desirable efforts.\u201d <em>Id. See also New England Coalition on Nuclear Pollution v. United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </em>582 F.2d 87, 94 (1st Cir.1978).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that the changes in the project were not substantial enough to require the revision and recirculation of the DEIS.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We will affirm the grant of summary judgment on the substantial-changes aspect of claim 1 because appellants have not created a genuine issue of material fact on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">B. <em>New Information</em></p>\n<p id=\"Apd\">Appellants also assert that appellees should have redrafted and recirculated the DEIS because of new information that became available after the document\u2019s initial preparation and circulation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Specifically, appellants focus on six studies contained in the FEIS but undertaken after the DEIS had been circulated: (1) an air-quality report, Admin. Record, doc. 71; (2) a noise report, <em>id.; </em>(3) an ecosystems report, <em>id., </em>doc. 70; (4) an industrial-impact analysis, <em>id., </em>doe. 76; (5) new traffic studies, <em>id., </em>doc. 59; and (6) new engineering studies, <em>id., </em>doc. 60. Additionally, appellants contend that the EIS ignored the \u201cenergy crisis\u201d and its impact on the need for the proposed highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Pursuant to instructions from the district court, FHWA and NJDOT submitted a letter addressing each of the points raised by appellants. Letter from John J. Kessler, Jr., and F. Howard Zahn to Hon. Frederick B. Lacey (September 3, 1981) (discussing significance <em>vel non </em>of new studies and information), App. at A215. Appellees concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">None of the studies provided significant new information within the context of an EIS for a project alignment; none of the information would affect a decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>build or not to build or to select another alignment. The most important of the new information concerns mitigation measures: the noise study identifies benefits which justify the large added construction cost of the lowered profile (a design feature); the wetlands study finds that, wetland replacement is feasible. The other studies provided additional information which confirms the DEIS conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We considered the added studies as a normal response to DEIS and public hearing comments and to develop mitigation measures. New information was not considered significant enough to recirculate as a revised or supplemented DEIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 2-3, App. at A216-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Upon receipt of this letter, the district court undertook its own careful analysis of each of the seven issues raised by appellants and concluded that appellees reasonably could have found no need to supplement or redraft the DEIS.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Springfield II, supra, </em>slip op. at 26-33. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">In order for the network of environmental regulations to function effectively and to \u201ccreate and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331(a), federal agencies conscientiously must fulfill their continuing duty to gather, evaluate, and circulate new information relevant to the environmental impact of their proposed actions. <em>See Warm Springs Dam Task Force </em>v. <em>Gribble, supra, </em>621 F.2d at 1023; <em>Society for Animal Rights, Inc. v. Schlesinger, </em>512 F.2d 915, 917-18 (D.C.Cir. 1975); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2). The \u201cideal situation,\u201d of course, occurs when all information contained in the Final EIS [has] been circulated in the Draft EIS; however, to require such perfection under NEPA fails to recognize the reality that new and better information may become available. Prohibiting the inclusion of updated information in a Final EIS defeats the purpose behind NEPA of encouraging a full and fair consideration of environmental effects. As the Supreme Court indicated in <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. [v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 555 [98 S.Ct. 1197, 1217, 55 L.Ed.2d 460] (1978) ], and <em>ICC v. Jersey City, </em>322 U.S. 503, 514 [64 S.Ct. 1129, 1134, 88 L.Ed. 1420] ... (1944), an administrative process can never come to an end if the process must begin again every time new information is available. Inclusion of information in the Final EIS that was not circulated in the Draft EIS does not necessarily violate NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\"><em>Piedmont Heights Civic Club, Inc. v. Moreland, </em>637 F.2d 430, 442 (5th Cir.1981). <em>See also Warm Springs Dam Task Force v. Gribble, supra, </em>621 F.2d at 1024; <em>Green Mountain Grange No. One v. Lewis, supra, </em>slip op. at 17. Accordingly, we must allow involved agencies some leeway to make a reasoned determination that new studies and information do not require revising and recirculating the DEIS; to do otherwise' would wreak havoc upon the administrative process and might even discourage vigorous post-DEIS analysis of proposed projects. We have reviewed the seven points raised by appellants, and we are satisfied as to the correctness of the district court\u2019s conclusion that FHWA and NJDOT did not exceed the bounds of reasonable discretion.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>IV. <em>Adequacy of the FEIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Appellants assert in claims 3, 4, and 5 of their complaint that appellees have violated NEPA and DOTA by processing and approving the 1-78 project without adequately examining adverse environmental effects, without studying available alternatives to the proposal, and without taking all possible measures to minimize harm to protected parklands. The district court summarized appellants\u2019 major contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">(1) the EIS fails to discuss, in good faith, reasonable alternatives, such as the tunnel cut and cover alternatives, making smaller scale improvements to Routes 22, 24 and 28, making improvements in mass transportation, improving Route 22 with a double-decked roadway, designing 1-78 with 4 lanes instead of 6, and using different interchange configurations to lessen traffic on local streets; (2) ... the EIS misrepresents the trend for traffic volumes on 1-78; and (3) ... the EIS misrepresents the mix of trucks projected for 1-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\"><em>Springfield II, supra, </em>slip op. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In addition to attacking the adequacy of the EIS, appellants also have introduced the affidavits of their traffic expert, Allan Davis, a registered professional engineer. <em>See supra </em>note 23. Davis asserted that</p>\n<p id=\"AAIW\">[t]he traffic forecasting methodology [employed in the EIS] is inappropriate, inaccurate and based on false assumptions. The traffic forecasts are grossly inaccurate. These traffic forecasts are the basis for the analysis of air quality and noise impacts, for demonstrating the need for the project, and for the design of the project. The inaccuracy of the traffic forecasting has resulted in errors in all of those aspects of the FEIS and of the design.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Davis Aff. I, <em>supra </em>note 23, at 1, App. at A182. These conclusions advanced by Davis allegedly rested on <em>actual </em>traffic counts taken during periods for which, years earlier, appellees had been able to produce only forecasts. Davis thus claimed that reality \u2014 and the energy crisis \u2014 had proved ap-pellees\u2019 predictions incorrect and that traffic in the area actually had decreased, rendering construction of the new highway unnecessary. Davis also argued (apparently in the alternative) that, if the highway were in fact needed, the project nevertheless was so poorly designed that it would \u201cbe operating in a \u2018stop and go\u2019 manner within five years of [its] opening.. .. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3, App. at A184.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">The district court carefully scrutinized NJDOT\u2019s traffic studies and rejected Davis\u2019 contentions that the data therein were derived by inappropriate or inaccurate traffic-forecasting methodologies. <em>Springfield II, supra, </em>slip op. at 2-B.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The court then undertook an exhaustive, paragraph-by-paragraph dissection of the Davis affidavits, <em>id. </em>at 6-16, 33-36, and found in them nothing that impeached the accuracy of traffic forecasts in the EIS.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">The district court deemed Davis\u2019 figures misleading because Davis was working with road segments different from those that appellees had used in their own studies. The court also found that the segments discussed in the affidavit had been labeled confusingly and that Davis had employed forecasting methods different from those used by appellees. <em>Springfield II, supra, </em>slip op. at 9-11. Furthermore, the district court found internal contradictions and inconsistencies in the affidavits. <em>Id. </em>at 12-16. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Finally, the court noted that Davis \u201cdoes not state that this inaccuracy [in the traffic foreeasts] makes 1-78 unnecessary, [and] he advances no view as to how such alleged errors would affect the project as it is proposed or the alternatives which were discussed in the final EIS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> For these reasons, the court rejected the affidavits as \u201c[cjonsisting largely of unsupported opinion, and embodying, as to a critical portion, internal contradictions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, and ruled that, \u201cwhile traffic volumes on Route 22 [a nearby highway] may have decreased somewhat, the traffic projections [in the NJDOT studies] were well within the realm of accuracy and the decreas [sic] was in fact attributable to the opening of 1-78,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15-16.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The court therefore granted summary judgment on claims 3, 4, and 5 for appellees.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We first must determine the appropriate standard of review of appellees\u2019 actions. This Court has held that</p>\n<p id=\"AAS\">[t]he review of an agency decision to go forward with a major federal action after the agency has prepared and considered an Environmental Impact Statement, requires the court to determine whether all necessary procedures were followed, to consider de novo all relevant questions of law, and to examine the facts to determine whether the decision was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\"><em>Concord Township v. United States, supra, </em>625 F.2d at 1073 (footnote omitted). <em>See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 413-17, 91 S.Ct. 814, 822-824, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). The reviewing court must adopt that posture because</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">NEPA, while establishing \u201csignificant substantive goals for the Nation,\u201d imposes upon agencies duties that are \u201cessentially procedural.\u201d ... NEPA was designed \u201cto insure a fully informed and well-considered decision,\u201d but not necessarily \u201ca decision the judges of the Court of Appeals or of this Court would have reached had they been members of the decisionmaking unit of the agency.\u201d ... [0]nce an agency has made a decision subject to NEPA\u2019s procedural requirements, the only role for a court is to insure that the agency has considered the environmental consequences; it cannot \u201c \u2018interject itself within the area of discretion of the executive as to the choice of the action to be taken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kleppe v.

The four-volume FEIS itself attests to the attention paid to alternatives and mitigative measures. Moreover, the court\u2019s painstaking scrutiny of the Davis affidavits convinces us that we cannot set aside appellees\u2019 determinations on the basis of the information contained in Davis\u2019 submissions. Because appellants\u2019 submissions do not suffice to raise a genuine issue of material fact, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment for appellees on claims 3, 4, and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">V. <em>The Need for Further Public Hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Appellants next contest (claim 2) the fact that appellees have continued to process the project without holding the additional public hearings allegedly required by federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>regulations and the Action Plan.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.5(e) (1980) provides that, \u201c[i]f location approval is not <em>requested </em>within 3 years after [a] related corridor hearing [has been] held, or an opportunity for a hearing afforded, under this part, a <em>new hearing </em>must be held or the opportunity afforded for such a hearing\u201d (emphasis added); the Action Plan prepared by appellees similarly declares that \u201c[t]he opportunity for a new hearing will be afforded the public when ... location approval is not <em>requested </em>from the FHWA within three years after the date of the previous hearing or of the opportunity for a hearing afforded,\u201d Action Plan at VII-27 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">Appellants advance a two-part argument, corresponding to the two sets of public hearings that have been held during the long life of the 1-78 project. The Bureau of Public Roads originally granted location approval to NJDOT in 1959, following public hearings held in 1958. Appellants contend, however, that this approval either lapsed or was implicitly rescinded sometime between 1959 and the 1970\u2019s;<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> otherwise, appellants assert, the whole EIS process would be a \u201c \u2018post hoe rationalization for a decision already made,\u2019 \u201d <em>Springfield 1, supra, </em>slip op. at 10 (quoting appellants). The intervention of NEPA, DOTA, and FAHA, appellants say, required appellees to hold new public hearings and again request loca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>tion approval within three years of those hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">NJDOT did, in fact, hold new hearings from June 27 through July 1,1976. 2 FEIS at I-A-2. However, NJDOT did not request \u201capproval and adoption\u201d of the FEIS until June 2, 1980, nearly four years later. <em>See </em>Letter from F. Howard Zahn to John J. Kessler, Jr. (June 2, \u00cd980) (requesting adoption of FEIS by FHWA), App. at A105. Because NJDOT\u2019s request did not come within three years of the hearings, appellants conclude, NJDOT must hold yet another public hearing (or afford an opportunity for one to be held) and again request location approval from FHWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Appellees respond with two arguments. First, they assert, the 1959 location approval never was rescinded, and NJDOT is entitled to rely on its initial request for location approval as long as it does not seek to change the alignment of the highway. Second, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the 1959 location approval no longer is valid, appel-lees contend that they did in fact request location approval before July 1, 1979 (i.e., within three years of the 1976 public hearings). Appellees point to a letter from NJDOT to FHWA, dated September 25, 1978, requesting \u201cearly approval to print,\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and another letter from NJDOT to FHWA, dated March 15,1979, enclosing the FEIS \u201cfor your review and approval.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Based on these submissions, appellees argue (1) that they did timely request location approval even though they did not use the word \u201cadoption,\u201d upon which appellants place so much weight, and (2) that, at any rate, they <em>substantially </em>complied with the Action Plan and the regulations by sending the above letters to FHWA and thus should not be penalized for omitting the specific words arguably needed to effect a second request for location approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Finding a disputed issue of material fact as to \u201cwhether location approval, granted in 1959, was rescinded implicitly, and, if so, whether it was subsequently requested within three years from the last public hearing,\u201d <em>Springfield I, supra, </em>slip op. at 11, the district court initially denied appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and held two days of evidentiary hearings to resolve these issues. <em>Springfield IV, supra, </em>slip op. at 1. Appellee Kessler, of FHWA, testified at the hearings that, at the time of his appointment in 1974, he had not gone through files to determine whether the 1959 approval had been rescinded because everyone at FHWA understood that approval still to be in effect. <em>Id. </em>at 2. On behalf of NJDOT, Frank Howard Zahn, Jr., Chief of the B\u00fareau of Environmental Analysis for NJDOT, stated that he never specifically had requested location approval for 1-78 because he always believed that such approval had long since been granted. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. The district court credited the testimony of both witnesses. Id<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Appellants, for their part, neither called any witnesses of their own nor cross-examined any of appellees\u2019 witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Nor did they introduce any direct evidence showing a lapse or rescission of the 1959 location approval. Instead, appellants presented circumstantial evidence, relying heavily on transcripts of the 1976 public hearings, during which NJDOT officials represented that the agency was considering nine different locations for the highway, had not yet selected a preferred alternative, and wanted comments from the public before making any decisions.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Moreover, appellants stressed that location approval depends upon the <em>adoption, </em>not the printing or review, of the FEIS, and NJDOT did not request \u201cadoption\u201d until June 2, 1980, <em>see supra. </em>In short, appellants contended that the EIS, the public hearings, and the NJDOT officials\u2019 comments at those hearings all constituted an implicit acknowledgement that the 1959 location approval had been rescinded; if not, appellants suggested, appellees either had acted in bad faith or had engaged in a charade.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">On June 29,1982, the district court issued its opinion dealing with the evidentiary hearings held on February 8 and 17, 1982. The court reviewed the parties\u2019 contentions and declared it \u201cabundantly plain from the massive Administrative Record that the purposes of these statutory provisions were fulfilled by the public hearings which were held in 1976.\u201d <em>Springfield IV, supra, </em>slip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>op. at 16. In closing, the district judge wrote: \u201cthis court <em>finds </em>that in light of the Administrative Record and the applicable state and federal regulations, the 1959 location approval was never rescinded by FHWA and was preserved and \u2018grandfathered\u2019 by 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.4(b), 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.5(b) and the New Jersey Action Plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the court denied appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on claim 2 and granted appellees\u2019 motion therefor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">We begin our discussion by addressing what we consider to be a critical fallacy in appellants\u2019 argument: the contention that the 1959 location approval <em>must </em>either have lapsed or been rescinded because NJDOT otherwise would not have gone through the trouble of preparing an EIS, holding public hearings, cooperating with FHWA, etc. Regardless of the effectiveness <em>vel non </em>of the 1959 location approval, appellees had an <em>obligation </em>under NEPA, DOTA, and FAHA to compile an EIS and to hold the hearings; even assuming the continuing validity of the Bureau of Public Roads\u2019 1959 actions, \u201c[i]t is clear that projects in the design or pre-construction stage are subject to NEPA [as well as to other environmental statutes].\u201d <em>Concerned Citizens of Bushkill Township v. Costle, </em>592 F.2d 164, 169 (3d Cir.1979).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The 1-78 project here at issue was nowhere near completion in 1976, when NJDOT held its location hearings. Design approval had not been requested; nor had design hearings even been scheduled.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> There thus remained ample time and opportunity for appellees to conform the proposal to the requirements of NEPA, DOTA, and FAHA.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Accordingly, appellees had a duty to comply with those statutes, and their compliance thus can shed no light on the question whether the 1959 location approval remained in effect.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Two possibilities remain: the 1959 location approval retains its validity unless (1) it was rescinded as a matter of fact or (2) it lost its meaning as a matter of law. The district court, after holding evidentiary hearings, found that FHWA never rescinded the 1959 approval. <em>See Springfield IV, supra, </em>slip op. at 17. We read this statement as a finding of fact, which we must accept unless we determine it to be clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>erroneous.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> This, we cannot do. The approval therefore must stand unless it lost its effect by operation of law; indeed, appellants conceded as much at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We have held that NEPA, DOTA, and FAHA apply to the Watchung Gap project. Application of these statutes, however, does not <em>automatically </em>nullify every step taken prior to the enactment of those laws. Ap-pellees did have a duty to comply fully with NEPA, DOTA and FAHA, but they were entitled to rely on the continuing validity of the 1959 location approval as long as (1) they did not alter the alignment of the highway from that approved in 1959 <em>and </em>(2) the federal authorities involved did not decide, on the basis of the EIS and the location hearings, that construction of the highway on the location previously approved would create unacceptable environmental impacts. It is clear from the record that (1) the preferred alignment proposed in the FEIS was virtually identical<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> to that approved by the Bureau of Public Roads in 1959 and that (2) FHWA ultimately approved construction of the highway according to those plans. The two conditions having been satisfied, NJDOT did not have to make a second request for approval to build the highway along the alignment for which location approval had been granted twenty years earlier. The 1959 request for location approval thus was \u201cgrandfathered,\u201d and NJDOT therefore cannot be faulted for not following the literal language of 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 790.5(e) and the Action Plan.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Our reading of the Action Plan and of relevant federal regulations supports this conclusion. The Action Plan itself provides, at 1-4, that \u201c[t]he process described is not retroactive, and shall not apply to any step or steps taken in the development of a project prior to the time of FHWA approval.\u201d We also note that federal regulations prescribe specific procedures for projects \u201con which a hearing was held ... before January 18, 1969,\u201d but which \u201chave not received location approval\u201d;<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> the absence of comparable regulations for projects on which a hearing was held and for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>location approval was obtained prior to January 18,1969, suggests that another formal request for such approval need not be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Accordingly, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment for appellees on claim 2.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">YI. <em>Advance Acquisition of the Houdaille Quarry</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">A. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Appellees realized that construction of the highway would require the excavation and transportation of vast amounts of earth and rock. In 1979, NJDOT decided to acquire and use as a dump site the Houdaille Quarry, an inactive quarry in the Township of Springfield. No such acquisition had been mentioned in either the DEIS or the 1976 public hearings. Yet, appellees, relying on the same federal regulations invoked by appellants, see <em>infra, </em>elected to proceed without holding hearings or waiting for adoption of the FEIS and sought FHWA\u2019s approval of the acquisition in order to qualify for federal assistance. FHWA granted its conditional approval in June 1980. Letter from John J. Kessler, Jr., to Russell H. Mullen (June 26, 1980) (approving acquisition of Houdaille Quarry), App. at A150.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Claim 7 of appellants\u2019 complaint alleges that appellees approved and processed the advance acquisition of the quarry in violation of NEPA, DOTA, ERA, and, in particular, federal regulations providing that:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">(1) In extraordinary cases or emergency situations the State highway department may request and [FHWA] may approve Federal participation in the acquisition of a particular parcel or a limited number of particular parcels within the limits of a proposed highway corridor pri- or to completion of processing of the [FEIS] or adoption of the negative declaration, but only after (i) the State highway department has given official notice to the public that it has selected a particular location to be the preferred or recommended alignment for a proposed highway, or (ii) a public hearing has been held or an opportunity for such a hearing has been afforded. Proper documentation shall be submitted to show that the acquisition is in the public interest and is necessary to:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">(B) Prevent imminent development and increased costs of a parcel which would tend to limit the choice of highway alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">(4) Ultimate Federal participation in the cost of property acquired under \u00a7 712.204(d) is dependent upon the incorporation of such property in the final highway right-of-way. Where a parcel is partially incorporated, Federal participation will be in accordance with the alternative selected for statewide application pursuant to 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 710.304(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">23 C.F.R. \u00a7 712.204(d)(l)-(4) (1980). Appellants claim that appellees neglected to investigate alternatives to acquiring the quarry, as required by NEPA and DOTA. They also claim that appellees violated section 712.204(d) in that: (1) NJDOT failed to give official public notice of site selection and neither held a public hearing nor provided an opportunity for one to be held; (2) development of the quarry was not imminent and acquisition costs would not rise; and (3) the quarry site was not intended to be incorporated in the final highway right-of-way. The district court granted summary judgment for appellees, finding that they had satisfied the dictates of 23 C.F.R. \u00a7 712.204(d) as well as the general NEPA requirement of considering alternatives to the proposed course of action. We agree that the mandate of NEPA has been satisfied, but we do not believe that appellants have demonstrated the requisite standing to prosecute their section 712.204(d) claim. Accordingly, we will affirm the grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>summary judgment for appellees on claim 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">B. <em>Investigation of Alternatives</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">As the district court noted, it simply is incorrect to assert that appellees failed to consider alternatives to the taking of the quarry. <em>Springfield </em>1, <em>supra, </em>slip op. at 11. While the DEIS did not contain any mention of the plan, the FEIS did:</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Only two possible options are considered environmentally acceptable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">1. haul all excess material to the inactive Houdaille Quarry, about one mile east of Baltusrol Road in Springfield;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">2. haul the estimated two million cubic yards of earth to Houdaille Quarry, and allow the contractor to sell the estimated one million cubic yards of rock to the active Fanwood Quarry about one mile south of the project on New Providence Road in the Township of Wat-ehung.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">2 FEIS at IV-A-28.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Admittedly, the FEIS did not treat \u201cthe question of the lease as opposed to the purchase of the quarry,\u201d although leasing the quarry would have preserved the property\u2019s status as a tax ratable (a subject of concern to appellant Springfield Township). The district court determined that this factor would not \u201c \u2018significantly affect the quality of the human environment,\u2019 so as to trigger the application of the NEPA provisions. [Citation omitted.] Rather the consideration of the purchase as opposed to the lease of the quarry is economic, and does not come within the dictates of NEPA.\u201d <em>Springfield I, supra, </em>slip op. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">We believe that the district court, in so holding, took too narrow a view of NEPA. For NEPA to fulfill the vision of its drafters, the statute must encompass a broad spectrum of environmental and socioeconomic changes that would affect the quality of life. <em>See, e.g., Monarch Chemical Works, Inc. v. Thone, </em>604 F.2d 1083, 1088 (8th Cir.1979) (\u201cChanges in energy supply and demand occasioned by a federal project may be cognizable under the broad reach of NEPA.\u201d); <em>Nucleus of Chicago Homeowners Association </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>524 F.2d 225, 229 (7th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 967, 96 S.Ct. 1462, 47 L.Ed.2d 734 (1976) (policy expressed in NEPA \u201cnecessarily includes concern for the quality of urban life\u201d); <em>Hanly v. Mitchell, </em>460 F.2d 640, 647 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 990, 93 S.Ct. 313, 34 L.Ed.2d 256 (1972) (\u201c[NEPA] contains no exhaustive list of so-called \u2018environmental considerations,\u2019 but without question its aims extend beyond sewage and garbage and even beyond water and air pollution.\u201d). Consistent with these views, we hold that NEPA\u2019s scope can comprehend a substantial adverse impact upon a municipal tax base.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">Nevertheless, we are unwilling to reverse the judgment of the district court on this basis. Counsel for appellees informed us during oral argument that NJDOT has agreed to give to Union County $3,000,000, to improve the County\u2019s park system, and seventy acres of the Houdaille Quarry tract, contiguous to the Watchung Reservation, to serve as parkland. Appellees also told us during oral argument that they intend to put up for auction the remaining ninety acres of the quarry tract after dumping has been completed; thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>improved and graded land may well return to Springfield\u2019s tax rolls. These actions will mitigate \u2014 and, indeed, might even outweigh \u2014 the adverse economic impacts stemming from the purchase of the Houdaille Quarry and its removal from the tax rolls. Given these facts, it would not have been unreasonable for appellees to have concluded that the decision to purchase rather than lease the quarry did not create a substantial economic impact; moreover, any failure expressly to consider and reject the leasing alternative was, on the facts of this ease, at most harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">C. <em>Advance-Acquisition Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"aau-dedup-0\">23 C.F.R. \u00a7 712.204(d) prescribes three requirements that a state must meet in order to obtain federal funds for the advance acquisition of land to be used in a highway construction project: (1) the state must show that advance acquisition is needed to \u201c[pjrevent imminent development and increased costs of a parcel which would tend to limit the choice of highway alternatives,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 712.204(d)(1)(B); (2) the state must hold a public hearing on, or give notice to the public of, the planned acquisition, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 712.204(d)(1); and (3) the state must incorporate the acquired land in the \u201cfinal highway right-of-way,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 712.-204(d)(4). The district court held that NJDOT had satisfied all three criteria, <em>see Springfield I, supra, </em>slip op. at 11-17; appellants contest the court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We do not reach the merits of appellants\u2019 section 712.204(d) argument, however, for appellants have failed to demonstrate the requisite standing to press this claim. Relying on <em>Citizens Committee for Hudson Valley v. Volpe, </em>425 F.2d 97,105 &amp; n. 10 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 949, 91 S.Ct. 237, 27 L.Ed.2d 256 (1970), appellants urged during oral argument that the Township of Springfield had standing to assert this claim because the advance acquisition of the Houdaille Quarry would deprive the township of a sizable tax ratable, <em>see supra </em>note 48. But this contention misses the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Section 712.204(d) governs only those advance acquisitions actually made with federal funds; it does not regulate a purchase or condemnation effected by the state with its own monies. Thus, a finding that NJDOT and FHWA had violated section 712.204(d) would have meant only that NJDOT would have had to purchase the quarry with its own funds; it would not have meant that the quarry could not be purchased at all. Without deciding whether a plaintiff in Springfield\u2019s position ever can have standing to enjoin an alleged violation of section 712.204(d), we therefore hold that Springfield lacks standing to assert this claim unless it can show at least a nexus between the loss of tax revenues and the fact that federal, rather than state, funds were to be used to buy the Houdaille Quarry. The township has made no such showing on the record before us. There is no evidence that NJDOT would not have bought the quarry, or even would have delayed the acquisition, had federal monies been unavailable. The necessary nexus being lacking, appellants may not pursue their section 712.204(d) claim.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>will affirm the grant of summary judgment for appellees on claim 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">VII. <em>Miscellaneous Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We now dispose of appellants\u2019 remaining claims in a more summary fashion. In each instance, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment for appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">A. <em>Fulfillment of Conditions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">When USDOT approved the FEIS, it did so on the condition that NJDOT work closely with the various communities affected by the 1-78 project to develop plans for disposing of waste material, for grading and finishing the highway site, and for accommodating other community concerns.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Appellants allege in claim 6 that appellees \u2014 particularly NJDOT \u2014 have failed to meet US-DOT\u2019s conditions. Appellees have submitted letters purportedly showing the requisite compliance.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The district court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">That NJDOT has met with representatives of Berkeley Heights and Springfield is clear. These letters, in conjunction with the Administrative Record and the final EIS, show that NJDOT is striving to its utmost to comply with the USDOT conditions. I am convinced that the agency will continue to work closely with these communities as the project progresses in order that their concerns will be considered and resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\"><em>Springfield II, supra, </em>slip op. at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Appellants retort that the \u201cbreach of duty\u201d claim does not depend on the administrative record and that proof should rest on affidavits, documents, and testimony of witnesses. Thus, they insist, the court erred in granting summary judgment. Moreover, they add, the record was not even complete until supplemented with the two letters written by NJDOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">It is, of course, perfectly clear why those two letters did not earlier appear in the record: USDOT articulated the conditions on December 19, 1980, well after the FEIS had been printed and distributed; the letters were not written until May and July of 1981. Nor can appellants withstand summary judgment merely by asserting that appellees have breached their duty; instead, appellants must show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as to the alleged noncompliance. As appellants have not presented any evidence showing noncompliance with the conditions, the district court properly granted summary judgment for appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-17\">B. <em>Alleged Violation of the Environmental Rights Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">Appellants allege in claim 8 that the highway is being built in violation of section 2A:35A-4 of New Jersey\u2019s Environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>mental Rights Act (\u201cERA\u201d), NJ.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2A:35A-1 to -14 (West 1982), which grants a private right of action to any person seeking to enforce any statute or regulation designed to prevent or minimize pollution or destruction of the environment.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Subsection 2A:35A-4(b), however, allows such a suit \u201c[e]xcept ... where the conduct complained of constitutes a violation of a statute, regulation or ordinance which establishes a more specific standard for the control of pollution, impairment or destruction of the environment.... \u201d <em>See supra </em>note 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The district court held that appellants could not sue under subsection 2A:35A-4(a) because they had \u201cnot set forth the statute, regulation or ordinance upon which they rely to maintain [their] cause of action .... \u201d <em>Springfield II, supra, </em>slip op. at 20. The court also noted that subsection 2A:35A-4(b), by its terms, bars appellants\u2019 suit because there exists \u201ca more specific standard for the control of pollution, impairment or destruction of the environment\u201d: the Action Plan. <em>See Borough of Kenilworth v. Department of Transportation, </em>151 NJ.Super. 322, 335, 376 A.2d 1266, 1273 (App.Div.1977) (Action Plan applicable to proposed construction project constitutes \u201ca more specific standard\u201d within meaning of subsection 2A:35A-4(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">We agree that the Action Plan applies to this project and precludes appellants from maintaining a suit under subsection 2A:35A-4(b) of the ERA. We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment for appellees on claim 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">C. <em>Removal of Project from Interstate System</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Finally, appellants allege in claim 9 that the 1-78 project violates FAHA \u201cin that the Project has been found to be non-essential, other conditions required for the Project to remain as part of the interstate system as set forth in FAHA have not been met, and the Project is required to be removed from designation as a part of the interstate system.\u201d Complaint at 162, App. at A28. Appellants rely on section 102(b) of FAHA of 1976,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> which required USDOT to spend at least thirty percent of its 1978 and 1979 state apportionments to close \u201cessential gaps\u201d in the interstate system, as designated in USDOT\u2019s Interstate Gap Study. The Gap Study did not name the Watchung gap as an \u201cessential gap,\u201d though it did so label another gap in 1-78. Thus, appellants contend, federal expenditures for the Wat-chung site violated FAHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">As the district court held, <em>Springfield II, supra, </em>slip op. at 21-22, this claim has no merit. FAHA does not decree that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>only </em>\u201cessential gaps\u201d may receive federal funding; rather, the statute merely accords to \u201cessential gaps\u201d priority over only thirty percent of the monies at issue. What US-DOT does with the remaining seventy percent is not determined by FAHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Appellants also assert that appellees failed to comply with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(g) (1976),<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> which provides for removal from the interstate system of any segment for which a state has not presented by July 1, 1975, a \u201cschedule for the expenditure of funds for completion of construction of such segment....\u201d The district court found that NJDOT had submitted to FHWA the requisite schedules and accompanying information by letter dated June 13,1975, thereby satisfying section 103(b) of FAHA. <em>Springfield II, supra, </em>slip op. at 23. We find no error in the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">We will affirm in full the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\">. The location of the highway initially was approved in 1959, prior to the enactment of NEPA, DOTA, and FAHA.

The district court stated in its opinion that a \u201crule of reason\u201d applies in reviewing the comprehensiveness of an EIS. See <em>Springfield II, supra, </em>slip op. at 2. On the surface, this \u201crule of reason\u201d might seem to clash with <em>Concord Township\u2019s </em>enunciation of an arbitrary-and-capricious or abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Cf. Township of Lower Alloways Creek v. Public Serv.

We note first that, to the extent that application of the \u201crule of reason\u201d <em>does </em>conflict with <em>Concord Township, </em>appellants have had the benefit of a standard of review <em>less </em>deferential to agency action than that employed in <em>Concord Township. </em>We do not believe, however, that the \u201crule of reason\u201d articulated by the district court necessarily is inconsistent with <em>Concord Township.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The Supreme Court has stated that \u201cdetailed statements] of alternatives\u201d cannot be found wanting simply because the agency failed to include every alternative device and thought conceivable by the mind of man. Time and resources are simply too limited to hold that an impact statement fails because the agency failed to ferret out every possible alternative, regardless of how uncommon or unknown that alternative may have been at the time the project was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\"><em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., supra, </em>435 U.S. at 551 [98 S.Ct. at 1215]. Similarly, the Fourth Circuit has held that,</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">[s]o long as there are unexplored and undis-cussed alternatives that inventive minds can suggest, without a rule of reason, it will be technically impossible to prepare a literally correct environmental impact statement and literally impossible for a state highway department to report ... the final decision on the route of a federal highway to the federal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\"><em>Fayetteville Area Chamber of Commerce v.

Under this approach, the \u201crule of reason\u201d is what a court invokes when faced with the contention that the agency never considered certain information or alternatives at all: if the only alternatives not explored are those that it was not rational for the agency to have explored, the agency acted properly. The arbitrary-and-capricious standard, on the other hand, would apply when the court reviews how the agency dealt with the information and alternatives it did consider. Accordingly, under the district court\u2019s approach, we can require an agency to consider only what it reasonably should have considered; the consideration it actually accorded is subject to a more deferential standard of review. \u2022 This result would not appear to conflict with <em>Concord Township.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b519-5\">.

Commissioner Alan Sagner spoke at those hearings for NJDOT:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019m coming before you this evening, the first day of the 1-78 Public Hearing, so that I might elaborate on the purpose of this Hearing and emphasize the importance, if that\u2019s necessary, and my personal concern about the project. For four days and evenings the focus of the 1-78 project will shift completely from Departmental Headquarters, in Trenton, to this school building in Berkeley Heights. Here it will be up to you, the people who live, work, and commute in this area, to state your case and to speak your mind on whether or not the Department should recommend the proposed completion of 1-78 in Union and Somerset Counties, and if so, along which of the nine alternatives presently under consideration ....</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">As I\u2019m here before you today, much prior to my communicating my recommended course of action to the Federal Highway Administration, I can honestly tell you that at this time the Department has not selected a preferred alternate, nor have I attempted to narrow the field of alternatives. However, the time for beginning the evaluation that will lead to making a full decision is close at hand. That process started once this week\u2019s Public Hearings is [sic] completed and a designated period for submitting written testimony is closed, cannot be effective or realistic unless in [sic] considers public input, along with the engineering, and environmental data presented here this evening. I am, therefore, urging you to take advantage of this week\u2019s public Hearing to present the type of constructive and well documented testimony that will permit me to make a recommendation that most effectively meets the needs of the public. Admin. Record, doc. 176, App. at Al 12-13. Furthermore, an NJDOT press release, dated June 22, 1976, announced that \u201c[t]he purpose of the hearing is to afford citizens the opportunity to participate in the process of determining whether a five-mile link of Route 78 in Union County should be constructed and if so, along which of the alignments under consideration.\u201d App. at A123.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\">. Because the date of the location-approval request was so critical to appellants\u2019 case, appellants filed a Second Request for Production of Documents and sought discovery of documents constituting \u201crequests for location approval\u201d made in connection with other FHWA projects. App. at A278. Appellants\u2019 idea was \u201cto ascertain ... what format or words were routinely used in other cases to request location approval,\u201d Brief for Appellants at 35, because \u201c[appellants\u2019] position throughout this case has been that location approval is requested by some kind of a document saying, in essence, \u2018we hereby request location approval,\u2019 \u201d id., and that requests for review or for approval to print do not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">The court held a hearing on appellants\u2019 motion to compel production, App. at A303, and denied discovery, seeking \u201cto limit the matter ... to the administrative record\u201d and finding \u201cno demonstration here that other projects ... have any bearing on the project that is here at issue.\u201d <em>Township of Springfield v. Goldsch-midt, </em>No. 81-123 (D.N.J. Jan. 28, 1982) (Transcript of Proceedings), at 10, App. at A312. We cannot say that the court abused its discretion in restricting the scope of the proceedings to the administrative record. Moreover, our disposition of claim 2 renders any error in this regard unimportant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b522-5\">. <em>See also Louisiana Environmental Soc'y, Inc. v.

In each of those cases, construction had begun or plans had been finalized before the enactment of the environmental statutes at issue. Such was not the case with the 1-78 project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b522-15\">. We also question whether actions and statements of individual state officials, <em>see supra </em>note 36, could rescind approval granted by the federal Government. We need not address this issue, however, for we decide the master on other grounds, <em>see infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b523-6\">. <em>See Krasnov v.

It appears from the FEIS that the original 1959 alignment differed from the preferred 1976 alignment in only two respects: a 7,500-foot stretch of roadway at the eastern end of the gap was realigned slightly to the north, to move the highway \u201cas far out of the wetlands as possible without severely encroaching on the Commonwealth Water Company Well Field or creating extreme excavations into the hillside north of Glenside Avenue,\u201d 2 FEIS at IVA-l; the route also was realigned slightly to the south near the Sayre House \u201cto minimize the impact on that historic property,\u201d <em>id. </em>at IV-A-2. <em>See also </em>1 FEIS Exhibit S-4 and 4 FEIS Exhibits IX-P and -Q (maps showing various alignments). These changes are negligible and were effected to modify adverse environmental impacts. Furthermore, appellants do not appear to base their claim on the differences between the original (1959) and preferred (1976) alignments. Hence, we shall treat the alignment discussed in the FEIS as indistinguishable from that approved in 1959 by the Bureau of Public Roads.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b523-10\">. <em>Cf. </em>23 C.F.R. \u00a7 771.4(b) (1980) (provisions of section regulating EIS procedure \u201cdo not apply to or in any way affect or alter decisions, approvals, or authorizations which were given by the FHWA pursuant to directives then in effect\u201d); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 771.5(b) (development of EIS must be completed \u201cprior to the selection of a particular location; except for those highway sections to which this part applies that had received location approval prior to the effective date of this part\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b523-11\">.

We therefore do not reach the question whether NJDOT effectively requested location approval within three years of the 1976 public hearings. Without commenting on the validity of the asserted substantial-compliance doctrine, however, we note that appellees certainly have complied substantially with the various statutes and regulations at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b525-11\">. \u201cUnder both options, the Houdaille Quarry would be graded to facilitate private development or recreational use by the State or County.\u201d <em>Id </em>at IV-A-29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b525-12\">. While the financial considerations involved in the cost of obtaining the use of the quarry by either purchase or lease might not seem of great importance in evaluating the total costs of constructing the highway, these considerations would appear to have substantial impact on a single township \u2014 in this case, the appellant Township of Springfield. We are satisfied that, in this case, the financial impact was sufficiently serious to fall within the ambit of NEPA. The Houdaille Quarry paid $83,832.64 in property taxes to Springfield in 1980, which amount represented almost one percent of the township\u2019s total tax levy. See Letter from James R. Zazzali to Hon. Frederick B. Lacey (July 24, 1981) (containing document entitled \u201cFilling of Houdaille Quarry\u201d), App. at A469, A473. We therefore are not dealing with a situation in which the lost tax ratable constitutes only a miniscule part of the municipal tax base.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">. Appellants have asserted that NJDOT had no need to buy the land at all and that the agency could have followed the procedures established in N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 27:7-66 and -67 (West 1982), whereby the state simply could file a map with the municipal clerk designating the proposed line of the highway. This map then would operate as a temporary stay on development of the site, giving NJDOT an opportunity to make recommendations as to any changes affecting that land. Because appellants\u2019 contention arguably might be construed as a pendent state claim against the advance acquisition separate from the \u00a7 712.204(d) claim, we note our agreement with the district court\u2019s conclusion that N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 27:7-66 and -67 do not foreclose NJDOT\u2019s actions. We do not read \u00a7\u00a7 27:7-66 and -67 as giving NJDOT the absolute right to block development; to the extent that they might have that practical effect, however, these statutes appear to have been enacted in order to give the state the option of preserving a proposed site without having to buy it. There is no indication that \u00a7\u00a7 27:7-66 and -67 were intended to preclude the state from actually purchasing the land. <em>Cf. Kingston East Realty Co. v. State, By Comm\u2019r of Transp., </em>133 N.J.Super. 234, 336 A.2d 40 (App.Div.1975) (reservation of land pursuant to statutory scheme neither constitutes a taking nor compels state to institute condemnation proceedings). NJDOT therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>was free to proceed by acquisition and without regard to \u00a7\u00a7 27:7-66 and -67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b527-11\">.
