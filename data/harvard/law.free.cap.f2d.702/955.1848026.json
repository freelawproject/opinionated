The essential features of the complicated alternative plan can be summarized as follows. The plan sets \u201cprospective\u201d reimbursement rates, reimbursing hospitals for costs they expect to incur under the Medicaid program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After disallowing some types of costs, the plan distinguishes between educational, capital and operating costs. It departs from the Medicare methodology by <em>inter alia </em>limiting the amount of reimbursable capital and operating costs. Hospitals whose average unused capacity exceeds 50% of available licensed beds are reimbursed for less than all capital costs. The limitation on operating costs is achieved by dividing hospitals into classes according to their rural or urban locations and licensed bed sizes. Within each class the maximum amount of reimbursable operating costs is measured by the class\u2019s mean operating costs, plus one standard deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-21\">Pursuant to the former code provision and accompanying regulations, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) formally approved the plan. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(D) (1976);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 447.261-447.316 (1979). While HHS\u2019s formal approval of the plan was pending, however, Congress had revised the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>code provision. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) (West Supp.1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-3\">The new provision, in an attempt to discourage soaring medical costs and upgrade the role of the states, differs from its predecessor in several ways. First, Congress altered the general standard used to assess reimbursement rates devised by the states. Under the former code provision, states must reimburse hospitals for the reasonable costs of Medicaid services. Because Congress considered this reasonable cost standard inflationary,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it lowered the threshold of permissible reimbursement rates, requiring that states reimburse \u201cthe costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities.... \u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) (West Supp.1982). Second, Congress identified two special situations to which a state\u2019s reimbursement methodology must speak. The state\u2019s methods must \u201ctake into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients\u201d and \u201cprovide, in the case of hospital patients receiving services at an inappropriate level of care ..., for lower reimbursement rates reflecting the level of care actually received. ...\u201d Third, the new provision uses different language to describe the role of the Secretary in assessing methodologies proposed by the states. Whereas the former provision stated that state plans shall be \u201creviewed and approved by the Secretary,\u201d the new provision provides that the state must find and make \u201cassurances satisfactory to the Secretary\u201d that the methodology fulfills statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Shortly after the above changes became law, the Alabama Hospital Association and ten Alabama hospitals filed suit to enjoin implementation of the plan, alleging the invalidity of the plan under the revised statute. Based on HHS\u2019s failure to review the plan in light of the new statute, the district court temporarily enjoined implementation of the plan pending completion of proceedings before it. HHS subsequently approved the plan in light of the new statute, concluding that the state had given satisfactory assurances of compliance. Following a trial on the merits, the district court held that HHS had properly approved the plan under the new statute and dissolved the temporary injunction it had issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">On appeal plaintiffs argue that viewed in light of the new code provision HHS\u2019s approval of the plan cannot stand because (1) HHS failed to promulgate standards defining the efficient cost standard; (2) the state did not submit to HHS the information required by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.255(b) (1981); (3) the plan does not take into account the situation of hospitals serving a disproportionate number of indigent patients; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>(4) the plan does not reduce rates for patients receiving an inappropriate level of care. We reject the first three arguments and accept the fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">I. <em>Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">The current statute provides that the state must find and make \u201cassurances satisfactory to the Secretary\u201d that its reimbursement rates \u201care reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities.... \u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) (West Supp.1982). Citing <em>Alabama Nursing Home Association v. Harris, </em>617 F.2d 388 (5th Cir.1980),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appellants argue that HHS\u2019s approval of the plan is invalid because neither the Secretary nor the state has defined \u201cthe costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities.\u201d We find it unnecessary to decide the merits of appellants\u2019 contentions because, assuming arguendo that the contested phrase requires further definition, the failure to formulate such a definition constitutes harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">Courts have not hesitated to apply a harmless error rule where the agency has committed an error that clearly had no bearing on its substantive decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1976) (court reviewing agency action shall take \u201cdue account ... of the rule of prejudicial error\u201d);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>U.S. Steel Corp. v. EPA, </em>595 F.2d 207, 215 (5th Cir.1979); <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Exchange Security Bank, </em>529 F.2d 1214,1216-17 (5th Cir.1976); <em>Dodson v. National Transportation Safety Board, </em>644 F.2d 647, 652 (7th Cir.1981); <em>Consolidated Gas Supply v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, </em>606 F.2d 323, 328-29 (D.C.Cir.1979). <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here it is clear that the plan\u2019s reimbursement levels will satisfy whatever standards the Secretary adopts to define \u201ccosts which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">HHS approved the plan under the \u201creasonable cost\u201d standard contained in the former code provision, a standard which is more generous from the appellants\u2019 perspective. Congress, in replacing the reasonable cost standard with one based on considerations of efficiency and economy, intended to give the states flexibility to lower reimbursement levels below those required by the reasonable cost standard. Because the new \u201cefficient cost\u201d standard is designed to lower the threshold of permissible reimbursement rates,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rates properly approved under the reasonable cost standard will satisfy the new efficient cost standard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Appellants, however, do not contend that HHS\u2019s approval of the plan\u2019s reimbursement rates under the reasonable cost standard was based on flawed regulations or an inadequate application of its regulations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In fact, they offer no plausible reason why the agency, after approving the plan under the more restrictive reasonable cost standard, might reach a different result under a suitably defined efficient cost standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">Appellants, for instance, dispute the reasonableness of the plan\u2019s low occupancy penalty and its rural/urban and bed size classifications. In approving the plan under the reasonable cost standard, however, HHS, after explicitly analyzing these issues, specifically found the low occupancy penalty and the challenged classifications reasonable. <em>See </em>Memorandum from Robert Streiner, Director of HHS Division of Alternative Reimbursement Systems, to George R. Holland, HHS Regional Administrator (Aug. 7, 1981) (recommending plan\u2019s approval). Yet appellants do not explain why the agency\u2019s presumptively valid conclusion, <em>see Johnson\u2019s Professional Nursing Home v. Weinberger, </em>490 F.2d 841, 844 (5th Cir.1974), is invalid under the reasonable cost standard or, more to the point, the efficient cost standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-11\">Appellants also object to the plan\u2019s failure to allow reimbursement for bad debts and telephone services, costs which the appellants argue must be incurred by an efficiently and economically operated hospital. This argument is devoid of merit. The Medicare reimbursement methodology that serves as the absolute upper limit on repayment under the former reasonable cost standard generally disallows both types of costs. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 405.420, 405.451 (1979). In revising the statute Congress sought to move away from the inflationary Medicare reimbursement methodology. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Appellants\u2019 argument ignores the intent underlying the recent enactment. Congress intended the efficient cost standard to reduce, not increase, the permissible level of reimbursement below that available under Medicare principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">Appellants thus make no colorable argument that HHS improperly approved the plan\u2019s general structure under the reasonable cost standard and that HHS, had it properly applied the new efficient cost standard would not have approved this structure. In this context, we hold that HHS\u2019s alleged error in failing adequately to elaborate the efficient cost standard is harmless.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We see no reason to require HHS to refine an analysis when, seen in light of appellants\u2019 own contentions, refinement would appear unnecessary, duplicative and wasteful.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">II. <em>Informational Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">Appellants object to the state\u2019s failure to submit to HHS the information required by HHS\u2019s regulations. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.255 (1981).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These informational requirements are largely designed to facilitate HHS\u2019s decision regarding whether a state\u2019s reimbursement rates satisfy the efficient cost standard. Consistent with the analysis in the preceding section, we hold that HHS\u2019s approval under the reasonable cost standard, coupled with appellants\u2019 failure to object colorably to HHS\u2019s analysis, render any noncompliance with informational requirements harmless error.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">III. <em>Hospitals Serving Low Income Patients</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">The new statute requires that the reimbursement rates devised by the state \u201ctake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs.... \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A). In their initial brief appellants faulted the plan for failing specifically to address the special needs of such hospitals. Since that time, however, the state has amended its plan to accommodate the situation of hospitals serving large numbers of indigent patients. Although appellants, in their reply brief, do not challenge the adequacy of the amendment, they urge this court to hold that the unamended plan violates the statute. Otherwise, they assert, the state might rescind the amendment. Appellants\u2019 objections to the unamended plan are moot, and we decline to evaluate its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">Newly promulgated administrative regulations can have the effect of mooting a previously viable case. <em>See Sannon v. U.S., </em>631 F.2d 1247, 1250-51 (5th Cir.1980). As articulated by the Supreme Court, the general test is whether \u201c\u2018the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>County of Los Angeles v. Davis, </em>440 U.S. 625, 631, 99 S.Ct. 1379, 1383, 59 L.Ed.2d 642 (1979) (quoting <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 496, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 1950, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969)). Appellants\u2019 objections to the plan here are no longer \u201clive\u201d because they neither request any relief, such as money damages, for the period during which the unamended and allegedly insufficient plan was in effect nor question the adequacy of the amendment. The mere possibility that the state might rescind its recent amendment does not, for purpose of mootness, enliven the controversy. The issue is moot unless there is a \u201c <em>\u2018reasonable expectation </em>... \u2019 that the alleged violation will recur.... \u201d 440 U.S. at 631, 99 S.Ct. at 1383 (quoting <em>U.S. v. W.T. Grant Co., </em>345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 897, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953)) (emphasis added). Nor does this issue come within the well-recognized exception for alleged violations \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review.\u201d <em>See Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, </em>219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911). The appellants may, without undue difficulty, assert their objections against the unamended plan if and when the state rescinds the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">IV. <em>Inappropriate Level of Care</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">The revised code provision declares that \u201c[a] state plan for medical assistance <em>must </em>provide ... in the case of hospital patients receiving services at an inappropriate level of care ... for lower reimbursement rates reflecting the level of care actually received....\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) (West Supp.1982) (emphasis added). This language speaks to the situation where the hospital extends inpatient services to a patient who needs less expensive \u201cpost-hospital extended care services.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(G), 1396a(a)(13)(A) (West Supp.1982). The appellants argue that the plan is deficient for failing to address Congress\u2019s concern that reimbursement rates account for patients who receive but do not medically need inpatient treatment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">The statute\u2019s express language affirmatively obligates the state to provide in its reimbursement plan for lower payment rates for patients who do not need inpatient care. HHS\u2019s regulations, restating the statute, also mandate inclusion of such a provision. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.252(a)(3)(ii) (1981).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We therefore hold that the statute and its accompanying regulations require that the reimbursement rates specified in the plan account for patients receiving an \u201cinappropriate level of care,\u201d as illuminated by 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395x(v)(l)(G) (West Supp.1982). To this extent HHS erred in approving the plan, because the plan contains no provision accounting for patients receiving an inappropriate level of care. Even assuming, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>appellees argue, that the revised provision reduces the level of scrutiny HHS must give state plans,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the Secretary has no discretion to approve a plan that on its face fails to fulfill the statute\u2019s plain requirements.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We accordingly remand to the district court so that it may devise an appropriate equitable remedy. Because we have upheld the plan\u2019s general structure against appellants\u2019 challenges, the district court may, pending development of an appropriate provision that accounts for patients receiving an inappropriate level of care, choose not to suspend operation of the plan altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">We AFFIRM in part, REVERSE in part and REMAND for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1032-15\">.

With States facing hospital cost escalation exceeding the rate of inflation and recent American Hospital Association data showing annual hospital cost increases of 20 percent, States could achieve significant savings in their Medicaid program by reducing hospital costs.

Our conclusion does not conflict with <em>Kollett v. Harris, </em>619 F.2d 134, 146 (1st Cir.1980) where the court, after identifying procedural error, refused to assume that the error was harmless. Our holding is not based on a mere assumption. Rather, it rests on HHS\u2019s decision made under a standard more favorable to appellants than that contained in the current code. If HHS properly applied the reasonable cost standard, and appellants do not suggest otherwise, logic virtually compels the conclusion the plan also satisfies the efficient cost standard. This peculiar feature of the case distinguishes it from <em>Alabama Nursing Home, supra, </em>and <em>Arnold v. Morton, </em>529 F.2d 1101, 1105 (9th Cir.1976) (where agency failed to address issues legally relevant to its decision, court must be subjectively certain that agency\u2019s result is correct before error deemed harmless).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">. Our disposition of this issue makes it unnecessary to decide whether and to what extent the new statute has diminished HHS\u2019s role in insuring that a state\u2019s methodology fulfills statutory requirements. <em>Compare </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(D) (1976) (plans shall be \u201creviewed and approved by the Secretary\u201d) <em>with </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) (West Supp. 1982) (state shall find and make assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that plan satisfies statute). <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 97-139, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. <em>reprinted in </em>1981 U.S.Code, Cong. &amp; Ad.News 396, 744; H. Conference Rep. No. 96-1479, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code, Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5944 (explaining provision after which \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) was modeled). <em>See also Mendoza v. HHS, </em>655 F.2d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">. (b) Related information. The Medicaid agency must submit, with the assurances described in \u00a7 447.252(c), the following information:</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">(1) The amount of the average proposed payment rate for each type of provider (hospital, SNF, ICF, or ICF/MR), and the amount by which that average rate increased or decreased relative to the average payment rate in effect for each type of provider for the immediately preceding rate period;</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">(2) A quantified estimate of the short-term and, to the extent feasible, long-term effect the change in the rate will have on\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">(i) The availability of services on a Statewide and geographic area basis;</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">(ii) The type of care furnished (for example, secondary or tertiary care);</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-16\">(iii) The extent of provider participation; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-17\">(iv) The degree to which costs are covered in hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1036-18\">. Besides relating to the efficient cost criterion, some of the required information serves the arguably distinct purpose of allowing HHS to assess the effect a state\u2019s reimbursement rates will have on the availability of Medicaid services. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.255(b)(2)(i-iii) (1981). It is highly unlikely, however, that the absence of such information affected HHS\u2019s decision. In evaluating reimbursement rates under the reasonable cost standard, it appears that HHS considered the effect the plan\u2019s rules would have on the quality and availability of care. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.262(d)(3) (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">. (ii) The methods and standards used to determine payment rates must provide that reimbursement for hospital patients receiving services at an inappropriate level of care under conditions similar to those described in .section 1861(v)(l)(G) of the Act will be made at lower rates, reflecting the level of care actually received, in a manner consistent with section 1861(v)(l)(G); ....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1038-12\">.

The language in the current provision describing HHS\u2019s role in reviewing a state\u2019s plan was drawn from a provision relating, <em>inter alia, </em>to reimbursement of \u201cskilled ursing facilities.\u201d P.L. 96-499, \u00a7 962, 94 Stat. 2650-51 (1980) formerly codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(E). In explaining that provision, the Conference Committee stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-26\">[Wjhile the States have discretion to develop methods and standards on which the rates of reimbursement are based, the Secretary retains final authority to review the rates and to disapprove those rates if they do not meet the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"ARU\">H.
