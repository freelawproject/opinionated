Here grand jury subpoenas duces tecum seek to compel production of evidence used in a bankruptcy proceeding \u2014 the transcript of a witness\u2019 deposition and certain corporate records. Appellants have resisted compliance, claiming that an agreement of confidentiality regarding the deposition and a settlement agreement, which placed the corporate records under a protective order and directed them sealed, shield these items from compelled production.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b495-24\">We sketch briefly the background from which this case arose. Frigitemp, a New York corporation formerly engaged in ma-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ri\u00f1e construction, did substantial business with General Dynamics Corporation, including subcontracting work on vessels being built by General Dynamics at its shipyards in Quincy, Massachusetts. At the time when Frigitemp was involved in this subcontracting, P. Takis Veliotis was General Manager of the General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division, and George C. Davis was serving as Senior Vice President of Frigitemp in charge of its Quincy subcontracting work. In early 1978 Davis formed a new corporation \u2014 appellant Intersystems Design and Technology Corporation (IDT) \u2014and a month or so later Frigitemp filed a petition in bankruptcy in the Southern District of New York. General Dynamics promptly terminated Frigitemp\u2019s Quincy subcontracts and awarded them to IDT.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Shortly after Frigitemp filed its petition, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York commenced a criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy. In January 1980 Bankruptcy Judge Lewittes of the Southern District of New York authorized the trustee in bankruptcy of the Frigitemp estate to investigate causes of action available to the estate, including so-called \u201cbusiness crimes\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> involving Davis, IDT and several General Dynamics employees. In February 1980 the trustee, utilizing the provisions of Bankruptcy Rule 205, sought to examine General Dynamics by deposing several of its employees, including Veliotis. Because the parties were located in Quincy, ancillary proceedings were conducted before the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts. Those to be deposed appeared by counsel who requested a protective order. After a series of hearings before Bankruptcy Judge Lavien of the District of Massachusetts, an \u201cunderstanding\u201d was reached that afforded limited protection to portions of the testimony and accompanying documents which were later to be designated as containing confidential business information and/or scurrilous allegations of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The Southern District Bankruptcy Court, in June 1980, approved a protective order which restricted the trustee\u2019s access to and use of confidential information contained in business records belonging to Davis and IDT. The trustee was only allowed to view these records in counsel\u2019s office and could not make copies. However, paragraph 9 of the order provided that \u201cNothing herein shall preclude IDT from disclosing any confidential information to any person or entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In April 1981 a settlement agreement was reached between Davis, IDT and the trustee which required IDT to pay $1.4 million to the Frigitemp estate. It also required the trustee to turn over to IDT all his copies of transcripts of the examinations taken under Rule 205 and exhibits marked at those examinations. The originals were filed with the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court under seal until the Frigitemp estate was closed, at which time they were to be destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">A grand jury is currently investigating the claimed diversion of $5 million from Frigitemp through bribery, alleged kickbacks, embezzlement and fraudulent misappropriation by means of fictitious invoices and contracts. Appellant Davis is a target of this investigation. In early 1982 grand jury subpoenas duces tecum (which are the subject of this appeal) were issued to Davis and IDT requiring production of the corporate documents discussed above. A similar subpoena was issued to General Dynamics calling for the production of a variety of documents, including the transcript of Vel-iotis\u2019 testimony taken at the Rule 205 examination. The government also moved the Bankruptcy Court for an order permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>it access to the materials under seal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> General Dynamics has turned over all the requested records in its possession except the Veliotis transcript. Davis has produced some but not all of the records subpoenaed from him and IDT.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Veliotis was permitted to intervene in order to argue against production of his testimony. On appeal he asserts that General Dynamics need not turn over to the grand jury the transcript of his Rule 205 testimony because he relied on the understanding of confidentiality described above before agreeing to testify. Davis and IDT contend that the terms to the protective order of June 1980 shield them from any obligation to produce the subpoenaed corporate documents; they also urge that the settlement agreement and consequent sealing by the Bankruptcy Court foreclose access by the United States Attorney and the grand jury to those sealed documents in the Clerk\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In pressing their arguments before us appellants rely heavily on our decision in <em>Martindell v. International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., </em>594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir.1979) (Mansfield, J.). In <em>Martindell </em>we were faced with the government\u2019s formal and informal attempts to secure evidence covered by a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) protective order issued in a civil suit to which it was not a party. In our analysis we stated that the function of a Rule 26(c) protective order is to \u201csecure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination\u201d of civil disputes. We also noted the policy consideration that encouragement of full disclosure of all relevant evidence is a key objective in the true administration of justice. The court recognized that without enforcement of a Rule 26(c) protective order witnesses might frequently refuse to testify if the government, in disregard of the order, could use the witnesses\u2019 testimony for criminal investigatory purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 295-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Regarding the government\u2019s efforts to obtain the information in <em>Martindell </em>by means of a telephone call and letter to the court, we held that the government\u2019s power to investigate, including use of the grand jury process, cannot be enhanced by such attempts to circumvent a protective order issued in a civil suit. We thus rejected the government\u2019s informal attempt to insinuate itself into private litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">The government, after being granted the status of a permissive intervenor, formally sought modification of the protective order to allow it access to certain deposition testimony. Since the deposed witnesses in <em>Mar-tindell </em>had testified in reliance on confidentiality guaranteed by a formal protective order, the government\u2019s motion for modification was denied. The court reasoned that the government had failed to show the element of extraordinary need necessary to obtain modification of a protective order because it still had available its usual arsenal of investigatory weapons, including use of the grand jury process. Specifically reserved was the issue of whether the government might be entitled to enforcement of a subpoena compelling production of civilly protected depositions. <em>See Martindell, </em>594 F.2d at 296 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">Ranged against these considerations are the reasons for permitting the grand jury broad subpoena power in a criminal investigation. The awesome power of the government to use the inquisitional function of the grand jury in the compulsion of witnesses\u2019 attendance before it has been recognized since our country\u2019s founding. <em>Blair v. United States, </em>250 U.S. 273, 280, 39 S.Ct. 468, 470, 63 L.Ed. 979 (1919). The grand jury\u2019s authority to subpoena witnesses because \u201cthe public .. . has a right to every man\u2019s evidence\u201d is essential to its task. <em>Branzburg </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>408 U.S. 665, 688, 92 S.Ct. 2646, 2660, 33 L.Ed.2d 626 (1972). A grand jury has wide ranging authority to inquire into suspected viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tions of the criminal law; and to effectuate such investigations it may compel the production of documentary evidence or the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary. <em>See United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 343, 94 S.Ct. 613, 617, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). While the power to summon and the correlative duty of the person summoned to appear is subject to some exceptions, <em>see Branzburg, </em>408 U.S. at 688, 92 S.Ct. at 2660, <em>e.g., </em>a Fifth Amendment claim of self-incrimination, the scope of a grand jury\u2019s power to investigate is not narrowly limited, <em>see Blair, </em>250 U.S. at 282, 39 S.Ct. at 471. Wide latitude in gathering evidence is vital to the grand jury\u2019s investigative function. Every piece of information bearing on the investigation has importance in the deliberations since the nature of the crime and the identity of the accused are decisions made by the grand jury at the conclusion of its inquiry, not at the beginning. <em>See id. </em>at 282, 39 S.Ct. at 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The conflict between protection of private material used in a civil proceeding and public need in a criminal prosecution initially posed is easily resolved in this case. Absent applicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted Fifth Amendment privilege, no shield protects the civil evidence here from compellable production before the grand jury which subpoenaed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Veliotis\u2019 reliance on <em>Martindell </em>is misplaced because his situation is entirely different from that presented in our prior decision. A brief review of the manner in which the \u201cunderstanding of confidentiality\u201d was reached in this case demonstrates this. On the morning of February 19, 1980, prior to the examination of Veliotis, counsel for General Dynamics requested of Judge Lavien that \u201cthe papers in this proceeding,\u201d particularly an affidavit and memorandum filed by the trustee and the transcript of the instant discussion, be placed under seal because of \u201callegations that have been made about individuals at General Dynamics\u201d which were \u201cinappropriate and scandalous.\u201d The trustee\u2019s attorney consented, except that he wanted the documents to be available \u201cto the Courts.\u201d Judge Lavien suggested that the lawyers draw up a stipulation. Later that day General Dynamics\u2019 counsel requested that any documents supplied be maintained \u201con a confidential basis\u201d and \u201cunder a stipulation of confidentiality\u201d because they included \u201cconfidential business information.\u201d The court responded that this was not customary and that the record in this case was not such as would require that everything be sealed. Judge Lavien then instructed counsel for General Dynamics that anything produced which counsel thought contained any \u201cproprietary or confidential business information\u201d should be so labeled and, absent disagreement from the opposition, would not be \u201cmade available for public dissemination.\u201d Significantly, no stipulation of confidentiality was ever reduced to writing, no formal protective order was ever issued by Judge Lavien, and no documents or testimony were ever designated as containing proprietary or confidential business information.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Thus, while <em>Martindell </em>involved a formal protective order issued under Rule 26(c), here there was simply an \u201cunderstanding of confidentiality.\u201d Further, the government in <em>Martindell </em>was proceeding outside of its usual investigative powers to secure the requested testimony, not by grand jury subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Finally and most crucially, there is no indication that Veliotis agreed to testify only in reliance on the \u201cunderstanding.\u201d He has not shown us any evidence that he ever designated any of his testimony as containing confidential information, as required by the \u201cunderstanding.\u201d He now claims that the understanding extended beyond that reached in court, due to an alleged out-of-court agreement between counsel. But a court cannot be expected to enforce an agreement of this nature which was never placed before it for approval and which has not even been reduced to writing. Were Veliotis truly concerned about his Fifth Amendment privilege, he would have insisted on something more than an out-of-court discussion or the very limited \u201cunder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>standing\u201d outlined by Judge Lavien, before he agreed to testify. He could, for instance, have asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege at the time. <em>Cf. Garner v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 648, 653-56, 96 S.Ct. 1178, 1181-1183,47 L.Ed.2d 370 (1976) (under certain circumstances, failure to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege constitutes waiver of the privilege). His argument that he did not believe it necessary to claim the constitutional privilege because of his reliance on the \u201cunderstanding\u201d is undercut by the fact that he apparently never availed himself of the protection afforded him. He has not shown that he in any way indicated which portions of his testimony- were confidential and thereby included within the coverage of the understanding. Consequently, his argument that his Rule 205 testimony is \u201carguably\u201d self-incriminating is now ineffectual.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We next consider the claims of Davis and IDT. As for the copies of the requested documents sought directly from Davis and IDT, paragraph 9 of the protective order, relied on by appellants to resist compliance, itself permits dissemination of these papers to anyone, <em>i.e., </em>to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">As for those copies under seal in the Bankruptcy Court, access to sealed court records is ordinarily obtained by a request addressed to the discretion of the trial court which determines the question in light of the relevant circumstances, <em>cf. Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 589, 599, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 1312-1313, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978) (upheld district court\u2019s denial of access by third party to former President\u2019s tapes used in previous court proceedings). In view of the fact that paragraph 9 of the protective order specifically permitted IDT to disclose \u201cto any person or entity\u201d information contained in the same corporate documents sought from the court, modification of the sealing order was well within the lower courts\u2019 discretion. Moreover, these records existed prior to the advent of the litigation and before the settlement agreement, which also contains a sealing provision, was entered into. As such they were previously subject to subpoena and cannot now be protected from grand jury review simply because the parties to the agreement saw fit in their own private interests not to reveal this corporate material to the public. A court may direct access to such material upon a proper showing of need. Here such a showing was amply demonstrated. To have refused access to these records in the face of a subpoena from a grand jury would have been an abuse of discretion. <em>Cf. Ex parte Uppercu, </em>239 U.S. 435, 36 S.Ct. 140, 60 L.Ed. 368 (1915) (Holmes, J.) (mandamus lies to compel a judge to unseal documents shown to be material and necessary in litigation, absent a demonstrated privilege).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The orders are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-14\">. The seal on those papers previously filed with this Court, i.e., the government\u2019s moving papers and the responsive papers of appellants Davis, IDT and General Dynamics Corp., is to the limited extent required by this opinion lifted. A motion made by General Dynamics to keep the record before us sealed and for other relief is similarly denied to the same extent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b496-5\">. The use of the words \u201cso-called business crimes\u201d appearing in this record is an unfortunate euphemism. The words suggest that actions, ordinarily considered criminal, that occur in a business setting somehow are not real crimes, but merely corporate transgressions. Of course, no such distinction exists in the law. Shakespeare resolved a failure to call by name that which something is by saying: \u201cthat which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\u201d [Romeo and Juliet, Act II, scene ii]. Similarly, a crime by any other name is still a crime and should be so titled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\">. The government does not \u00e1eek production of Davis\u2019 testimony, which was given under a statutory grant of immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\">. An estoppel argument raised by Davis and IDT is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
