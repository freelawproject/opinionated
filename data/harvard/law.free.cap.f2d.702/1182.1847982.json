Both cases, whose facts we leave for recital in the panel opinions issued today, 702 F.2d 1159 raise a common issue to which we have limited this <em>en banc </em>consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"AFe\">What degree of deference, if any, is due to a district court\u2019s assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence in granting a post-verdict motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-12\">We have concluded that we do not defer to the district court, because we must make our own independent judgment regarding the sufficiency of evidence. In so doing, of course, we may consider and be influenced by the opinion of the expert trial judge who has lived with the case \u2014 just as we give weight to one another\u2019s views. This will be particularly so where the trial judge has set forth his reasons with specificity. Moreover, it is the burden of the Government, as it is always the appellant\u2019s burden, to show that the judgment appealed from was wrong. But ultimately, the decision whether or not the evidence was sufficient is a question of law and therefore entirely our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-14\">Application of this standard to the facts of these particular cases, and the other issues involved in these appeals, we leave to the respective panels of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-15\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
