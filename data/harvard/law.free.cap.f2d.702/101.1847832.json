Petitioner claimed he had been denied his constitutional rights to prompt extradition and speedy trial by the Illinois state officials\u2019 delay in issuing an extradition warrant. The respondent contends that the appeal is moot because at some time between the decision of the district court and the filing of the respondent\u2019s brief the petitioner was transferred to the custody of the Mississippi officials. The respondent admittedly made no application under Fed.R. App.P. 23 to authorize this transfer. Respondent contends that Rule 23 is inapplicable because the petitioner consented to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>turn to Mississippi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, by its own terms the rule applies to all transfers of custody and includes no exception for allegedly voluntary transfers. Respondent cites <em>Masters v. Stevens, </em>357 F.2d 433 (8th Cir.1966); <em>Opheim v. Campbell, </em>384 F.2d 717 (10th Cir.1967); and <em>Brady v. Parole Commission, </em>600 F.2d 234 (9th Cir.1979) as similar cases in which courts held that Rule 23 did not apply. These authorities are not persuasive. Rule 23 was inapplicable in <em>Masters </em>and <em>Opheim </em>because both cases involved transfers which occurred prior to the effective date of the rule. <em>Brady </em>did not involve a transfer of custody, but a release of the prisoner. Since the transfer of the petitioner occurred in violation of Rule 23, we have not been divested of subject matter jurisdiction and the case is therefore not moot. <em>Cohen v. United States, </em>593 F.2d 766, 767 n. 2 (6th Cir.1979); <em>Meek v. Commanding Officer, Valley Forge Hospital, </em>452 F.2d 758 (3d Cir.1971); <em>Hudson v. Hardy, </em>424 F.2d 854 (D.C.Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Nevertheless, for the reasons stated so well in Judge Aspen\u2019s memorandum opinion, we conclude that petitioner\u2019s arguments relating to the issuance of the writ have no merit and therefore we affirm the district court and adopt its opinion as our own.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">. Even assuming that this contention has legal merit, there is an insufficient basis in the record for concluding that the transfer was voluntary. The only submission by the respondent is a photostatic copy (not certified) of a \u201cWaiver of Extradition\u201d purportedly signed by the petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
