Leo Glas-ser, Judge, dismissing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on grounds that petitioner was not a \u201cprisoner\u201d \u201cin custody,\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). Petitioner\u2019s argument that his removal from the bench of the Nassau Family Court, the revocation of his professional license to practice law, and his disqualification from being licensed as a real estate broker or insurance agent so greatly limited his economic mobility as to constitute \u201ccustody\u201d is rejected and the dismissal of the petition is affirmed. Petitioner was convicted in the County Court of Nassau County, New York, of perjury before a grand jury looking into his receipt of money while serving as a New York State Assemblyman. <em>People v.
