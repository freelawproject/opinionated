Burton was placed in administrative confinement as a result of his involvement in the stabbing deaths of the warden and deputy warden at Holmes-burg Prison when he was an inmate there. He was transferred first to Graterford Prison and then to the Western Penitentiary; he remained in administrative confinement at those institutions for a total of five years. Burton filed this suit alleging that the procedures used by the prison officials at the Western Penitentiary in periodically re-evaluating his segregated confinement were insufficient to protect his due process rights. Following a non-jury trial, the district court concluded that Burton\u2019s constitutional rights had been violated and awarded him compensatory damages and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The various officials appealed the judg'ment of the district court, arguing that: (1) they did not violate Burton\u2019s constitutional rights; (2) if they did, they were immune from liability for damages; and (3) if they were not immune, damages were incorrectly assessed. A panel of this Court affirmed the judgment of the district court. The full Court then voted to vacate the judgment and opinion of the panel and to reconsider this case <em>in banc, </em>primarily because of the pendency in the Supreme Court of <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>455 U.S. 999, 102 S.Ct. 1629, 71 L.Ed.2d 865 (1982) (granting certiorari), a case involving the due process rights of inmates placed in administrative confinement in Pennsylvania prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">On February 22,1983, the Supreme Court issued its judgment in <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>- U.S. --, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). The majority opinion discussed at length the procedural safeguards that the state is required to provide before a prisoner is initially placed in administrative confinement. Although the appeal now before us concerns the procedures to be used in evaluating the need to <em>continue </em>an inmate in administrative confinement, those two issues are sufficiently similar that we conclude that the case should be remanded to the district court for reconsideration in light of <em>Hewitt. </em>Because the opinion in <em>Hewitt </em>analyzed the question of what process is due in the administrative confinement setting somewhat differently from the manner employed by the district court in this case, additional fact-finding may be necessary to resolve the questions presented. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be vacated and the matter remanded for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
