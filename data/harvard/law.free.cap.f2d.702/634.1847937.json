The Company opposes enforcement on the grounds that the Union was improperly certified as the employees\u2019 bargaining representative. For the reasons stated below, we deny the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">In April 1980, a representation election was held among the Company\u2019s production, maintenance and delivery employees at its Defiance, Ohio facility. The record indicates that all twenty-two eligible voters cast ballots. The final tally showed that eleven employees voted for the Union, ten opposed the Union, and one ballot \u2014 that of Steven Hall, son-in-law of the Company\u2019s president and majority stockholder \u2014 was challenged by the Union on the basis that he was either not an \u201cemployee\u201d under section 2(3) of the National Labor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3), or that his interests were more closely allied with management than with the unit employees. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Since the challenged ballot could have affected the outcome of the election, the Regional Director conducted an administrative investigation pursuant to 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c)(1). The Director\u2019s report indicated that Hall is the son-in-law of the president and majority stockholder of the Company, and that the contesting parties had stipulated before the election that Mrs. Hall was not an eligible voter because of her relationship to her father. At the time of the election, Mr. and Mrs. Hall worked four ten-hour days, beginning at 2:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday, running the binding equipment on the Company\u2019s second shift. The only other people who worked during the second shift were two janitorial employees. Before the Halls, no other employee on either shift had worked a 4-day, 10-hour work week. Thus, the married couple who previously ran the binding equipment on the second shift worked five eight-hour days. The report also indicated that all supervisors and first shift employees leave the Company\u2019s facility by 6:00 p.m. each evening, and thus the Halls work without supervision during approximately two-thirds of their work day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">The Regional Director concluded that Hall did not share a community of interest with the other unit employees because of (1) Hall\u2019s family relationship with the Company\u2019s president and majority stockholder, (2) the Halls\u2019 unprecedented 4-day 10-hour work schedule, and (3) the Company\u2019s lack of supervision. Accordingly, the Director recommended that the Union be certified. The Company filed exceptions to the report and a supporting brief, which alternatively contended that the Regional Director\u2019s factual findings could not, as a matter of law, support a finding of special status in this case, and that the Board should order the Regional Director to hold a hearing to resolve other material issues of fact. 29 C.F.R. 102.69(f). The Board, however, adopted the Regional Director\u2019s Report and Recommendations without a hearing, and certified the Union as the exclusive representative of the unit employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-17\">The Company then refused to bargain with the Union. In December 1980, the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge which alleged that the Company violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>section 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act. The Company answered by denying that the Union had been elected by a majority of the bargaining unit employees. Thereafter, the general counsel filed a motion for summary judgment which alleged that the issues raised in the employer\u2019s answer had already been resolved in the representation proceeding, and thus there were no unresolved, material issues of fact. The Board granted the general counsel\u2019s summary judgment motion, and ordered the Company to bargain. The Board now seeks enforcement of its order from this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The question presented is whether Hall enjoyed a \u201cspecial status\u201d at the workplace which allied his interests with those of management. <em>Cherrin Corp. v. NLRB, </em>349 F.2d 1001, 1004 (6th Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 981, 86 S.Ct. 557, 15 L.Ed.2d 471 (1966). Since the Company admits it refused to bargain with the Union, the Board\u2019s order should be enforced if its finding of special status is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); <em>Harlan # 4 Coal Co. v. NLRB, </em>490 F.2d 117, 119, 125 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 986, 94 S.Ct. 2390, 40 L.Ed.2d 763 (1974); <em>NLRB v. Connecticut Foundry Co., </em>688 F.2d 871, 878 (2d Cir.1982). In prior cases, this court has held that a finding of special status cannot be based solely on the existence of a family relationship between the employee and employer. <em>Cherrin Corp., </em>349 F.2d at 1004; <em>NLRB v. Sexton, </em>203 F.2d 940 (6th Cir.1953). Instead, such relationship can be considered only if the employee receives job-related benefits or other favorable working conditions on account of the relationship.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Cherrin Corp., </em>349 F.2d at 1004r-05; <em>see, e.g., NLRB v. Connecticut Foundry Co., </em>688 F.2d 871, 878-79 (2d Cir.1982); <em>NLRB v. Jackson Farmers Inc., </em>432 F.2d 1042, 1044-45 (10th Cir.1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>401 U.S. 955, 91 S.Ct. 974, 28 L.Ed.2d 238 (1971); <em>Uyeda v. Brooks, </em>365 F.2d 326, 329 (6th Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Notwithstanding the family relationship involved, the evidence of special status in this case consists of: (1) the Company\u2019s lack of supervision over Hall; and (2) the Halls\u2019 4-day, 10-hour work week. While the general counsel correctly points out that the Halls worked without supervision during much of the second shift, the record indicates that <em>all </em>supervisors leave the facility by 6:00 p.m. each evening. Thus, the employees who previously ran the binding equipment on the second shift and the janitorial employees who currently work during the second shift were under no greater degree of supervision than the Halls. We therefore find no basis in the evidence for the Board\u2019s finding of special status due to the Company\u2019s lack of supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">The only other evidence of Hall\u2019s special status is his special work schedule. The record does not indicate the Company\u2019s reason for allowing Hall to work the special hours. Nevertheless, we hold that even if the schedule was established for Hall\u2019s convenience, this single instance of special treatment does not constitute substantial evidence of special status in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A ten-hour, four-day work week is simply not so unusual in the workplace that, standing alone, it warrants Hall\u2019s exclusion from the bargaining unit. In this context, we note that the evidence of special status in this case is not nearly as persuasive as that presented in <em>Cherrin Corp. v. NLRB, </em>349 F.2d 1001 (6th Cir.1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 981, 86 S.Ct. 557,15 L.Ed.2d 471 (1966). In <em>Cherrin, </em>this court reluctantly deferred to the Board\u2019s determination that the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ployee in question enjoyed a special status after finding that, unlike the other employees, (1) she was the daughter of the corporation\u2019s secretary, and also a niece of all the other officers and owners, (2) she was not required to punch a time clock, (3) no record was kept of her absences, and thus the employer\u2019s sick leave policy could not be applied to her, and (4) she was never reprimanded or penalized for tardiness. <em>Id., </em>at 1005-07. Although the court did enforce the bargaining order, it referred to the Board\u2019s evidence as \u201cflimsy\u201d and \u201cpretty thin,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1004, and hinted that the order would not have been enforced had the court heard the ease <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The record indicates that the Board summarily adopted the Regional Director\u2019s report in the certification proceeding, and thus found no unresolved, material issues of fact. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(f). The general counsel also argued that there were no unresolved, material issues of fact in her motion for summary judgment during the subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding. Therefore, having accepted as true all evidence of special status contained in the Regional Director\u2019s report, we hold that on the facts of this case the Board\u2019s finding of special status is not supported by substantial evidence, and thus deny enforcement of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-12\">. One supervisor is required to make a brief visit to the facility at 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. on the nights that the Halls are working.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\">. We acknowledge that other circuits have also employed \u201can expanded community of interest standard that permits the Board to exclude employees on the basis of family relationship\u2014 without regard to job-related factors\u201d \u2014 provided the Board adheres to the guidelines set out in these decisions. <em>NLRB v. Caravelle Wood Products, Inc., </em>504 F.2d 1181, 1187 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>accord, NLRB v. H.M. Patterson &amp; Son, Inc., </em>636 F.2d 1014, 1017 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Linn Gear Co. v. NLRB, </em>608 F.2d 791, 796 (9th Cir. 1979). This circuit, however, has never employed this standard in a \u201cspecial status\u201d employee case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b712-11\">. The record further indicates that Hall has received no special privileges regarding his wages or benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
