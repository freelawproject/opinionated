If our holding is perceived to be that collection of a note containing Georgia\u2019s statutory attorney fee provision in a bankruptcy proceeding automatically authorizes attorney fees, we wish to correct that impression. Perhaps; we were guilty of saying too much.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">One of appellant\u2019s contentions in this case was that the note was not collected \u201cby or through an attorney\u201d because the intervening petition for arrangement under Chapter XII barred collection in an ordinary civil adversary proceeding. The filing of the petition in bankruptcy did automatically stay the foreclosure proceeding, and collection was effectuated, as stated in our opinion, \u201cthrough the bankruptcy reorganization proceeding instead of collection through foreclosure.\u201d Appellant now argues that since oral argument, and not as a part of the record in this case, the bankruptcy proceeding has concluded with a reinstatement of the notes and a modification of the terms that provide for a greater interest payment to the creditors. What has occurred since submission of this case cannot affect our decision or opinion, absent a joint petition by all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">To clarify our prior opinion in this case, we supplement it with the following paragraph:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-15\">The filing of a petition for reorganization under Chapter XII of the Bankruptcy Act does not diminish the debtor\u2019s obligation for attorney fees if vested when the petition is filed. The attorney fees in this instance were vested at the time the petition was filed. Appellant argues that our holding in <em>In Re Atlanta International Raceway v. Cotton, </em>513 F.2d 546 (5th Cir. 1975), forbids the grant of attorney fees. However, petitioner confuses cases interpreting pre-petition contractual claims for attorney fees, as here, with post-petition claims. In <em>Atlanta International Raceway, </em>the promissory note was not in default when the debtor filed a Chapter X petition which prompted the creditors\u2019 10-day letter declaring the note to be in default. In our opinion in that case, our court distinguished <em>National Acceptance Company v. Zusmann, </em>379 F.2d 351 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>389 U.S. 975, 88 S.Ct. 478, 19 L.Ed.2d 469 (1967), which was a case in which the 10-day default letter with notice of attorney fees was sent <em>prior </em>to the filing of the petition filed by the debtor under Chapter XI. That case in turn relied upon <em>Security Mortgage Co. v. Powers, </em>278 U.S. 149, 49 S.Ct. 84, 7\u00a3 L.Ed. 236 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">The petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
