In the district court both parties moved for summary judgment, and the court referred the matter to a United States Magistrate. On July 20, 1982, the magistrate issued her report, which found and recommended that defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted and that plaintiff\u2019s be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-25\">Plaintiff filed no objections to the magistrate\u2019s report, and on August 9, 1982, the district court, noting plaintiff\u2019s failure to object, adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendations. The court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted defendant\u2019s motion, and entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appeals. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>seeks a dismissal of the appeal for failure to file timely objections to the magistrate\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Under the Federal Magistrate Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 631-39, a district court is empowered to designate a magistrate to hear motions for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). The magistrate is directed to file proposed findings and recommendations with the court, and \u201c[wjithin ten days after being served with a copy, any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 636(b)(1). The Act provides for de novo review in the district court of the objected to portions of the magistrate\u2019s report. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In <em>Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>616 F.2d 603 (1st Cir.1980), we interpreted the foregoing statutory provisions as a bar to appellate review when a party fails to raise objections to the magistrate\u2019s report within the statutorily prescribed ten-day limit. \u201c[A] party \u2018may\u2019 file objections within ten days or he may not, as he chooses, but he \u2018shall\u2019 do so if he wishes further consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605. We have applied the same rule to criminal matters referred to a magistrate under this section of the Act. <em>See United States v. Vega, </em>678 F.2d 376 (1st Cir.1982). Moreover, at least three other circuits have adopted the same interpretation of the statute. <em>See Nettles </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>677 F.2d 404 (5th Cir.1982) (Unit B in banc); <em>United States v. Walters, </em>638 F.2d 947 (6th Cir.1981); <em>McCall v. Andrus, </em>628 F.2d 1185 (9th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 996, 101 S.Ct. 1700, 68 L.Ed.2d 197 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We conclude that plaintiff, having failed to object to the magistrate\u2019s report, is precluded from pursuing the instant appeal. We add that our review of the record and the magistrate\u2019s report shows little chance of plaintiff\u2019s prevailing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
