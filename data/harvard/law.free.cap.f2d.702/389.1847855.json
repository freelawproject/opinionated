The district judge, describing the circumstances as a \u201ctrap for the unwary,\u201d found the \u201cmere inadvertence stricture\u201d inapplicable and granted the plaintiff\u2019s untimely request. We affirm. 94 F.R.D. 333 (D.C.).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">Plaintiff filed this personal injury suit in the New York Supreme Court. On December 9, 1980, defendant removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In conformance with the stipulation of the parties, the defendant\u2019s answer was filed on January 12, 1981. An amended answer followed on March 13, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">No demand for a jury trial was filed by either party prior to a pretrial conference on April 12,1982. Seemingly unaware that the federal rules require a written request within a specified time, plaintiff\u2019s counsel was surprised when he learned from the magistrate conducting the conference that this case was to be a bench trial. On the following day, plaintiff presented a petition for leave to file a jury demand out of time. The district court granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">The district court noted that plaintiff\u2019s counsel had \u201cinadvertently\u201d failed to file a jury trial notice because he was under the impression that he could do so at any stage of the proceeding, as is the practice in the New York state courts. The district judge recognized that in <em>Noonan v. Cunard Steamship Co., </em>375 F.2d 69 (2d Cir.1967), this court held mere inadvertence of counsel was not an adequate basis for allowing an untimely filing of a jury trial notice. However, he also observed that in <em>Higgins v. Boeing Co., </em>526 F.2d 1004 (2d Cir.1975), discretionary relief had been permitted in circumstances similar to those in the case at bar. Believing that <em>Noonan </em>had been substantially weakened by <em>Higgins </em>as well as by the passage of time, and finding no prejudice to defendant, the judge permitted plaintiff to \u201cfile an untimely jury demand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">The court then granted permission to appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), certifying the following three questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-17\">\u201c1. Did the District Court have power to issue the Order of June 17, 1982?</p>\n<p id=\"b466-18\">2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in issuing the Order of June 17, 1982?</p>\n<p id=\"b466-19\">3. Where a civil action was removed by defendant from state to federal court because of diversity, prior to service of an answer to the complaint, and plaintiff thereafter twice failed (after the first, and then after amended, answer) to file a timely jury demand pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 38(b) solely because of her attorney\u2019s \u2018inadvertence\u2019 and \u2018mistaken impression that a jury demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>could be filed at any stage of the proceeding,\u2019 did the District Court err in permitting plaintiff, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 39(b) or Rule 81(c), to file a jury demand 15 months after the date it was due,' at a time when the case was ready for trial?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Defendant appeals, contending that <em>Noo-nan </em>set out the limited area of discretion available to the district judge and therefore the cause should proceed nonjury. Plaintiff relies on <em>Higgins </em>to support an enlarged scope of discretion when the case is one removed to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure proceed on the basic premise that a jury trial is waived unless a timely demand is filed. Rule 38, applicable generally to cases in the federal courts, requires the written demand to be served upon the adverse party no later than ten days after service of the last pleading directed to the issue. Rule 39(b) permits a district judge to exercise his discretion and grant a jury trial despite the failure of a party to comply with the time provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Special provisions applicable to removed cases are in Rule 81(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. Three instances are specified in the rule. The first is where all necessary pleadings have been served before removal. In that situation, the demand must be served by the removal petitioner within ten days after the petition is filed. If some other party desires a jury trial, he must ask for it within ten days after service of the notice of filing the removal petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The second instance is where a party has, before removal, requested a jury in accord-anee with state law. When that has been done, no further affirmative step is required in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">The third situation addressed by Rule 81(c) is that in which state law does not require the parties to expressly claim trial by jury. In effect, the state from which the case is removed acts on the presumption that the parties desire a jury unless they affirmatively indicate otherwise. When a case is removed from a jurisdiction having such a practice, no additional steps need be taken in the federal court unless the district court directs that a specific demand be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">None of the three situations cited in Rule 81(c) are directly applicable to the case at hand. Here the answer and its amendment were not filed until after the case had been removed to the federal court. No demand had been made in the state court and New York does not automatically grant jury trials. As pointed out in <em>Higgins v. Boeing Co., </em>526 F.2d at 1007, the practice in New York falls within a gray area not covered by Rule 81(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">The New York statute requires that the request for a jury in the state courts be made by filing it with a \u201cnote of issue.\u201d No time for the notice is specified. <em>See </em>N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 4102(a) (McKinney\u2019s 1981 &amp; Supp.1982). As the district court observed, \u201cIn essence, the decision as to whether or not a case should be tried by a jury need not be made in New York state courts until a case is actually ready for trial.... \u201d The state courts may grant a late request unless \u201cundue prejudice\u201d to other parties would result, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4102(e) \u2014 certainly a broad grant of discretionary power.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The action of the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer here in delaying his request for a jury until the pretrial conference is not unusual in New York practice. Had the case remained in the state court, his petition to permit late filing would have been granted. The district court and the plaintiff, however, do not deny that the request made in this case was untimely under the federal rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The issue before us is limited to whether the court had discretion to grant the request, albeit untimely. Our review of the designated times set out in the federal rules and the New York practice is intended to serve as background against which we evaluate the limits of discretion entrusted to the district judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Although Fed.R.Civ.P. 39 does not articulate any restriction on the district court\u2019s discretion and commentators have argued for liberality, <em>see </em>9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 2334 at 115-16 (1971), decisional law has imposed limitations. Notwithstanding appellate reluctance to interfere with trial judge discretion, this court in <em>Noonan </em>noted a trend of district court decisions that had shrunk the question \u201cto determining whether the moving party\u2019s showing <em>beyond </em>mere inadvertence is sufficient to justify relief.\u201d 375 F.2d at 70 (emphasis in original). Indeed, granting a motion based only on inadvertence was said to be reversible error, because \u201cthe settled course of decision had placed a gloss upon the Rule\u201d which a district court could not disregard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Although not mentioned as a basis of the decision, the plaintiff who neglected to ask for a jury trial in <em>Noonan </em>had chosen to file the suit in federal court. In that setting, it would not seem too exacting to expect that, having selected the forum, the plaintiff should be familiar with and abide by the procedures followed there.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In <em>Higgins, </em>by contrast, the plaintiff originally filed in a state tribunal but was taken to a different jurisdiction, perhaps against his will, but, in any event, to a forum not of his choosing. Although we may not overlook lack of compliance with the federal procedural rules in removed cases, there is nonetheless some \u201cplay in the joints\u201d for accommodating a removed party who may not be as at ease in the new surroundings imposed upon him. In removed cases, the argument for applying the rigid <em>Noonan </em>constraints on the district court\u2019s discretion is simply not as strong.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">In the removed case, the interpretation of Rule 39(b) espoused by Professors Wright and Miller has substantial appeal. \u201cThe court ought to approach each application under Rule 39(b) with an open mind and an eye to the factual situation in that particular case, rather than with a fixed policy against granting the application or even a preconceived notion that applications of this kind are usually to be denied.\u201d 9 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 2334 at 116 (1971); <em>see also Cox </em>v. <em>C.H. Masland &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>607 F.2d 138, 144 (5th Cir.1979) (court should grant jury trial in absence of strong and compelling reasons to the contrary); Case Comment, 47 Iowa L.Rev. 759, 765 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">In <em>Higgins </em>this court weighed a number of factors. We noted the customary New York practice, including the discretion granted by the state statute which comported with Rule 39(b). Moreover, the case, one for personal injuries, was traditionally tried by a jury, and the parties had proceeded for some time on the assumption that the matter would not be a bench trial. Finally, the defendant had acquiesced in the jury request and would not be prejudiced by that court\u2019s action in granting the plaintiff\u2019s untimely demand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In view of these circumstances, we held that an exercise of discretion under Rule 39(b) should not be foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>We apply the same rationale here. The district judge found that all the <em>Higgins </em>factors were present.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, he found that plaintiffs counsel is essentially a state court practitioner having greater familiarity with New York practice and was admitted to practice in the federal courts only a year before this suit was filed. It may fairly be said, therefore, that there was more than mere inadvertence here, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the untimely filing of the jury demand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">We do not consign <em>Noonan </em>to overruled status. Its holding shall continue to govern cases where it is applicable. We hold only that the matter at hand falls within <em>Higgins\u2019s </em>ambit rather than <em>Noonan\u2019s, </em>and the exercise of discretion was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"AWyN\"><em>\u201cRemoved Actions. </em>These rules apply to civil actions removed to the United States district courts from the state courts and govern procedure after removal. * * * If at the time of removal all necessary pleadings have been served, a party entitled to trial by jury under Rule 38 shall be accorded it, if his demand therefor is served within 10 days after the petition for removal is filed if he is the petitioner, or if he is not the petitioner within 10 days after service on him of the notice of filing the petition. A party who, prior to removal, has made an express demand for trial by jury in accordance with state law, need not make a demand after removal. If state law applicable in the court from which the case is removed does not require the parties to make express demands in order to claim trial by jury, they need not make demands after removal unless the court directs that they do so within a specified time if they desire to claim trial by jury. The court may make this direction on its own motion and shall do so as a matter of course at the request of any party. The failure of a party to make demand as directed constitutes a waiver by him of trial by jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-8\">. <em>Galella v. Onassis, </em>487 F.2d 986 (2d Cir.1973), was a removed case in which the district court refused to honor an untimely request for a jury trial. We affirmed that exercise of discretion summarily, and cited <em>Noonan. </em>The opinion, however, did not discuss all the elements later reviewed in <em>Higgins. </em>When those factors are present, the <em>Higgins </em>analysis, rather than <em>Gaiei-la\u2019s, </em>is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-19\">. Although the defendant did not take any positive steps indicating that it expected the case to be a jury trial, neither did it take a position to the contrary. It seems fair to characterize the defendant\u2019s position as being noncommittal pri- or to the pretrial conference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b469-30\">. We do not share the able district judge\u2019s view that the conduct of jury trials has markedly improved since 1967 when <em>Noonan </em>was decided. Although that premise would have no relevance to <em>Noonan\u2019s </em>application, our experience is that the level of competence in the trial field has remained fairly constant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
