As such, it had no preceden-tial value under our Local Rule \u00a7 0.23. Having construed appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing as a request, in part, for the January 24 order to be published, we have decided to publish it. <em>See O\u2019Hara v. Long Island Railroad, </em>665 F.2d 8 (2d Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b114-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b114-22\">This is an appeal from a judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered after a three-day jury trial before Judge Milton Pollack.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>On September 20, 1973, appellant was indicted as a member of a conspiracy involving twelve named and various unnamed co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to distribute narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The named defendants included, among others, Vincent Pacelli, Jr., Alfred Catino, a/k/a \u201cHerbie,\u201d A1 Bracer, Albert Perez, a/k/a Abbe Perez, Edgardo Ramirez, and John Fazzalari, a/k/a \u201cFuzzy.\u201d Others named as co-conspirators, but not as defendants, included Herbert Sperling and Barry Lipsky.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">Perez was not arrested with the other conspirators because he had fled the country in the latter part of 1972. He was not arrested for his role in the conspiracy until April 13, 1979, in Scottsdale, Arizona. On April 16, 1979, Perez was removed to New York to face the narcotics charges lodged against him in the 1973 indictment. Prior to trial he again fled the authorities, and a separate indictment charging bail jumping was filed on December 27,1979, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3150. Perez eluded apprehension until March 10, 1982, when he was rearrested in New York City. He was tried before a jury on the narcotics and bail jumping indictments from May 17 through May 19, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">At trial, the government introduced evidence of a narcotics conspiracy involving Perez and two other principal partners, Vincent Pacelli and A1 Bracer. Also presented was the testimony of co-conspirator Barry Lipsky who testified, <em>inter alia, </em>to an out-of-court declaration in which Pacelli told him that \u201che [Pacelli] had just formed a partnership with Abbe Perez and A1 Bracer.... \u201d (Tr. 37). Further, Lipsky testified concerning his participation in conversations with Pacelli and Perez in which the three men discussed their narcotics transactions. (Tr. 58-59).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Other evidence presented by the government regarding Perez\u2019 involvement in the conspiracy included testimony by narcotics agents, Joseph Salvemini and Gerald Smith, about their observations of Perez during the pertinent period. In addition, Perez\u2019 former girlfriend, Emily Flores, testified that numerous meetings took place at their apartment at which Pacelli, Lipsky, Bracer and Perez were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">At the termination of the jury trial, appellant was convicted of conspiracy to distribute narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Appellant was also convicted of failing to appear for trial in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3150.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">On appeal from the former, Perez contends that Lipsky\u2019s testimony as to the conversation between Pacelli and Lipsky, which implicated Perez as a partner in the drug conspiracy, was inadmissible hearsay and that its admission violated Perez\u2019 right of confrontation. Since we find the statement admissible under the co-conspirator\u2019s hearsay exception, Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), we reject appellant\u2019s contentions and affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">The law in this circuit regarding the admissibility of declarations made by co-conspirators is set forth in <em>United States v. Geaney, </em>417 F.2d 1116 (2d Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1028, 90 S.Ct. 1276, 25 L.Ed.2d 539 (1970). In <em>Geaney, </em>Judge Friendly wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">[w]hile the practicalities of a conspiracy trial may require that hearsay be admitted \u201csubject to connection,\u201d the judge must determine, when all the evidence is in, whether in his view the prosecution has proved participation in the conspiracy, by the defendant against whom the hearsay is offered, by a fair preponderance of the evidence independent of the hearsay utterances.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1120. Thus, a <em>Geaney </em>finding as to the existence of a conspiratorial relationship between the declarant and the defendant must be shown <em>aliunde </em>of the hearsay statement itself. <em>See also United States v. Ziegler, </em>583 F.2d 77, 79-80 (2d Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Mangan, </em>575 F.2d 32, 42 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 931, 99 S.Ct. 320, 58 L.Ed.2d 324 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">Appellant argues that Lipsky\u2019s inadmissible hearsay testimony was the only proof linking Perez to the conspiracy. Therefore, he contends, there was no independent evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>dence to support admission of Lipsky\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, we find the record replete with direct and corroborative evidence, independent of Lip-sky\u2019s hearsay testimony, which links Perez to the conspiracy charged. Amid Lipsky\u2019s non-hearsay testimony is his statement that he, Perez and Pacelli met frequently to handle the affairs of the drug business (Tr. 58-59); that he saw Perez present when money from narcotics sales was counted at Marge Jackalone\u2019s apartment (Tr. 67-68); that he saw Perez present at the 118th Street apartment of Frank Bassi, Jr., when money from narcotics sales was counted (Tr. 70); that he, Perez and Pacelli drove to the Jack-in-the-Box restaurant in the Bronx on more than one occasion to pick up cocaine (Tr. 73-74); that on one occasion, he and Pacelli went to Second Avenue and 115th Street to \u201cborrow\u201d dilutant from Perez, \u201cSkinny Herbie\u201d and \u201cFuzzie\u201d (Tr. 81-82); that he was told to make up thin polyethylene bags of cocaine so that they might be sewn into Perez\u2019 jacket for Perez\u2019 trip to Spain, and did so (Tr. 84-86); that he saw Perez present when two women altered Perez\u2019 jacket to accommodate the bags of cocaine (Tr. 86); that on more than one occasion he and Pacelli went to the L &amp; A Sporting Goods store, jointly owned by Perez, Pacelli and Nick Lugo, and talked to Perez about the operations of the drug business (Tr. 95); that on one occasion, he drove with Perez to meet co-conspirators Edgardo Ramirez and Jack and Eddie Bless, the latter two being persons to whom the partnership sold cocaine and from whom they received heroin (Tr. 113); that on that same occasion he saw Jack Bless hand an object to Perez shortly before Perez handed to Lipsky a set of car keys and a claim check to a car which contained four half-kilo bags of heroin (Tr. 116-19); that he had personal knowledge of the contents of the half-kilo bags because he had weighed and tested the heroin for purity (Tr. 119); that Pacelli summoned him to a discotheque where Lip-sky saw the three partners \u2014 Pacelli, Perez and Bracer \u2014 seated together (Tr. 118); and that Perez gave Lipsky money to leave New York, to enable Lipsky to avoid arrest (Tr. 125-26).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Lipsky\u2019s testimony linking Perez to Pacel-li and Bracer was corroborated through a number of sources. A drug enforcement agent testified that he had participated in a drug sale at Perez\u2019 and Pacelli\u2019s sporting goods store where cocaine was in open view when Perez walked in, glanced at the agent, gave a half nod of his head and smiled before leaving (Tr. 350-55). The agent\u2019s testimony concerning the sale at the sporting goods store mirrored Lipsky\u2019s account of the sale as told by Pacelli (Tr. 101-02). The Government also presented evidence to show, and appellant does not dispute, that Perez travelled to the Grand Canary Islands under a false name, where he met with co-conspirator A1 Bracer. (GX 17; Tr. 336-39). Emily Flores, Perez\u2019 former girlfriend, testified that whenever Perez and Pacelli met at Perez\u2019 apartment for conversations, they would ask her to leave the room (Tr. 303-04); that Perez never told her what he did for a living (Tr. 331-32); and that she had personally seen Perez use cocaine (Tr. 315).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Although each item of evidence itself may not be dispositive proof that Perez was a co-conspirator, \u201csuch pieces of evidence are to be viewed not in isolation but in conjunction.\u201d <em>United States v. Geaney, supra, </em>417 F.2d at 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Appellant next argues that the district judge committed error when he did not make a specific <em>Geaney </em>finding as to Perez\u2019 participation in the conspiracy. We disagree. This circuit has recognized that where the record indicates it to be appropriate, an implicit <em>Geaney </em>ruling can be inferred in the trial judge\u2019s decision to receive the evidence and to deny a directed verdict of acquittal on the conspiracy charge. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cambindo Valencia, </em>609 F.2d 603, 631 (2d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 940, 100 S.Ct. 2163, 64 L.Ed.2d 795 (1980); <em>United States v. Lyles, </em>593 F.2d 182, 194 n. 15 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 972, 99 S.Ct. 1537, 59 L.Ed.2d 789 (1979); <em>United States v. Ziegler, supra, </em>583 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>80 n. 5. In light of the abundance of evidence linking Perez to the conspiracy, we infer that an implicit finding has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\"> Appellant\u2019s claim that the admission of Pacelli\u2019s statements violated his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment is unavailing. In order to protect a defendant\u2019s right to challenge evidentiary statements when the declarant is unavailable, the judge must determine whether, in the circumstances of the case, the statement \u201cbears sufficient indicia of reliability to assure the trier of fact an adequate basis for evaluating the truth of the declaration.\u201d <em>United States v. Puco, </em>476 F.2d 1099, 1107 (2d Cir.) (On petition for rehearing), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>414 U.S. 844, 94 S.Ct. 106, 38 L.Ed.2d 82 (1973). Further, \u201c[i]n most cases the determination that a declaration is in furtherance of the conspiracy ... will decide whether sufficient indicia of reliability were present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1107; <em>accord, United States v. Wright, </em>588 F.2d 31, 38 (2d Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 917, 99 S.Ct. 1236, 59 L.Ed.2d 467 (1979); <em>United States v. Mangan, supra, </em>575 F.2d at 44. This is true because a declaration in furtherance of a conspiracy would be against the penal interest of the declarant. <em>Cf. United States v. Glasser, </em>443 F.2d 994, 999 (2d Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">It is clear that Pacelli\u2019s statement to Lipsky concerning the formation of the partnership was in furtherance of the charged conspiracy. Pacelli was imparting to Lipsky the composition of a partnership in which Lipsky was to act as a principal worker. In order to prepare Lipsky for his intended role, Pacelli had to reveal the identity of the others involved. Thus, we find Pacelli\u2019s statements to be in furtherance of the conspiracy, and conclude that the jury as triers of fact had an adequate basis for evaluating the truth of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Appellant claims that under the Jencks Act he is entitled to a reversal because he was denied an unredacted version of an eight page letter Lipsky had written to Assistant United States Attorney Feffer. This claim is also to no avail. There is no indication that the Government deliberately misplaced the two missing pages. Moreover, the significance of the missing pages is minimal when weighed against the strength of the Government\u2019s proof. <em>See United States v. Grammatikos, </em>633 F.2d 1013, 1019-20 (2d Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>526 F.2d 1319, 1326 (2d Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 821, 97 S.Ct. 69, 50 L.Ed.2d 82 (1976). The Government\u2019s explanation that after a 10 year hiatus, while Perez was at large, the two missing pages could not be located, is plausible. We note that the remainder of the letter\u2019s contents was vigorously used by Perez\u2019 counsel in his attempt to impeach Lipsky\u2019s character. Appellant\u2019s counsel, during cross-examination of Lipsky, used the redacted version of the letter to expose Lipsky\u2019s prior perjuries and participation in a murder, as well as the preferential treatment Lipsky had received while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">The appellant\u2019s remaining claims are without merit. First, he claims that the government attempted to improperly bolster Lipsky\u2019s credibility during its summation by referring to evidence which had been excluded at trial. The appellant did not object to the summation at trial; therefore, this court\u2019s inquiry is directed at whether the challenged argument amounted to a \u201cflagrant abuse.\u201d <em>United States v. Perry, </em>643 F.2d 38, 51 (2d Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Dibrizzi, </em>393 F.2d 642, 645-46 (2d Cir.1968). The prosecutor\u2019s statement did not refer to excluded evidence but rather, to Lipsky\u2019s testimony that he had contacted the federal law enforcement authorities pri- or to corroboration of his allegations. We do not find this to be flagrant abuse. Second, the appellant objects to certain aspects of the jury charge. He claims that the district court committed prejudicial error by informing the jury as to the statutory purpose of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention Act, the dangers of a conspiracy, and the fact that co-conspirator Susan Weyl had previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy with Perez, Pacelli, Lipsky and others, when in fact she had not named Perez. This was not reversible error. A charge on statutory purpose is not an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of discretion. <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor, </em>580 F.2d 38, 44 (1978). Moreover, appellant does not dispute the accuracy of the district judge\u2019s statement concerning the statutory purpose of the Act. The charge regarding the dangers of a conspiracy was given to convey to the jury the intricacies of a conspiracy conviction and the fact that a conspiracy can be viewed as a separate offense from th\u00e9 substantive charges. The trial judge\u2019s inadvertent reference to Perez\u2019 name while discussing Susan Weyl\u2019s plea was not met with objection by the defendant. Under these circumstances, Perez may not object to this portion of the charge on appeal. <em>See United States v. Head, </em>546 F.2d 6, 7-8 (2d Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. S31, 97 S.Ct. 1551, 51 L.Ed.2d 775 (1977). Furthermore, the judge\u2019s error was remedied by the balance of the charge which instructed the jury that regardless of the other co-conspirators\u2019 guilt or innocence, they must independently determine whether Perez was a member of the charged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
