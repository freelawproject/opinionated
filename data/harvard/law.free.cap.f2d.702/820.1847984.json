Specifically, the Association seeks to substitute an \u201caggregate\u201d approach for the \u201crun-by-run\u201d approach used by the Secretary to determine the portions of each North Pacific salmon harvest allocated to various Indian tribes under the federal plan. According to the Association, the run-by-run approach is not required by the treaties that established the Indians\u2019 fishing rights and is inconsistent with the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801-1882 (Mag-nuson Act). These legal issues were argued to the district court on cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary. The Association appeals. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">This action arises from a history of controversy between treaty and nontreaty fishers in Washington State over the division of fishing rights. <em>See, e.g., </em>S.Rep. No. 667, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1980) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1980, p. 6793. Treaties negotiated by Governor Isaac Stevens between the United States and several Pacific Northwest Indian tribes in the 1850s established the rights of the treaty fishers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1970 the United States, on its own behalf and as trustee of seven Indian tribes, initiated litigation to clarify the treaty fishers\u2019 rights. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>384 F.Supp. 312 (W.D.Wash.1974) (\u201cfinal\u201d decision) (Boldt, J.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>520 F.2d 676 (9th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1086, 96 S.Ct. 877, 47 L.Ed.2d 97 (1976); <em>United States v. Washington, </em>459 F.Supp. 1020, 1020-1130 (W.D.Wash.1974-1978) (post-trial decisions), <em>various appeals dismissed, </em>573 F.2d 1117 (9th Cir.1978), 573 F.2d 1118 (9th Cir.1978), 573 F.2d 1121 (9th Cir.1978), <em>various appeals aff\u2019d sub nom. Puget Sound Gillnetters Association v. United States District Court, </em>573 F.2d 1123 (9th Cir.1978) (aff\u2019g decisions at 459 F.Supp. at 1097-1118 (W.D.Wash.1977-78)), <em>aff\u2019d in part, vacated in part, and remanded sub nom. Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Association, </em>443 U.S. 658, 99 S.Ct. 3055, 61 L.Ed.2d 823 (1979) (hereinafter <em>Fishing Vessel). </em>The litigation culminated in the holding that treaty fishers have a right to a share of each run of anadromous fish<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that passes through the \u201cusual and accustomed\u201d Indian fishing sites. <em>Fishing Vessel, </em>443 U.S. at 685, 99 S.Ct. at 3074.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">This action represents at least the second effort of the Association<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Secretary\u2019s approach in allocating a portion of each annual harvest to treaty fishers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Association complains that the run-by-run approach forces the Secretary to call an early halt to each year\u2019s ocean harvest by nontreaty fishers to protect individual runs of the depressed species, viz., chinook and coho. (The chinook and coho are line-biting fish and are thus the salmon species of primary interest to the Association.) The Association cites, for example, the Secretary\u2019s plan for the 1981 ocean harvest off the coast of Washington. The plan provided for a commercial season from May 1 to May 31 for all salmon species except coho and for all species from July 15 to September 1, subject to closure whenever the coho harvest reached 372,000 fish. 46 Fed.Reg. 30,633, 30,641-42 (1981). The plan also provided for a recreational season from May 23 to September 7, with a daily bag limit of two salmon (three north of the Queets River, only two of which could be chinook or coho). This season was subject to closure whenever the harvest of coho reached 248,-000 fish. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The Association contends in this appeal that the Secretary should use an aggregate approach that would give the region\u2019s treaty fishers roughly half of the <em>total </em>salmon harvest, i.e., half of the harvest of all species, including chum and sockeye. Under the Association\u2019s aggregate approach, treaty fishers would be compensated for loss of their usual stream-harvested share of the chinook and coho through an allocation of more than half of the chum and sockeye. According to the Association, an aggregate approach is permitted by the Stevens treaties and is required by the Magnuson Act. The Association argues alternatively that, if the Stevens treaties do not permit an aggregate approach, they have been, to that extent, abrogated by the Magnuson Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The Association\u2019s proposed aggregate approach is precluded by the treaties negotiated by Governor Stevens with the Indians. All of these treaties provide that \u201c[t]he right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds and stations, is further secured to said Indians, in common with all citizens of the Territory .... \u201d Treaty of Medicine Creek, art. III, 10 Stat. 1133 (quoted in <em>Fishing Vessel, </em>443 U.S. at 674, 99 S.Ct. at 3068). <em>Fishing Vessel </em>provides the controlling construction of this critical treaty provision. The Court there declared, \u201cIn our view, the purpose and language of the treaties are unambiguous; they secure the Indians\u2019 right to take a share of <em>each run </em>of fish that passes through tribal fishing areas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>443 U.S. at 679, 99 S.Ct. at 3071 (emphasis added). The Court further held that the Indians\u2019 treaty share of each run is presumptively half but that this presumptive share should be reduced whenever tribal needs would be satisfied by a lesser amount. <em>Id. </em>at 685-86, 99 S.Ct. at 3074-75. Thus, the Indians\u2019 treaty share is a \u201cfair share\u201d of each run. <em>Id. </em>at 684, 99 S.Ct. at 3073.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">The Association argues that by substituting a \u201cfair share\u201d for the fifty-fifty, treaty-nontreaty division of fish originally proposed by the district court in <em>United States v. Washington, </em>384 F.Supp. 312, the Supreme Court somehow abandoned the run-by-run approach. Nothing in the Court\u2019s opinion supports this interpretation of <em>Fishing Vessel. </em>In discussing the very issue of the Indian\u2019s \u201cfair share,\u201d the Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"anu-dedup-0\">We also agree with the Government that an equitable measure of the common right should initially <em>divide the harvesta-ble portion of each run that passes through a \u201cusual and accustomed\u201d place into approximately equal treaty and non-treaty shares, </em>and should then reduce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>treaty share if tribal needs may be satisfied by a lesser amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\"><em>Fishing Vessel, </em>443 U.S. at 685, 99 S.Ct. at 3074 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The Association next contends that, because the line of cases leading up to <em>Fishing Vessel </em>addressed issues concerning fishing in the interior waters of Washington State and did not involve ocean waters under the jurisdiction of the United States, the Secretary must divide the harvest of fish as the Association proposes in order to achieve the Magnuson Act goal of the \u201coptimum yield.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1851(a)(1) (1976). This argument ignores not only the physical realities of the salmon life cycle, viz., the fact that harvestable fish in ocean waters are the same fish that return to the streams of Washington State to spawn, but also the fact that the Court expressly included ocean catches in the allocation of fish. <em>Fishing Vessel, </em>443 U.S. at 688, 99 S.Ct. at 3075.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The Association also asserts that the district court\u2019s orders in <em>United States v. Washington, </em>384 F.Supp. 312, do not require run-by-run allocations of fish. The Association relies on various statements of the district court regarding the need for flexibility in allocating harvest shares to respond to special local circumstances. Contrary to the position of the Association, however, the district court clearly adhered to the right of each tribe to take a share of each run passing through tribal fishing sites as the regional rule of allocation. <em>Hoh Indian Tribe v. Baldrige, </em>522 F.Supp. 683, 689 (W.D.Wash.1981). The Secretary and Washington State have been expressly invited by the district court to seek relief in that court whenever a departure from the usual rule is warranted by, among other concerns, the needs of nontreaty fishers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The Association next argues that the run-by-run approach was treated in <em>Fishing Vessel </em>simply as a means of calculating the treaty fishers\u2019 overall harvest <em>share, </em>not as a rule for determining a \u201cfair share\u201d of salmon that individual tribes could take from their \u201cusual and accustomed\u201d fishing sites. The Association\u2019s interpretation of the right to take fish \u201cin common\u201d is indistinguishable from the hypertechnical readings of treaty language that have been rejected by the Supreme Court. <em>See Fishing Vessel, </em>443 U.S. at 675-78, 99 S.Ct. at 3069-3070.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">In short, the Stevens treaties preclude adoption of an aggregate approach' as the exclusive rule of salmon allocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">Finally, the Association maintains that the run-by-run approach diminishes the overall annual harvest and is, as a consequence, inconsistent with the Magnuson Act\u2019s \u201coptimum yield\u201d goal, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1851(a)(1) (1976). Therefore, the Association contends that, to the extent the Stevens treaties require a run-by-run approach, they were abrogated by the Magnuson Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-16\">Congress\u2019 intent to abrogate or modify an Indian treaty must be clear. <em>Menominee Tribe </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 404, 412-13, 88 S.Ct. 1705, 1710-1711, 20 L.Ed.2d 697 (1968). Such an intent may be found in the express provisions of an act or in its surrounding circumstances and legislative history. <em>United States v. Fryberg, </em>622 F.2d 1010, 1016 (9th Cir.1980). There is, however, nothing in the language of the Magnuson Act or in its legislative history that even remotely suggests that Congress intended to abrogate or modify the Stevens treaties. On the contrary, the Magnuson Act expressly provides that each fishery management plan approved by the Secretary shall be consistent with all provisions of the Act and \u201cany other applicable law.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1853(a)(1)(C) (1976). Such \u201cother law\u201d includes the Stevens treaties.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">The purpose of the Magnuson Act was to protect United States fisheries by extending the exclusive fisheries zone of the United States from 12 to 200 miles and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>to provide for management of fishing within the 200-mile zone. H.R.Rep. No. 445, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 21 (1975), <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 593, 593-94. The extension of the zone indicates that Congress was concerned about harvests by foreign fishers, not catches by treaty fishers. Five years later, relying on the assumption that treaty fishers have a right to take a \u201cfair share\u201d of each annual harvest, Congress decided to assist nontreaty fishers by enacting the Salmon and Steel-head Conservation and Enhancement Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-561, 94 Stat. 3275 (in part amending the Magnuson Act; codified in scattered sections of titles 15, 16 &amp; 46). <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1243, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 12, 28 (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 6793, 6794, 6810.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The district court was correct in granting summary judgment in favor of the Secretary. The run-by-run approach for allocating salmon is required by the Stevens treaties and has not been abrogated by the Magnuson Act. Thus, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-9\">. Summary judgment is appropriate where there are no disputed issues of fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Lutcher v. Musicians Union Local 47, </em>633 F.2d 880, 882 (9th Cir.1980). Here, the parties agreed to the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-10\">. The United States entered into the treaties with the Indians to extinguish the last conflicting claims to lands lying west of the Cascade Mountains and north of the Columbia River in what is now Washington State. The treaty with amici (who are treaty fishers of the Qui-nault Indian Nation, the Hoh Indian Tribe, and the Quileute Indian Tribe) is the Treaty of Olympia, July 1, 1855, and January 25, 1856, ratified March 8, 1859, and proclaimed April 11, 1859, 12 Stat. 971. See <em>United States v. Washington, </em>384 F.Supp. 312, 349 (W.D.Wash. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b897-11\">. \u201cAnadromous fish\u201d are fish which are spawned or artificially produced in fresh water, reach maturity in the ocean, and then return to their water of origin to spawn. See 384 F.Supp. at 405. A \u201crun\u201d is a group of anadro-mous fish on their return migration, identified by species, race, and water of origin. See <em>id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b897-14\">. The Association tried to intervene in <em>Hoh Indian Tribe </em>v. <em>Baidrige, </em>522 F.Supp. 683 (W.D. Wash.1981) (Craig, J.), in which amici in this appeal challenged the Secretary\u2019s 1981 harvest plan, seeking reductions in either the ocean harvest limits or Washington State\u2019s spawning escapement goals. When the Association appealed the district court\u2019s denial of its motion to intervene, this court held that the Association\u2019s challenge was foreclosed by the line of cases leading up to <em>Fishing Vessel </em>and by <em>Fishing Vessel </em>itself. <em>Hoh Indian Tribe v. Baidrige, </em>676 F.2d 710 (9th Cir.1982) (memorandum) <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 141, 74 L.Ed.2d 120 (1982). The panel described the Association\u2019s effort as a \u201cthinly-veiled\u201d attempt to \u201crelitigate issues that have previously been decided.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b898-5\">. The relevant duties of the Secretary are set forth in the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1801-1882, which charges the Secretary with responsibility for establishing annual harvest plans for each ocean fishery consistent with the goals established by the Act. The goals include achievement of the \u201coptimum yield\u201d from each fishery, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1851(a)(1) (1976), and a fair allocation of fishing privileges among all United States fishers, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1851(a)(4)(A).
