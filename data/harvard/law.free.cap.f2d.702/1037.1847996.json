Appellant contends that the trial judge erred in several respects in ruling that certain of plaintiff\u2019s proffered proofs were inadmissible. Because we find merit in appellant\u2019s contentions that the district court erred in excluding (1) evidence of the employer\u2019s retaliatory actions against appellant prior to the discharge and (2) evidence of a pattern of retaliation against other employees, we reverse and remand the case for a new trial. Because we also have some concern that the state of the pleadings in the district court has permitted the parties to proceed without adequately establishing either the jurisdictional or the substantive basis of this action, we further instruct the trial court to grant leave to amend the pleadings in accordance with the following opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">Appellee Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (the Authority), is an agency operated pursuant to a 1967 interstate compact between the District of Columbia and the states of Virginia and Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Authority is responsible for the operation of the subway and bus systems in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Appellant Morris was an officer employed by the Authority\u2019s Transit Police Force (the Force) from November 1974 until his discharge in October 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-16\">The discharge led Morris to file the present action in District Court on May 23, 1980.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint set forth three counts. Count 1, styled \u201cRace Discrimination,\u201d alleged that \u201cthroughout Plaintiff\u2019s tenure on the WMATA police force black officers were treated differently with respect to matters of promotion and discipline,\u201d that Morris was one of the black officers who suffered incidents of disproportionate discipline because of his race, and that the Authority ultimately relied upon these incidents \u201cas a pretext to fire him.\u201d Complaint UK 5, 6. Count 2, styled \u201cRetaliation,\u201d alleged that as a result of several complaints he made regarding the racial discrimination allegedly practiced on the Force, Morris \u201cwas singled out and fired ... in retaliation for the exercise of his rights.\u201d In these counts \u2014 the first premised on racial discrimination, the second on <em>complaints about </em>such discrimination \u2014 Morris relied upon Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>(1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1115-17\">Count 3, with which we are primarily concerned on this appeal, was styled \u201cFirst Amendment.\u201d This count alleged that \u201cbecause plaintiff exercised his right to free speech, in criticizing the practice of race discrimination and disparate treatment, Defendant fired the plaintiff in violation of the rights guaranteed to him under the First Amendment....\u201d Complaint \u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-18\">Plaintiff sought a variety of remedies for these alleged injuries. These included reinstatement with back pay, promotion to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>pay grade he would have attained in the normal course of advancement in the Force, $500,000 in compensatory and punitive damages, and a declaration that his statutory and constitutional rights had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">By order of November 3, 1980, the trial court granted Morris\u2019 demand for a jury trial as to the First Amendment claim but denied it as to the Title VII counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury trial commenced on November 13, 1980. On November 17, the jury returned a general verdict and answered interrogatories in favor of the defendant Authority. Morris\u2019 motion for a new trial was denied, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">A. <em>Preliminary Jurisdictional and Substantive Questions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">Although appellant has limited his appeal to challenging three evidentiary rulings by the trial court, we find it necessary before considering these issues to raise <em>sua sponte </em>a question going to the substantive theory, and perhaps to the jurisdictional basis, of appellant\u2019s case. Such matters casting doubt upon the existence of federal subject matter jurisdiction are the proper subject of consideration on the court\u2019s own motion, as neither the consent or omission of the parties nor the acquiescence of the court can confer jurisdiction where none exists. <em>Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>440 U.S. 391, 398, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 1175, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979); <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Wetzel, </em>424 U.S. 737, 740, 96 S.Ct. 1202, 1205, 47 L.Ed.2d 435 (1976); <em>Louisville &amp; N. Ry. v. Mottley, </em>211 U.S. 149, 152, 29 S.Ct. 42, 43, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908). While our concern extends beyond the issue of jurisdiction to embrace the remedial theory under which Morris seeks relief, we deem it desirable and helpful, in order to assist both parties on remand in the instant case, to set forth the following observations on the nature of appellant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-13\">The action appears to have proceeded thus far on the assumption that the First Amendment provides a direct remedy for the conduct complained of here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have serious doubts as to the correctness of that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-14\">Were the Authority an agency of the federal government, it is clear that Morris\u2019 exclusive remedy for the retaliatory conduct alleged would be the retaliation provision of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (1976). <em>Brown v. General Services Administration, </em>425 U.S. 820, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976). As we recently noted, <em>Brown </em>held Title VII to be \u201cthe exclusive source of judicial remedies for discrimination arising out of federal employment.\u201d <em>Borrell v. United States International Communications Agency, </em>682 F.2d 981, 989 (D.C. Cir.1982). Absent a showing that Title VII provides inadequate protection for his or her rights,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>see id., </em>a federal employee urging unlawful discrimination is confined to actions under that statute. Hence, a direct constitutional action by an employee against an agency of the United States or its officials would be foreclosed on the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-15\">Title VII, however, does not similarly preempt the pursuit by <em>state </em>employees of alternative remedies against the agencies or officials that employ them. <em>Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). Assuming that the sovereign immunity guaranteed by the Eleventh Amendment does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>not otherwise foreclose an action of such character, a nonfederal public employee generally has resort to all other statutory and constitutional remedies available to redress deprivations of constitutional rights. Therefore, before we can proceed to the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments relating to the proof of his constitutionally-based claim, it must be determined whether appellant, in relying upon the First Amendment, has stated an available ground for relief. That question, as the foregoing suggests, reduces to whether Morris was a federal or a nonfederal employee at the time he was dismissed by the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\">The Authority, as noted earlier, is the product of an interstate compact entered into by Virginia, Maryland, arid the District of Columbia, and approved by the Congress as required by Art. I, \u00a7 3 of the Constitution. Pub.L. No. 89-774, 80 Stat. 1324 (1967). The fact that the requisite congressional approval of the Authority\u2019s creation and operation was secured does not, however, compel the conclusion that the Authority is an agency of the federal government. <em>Lake Country Estates, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>440 U.S. 391, 399 n. 13, 99 S.Ct. 1171, 1176 n. 13, 59 L.Ed.2d 401 (1979). While we leave the question open for further development by the parties on remand, it would appear at first blush that the Authority is an instrumentality of \u201ceach of the signatory parties\u201d to the interstate compact, Pub.L. No. 89-774, \u00a7 4, and thus a creature of the states and the District of Columbia, which acts \u201cunder color of state law,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (Supp. IV 1980).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">Assuming that the Authority is properly considered to be a nonfederal employer, a further problem arises as to its precise status under state law. For if the Authority were to be held an <em>instrumentality, </em>rather than a \u201cpolitical subdivision,\u201d of the signatory states, its successful invocation of the Eleventh Amendhient\u2019s immunization of the states from actions for damages in the federal courts would render this court without jurisdiction to hear the case, <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 677-78, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1362-63, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), and the judgment of the district court a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">Because <em>Lake Country Estates </em>and the terms of Public Law 89-774, \u00a7\u00a7 12(a), 16, 17, 18, and 80 strongly indicate that the Authority is either not cloaked with the immunity enjoyed by Virginia and Maryland, or has waived such immunity, <em>see Hodgers v. Tomberlin, </em>510 F.Supp. 1280, 1283 (N.D.Ga.1980), it would conserve judicial resources to review the merits of this case on the present appeal. However, the issues have not been argued and we do not wish to foreclose further development of the jurisdictional issues by a ruling that would constitute the law of the case. We therefore leave this matter as well for the district court to resolve on the basis of the record before it and any further submissions by the parties. <em>See Van Ooteghem v. Gray, </em>654 F.2d 304, 306 (5th Cir.1981) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 909, 102 S.Ct. 1255, 71 L.Ed.2d 447 (1982). We note that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals recently held that the Authority is an agent of each sovereign signatory to the compact and that the compact waives the signatories\u2019 sovereign immunity for proprietary functions. <em>Qasim v. WMATA, </em>455 A.2d 904 at 906 (D.C.App.1983) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">Assuming that Morris\u2019 claim is neither jurisdictionally barred by the Eleventh Amendment nor preempted by the provisions of Title VII, one final preliminary issue remains concerning the nature of the remedy sought. Morris\u2019 free speech claim relies directly on the First Amendment as the source of the remedy sought. Yet although the courts have recognized the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>istence of a <em>Bivens </em>-type remedy for violations of the First Amendment,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is not clear that a remedy based exclusively on that amendment can be -had against anyone other than <em>federal </em>defendants acting pursuant to <em>federal </em>law. A direct constitutional remedy for the unlawful conduct of <em>state </em>actors, if any such remedy exists, would necessarily depend upon the Fourteenth Amendment, incorporating the substantive guarantees of the First, as its source.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We need not resolve this question, since the statutory remedy granted by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 does afford relief for the infringement of First Amendment rights alleged here. Accordingly, we treat Morris\u2019 claim on appeal as if it were an action under section 1983.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">We have noted only two significant questions arising out of the parties\u2019 failure to explore fully the nature of the claim involved in this appeal. There may well be other substantial differences between the action as it has been perceived to this point and as we think it should be viewed; we do not seek to identify or elaborate upon them. In addition to our disposition of the particular matters discussed below, therefore, we direct the district court on remand, to permit the parties to amend their, pleadings in light of our opinion<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to address any new legal issues thereby placed in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>B. <em>Evidentiary Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">The parties were, and continue to be, in apparent agreement as to the elements of Morris\u2019 First Amendment claim. As set forth in the interrogatories propounded by the court to the jury, the action proceeded on the understanding that the burden was on plaintiff to prove</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">(1) that he \u201chad reason to believe there was racial discrimination on the WMATA [Authority\u2019s] police force\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">(2) that he \u201ccomplained about racial discrimination at an appropriate time and place, in a manner [so as] not to interfere with his duties\u201d; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">(3) that the Authority did \u201cunreasonably take action against him solely as a result of these complaints, and did not terminate him on the basis of deficient performance and insubordination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">Verdict Interrogatories, Nos. 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-9\">The jury found that Morris had proved the second element, i.e., that his complaints had been made at a reasonable time and place and in a reasonable manner. However, it found that he had failed to prove either that his belief that discrimination was being practiced was reasonable (element 1) or that the Authority had discharged him \u201csolely\u201d because of his complaints (element 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-10\">There is no dispute as to the basis for or correctness of the jury\u2019s ruling on the second element.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, on appeal Morris urges that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence on both the reasonable belief issue and the retaliatory motive issue. We consider these claims in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">1. <em>The reasonableness of Morris\u2019 belief</em></p>\n<p id=\"app-dedup-0\">The first element of Morris\u2019 claim identified in the district court, that the belief which gave rise to his complaints about the discrimination he perceived was one he in fact held and one which was \u201creasonable,\u201d is in essence a requirement that the plaintiff show his complaints to be speech falling within the protection of the First Amendment. Assuming the speech to be so protected, any restriction directed purely at suppressing its communicative content is impermissible save in the most extreme cases involving matters of \u201ccompelling\u201d governmental interest. <em>Widmar v. Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-13\">Morris sought to introduce testimony tending to show that there was a basis in fact for his belief that the Authority discriminated against black officers. The trial court, at the Authority\u2019s urging, excluded this testimony as irrelevant on the ground that the Authority had already stipulated to the fact that \u201cthe content of plaintiff\u2019s complaints or alleged complaints regarding racial discrimination ... falls within the categories of speech protected by the first amendment,\u201d Stipulation No. 1, and to the fact that Morris in fact believed that he had been discriminated against because of his race. Stipulation No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-14\">The transcript makes it apparent that the Authority stipulated to the protected status of Morris\u2019 complaints in order to prevent Morris from placing the details of the race discrimination complaints he voiced before the jury. Transcript (Tr.) 22. In other words, the Authority made the tactical decision to admit that Morris acted within his First Amendment rights,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in order to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>vent the admission of evidence that might have made the jury more receptive to Morris\u2019 theory of the Authority\u2019s motivation in discharging him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">The trial court correctly held that the stipulations entered into by the parties eliminated the need to adduce evidence on the question whether Morris\u2019 speech was protected by the First Amendment. The purpose and effect of the stipulations was precisely to pretermit any inquiry into whether Morris was justified in voicing his complaints. The defendant stipulated that the speech was \u201cprotected,\u201d Stipulation No. 1, and this was sufficient to dispose of the issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">However, we are presented with the fact that the court ultimately did submit to the jury an interrogatory asking whether Morris\u2019 belief was \u201creasonable,\u201d which the jury answered in the negative. In our view, the interrogatory was superfluous in light of the stipulations, and as a result the jury should not have reached the issue. Accordingly, the trial court should have instructed the jury, in line with Stipulation No. 1, that Morris\u2019 speech was entitled to full First Amendment protection, and that the only issues for the jury were the reasonableness of the time, place and manner of complaint, and the motivation for the firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-14\">Thus, although we reject appellant\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s ruling that the stipulation rendered irrelevant appellant\u2019s proffered evidence regarding the reasonableness of his belief, we note that the stipulations should have been sufficient and the issue should not have been presented to the jury. Because we hold that the ease must be remanded for a new trial for other reasons discussed below, we need not take the unusual step of reversing on grounds not urged by appellant. At trial upon remand, however, the court should instruct the jury that the parties have stipulated that Morris\u2019 complaints to his superiors were speech protected by the First Amendment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-15\">This ruling does not bar the introduction of testimony as to the nature of those complaints. Such testimony may be relevant, not to the \u201creasonableness\u201d of Morris\u2019 beliefs, but to the question of the Authority\u2019s motivation in firing him. <em>Regardless </em>of the reasonableness of his belief in their validity, if Morris can show that his complaints about discrimination caused his discharge, he will have carried his burden. To the extent that the content of those complaints, as distinct from the mere fact of their having been voiced, makes it more or less likely that Morris was discharged because he exercised his right to speak, that content will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>be relevant and admissible on the question of motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\">2. <em>The motivation for the discharge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Morris attempted to prove that the Authority\u2019s action was taken in retaliation for his speech by showing (1) that the Authority had a practice of retaliating against employees who complained about allegedly unlawful employment practices<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and (2) that the Authority\u2019s allegations of unsatisfactory job performance on appellant\u2019s part were in fact merely pretextual because those citations were themselves acts of retaliation. In short, Morris attempted to make out a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge and then to discredit the Authority\u2019s asserted nonretaliatory justification for the firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">The trial court excluded evidence proffered by Morris on both questions. For the reasons set forth below, we find that these rulings were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">(a) <em>Pattern of retaliation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">Given a satisfactory demonstration \u2014or, as here, a concession \u2014 that his speech was protected by the First Amendment, a prima facie case of unlawful discharge is made out if a plaintiff shows that the exercise of his right to speak and petition was a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cmotivating\u201d factor in the decision to fire him. <em>Mt. Healthy Board of Education </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 576, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). In other words, the plaintiff must show that \u201cbut for\u201d his speech he would not have been fired. <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, </em>489 U.S. 410, 417, 99 S.Ct. 693, 697, 58 L.Ed.2d 619 (1979); <em>Egger v. Phillips, </em>669 F.2d 497 (7th Cir.1982). In order to impose liability on a political subdivision, as distinct from its employees or officials, a section 1983 plaintiff must also show that the unlawful decision was part of a \u201ccustom or policy\u201d of unlawful firings on such grounds. <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. at 2035-36 (1978). Once the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to show \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision\u201d to discharge the plaintiff \u201ceven in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d <em>Mt. Healthy Board of Education v. Doyle, supra, </em>429 U.S. at 287, 97 S.Ct. at 576. Plaintiff is then entitled to rebut this justification by proving it is merely pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">In the present case the court instructed the jury that, in order to find for the plaintiff, they would have to determine that the Authority had discharged Morris <em>\u201csolely\u201d </em>because of his protected complaints. Jury Instruction No. I.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Even if the \u201csole factor\u201d test were correct, we would be forced to agree with appellant that the testimony of other employees as to the Authority\u2019s treatment of other complaints about employment conditions was improperly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-13\">The question of the legitimacy of the employer\u2019s motivation in firing the employ<em>ee </em>\u2014 i.e., the question whether an improper motive was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the discharge \u2014 is one upon which the past acts of the employer have some bearing. <em>See, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Porter, </em>659 F.2d 306, 320 (3d Cir.1981); <em>Scaramuzzo v. Glenmore Distilleries, Inc., </em>501 F.Supp. 727, 733 n. 7 (N.D.Ill.1980), <em>and cases cited. </em>They also tend to show the existence of a \u201ccustom or policy\u201d of unconstitutional acts, necessary to a finding of liability against the Authority. With regard to the latter, it bears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>noting that were evidence of other instances of retaliation inadmissible, it would be difficult to imagine many cases in which the \u201ccustom or policy\u201d element could be proved save those in which the plaintiff could elicit testimony from the defendant\u2019s own agents that such a custom exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">This conclusion as to the relevance of past acts of retaliation is the same whether the legal standard on which the jury was charged was the \u201csole\u201d factor or the \u201csubstantial or motivating\u201d factor test.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The legal <em>standard </em>for proof of causation is independent of the issue of whether evidence is <em>relevant </em>to causation. Here the plaintiff must show both that his dismissal was substantially caused by his speech and that this causation was not unique to his case but rather was customary in cases of complaint. The evidence plaintiff sought to adduce of past retaliation by the Authority for complaints from members of the Force was relevant to both requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">Morris attempted to introduce the testimony of three WMATA police officers, Bruce, Famoudou, and Nicola, in support of his allegation that the Authority engaged in the practice of retaliation against employees who complained about its employment practices. The district court excluded testimony by two of the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">Officer Nicola, who is white, was employed by the Authority beginning in January 1977, and served as the officers\u2019 union shop steward. He was prepared to testify both as to management\u2019s disparate treatment of him in retaliation for his union organizing activities<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and as to the disciplining of other officers in retaliation for complaints about employment conditions, with which he was familiar from his role as shop steward. The trial court took the view that Nicola\u2019s testimony that he <em>personally </em>had been disciplined for complaining was relevant to Morris\u2019 claim only insofar as it would relate other instances of retaliation for complaints <em>about racial discrimination. </em>Tr. 212-13B. Nicola would have testified only to events concerning complaints about sex discrimination and safety matters. Consequently, only one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, Officer Famoudou, was permitted to testify as to the Authority\u2019s response to his complaints, which concerned racial discrimination specifically. <em>See </em>Tr. 201, 203-04, 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-10\">We think this limitation on testimony was erroneous. Morris\u2019 claim that his First Amendment rights were violated rested upon an allegation that the Authority had retaliated against him for complaints that were protected speech and which were made in a reasonable time, place, and manner. Although Morris\u2019 complaints were directed at the Authority\u2019s treatment of its black employees, whereas the proffered testimony of Nicola concerned other sorts of employee complaints (made by Nicola himself and by other officers), we think that evidence showing that the employer followed a broad practice of retaliation and responded to any protected criticism with disciplinary action has some probative value on the issue of the employer\u2019s likely motivation here. Fed.R.Evid. 401. Evidence of other acts may be admitted to show motive, intent, preparation or plan. <em>Id. </em>404(b). <em>See, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Porter, </em>659 F.2d 306, 310 (3d Cir.1981). Under the circumstances of this case, the court should have admitted the evidence as relevant, and permitted the <em>jury </em>to consider whether the Authority\u2019s response to criticism on other subjects, if proved, was persuasive of its motivation in firing Morris for the reasons he claims.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>Morris also proffered the testimony of Officer Bruce, who was an employee at the time Morris was discharged, and who acted as a union shop steward during and after Morris\u2019 tenure on the Force.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Unlike Nicola, Bruce was permitted to testify to instances in which he personally had been charged with violations of Force regulations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, Bruce was not allowed to testify regarding complaints made by other officers or the Authority\u2019s response to such complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\">As with the proffered testimony of Officer Nicola, appellant\u2019s contention on appeal with respect to Officer Bruce is that he should have been permitted to testify as to the discipline meted out to officers besides himself and appellant, and to the First Amendment activities of those so disciplined. Appellant argues that Bruce, as one who acted in the capacity of a shop steward handling employee-employer grievances regularly, was qualified to testify as to the correlation, if any, between complaints and discipline, and that the trial court\u2019s confinement of Bruce\u2019s testimony to his own discipline was therefore error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">From the outset, counsel for plaintiff cast as one of \u201creasonableness\u201d the inquiry into the motivation in firing Morris. <em>See, e.g., </em>Tr. 46, \u00cd48. It appears that this emphasis on the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the firing, instead of upon the probable <em>motivation </em>for the firing, ultimately led the court to confine the evidence to the facts surrounding the disciplining of Morris himself. Tr. 167. Although the court at one point appears to have recognized that the discipline accorded other officers could have been relevant to the motivation element, Tr. 168, it is evident from the record that the court gave plaintiff\u2019s counsel the clear impression that Bruce would not be permitted to testify to instances of discipline other than those directed against the witness <em>personally </em>or those with respect to which he represented Morris before the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\">Again, although testimony generally must be based upon personal knowledge, the requisite knowledge can be knowledge of the treatment accorded others. If a proper foundation was laid that Bruce had knowledge of other instances in which protected complaints were followed by official discipline \u2014 whether such knowledge came from first-hand observation, from records kept in the ordinary course of business, or from some other acceptable source \u2014 then he was competent to adduce that evidence. We conclude, therefore, that to the extent the testimony of Nicola and Bruce met these requirements, it should have been admitted.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-11\">(b) <em>Pretext</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1123-12\">The defense offered by the Authority to Morris\u2019 claim was in essence that its decision to discharge Morris was grounded on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>numerous violations of legit\u00edmate Force regulations. The Authority adverted to seventeen breaches of regulations during Morris\u2019 twenty-three month tenure,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> culminating in a failure to report for duty when directly ordered to do so. Assistant Deputy Chief Stewart testified on behalf of the Authority that these recurrent violations constituted the true basis for Morris\u2019 dismissal. Tr. 363-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">Morris sought to meet the Authority\u2019s defense by showing that the series of infractions allegedly leading to his firing was actually a series of unlawful retaliatory actions for various complaints he had voiced, in which the Authority had imposed disproportionate punishment for breaches of rules that normally went unpunished. In short, Morris sought to convince the jury that the Authority\u2019s justification was purely pretex-tual and fabricated only to disguise its real retaliatory motive. <em>See, e.g., </em>Tr. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Morris attempted to substantiate his pretext theory with evidence that the instances of discipline leading up to his discharge typically followed close on the heels of one of his complaints to the Authority. By showing that discipline for breaches of duty that would normally be overlooked was regularly enforced only against those who voiced complaints about conditions of employment, Morris sought to convince the jury that the Authority was in fact unlawfully punishing not the breaches but the speech. This is a typical response, and the jury was fully justified in not believing it. Many violators attempt to excuse their conduct by pointing to someone else who went unpunished for \u201cidentical\u201d conduct. The jury simply decided it was not identical, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\">The trial court permitted Morris to testify to seven instances in which he complained to Authority officials (in one instance, to a D.C. Council member who sat on the Authority board of directors) about disparate treatment accorded black and white officers on the Force. However, when counsel on direct examination attempted to elicit Morris\u2019 account of how each complaint was followed in short order by a finding that he had violated Force regulations \u2014 in each case a violation that Morris alleged would usually have gone unpunished \u2014 the trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objections that the evidence was irrelevant. Because plaintiff had specified only the complaints in its trial brief, and not the consequent unjustified discipline, the court took the view that evidence of the discipline was beyond the scope of plaintiff\u2019s case and barred by the court\u2019s pretrial order.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1124-9\">As it happened, the instances of discipline to which Morris sought to testify were precisely those upon which the Authority relied in contending that its discharge was justified. Both parties sought to put the identical instances of discipline into evidence: Morris, for the purpose of showing that punishment followed his complaints; and the Authority, for the purpose of showing it had legitimate grounds for its action. Morris\u2019 contention on appeal is that he should have been permitted, on direct examination, to testify to the discipline in a way that made evident the retaliatory motivation for the discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-10\">We agree, for several reasons. First, it was evident from the plaintiff\u2019s pretrial statement <em>taken as a whole </em>that Morris would seek in testifying to elucidate the link between his complaints and the disciplinary measures. The pretrial statement includes the contention that \u201cas a result of his lawful and justified complaints his superiors singled him out for harsh discipline not given others, and finally terminated him on the pretext of deficient performance and insubordination.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Pretrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>Statement at II.A(4). It is apparent from this statement of the plaintiff\u2019s basic theory of the case that he sought to prove a connection between his speech and the Authority\u2019s asserted justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">Second, it is evident from the ease put on by the Authority that it could not have been surprised or otherwise prejudiced by the introduction of this testimony. Each instance of discipline about which Morris sought to testify was enumerated in the defendant\u2019s own trial brief. In fact, exposition of these instances constituted the bulk of the defense case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Third, it is by now a recognized fact of employment discrimination litigation that showing of pretext can be part of the plaintiff\u2019s case in chief. The logical structure of a retaliation case, whether based upon Title YII or the First Amendment, consists in (1) the plaintiff proving his prima facie case, (2) the defendant providing a legitimate reason for its action, and (3) the plaintiff then having the opportunity to show that reason to be pretextual. However, the structure of the inquiry does not bar a plaintiff from adducing evidence of pretext at the same time his evidence of unlawful motive is presented. In instances where enforcing a rigid separation between the motivation and pretext cases would prevent the plaintiff from presenting a fair portrayal of the events as they unfolded, there is no reason to exclude evidence of pretext from plaintiff\u2019s case in chief, provided that the court and the defendant have notice, as they did here, of the plaintiff\u2019s ultimate intention to raise the pretext question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">We find under these circumstances that the exclusion of Morris\u2019 testimony regarding the discipline that followed (at least chronologically) his complaints to his employer was an abuse of discretion. Although we endorse the trial court\u2019s issuance of a detailed pretrial order governing the conduct of the litigation, in this instance the enforcement of the terms of part of that order by means of excluding testimony central to the plaintiff\u2019s case was an unduly strict approach. <em>See, e.g., Schneider v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>658 F.2d 835, 848 n. 8 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 994, 102 S.Ct. 1622, 71 L.Ed.2d 855 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">III.

The confusion concerning the stipulation as to Morris\u2019 belief can in some sense be laid at the feet of Morris himself, who propounded the erroneous jury instructions to the contrary, and continues to view the issue of protectedness as requiring proof. On the other hand, it was the Authority that originally sought and received the benefit of the stipulation with which the jury verdict conflicts, <em>i.e., </em>the exclusion of testimony bearing on race discrimination.
