(Studio-1). Blackwell, who served as president of Studio-1, concedes personal liability for these loans because he had guaranteed repayment of the loans. The district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that the debts were not dischargeable because Blackwell obtained the money by false representations. We reverse because 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) (Supp.1979),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> while barring discharge for money obtained by false pretenses, false representations or actual fraud, provides an exception where representations made were \u201cstatement[s] respecting the debtor\u2019s or an insider\u2019s financial condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such statements fall within the purview of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) which expressly provides that the statements be written. Since Blackwell\u2019s statements to plaintiffs were oral and concerned the financial condition of the corporation, an insider under the law, they are not encompassed by \u00a7 523(a)(2) and may not be relied on by his creditors to prevent his discharge in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b567-19\">Blackwell filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in the fall of 1981. From about 1976 until 1980 he and other Studio-1 principals participated on a part-time basis in the activity of the corporation, the promotion of rock concerts. Studio-1 experienced financial problems from its beginning. Losses for 1976 amounted to $17,717; 1977, $17,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>984; 1978, $14,716; and 1979, $89,000. The company had several judgments entered against it and had contemplated bankruptcy in 1977. In April 1979, however, Studio-1 produced a profitable concert that netted over $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Plaintiffs are Ella Dabney (who alleges making loans that were not repaid amounting to $35,000), Edward Bynum ($3000), Joseph Mercer ($4900) and William Hurdle ($3000). The loans in question were made during a period from May 1979 until October 1979. Each of the plaintiffs initially made a short-term loan that was repaid at a substantial rate of interest (from 15% to 20%). A second loan made by Edward By-num was also fully repaid with interest. Later loans were not repaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">At trial, testimony was given concerning Blackwell\u2019s statements to the plaintiffs. Dabney testified that Blackwell convinced her that the business \u201cwas growing\u201d, that \u201che was very successful.\u201d She also testified that the debtor told her that Studio-1 was a \u201ctop-notch company\u201d and that \u201cthey were just blooming.\u201d Other statements made by Blackwell were that \u201cbusiness was going great,\u201d that the corporation was a \u201cvery successful company of some young black men and they were doing very, very good,\u201d and that it was a \u201cstriving business that was doing well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Although holding that the debts were non-dischargeable because the debtor had made a continuing series of misrepresentations to the plaintiffs, the bankruptcy court found that there was no evidence of bad faith or improper withdrawals of funds. The bankruptcy court also rejected claims of fraud or false financial statements. In affirming the decision of the bankruptcy court, the district court found the issue to be whether the debtor\u2019s statements constituted puffing or representations of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">We find it unnecessary to reach the question of whether Blackwell\u2019s statements constituted false representations or puffing because the relevant statutory provision excepts oral statements concerning the debt- or\u2019s or an insider\u2019s financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">In the instant case, Studio-1 is defined as an \u201cinsider\u201d. Where an individual debtor is involved, the definition of \u201cinsider\u201d includes a \u201ccorporation of which the debtor is a director, officer, or person in control.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(25)(A)(iv) (Supp.1979). <em>In re Bedard, </em>19 B.R. 565, 567 (Bkrtcy.E.D.Pa. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">All of the statements made by Blackwell to the plaintiffs were essentially statements concerning the financial condition of Studio-1. Further, all of Blackwell\u2019s statements were oral. The representations are therefore outside the scope of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2) and can not be the basis for preventing discharge of the bankrupt. <em>In re Patch, </em>22 B.R. 970 (Bkrtcy.D.Md.1982); <em>In re Bedard, supra; In re Kiernan, </em>17 B.R. 362 (Bkrtcy.S.D.N.Y.1982); 1 Norton <em>Bankruptcy Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 27-40, \u00a7 27.42 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court and remand for the entry of an order discharging these debts.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b567-14\">(a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, or 1328(b) ... does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">(2) For obtaining money, property, or services, or an extension, renewal, or refinance of credit, by\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\">(A) False pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor\u2019s or an insider\u2019s financial condition; or</p>\n<p id=\"b567-20\">(B) use of a statement in writing\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b567-21\">(i) that is materially false;</p>\n<p id=\"b567-22\">(ii) respecting the debtor\u2019s or an insider\u2019s financial condition;</p>\n<p id=\"b567-23\">(iii) on which the creditor to whom the debtor is liable for obtaining such money, property, services, or credit reasonably relied; and</p>\n<p id=\"b567-24\">(iv) that the debtor caused to be made or published with intent to deceive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
