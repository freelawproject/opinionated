These charges had originally been paid to the Railroad by intervening respondent Union Carbide Corporation. This petition apparently involves a matter of first impression under sections of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Pub.L. No. 96-448, 94 Stat. 1895. For the reasons set forth below, the order of the ICC is reversed and the case remanded with directions to set aside the order of the Kentucky Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b192-21\">The facts are not disputed. In December 1978 and January 1979 Union Carbide shipped 143 cars of coal from Ravenna, Kentucky, to its plant at Kevil, Kentucky, serviced by the Railroad. Because of extreme cold weather, the coal arrived at the plant frozen in the rail cars. Union Carbide had difficulty unloading the coal, and kept the cars in excess of the \u201cfree time\u201d specified by its \u201caverage agreement\u201d with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Railroad.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Railroad assessed demur-rage charges pursuant to the applicable tariff. Union Carbide paid the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">On December 18, 1980 Union Carbide filed a complaint with the Kentucky Commission against the Railroad seeking a refund of the penalty portion of the demur-rage charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Union Carbide contended that the penalty charges were unreasonable, given the extreme weather and its diligence in unloading the coal. The Kentucky Commission agreed, and in its decision of September 9,1981 ordered the Railroad to return $158,690.80 in demurrage charges to Union Carbide.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Kentucky Commission noted that the \u201cextraordinary combination of unusually low temperatures and unusually high precipitation\u201d could not have been foreseen, and ruled that in this case the average agreement was \u201cunenforceable as contrary to the public interest and public policy.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The Railroad subsequently filed its petition for review with the ICC,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> arguing that the decision of the Kentucky Commission not to enforce the average agreement was in violation of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501, as amended by section 214 of the Staggers Act, which in relevant part requires that a state authority exercise jurisdiction \u201cexclusively in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle.\u201d The ICC affirmed the Kentucky Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although noting that \u201cthe I.C.C. generally enforces average agreements,\u201d and that \u201cthe penalty portion of demurrage could arguably indirectly affect carrier revenues to the extent that it encourages efficient car utilization by shippers,\u201d the ICC in this case found that the \u201cKentucky Commission\u2019s decision is within the limits of the discretion remaining to the states.\u201d This petition for review by this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">As a preface to our consideration of section 214 of the Staggers Act, we note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>in this case the ICC assumes the curious position of urging affirmance of a decision that an average demurrage agreement should not be upheld. As the Railroad points out, in the past the ICC has been adamant in its enforcement of average agreements notwithstanding a shipper\u2019s claim of inclement weather and due diligence in unloading cars.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Most recently, in <em>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. v. ICC, </em>685 F.2d 170 (6th Cir.1982), the ICC successfully persuaded the Sixth Circuit that the Commission\u2019s long-standing policy was to enforce average agreements. In that case, as here, the shipper sought relief.from de-murrage charges assessed pursuant to an average agreement. The shipper argued that because the coal arrived frozen in the rail cars, and because all means of unloading the coal had been utilized, the demur-rage charges assessed were unreasonable. In upholding the ICC\u2019s decision not to excuse demurrage charges, the court recognized that</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\"><em>Id., </em>685 F.2d at 174.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">[rjecent cases addressing the issue presented in this appeal have been uniform in their adherence to the policy that penalty demurrage should not be excused where an average agreement is in effect. We join the Third and Fourth Circuits in holding that the Commission has consistently applied this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">[L2] Given the consistent policy of the ICC to enforce average agreements, the issue then becomes whether, as the Railroad contends, the decision of the ICC to deviate from that policy is \u201carbitrary or capricious,\u201d or \u201can abuse of discretion,\u201d or \u201cotherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976). We are aware of the deference due an agency\u2019s construction of a statute committed to its administration, <em>see, e.g., Red Lion Broadcasting v. F.C.C., </em>395 U.S. 367,381, 89 S.Ct. 1794,1801, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969); <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1,16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801,13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965), and that more than mere deference is appropriate where a court examines a regulation promulgated by an agency pursuant to congressionally-delegated authority. <em>Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 424-26 &amp; n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 2399, 2404-06 &amp; n. 9, 53 L.Ed.2d 448 (1977). Here, however, no regulation of the ICC is under consideration, and, as conceded at oral argument, the ICC has not changed its position in regard to the enforcement of average agreements where it acts in the first instance (as opposed to its quasi-appellate function under section 11501). Our task then is one of statutory interpretation, \u201can area in which courts are the final authority.\u201d <em>Western Coal Traffic League v. United States, </em>694 F.2d 378, 383-84 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Federal Election Commission v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Commission, </em>454 U.S. 27, 31-32, 102 S.Ct. 38, 42, 70 L.Ed.2d 23 (1981) (\u201c[courts] must reject administrative constructions of the statute, whether reached by adjudication or by rulemaking, that are inconsistent with the statutory mandate or that frustrate the policy that Congress sought to implement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">Section 214(b)(1) of the Staggers Act (currently codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(b)(1)) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>A state authority may only exercise jurisdiction over intrastate transportation provided by a rail carrier ... if such State authority exercises such jurisdiction exclusively in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In sections 214(b)(1) and 214(1), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11501, <em>et seq., </em>the Staggers Act established a federal certification procedure for state agencies wishing to exercise jurisdiction \u201cover intrastate rates, classifications, rules, and practices.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(b)(2). A state may be certified under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(b)(3)(A) if the ICC determines that the state\u2019s \u201cstandards and procedures are in accordance with the standards and procedures applicable to regulation of rail carriers by the Commission under this title.\u201d The Conference Report accompanying section 214 indicates that \u201c[t]he conferees\u2019 intent is to ensure that the price and service flexibility and revenue adequacy goals of the Act are not undermined by state regulation of rates, practices, etc., which are not in accordance with these goals.\u201d Conf.Rep. No. 1430, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 106, <em>reprinted in </em>4 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3978, 4110, 4138 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The crux of the dispute we must resolve is whether the policy of the ICC to enforce average agreements can be considered a \u201crule\u201d or \u201cpractice\u201d under the Act, thereby requiring conformity by a state railroad commission exercising its authority under the Act. The ICC argues that because the Interstate Commerce Act does not specifically require the enforcement of average agreements, the mandate of section 214(b)(1) that a state exercise jurisdiction \u201cexclusively in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle\u201d is inapplicable. Thus, the ICC contends, whether demurrage agreements are upheld rest within the discretion of a particular state agency. Presumably the state agency could consider elements of local policy, weather, and foreseeability in reaching its determination. Further,. the ICC submits that if certain rulings can be considered binding upon state agencies, then only those matters necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Staggers Act are involved, and the enforcement of average agreements is not one such matter. The decision of the ICC here under review is not helpful. As noted above, the opinion does observe that \u201cthe I.C.C. generally enforces average agreements,\u201d and that \u201cthe penalty portion of demurrage could arguably indirectly affect carrier revenues to the extent that it encourages efficient car utilization by shippers.\u201d Yet these concerns were insufficient to overturn the Kentucky Commission which, it was held, acted \u201cwithin the limits of the discretion remaining to the states.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">We find that a discrete reading of the statute requires that consistent rulings of the ICC must necessarily be incorporated and adhered to by state commissions exercising jurisdiction pursuant to the Staggers Act. The Interstate Commerce Act expressly requires that rail carriers</p>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">compute demurrage charges, and <em>establish rules </em>related to those charges, in a way that fulfills the <em>national needs </em>\u2014 related to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">(1) freight car use and distribution; and</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">(2) maintenance of an adequate supply of freight cars to be available for transportation of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10750 (emphasis added). Moreover, in regard to demurrage charges, we have held that \u201c[t]he appropriate charge and the period of the free time are set by tariff and have nationwide application.\" <em>Central Illinois Pub. Serv. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, </em>659 F.2d 820, 821 (7th Cir.1981). It would be patently inconsistent to hold, as the ICC urges, that although the Interstate Commerce Act requires demurrage charges to be computed and the ICC enforces average agreements, the Staggers Act empowers state agencies to suspend these agreements. Such an interpretation finds no support in the statute or legislative history, and, in fact, is contrary to the command of section '11501(b)(3)(A) that a state\u2019s procedures and standards be \u201cin accordance with\u201d those of the ICC. Indeed, the conference report reflects the concern that service flexibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>not be \u201cundermined by state regulation of rates, <em>practices, </em>etc....\u201d <em>See </em>Conf.Rep. No. 1430, <em>supra </em>at 9 (emphasis added), U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1978, p. 4138. Thus, whether the ICC\u2019s insistence in honoring average agreements is considered a \u201cstandard,\u201d \u201cprocedure,\u201d or \u201cpractice,\u201d it should have been applied by the Kentucky Commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The decision of the ICC is vacated and the case is remanded to set aside the decision of the Kentucky Commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-7\">. Railroads assess demurrage charges when shippers hold railway cars for loading or unloading longer than a specific period, called \u201cfree time.\u201d The appropriate charge and the period of the free time are set by tariff and have nationwide application. The tariff offers two alternative methods of computing demurrage. Under \u201cstraight demurrage,\u201d the charges are computed separately on each car delivered to the shipper, and the shipper is entitled to additional periods of free time in specific situations such as bad weather, frozen lading, strikes or bunching of cars. The alternate method of computing demurrage charges is the \u201caverage agreement\u201d under which the early release of cars by the shipper provides it with credits which can be used to offset debits on other cars held beyond the free time. However, in return for that benefit, the shipper loses the right to receive extra free time for bunching, bad weather, or strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\"><em>Central Illinois Public Service Co. v. ICC, </em>659 F.2d 820, 821 (7th Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\">. \u201cThe compensation portion of the demurrage charge is that amount which adequately compensates the carrier for its losses and expenses resulting from the shipper\u2019s detention of the cars. The portion of the demurrage charge in excess of that amount is the penalty portion.\u201d <em>Central Illinois Public Service Co. v.
