The narrow focus of the present case falls on an apparent conflict between the facial language of two statutes promulgating procedures for the termination of collective bargaining agreements, \u00a7 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, and \u00a7 8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">On this appeal, the appellant unions challenge the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s holding that collective bargaining agreements are executory contracts subject to rejection with court approval under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365, a decision that enables a bankruptcy trustee/debtor-in-possession<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to avoid the more burdensome termination provisions of the N.L.R.A. Assuming arguendo that collective bargaining agreements are subject to the termination provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the unions also urge: (1) that the facts of the present case do not provide adequate justification for the rejection of the agreement and, (2) that the district court and the bankruptcy court applied an incorrect legal analysis to the facts in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-17\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-18\">Brada Miller Freight Systems, Inc. (\u201cthe Company\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brada Miller, Inc., is a special commodities carrier principally engaged in trucking in the midwestern United States. It is a signatory to the \u201cNational Master Freight Agreement and Central States Area Iron and Steel and Special Commodity Rider\u201d and the \u201cNational Master Freight Agreement and Central States Local Cartage Supplemental Agreement,\u201d two collective bargaining agreements negotiated between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>and an employer association to which Brada Miller belongs. These agreements were effective for the period April 1, 1979, to March 31, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The Company was acquired by Dean Cut-singer in January 1979, and its corporate headquarters was moved from Kokomo, Indiana to Birmingham, Alabama. At the time Cutsinger acquired the Company, it was profitably operating an average of 550 motorized units a day out of 29 terminals. In 1978, the Company generated daily gross revenues of $180,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Immediately after Cutsinger acquired the Company, a strike ensued which shut down Brada Miller\u2019s operations for approximately four months. The effects of the strike and a slowdown in the automobile industry, the principal market of the Company, precipitated a gradual decline in the Company\u2019s business. The Company showed a net operating loss of $188,000 for 1979, and, by the end of August 1980, the number of motorized units operated by the Company plummeted to 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">In the summer of 1980, the Company, in an effort to stave off impending bankruptcy, implemented a number of cost-cutting measures. Non-essential personnel were laid off, and a number of miscellaneous operating expenses were decreased or eliminated. The Company also approached its creditors and attempted to defer the amounts due under various accounts payable and loan installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">These actions, however, proved too little, too late. On August 1, 1980, the Company and its parent organization filed reorganization petitions under Chapter XI of Title 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101 <em>et seq. </em>in the bankruptcy court for the Northern District of Alabama. Brada Miller Freight Systems, Inc., continued to operate the Company as, a debtor-in-possession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Simultaneously with the filing of its bankruptcy petition, the Company took two additional actions which are relevant to this appeal. First, the Company requested that the court approve the Company\u2019s rejection of its collective bargaining agreements pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365. In an ex parte order entered on August 5, 1980, four days after the filing of the petition, the court authorized the rejection, but subsequently set its order aside on a motion by the unions pending a formal hearing on August 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Second, the Company informed its terminal managers that the collective bargaining agreements with the Teamsters had been rejected, and the managers were ordered to execute independent contracts with individual drivers. Several Teamsters members chose to continue operations as independent contractors, but those members who refused were not assigned further work by the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">Prior to the time of the hearing on the rejection of the contracts, various Teamsters locals filed charges with the N.L.R.B. contending that certain conduct of the Company pursuant to the rejection of the collective bargaining agreements constituted unfair labor practices. Following separate investigations, both the Detroit and Indianapolis Regional Offices of the N.L. R.B. issued complaints against the Company. These complaints were consolidated for a December 8,1980, hearing in Indianapolis.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">In addition to the above actions, the N.L. R.B., pursuant to its power under \u00a7 10(j) of the N.L.R.A., 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(j), sought an injunction from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois to compel the Company to cease numerous alleged unfair labor practices. On December 4, the Company, alleging that the N.L.R.B. proceedings and the federal district court action unduly interfered with the Company\u2019s continuing operations and its efforts to achieve reorganization, filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking a stay of all pending proceedings on the unfair labor practice charges. The bankruptcy court granted the stay following an informal hearing and set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>the matter down for a formal hearing on December 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">The bankruptcy court entered its findings on December 22, 1980. The bankruptcy court estimated that the Company\u2019s \u201cbreakeven point\u201d, <em>i.e. </em>the amount of gross revenues necessary for the Company to meet its operating expenses, was $102,000 daily for 1980. The court noted that throughout August and September of 1980, the daily gross receipts from operations were consistently less than $35,000 per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">A large portion of the Company\u2019s costs were its obligations under the collective bargaining agreements. The bankruptcy court found that these obligations, including wages for unionized employees, health insurance payments, pension fund payments, holiday time, vacation time, funeral and sick leave, subscription to the Motor Carriers\u2019 Labor Advisory Council, and various paperwork, cost the Company approximately $32,000 per day. The Company\u2019s remaining operating expenses equaled $70,-000 per day in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">The court held that the Company\u2019s attempt to reject its collective bargaining agreement was a proper exercise of the powers granted to a debtor-in-possession by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365. The court then concluded, \u201c[TJhere is ample evidence to support the rejection of the Union Contract which existed prior to the petition and the said rejection is approved.\u201d The court did not specify the precise facts on which it based this judgment or articulate the applicable legal test which might justify such a conclusion given the facts of the present case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">The N.L.R.B. and the affected unions appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The district court, <em>inter alia, </em>affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment- that collective bargaining agreements are subject to rejection under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(a) and concluded that substantial evidence existed to support the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of the Company\u2019s motion to reject. The court found that a denial of the motion to reject would likely have resulted in the collapse of Brada Miller and that the equities therefore weighed in favor of rejection; the court found that this evidence satisfied the two-pronged test for rejection promulgated in <em>Shopmen\u2019s Local Union No. 455 v. Kevin Steel Products, Inc., </em>519 F.2d 698 (2d Cir.1975) and <em>Brotherhood of Railway, Airline, and Steamship Clerks v. REA Express, </em>523 F.2d 164 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied </em>423 U.S. 1017, 1073, 96 S.Ct. 451, 855, 46 L.Ed.2d 389, 47 L.Ed.2d 82 (1975).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">The preliminary issue facing this Court is whether the rejection/termination of a collective bargaining agreement by a debtor-in-possession is governed by the statutory scheme of \u00a7 8(d) of the N.L.R.A. or \u00a7 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-14\">Section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides in relevant part: \u201c[A bankruptcy] trustee, subject to the court\u2019s approval, may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.\u201d This section, designed to allow the trustee or debt- or-in-possession to escape burdensome obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>gations of the debtor and facilitate the \u201cfresh start\u201d envisioned by the Code\u2019s reorganization provisions, is, for the purposes of this appeal, identical to \u00a7 313 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 713) (repealed).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, prior case law considering the relationship of \u00a7 313 and the N.L.R.A. is relevant to our disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Section 8(d) of the N.L.R.A. provides a detailed four-step process that a moving party must follow in order to terminate or modify a collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even if this procedure is complied with, a party to a collective bargaining agreement is subject to unfair labor practice charges if it breaches the terms of the agreement prior to the agreement\u2019s expiration date.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">The unions in the present case do not argue that a collective bargaining agreement is not an \u201cexecutory contract\u201d as that term is commonly defined.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, they urge that Congress, in enacting \u00a7 8(d), intended to carve out collective bargaining agreements as an exception to the unilateral rejection provisions of \u00a7 365. In support of this interpretation, the unions\u2019 briefs discuss extensively the history of this nation\u2019s labor laws, citing numerous instances of the Supreme Court\u2019s and the Congress\u2019 recognition of the critical role played by the collective bargaining process in the prevention of industrial strife and the smooth maintenance of U.S. commerce. However, despite the forceful arguments by counsel for the unions, we conclude that Congress intended collective bargaining agreements to be subject to unilateral rejection by the bankruptcy trustee (with the approval of the court) under \u00a7 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">Federal appellate courts previously considering this issue<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> have advanced a legal concept which largely avoids the necessity of accommodating the apparently conflicting language of \u00a7 365 and \u00a7 8(d). This concept, the so-called \u201cnew entity theory,\u201d is based on the notion that a debtor-in-possession is not the same legal entity as the pre-bankruptcy company, but a \u201cnew entity ... with its own rights and duties, subject to the supervision of the bankruptcy court.\u201d <em>Kevin Steel, </em>519 F.2d at 704. Since this new entity is not a party to the collective bargaining agreement, it is not bound by the strictures of \u00a7 8(d) and is free to seek rejection of collective bargaining agreements subject only to the applicable legal test for rejection under \u00a7 365. These courts have likened the bankruptcy trustee to a successor employer; like a successor employer, the trustee is held only to a duty to negotiate with the collective bargaining unit and is not bound by the substantive terms of the prior agreement to which it was not a party.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-16\">While the new entity theory is a useful analytical tool, this Court (along with numerous commentators)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is troubled by cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>tain conceptual inconsistencies which compel us to seek an alternative ground for the resolution of the statutory conflict. While we recognize that the debtor-in-possession may constitute a \u201cnew juridical entity\u201d for some purposes,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we find the debtor-in-possession indistinguishable from the pre-bank-ruptcy corporation as far as concerns their respective obligations under the collective bargaining agreement and the labor laws that regulate the formation, existence, and termination of such agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">The most obvious problem with the new entity theory is the statutory requirement that a debtor-in-possession, purportedly not a party to contracts executed by the pre-bankruptcy corporation, apply to the bankruptcy court for approval of its rejection of a collective bargaining agreement. If Congress had intended that the debtor-in-possession be in no way bound by the contracts of the pre-bankruptcy entity, the statutory scheme could simply prescribe that the filing of the bankruptcy petition constitutes a breach of all executory contracts to which the debtor is a party and grant the trustee/debtor-in-possession discretionary power merely to assume, not reject, these contracts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">Conversely, if a bankruptcy court refuses to allow a debtor-in-possession to reject a collective bargaining agreement, the debt- or-in-possession is bound retroactively to the agreement from the time of the filing of the petition;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> yet, the proponents of the new entity concept have failed to articulate a legal theory which justifies binding a \u201cnon-party\u201d to the agreement. In these circumstances, the new entity theory collides head on with the fact that a debtor-in-possession may be held accountable for breaches of the collective bargaining agreement committed in the time between the filing of the petition and the motion for rejection.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">In short, the viability of the new entity theory is contingent on the bankruptcy court\u2019s granting of the debtor-in-possession\u2019s motion to reject the collective bargaining agreement. Its fragility is all too apparent in contrary situations where the debtor-in-possession is compelled to comply with the terms of an existing collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">Perhaps recognizing some of the inherent faults of the new entity theory, the Second Circuit, its principal proponent, has attempted to restrict the theory\u2019s application since its promulgation, in <em>Kevin Steel </em>and <em>REA Express. </em>In <em>Matter of Unishops, Inc., </em>543 F.2d 1017, 1018-9 (2d Cir.1976), the court wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">We again caution that the language of <em>[Kevin </em>Steel] stating that \u201c[a] debtor-in-possession under Chapter XI ... is not the same entity as the pre-bankruptcy company\u201d should not be extended as a generalization in cases other than those involving labor collective bargaining agreements where the claim is that Section 8(d) of the [NLRA] ... precludes disaffirmance of the labor agreement in a Chapter XI proceeding without taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>the steps required under Section 8(a) of the Labor Act; or under the Railway Labor Act ...<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">However, this constraining language does nothing to cure the problems with the theory; once it is determined that \u00a7 365 is applicable to collective bargaining agreements, we see no evidence of a distinction by Congress between collective bargaining agreements and ordinary executory contracts that would support the Second Circuit\u2019s efforts to limit the theory\u2019s applications. The more the theory is forcibly restricted to a particular legal situation, the more apparent becomes its character as a \u201clegal fiction.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Therefore, rather than sidestep the apparent clash between the relevant statutes by the application of a legal concept that seems not wholly satisfactory, this Court finds it more beneficial to recognize the conflict in the statutory language and attempt to reconcile the statutes in a manner which best effectuates the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Our analysis begins with the wording of \u00a7 365. The appellant unions have failed to present the slightest indication that Congress intended \u201cexecutory contracts\u201d to be interpreted in other than its everyday meaning. Though we are constantly aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201ca thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the statute, because not within its spirit or the intention of its makers,\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> a more persuasive showing is required to justify a variation from explicit Congressional dictates than has been made in the present case; this is especially true where, as here, critical federal policies of equal magnitude weigh on each side.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">Our decision, however, does not rest merely on the facial language of the conflicting statutes. Like every federal court which has considered this issue, we are particularly persuaded by the existence of that portion of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1167,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> in which Congress specifically exempts collective bargaining agreements formed under the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq.) </em>from the operation of \u00a7 365. As the Second Circuit noted in <em>Kevin Steel, </em>this action by Congress shows that \u201cCongress knew how to remove labor agreements from the scope of a general power to reject executory contracts.\u201d 618 F.2d at 704. The impact of Congress\u2019 failure to exempt other types of collective bargaining agreements is strengthened by the numerous amendments of the bankruptcy and labor statutes,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> particularly the recent over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>haul of the bankruptcy laws which left untouched the narrow exemption for railway labor agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Moreover, we must reject the unions\u2019 contention that there is no rational basis on which to distinguish railway labor agreements from collective bargaining agreements in other industries. The mere existence of the Railway Labor Act demonstrates the unique status of labor relations in the railroad industry, a status frequently recognized by both Congress and the courts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Furthermore, though we do not fully accept the frequently made analogy between a debtor-in-possession and a successor employer, some of the factors behind the Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to bind successor employers to the substantive terms of collective bargaining agreements created by prior management lend weight to our conclusion in this ease. As the Supreme Court noted in Burns, to bind a successor employer to the substantive terms of a collective bargaining agreement negotiated by its predecessor would often interfere with the alienability of business enterprises and therefore frustrate the most efficient use of the nation\u2019s resources. 406 U.S. at 287-88, 92 S.Ct. at 1582. These same considerations apply with perhaps even greater force in the present context; if a corporation attempting to reorganize under Chapter XI is compelled to retain verbatim its pre-bank-ruptcy collective bargaining agreement, regardless of the degree to which the burdens imposed by the agreement contributed to the corporation\u2019s demise, it would often be impossible to induce fresh management and capital to participate in the revitalization effort of a bankrupt enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">We do not contemplate that Congress intended the ultimate fate of a corporation under Chapter XI to rest so largely in the hands of the company\u2019s protected employees. There simply exist too many other critical interests, those of other employees, creditors, and shareholders, the protection of which provides the stimulus for the bankruptcy laws, for this Court to conclude that the collective bargaining agreement was meant to hold a stranglehold position, totally immune from the flexibility provided by \u00a7 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">This is not to say, however, that the interests of employees subject to a collective bargaining agreement are not superior to the interests of other parties affected by a bankruptcy. The vital stake of this Nation in the encouragement and enforcement of these pacts between management and employees is so well-documented as not to require recitation here. But these interests find protection not in the inflexible position urged upon us by the unions in the present case, but in the test applied by the bankruptcy court in determining whether to allow the rejection of the collective bargaining agreement. It is this test to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">An ordinary commercial contract may be rejected by a bankruptcy trustee upon a showing that rejection would benefit the estate. 2 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>1365.03 (15th ed. 1981). However, this minimal burden is insufficient to protect the special rights accruing to employees under the federal labor laws.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>courts have imposed a heavier burden on a debtor-in-possession attempting to reject a labor-management contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\"><em>Kevin Steel </em>was the first federal appellate decision to struggle with articulating a test which would provide adequate protection to employees victimized by the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement while not throwing up intractable roadblocks before a bankrupt company seeking the advantages of Chapter 11 reorganization. The Second Circuit in that case adopted the proposal advanced in <em>In Re Overseas National Airways, Inc., </em>238 F.Supp. 359, 361 (E.D.N.Y.1965), that a bankruptcy court should approve rejection of a collective bargaining agreement \u201conly after thorough scrutiny, and a careful balancing of the equities on both sides ...\u201d <em>Kevin Steel, </em>519 F.2d at 707. The court noted that a bankruptcy court must \u201cmove cautiously\u201d in granting a motion to reject a collective bargaining agreement given the important labor interests involved. <em>Id:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In <em>REA Express, </em>decided only a few months after <em>Kevin Steel, </em>a panel of the Second Circuit considered an appeal from a district court order granting a motion of the employer to reject a collective bargaining agreement negotiated under the Railway Labor Act. Though purporting to apply the balancing test proposed in <em>Kevin Steel, </em>the <em>REA Express </em>court tacked on the additional requirement that a bankruptcy court could allow the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement only if it \u201cconcludes that an onerous and burdensome ex-ecutory collective bargaining agreement will thwart efforts to save a failing [company] in bankruptcy from collapse ...\u201d <em>REA Express, </em>523 F.2d at 169. In other words,</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">regardless of the outcome of a court\u2019s consideration of the interests of employees, unionized and non-unionized, creditors, and shareholders, a collective bargaining agreement could be rejected only if the financial obligations imposed by the agreement were determined to be the difference between successful reorganization and forced liquidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">The discrepancy between these two tests went unrecognized until <em>N.L.R.B. v. Bildis-co, </em>682 F.2d 72 (3d Cir.1982), <em>cert, granted,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">- U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 784, 74 L.Ed.2d</p>\n<p id=\"b974-10\">992 (1983). Until this time most courts apparently accepted the <em>REA Express </em>test as merely a fuller articulation of the somewhat loosely-worded standard of <em>Kevin Steel. </em>Thus, most courts have required a debtor-in-possession to make a threshold showing that successful reorganization is contingent on rejection of the challenged collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">In <em>Bildisco, </em>the Third Circuit noted the inconsistent language of the <em>Kevin Steel </em>and <em>REA Express </em>opinions and explicitly rejected the additional showing required by <em>REA Express. </em>682 F.2d at 79. The <em>Bildis-co </em>court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">[The <em>REA </em>standard], in our view, goes well beyond the \u201cbalancing of equities\u201d required by <em>Kevin Steel. </em>We reject this more stringent test for two discrete but related reasons: first, for the pragmatic reason that it may be impossible to predict the success vel non of a reorganization until very late in the arrangement proceedings; and second, for the prudential consideration that the imposition of such a test unduly exalts the perpetuation of the collective bargaining agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>ment over the more pragmatic consideration of whether the employees will continue to have jobs at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">682 F.2d at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">We agree with the <em>Bildisco </em>court, particularly with regard to its latter conclusion that the test of <em>REA Express </em>imposes an excessive burden on the debtor-in-possession, one that subordinates the myriad of diverse interests at stake to a single issue: the ability of the debtor-in-possession to show by a preponderance of the evidence that forced liquidation is a certainty absent a rejection of the collective bargaining agreement. We find, as did the <em>Bildisco </em>court, that the <em>Kevin Steel </em>balancing of the equities test provides a more satisfactory accommodation of the conflicting interests at stake in a rejection proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">The probability of a forced liquidation is only one factor (though an important one) in a court\u2019s consideration of a motion to reject; the failure of a debtor-in-possession to carry the burden suggested by <em>REA Express </em>should not be so firmly dispositive of the various interests at stake in a reorganization proceeding. To elevate this single consideration to such a dominant and decisive position allows the issue of rejection to be settled without any consideration of the interests of other parties involved, a total abdication of the policies behind the bankruptcy laws.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">Obviously each Chapter XI proceeding presents a unique set of circumstances. Hence, no hard-and-fast test may be applied in every case. There are, however, a number of factors which we think might properly be considered by a bankruptcy court addressing a motion to reject; while we do not pretend that the factors discussed below are necessarily exhaustive, we believe that these factors, if adequately considered, will strike an appropriate balance among the important policies at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">First, of course, is the possibility of liquidation, both with and without the rejection,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and the impact of liquidation on each of the parties involved. We do not envision a particularized consideration of the effect of liquidation on individual employees, creditors, and shareholders, but rather a weighing of the impact on these groups in the aggregate.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In calculating the probability of liquidation after the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement, the bankruptcy court should bear in mind that a debtor-in-possession, even after rejection, is compelled to bargain with an established bargaining unit in an attempt to execute a new collective bargaining agreement;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> therefore, the impact of a potential strike on the debtor need also enter into the court\u2019s calculus.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">Second, (and closely related to the first), a court should consider the claims that will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>result from the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement, both in terms of the adequacy of relief for the employees and other claimants, and the impact of these claims on the debtor. This factor is especially important since many of the benefits received by employees under collective bargaining agreements are non-monetary and generally incapable of providing a basis for a damage award.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In considering both this factor and the previous one, a court may find it appropriate to treat employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement and non-covered employees as distinct groups, paying particular attention to the proportion of covered employees in the entire workforce of the bankrupt company.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Third, the cost-spreading abilities of the parties must be considered in a resolution based on the equities. Certainly, a $50,000 loss to a group of employees averaging $20,-000 a year in salary may have a far more devastating impact than a $100,000 loss suffered by a group of large banks and other major creditors or by the debtor-employer itself. The consideration of this factor seems especially appropriate since it was the discrepancy in economic power between labor and management that provided the impetus behind the establishment of the labor law policies we now seek to preserve.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">Finally, the good (or bad) faith of the unions and the debtor in seeking to resolve their mutual dilemma might be examined by the bankruptcy court. For example, did the employer seek concessions from the unions prior to its attempt to reject the contract? If so, how cooperative was the union? The tone of past negotiations between the parties is also relevant in evaluating their behavior. We stop short of requiring that the parties commence the bargaining process prior to the granting of a motion to reject,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> but we leave it to the discretion of the. bankruptcy court to require such bargaining after considering the likelihood of success, the potential length of the negotiations, and the impact of delay on the debt- or-employer.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>In conclusion, we must address the fears expressed by the appellant unions in the present case that employers will enter Chapter XI and utilize the Section 365 mechanism for the sole purpose of escaping a union contract. It has long been held that such an abuse of the bankruptcy and labor laws will not be tolerated under any circumstances.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the balancing of the equities, a bankruptcy court must make an \u201cexplicit showing in the record that the debtors were not improperly motivated by a desire to rid themselves of the union\u201d prior to allowing the rejection of a collective bargaining agreement. <em>In Re Figure Flattery, Inc., </em>88 Lab.Cas.
