Title II of the Redwood National Park Expansion Act of 1978, Pub.L. No. 95-250, 92 Stat. 163 (\u201cRedwood Act\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides benefits to certain employees affected by the expansion of the Park. The petitioners appeal the decision of the Secretary of Labor that they do not qualify for Redwood Act benefits. We note jurisdiction under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 797(h) and affirm the decision of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Forest employees may qualify for Redwood Act benefits if they are both \u201ccovered\u201d by the Act and \u201caffected\u201d by the Park expansion, as defined by \u00a7\u00a7 201(10) and 201(11), respectively.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Secretary found that the petitioners were not affected employees. Section 201(11) provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"aiq-dedup-0\">\u201caffected employee\u201d means a covered employee who is either totally or partially laid off by an affected employer within a time period beginning on or after May 31, 1977, and ending September 30, 1980, unless extended, as provided in section 203, or is determined by the Secretary to be adversely affected by the expansion of the Redwood National Park. An employee shall be deemed adversely affected as of the date of the employee\u2019s layoff, downgrading or termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">It is agreed that the petitioners were laid off during the qualifying time period. The dispute is over whether Nor-Cal Cutters is an affected employer. If Nor-Cal Cutters is an affected employer, it would be as an affected contract employer, which is defined as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">\u201caffected contract employer\u201d means an affected employer providing services pursuant to contract with an affected woods employer, if at least 15 per centum of said employer\u2019s employee-hours worked during calendar year 1977 were within or <em>directly related to </em>the expansion area pursuant to such contract or contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"AU8\">Redwood Act, \u00a7 201(9) (emphasis added). There is no question that Nor-Cal provided services pursuant to a contract with an affected woods employer, namely, Simpson Timber Co. However, there is also no question that Nor-Cal did not work 15% of its employee hours within the Park expansion area during 1977. Accordingly, petitioners argue that Nor-Cal\u2019s operations were \u201cdirectly related to the expansion area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">When interpreting provisions of the Redwood Act, we are guided by \u00a7 213(f) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If there are two or more reasonable interpretations of the Act, we determine whether the Secretary has fulfilled his obligation to choose that reasonable interpretation most favorable to employees. <em>Lanning </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>650 F.2d 1055, 1057 n. 4 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">The petitioners would define \u201cdirectly related to the expansion area\u201d as meaning \u201cwithin the ambit of an affected woods employer\u2019s integrated operation involving expansion-area land so that there was a direct and proximate relationship between the use or loss of such expansion lands and the continuation or curtailment of the contract activities.\u201d The Secretary defines the statutory language as referring to' \u201cnecessary supportive services required to harvest timber from the expansion area,\u201d or wood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>processing operations that \u201cinclude, and are dependent on, wood obtained directly from the expansion area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The petitioners\u2019 proposed interpretation is unreasonable. It substantially begs the question by failing to define a \u201cdirect and proximate relationship\u201d between the contract activity and the expansion area, other than by implying that the former is dependent upon the latter. Perhaps petitioners are proposing a test that would allow Nor-Cal to qualify as an affected contract employer if the termination of Nor-Cal\u2019s contract could be traced to Park expansion. In this vein, petitioners have argued that Nor-Cal lost its contracts when contractors who had formerly worked in the expansion area moved into nearby forest land and displaced Nor-Cal. This argument, however valid, is irrelevant to \u00a7 201(9), which clearly requires a direct relationship between a contract employer\u2019s work performed in 1977 and the park expansion land itself, rather than between contract termination and the fact of Park expansion in 1978. <em>See Ashcom v. Donovan, </em>674 F.2d 805, 806 (9th Cir.1982) (\u201cThe direct relationship that seems to be contemplated [by \u00a7 201(9)] is between the work itself and the expansion area .... \u201d). Petitioners\u2019 \u201cripple effect\u201d definition fails to provide for such a relationship. Moreover, this definition could logically extend to any Northern California employer under contract to an affected woods employer. Such an expansive interpretation cannot be derived from the specific and narrowly phrased language of \u00a7 201(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We find the Secretary\u2019s definition to be reasonable. Applying the mandate of \u00a7 213(f), we find it favorable to employees since it does not unduly narrow the types of supportive services that may be related to the expansion area. We agree with the Secretary that the qualifying supportive services must be necessary, because the work outside the expansion area must be <em>directly </em>related to activities within. Judged by this interpretation, there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s finding that Nor-Cal did not have 15% of its 1977 employee hours devoted to necessary supportive services for timber harvesting in the Park expansion area or to wood processing operations involving expansion area timber. Accordingly, Nor-Cal is not an affected contract employer, and the petitioners cannot claim affected employee status through their employment with Nor-Cal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Petitioner Langford believes that he can qualify as an affected employee through his employment with other contract employers. We remand his petition alone to allow consideration of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED IN PART AS TO PETITIONER LANGFORD.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\">.
