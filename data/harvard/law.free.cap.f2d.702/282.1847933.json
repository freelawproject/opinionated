(High Beta) and Eric Rosenfeld, its sole shareholder, brought a diversity action in Massachusetts federal district court claiming that a yacht made by defendant S.F.C. Corporation and sold to High Beta by defendant Spar, Shaft &amp; Hull, Inc., (Spar) was defective. The district court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 action without prejudice for several reasons \u2014 namely, that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over defendants; that venue did not lie in Massachusetts; that Rosenfeld suffered no harm and thus could not sue in his personal capacity; and that defendants were not, as alleged by plaintiffs, subject to Mass.Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93A, \u00a7 2. Plaintiffs appealed, filing a brief that argued only the \u201cpersonal jurisdiction\u201d issue. In response, defendants pointed out that \u201clack of venue\u201d also provided sufficient support for the district court\u2019s decision and asked us to dismiss the appeal. We need not decide whether plaintiffs\u2019 brief waived the venue question, <em>see Pignons S.A. de Mecanique v. Polaroid Corp., </em>701 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1983), nor need we decide the \u201cpersonal jurisdiction\u201d question, for the district court\u2019s decision on venue is obviously correct. <em>Cf. Leroy v. Great Western United Corp., </em>443 U.S. 173, 180, 99 S.Ct. 2710, 2714, 61 L.Ed.2d 464 (1979) (appellate court may address issue of venue before personal jurisdiction \u201cwhen there is a sound prudential justification for doing so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">The United States Code,'28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(a), states that venue in a federal diversity case exists only \u201cin the judicial district where all plaintiffs or all defendants reside, or in which the claim arose.\u201d Plaintiff High Beta is not a Massachusetts resident. A corporate <em>plaintiff </em>is for venue purposes a resident only in the state in which it is incorporated, and High Beta is incorporated in Delaware. We need not consider whether High Beta is nonetheless \u201cdoing business\u201d in Massachusetts within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(c), for that section of the Code applies only to corporate defendants, not to corporate plaintiffs. See <em>Reuben H. Donnelley Corp. v. F.T.C., </em>580 F.2d 264, 269-70 (7th Cir.1978); <em>Data Disc, Inc. v. Systems Technology Associates, Inc., </em>557 F.2d 1280, 1289 (9th Cir.1977); <em>American Cyanamid Co. v. Hammond Lead Products, Inc., </em>495 F.2d 1183, 1185-87 (3d Cir. 1974); <em>Manchester Modes, Inc. v. Schuman, </em>426 F.2d 629, 630-33 (2d Cir.1970); <em>Carter-Beveridge Drilling Co. v. Hughes, </em>323 F.2d 417, 418 (5th Cir.1963) <em>(per curiam); Robert E. Lee &amp; Co. v. Veatch, </em>301 F.2d 434, 436-38 (4th Cir.1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 813, 83 S.Ct. 23, 9 L.Ed.2d 55 (1962); <em>Dixie Portland Flour Mills, Inc. v. Dixie Feed &amp; Seed Co., </em>272 F.Supp. 826, 829 (W.D.Tenn. 1965), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>382 F.2d 830 (6th Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">Neither do \u201call defendants\u201d reside in Massachusetts. The defendants include: S.F.C. Corp., which made the yacht; Seidelmann-Scarborough Corp., S.F.C. Corp.\u2019s successor; Robert Seidelmann, president and chairman of the board of Seidelmann-Scarborough Corp.; Spar, Shaft &amp; Hull, Inc., which sold the yacht; Leigh Weiss, Spar\u2019s president; and Donald Weiss, Leigh\u2019s brother. Seidelmann and the two Weisses make their home in New Jersey rather than Massachusetts, and plaintiffs pleaded the residence of these defendants as New Jersey. <em>See generally </em>15 C. Wright, A, Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3805 (1976); <em>Shaw v. Quincy Mining Co., </em>145 U.S. 444, 449, 12 S.Ct. 935, 937, 36 L.Ed. 768 (1892) (dictum); <em>Schultz v. McAfee, </em>160 F.Supp. 210, 212 (D.Me.1958) (\u201c \u2018re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>side\u2019 means \u2018are domiciled\u2019 \u201d). The individual defendants have not consented to suit in Massachusetts, <em>cf. Olberding v. Illinois Central Railroad Co., </em>346 U.S. 338, 74 S.Ct. 83, 98 L.Ed. 39 (1953); <em>Martin v. Fishbach Trucking Co., </em>183 F.2d 53 (1st Cir.1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Finally, \u201cthe claim\u201d did not arise in Massachusetts. As the district court pointed out in discussing personal jurisdiction, \u201cevery crucial event [in] ... this case happened outside Massachusetts.\u201d The case concerns a sale of a boat under a contract made outside of Massachusetts to a \u201cforeign\u201d corporation which took delivery of the boat in Delaware and found the boat (allegedly) inadequate during a later trip to Bermuda. We note that several minor, related events took place in Massachusetts: Rosenfeld first met Donald Weiss on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Rosenfeld initiated several long-distance phone conversations with defendants while he was in Massachusetts; defendants twice mailed promotional material into Massachusetts; and High Beta and Spar signed a financing agreement in Massachusetts. But, whether one uses a \u201csignificant contacts\u201d test, <em>see, e.g., Data Disc, Inc. v. Systems Technology Associates, Inc., </em>557 F.2d 1280, 1289 (9th Cir.1977) (\u201ca claim arises in any district with which it has \u2018significant contacts\u2019 \u201d), a \u201cplace of injury\u201d test, <em>see, e.g., Grappone, Inc. v. Subaru of America, Inc., </em>403 F.Supp. 123, 133 (D.N.H. 1975) (\u201cI agree that, in determining where the claim arose, courts should use the weight of the contacts test, but I also feel that the place of injury should be given great weight and consideration by the court\u201d), a \u201cconvenience of the parties\u201d test, <em>see, e.g., Leroy v. Great Western United Corp., </em>443 U.S. 173,185, 99 S.Ct. 2710, 2717, 61 L.Ed.2d 464 (1979) (convenience to defendant arguably relevant under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b)), or any other test that one can think of, these few peripheral contacts do not mean that the claim \u201carose\u201d in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">This case does not belong in the Massachusetts district court and that court\u2019s judgment is consequently</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
