Lipscomb did not testify in his own defense; had he done so, the government would have impeached his credibility with an eight-year-old robbery conviction under Rule 609(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Three other defense witnesses did testify and were impeached by prior felony convictions. In ruling that these prior convictions satisfied Rule 609(a)(l)\u2019s requirement that \u201cthe probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant,\u201d the district court had before it only the names of the crimes, their dates, and, for the defendant Lipscomb, his age when the robbery was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-16\">Lipscomb contends that without some information on the facts and circumstances underlying a prior conviction, the district court cannot determine whether the conviction is probative of a witness\u2019 credibility at all or, if it is probative, whether the probative value of the conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect. The government contends that the district court not only does not need to inquire into the facts and circumstances of a prior conviction in order to balance probativeness against prejudice, but should not be permitted to do so. We hold that (1) all convictions that meet the Rule 609(a)(1) threshold are at least somewhat probative of credibility; (2) the trial court has discretion to decide how much background information, if any, it needs to perform Rule 609(a)(l)\u2019s balance of probativeness against prejudice to the defendant; and (3) the district court did not abuse its discretion in this case. We therefore affirm\u2019 the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-17\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-18\">A. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-19\">Lipscomb was tried twice on a charge of possession of heroin with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The first trial ended in a hung jury; the second led to a conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>to six years imprisonment. At both trials, the prosecution and the defense offered radically different versions of the events leading to Lipscomb\u2019s arrest. Thus, the credibility of the defense witnesses was central to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-4\">For the prosecution, Officer Thomas Gal-logly testified that on the afternoon of March 6, 1981, while in plainclothes, he observed a blue Buick parked on the corner of Fourth and Ridge Streets, Northwest, District of Columbia, an area known for heavy narcotics traffic. The car was surrounded by several men. Gallogly saw one of the men approach the car and pass money through the window to the driver in return for a small white object, which Gallogly suspected was a bag of heroin. Two more apparent transactions followed, but Gallogly did not see the objects that were exchanged. Gallogly identified the driver as the defendant Lipscomb.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-5\">Lipscomb then drove several blocks, parked again, stepped out of his car, and began talking to someone. Gallogly, who had followed in his own car, got out and approached Lipscomb. Lipscomb turned around, saw Officer Gallogly, and immediately removed an object from his mouth, dropped it on the ground, and stepped on it. At the same time, Officer Gallogly smelled burning marijuana. He identified himself as a police officer and asked Lipscomb for his driver\u2019s license, to which Lipscomb replied that he had no license. Gallogly then retrieved the object that Lipscomb had dropped, concluded that it was probably a marijuana cigarette, and arrested Lipscomb for driving without a license and for possession of marijuana.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-14\">Officer Gallogly searched Lipscomb and found 25 white plastic packets, later determined to contain heroin, and $820 in cash. He also found seven packets of heroin on the floor of the Buick.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Officer Gallogly\u2019s partner, Officer Mark Barrows, was not in a position to see the earlier heroin transactions, but confirmed that Gallogly had found heroin in Lipscomb\u2019s pockets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-15\">Lipscomb testified on his own behalf at the first trial but did not testify at the second trial. He stated that he spent most of the afternoon in question at home with his mother and his girlfriend, Rovetta Williams. He had loaned his car to a friend, Daryl Smith, who came by to drop off the car. Lipscomb then drove the car to Smith\u2019s mother\u2019s house to drop off Smith, dropped off Williams at her house, and returned to Smith\u2019s mother\u2019s house to pick up Smith and take him home. As Lipscomb got out of the car, Officers Gallogly and Barrows approached and asked for his driver\u2019s license. After Lipscomb stated that he had no license, the officers searched him and found cash but no heroin. They also found no heroin inside the car, but did remove a brown paper bag from the trunk; Lipscomb knew nothing about the bag. The cash was for a trip to New York he planned to take with his girlfriend Williams.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lipscomb\u2019s story was corroborated by his mother, by his girlfriend, by his friend Smith, and by two other friends, Robert Green and Floyd Little, who claimed to be eyewitnesses to the arrest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1128-16\">The government impeached Lipscomb\u2019s credibility at the first trial with an eight-year-old robbery conviction and would have impeached his credibility at the second trial if he had testified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The government also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>impeached Smith\u2019s credibility with a 1980 armed robbery conviction, Green\u2019s credibility with a 1976 conviction for accessory after the fact to manslaughter, and Little\u2019s credibility with a 1976 robbery conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The district court gave appropriate limiting instructions, and Lipscomb\u2019s attorney properly requested exclusion of the prior convictions, both before trial and in a post-trial motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-5\">B. <em>The District Court\u2019s Decision to Admit the Prior Convictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"AxQ\">1. <em>Lipscomb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">The district court admitted Lipscomb\u2019s eight-year-old robbery conviction into evidence under Rule 609(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 609(a) states-:</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-7\">GENERAL RULE. For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that he has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted ... but only if the crime (1) was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which he was convicted, and the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant, or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-8\">Rule 609(b) creates an exception to Rule 609(a) for a prior conviction which is remote in time:</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-9\">TIME LIMIT. Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless the court determines ... that the probative value of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-13\">In ruling that the probativeness of Lipscomb\u2019s conviction outweighed its prejudicial effect, the court knew only the name of the offense (robbery), the date of conviction (1973), and Lipscomb\u2019s age when the crime was committed (16).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court did not know the details of the crime, whether Lipscomb had pled guilty or not guilty, or the sentence imposed; it had inquired but the prosecutor stated that he had no more information.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court found that Lipscomb\u2019s prior robbery conviction was probative because anyone \u201cdesperate enough to rob somebody ... is desperate enough to lie on the witness stand,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and because \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s testimony will be so important to his defense.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court did not discuss the extent of prejudice, but did state for the record that \u201cthe probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs the prejudicial effect.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-14\">In making this ruling based on limited information, the district court recognized the tension in our cases between, on the one hand, <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>613 F.2d 1045, 1050-54 (D.C.Cir.1979) (Wald, J.), and, on the other hand, <em>United States v. Jackson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>627 F.2d 1198, 1208-10 (D.C.Cir.1980) (MacKinnon, J.), and <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>626 F.2d 940, 945-51 (D.C.Cir.1980) (MacKinnon, J.). <em>Crawford </em>suggested that inquiry into the facts and circumstances underlying a prior conviction was desirable and often necessary; <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Lewis </em>suggested that such inquiry was rarely necessary. The district court concluded that \u201c[tjhere are two panels on the Court of Appeals and each has a different theory of this, and the most recent panel ... supports the Government\u2019s position [that detailed inquiry is unnecessary] ... and I will let it in.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">2. <em>Smith, Green, and Little</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">The district court admitted Smith\u2019s armed robbery conviction because, as for Lipscomb\u2019s conviction, \u201cthe desperate person who would commit an armed robbery would also lie under oath.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The court did not expressly explain why Little\u2019s robbery conviction or Green\u2019s accessory after the fact to manslaughter conviction were probative of credibility. The court did, however, state its opinion as to both Little and Green that the \u201cprobative value of the convictions outweighs the prejudice to the Defendant.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">3. <em>The Motion for a New Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">The district court was unsure whether it had adequately supported its decision to admit the prior convictions, and therefore suggested that if Lipscomb were convicted, defense counsel ought to \u201cgive me an opportunity to review this further on a motion for new trial.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Counsel did so, and the government, at the court\u2019s insistence, had by that time produced supplemental background material on the prior convictions of Lipscomb, Smith, Green, and Little. The new information showed that Lipscomb: (1) in February 1973, with two others, had robbed a man on the street, threatening him with a B-B gun, and taking $13, his hat, and his coat; (2) in May 1973, pled guilty while maintaining his innocence pursuant to <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), and was sentenced to three years probation; (3) then spent four months in a halfway house, but was evicted for \u201cdisruptive behavior,\u201d including smuggling in a gun, and shortly thereafter was arrested for burglary; the burglary charges were dismissed on the government\u2019s motion, but Judge Penn revoked Lipscomb\u2019s probation and sentenced him to an indeterminate six-year sentence; (4) in 1976, failed to return from an unescorted furlough and was placed on escape status, but soon turned himself in; (5) while at a community care center in the District of Columbia, was arrested and convicted for several burglaries in Virginia and reincar-cerated; (6) was finally released when his robbery sentence expired in November 1979.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-13\">Smith had robbed a man at gunpoint and also stolen his car; he was convicted after pleading not guilty. Little and his younger brother had robbed a man at gunpoint, with Little stating \u201cI\u2019ve got a gun, punk, give me your money\u201d; he was convicted after pleading not guilty. Green had been part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1055\">*1055</page-number>of a group who had robbed an 18-year-old boy; another member of the group had stabbed and killed the boy and the group then fled to Green\u2019s home. The principal in the stabbing was convicted of first-degree murder. In pleading guilty to accessory after the fact to manslaughter, he \u201cexpressed no regret\u201d and explained his plea by stating \u201call of my witnesses stood up for the government.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">The district court concluded from all this that \u201cthere are even stronger reasons than I knew at the time for admitting the convictions,\u201d and denied the motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">4. <em>The Government\u2019s Reluctance to Provide Further Information on the Convictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">Under Rule 609(a)(1), the prosecution must show that the probative value of a prior conviction outweighs the prejudice to the defendant. If it cannot do so, the evidence is excluded. <em>See </em>120 Cong.Rec. 40,891 (1974) (statement of Rep. Hungate, House floor manager for the Rules of Evidence) (the Conference Committee placed \u201cthe burden on the proponent of such evidence to show that ... the probative value of the conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect\u201d); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>551 F.2d 348, 359-60 (D.C.Cir.1976).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A major sub-theme in this case is the prosecution\u2019s attempt to minimize its burden of persuasion by insisting that the district court should not look behind the name and date of a conviction to determine how much probative value it has.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">The government did not introduce any background information on the prior convictions at the first trial, stating that it had none. Moreover, during the three-week interval between the first and second trials, it made no effort to obtain any background information despite Judge Oberdorfer\u2019s request for it at the first trial. At the second trial, Judge Oberdorfer again asked for more information and the government resisted, claiming that the information was \u201cunnecessary\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-13\">THE COURT: Have you tried [to get the case jackets in the prior convictions]?</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-14\">MR. CORNELL: No, I have not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-15\">THE COURT: Well, see if you can.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-16\">MR. CORNELL: One of the reasons is we don\u2019t view it as necessary....</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-17\">THE COURT: ... [T]he Court of Appeals will probably have these, and I don\u2019t see any reason why I should have to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-18\">MR. CORNELL: The Court of Appeals will not have the jackets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-19\">THE COURT: Well, they will if [defense counsel] puts them into the record in support of his motion for new trial. See if you can get them; not necessarily today ....</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-20\">MR. CORNELL: I will endeavor to get them.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-21\">C. <em>Issues Presented</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-22\">Lipscomb, relying on <em>Crawford, </em>contends that without knowing the circumstances of a prior conviction, the district court cannot, in all but exceptional cases, determine if the conviction is probative of credibility at all or how probative it is. Therefore, the prosecution, which has the burden of establishing admissibility, must submit such evidence. Without it, admitting the conviction is an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Lipscomb also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1056\">*1056</page-number>argues that the district court should not have considered the post-trial evidence and that this evidence does not in any event justify admitting the convictions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">The government, relying on <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Lewis, </em>argues that under Rule 609(a)(1), all felony convictions less than ten years old are <em>per se </em>probative on the issue of credibility. It further contends that inquiry into the underlying facts would be burdensome, time-consuming, and generally unhelpful, and therefore should not be permitted.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Finally, the government argues that even if the district court must inquire into the underlying facts, the court did so after the trial and found ample basis for admitting the convictions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">This court heard oral argument and then <em>sua sponte </em>set the case for reargument en banc to reconcile the tension between <em>Crawford, Jackson, </em>and <em>Lewis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">Part II of this opinion concludes, based on the language and legislative history of Rule 609, that all felony convictions less than ten years old have at least some probative value on the issue of credibility. Part III concludes that the district court has discretion to determine when to inquire into background facts and when not to. We neither require the court generally to conduct such an inquiry nor discourage it from doing so. Finally, in part IV, we consider the facts of this case and find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">II. The Probativeness of Felony Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-8\">In deciding whether the district court must inquire into the facts and circumstances underlying a conviction, a threshold question is whether, under Rule 609(a)(1), all felony convictions less than 10 years old have some probative value on the issue of credibility. The question is one of congressional intent, and we therefore look to the language and legislative history of the Rule for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-13\">We preface our analysis by considering what difference the answer makes. If a prior conviction for some crimes may not be probative of credibility at all, then for those crimes, the district court must inquire into the background facts and circumstances to determine whether a particular conviction has probative value. If, on the other hand, all felony convictions less than ten years old have some probative value on the issue of credibility, then in cases where there is minimal prejudice to the defendant <em>(e.g., </em>impeachment of a witness who has no connection to the defendant), a prior conviction will almost always be admitted, and there is no need for a detailed inquiry into proba-tiveness. Where the prior felony conviction would be prejudicial to the defendant to some degree, however, a threshold conclusion that the conviction is also probative to some degree does not help the district court determine whether, in a particular case, probativeness outweighs prejudice. Nor does it resolve the question of when the court should inquire into the background facts to determine how much probative value a prior conviction has.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-14\">A. <em>Plain Meaning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-15\">Rule 609, on its face, strongly implies that a prior conviction is <em>per se </em>probative of credibility for certain kinds of crimes. The language of the Rule also weakly suggests that all felony convictions less than 10 years old have at least some probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>Under Rule 609(a)(2), a prior conviction \u201cshall be admitted\u201d without any balancing of probativeness against prejudice, and regardless of the punishment, if the crime involved \u201cdishonesty or false statement.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Drawing the line between crimes that involve \u201cdishonesty or false statement\u201d and crimes that do not is not easy, as numerous cases in this<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and other circuits<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> attest. It is implausible that Congress believed that crimes falling on one side of the line are so probative of credibility that they should be admitted regardless of prejudice but that crimes falling just on the other side of the line may in some cases not be probative at all. More likely, Congress anticipated that crimes of stealth (e.g-., smuggling, burglary), while not quite crimes of \u201cdishonesty or false statement,-\u201d do reflect lack of credibility and should be admitted unless significantly prejudicial. Indeed, this court, in construing Rule 609(a)(2), has implicitly recognized as much by distinguishing between crimes \u201cthat bear <em>directly </em>upon the accused\u2019s propensity to testify truthfully\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and offenses which, while they have \u201csome bearing on an individual\u2019s credibility,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> should not be automatically admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-9\">The harder question, on which our prior cases point in different directions, is whether Rule 609(a)(1) incorporates a congressional belief that <em>all </em>felony convictions less than 10 years old are somewhat probative of credibility, even crimes of impulse <em>(e.g., </em>assault, purse-snatching, perhaps shoplifting). In <em>Crawford, </em>the district court ruled that a prior shoplifting conviction was admissible based only on the name and date of the crime. We found this information insufficient; without a factual inquiry, \u201cthe district court simply could not determine how probative (if at all) Crawford\u2019s shoplifting conviction may have been on her propensity to tell the truth.\u201d 613 F.2d at 1052.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number><em>Jackson, </em>however, we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to admit a prior manslaughter conviction without suggesting that an inquiry into the background facts and circumstances of the crime was necessary. We recognized that manslaughter is \u201cnot particularly a veracity-related crime,\u201d but relied on the \u201ccongressional determination that such a crime, as a felony, may be admissible under Rule 609(a)(1).\u201d 627 F.2d at 1210.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Lewis, </em>626 F.2d at 949 n. 12, we found that the name and date of a prior narcotics conviction was sufficient basis for the district court\u2019s ruling that probativeness outweighed prejudice in a trial on a new narcotics charge.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">The language of Rule 609(a)(1) gives two small clues. Under the Rule, felony convictions less than 10 years old</p>\n<p id=\"Asm\"><em>shall be admitted </em>if [properly introduced] during cross-examination <em>but only if </em>the crime (1) was [a felony] and the court determines that <em>the probative value </em>of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant, or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-9\">(Emphasis added.) The phrasing \u201cshall be admitted ... but only if,\u201d plus the phrase <em>\u201cthe </em>probative value,\u201d suggests that all pri- or convictions meet a threshold relevance requirement, but must nevertheless be evaluated for their prejudicial effect to the defendant. This linguistic inference would accord with the pre-Rule 609 understanding that all felony convictions were somewhat probative of credibility.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It would also be consistent with Congress\u2019 understanding that \u201cthe prior felony conviction of a prosecution witness may always be used [because] [t]here can be no prejudicial effect to the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>The inference is hardly compelling, however. Had Congress used the phrasing \u201cshall be admitted ... only if,\u201d one could not infer that all prior convictions are relevant. The use of \u201cbut\u201d in \u201cshall be admitted ... but only if\u201d does not, as a matter of strict logic, alter the meaning of the phrase, but does create a slight pause after \u201cshall be admitted.\u201d One must assume that this pause has substantive content for any inference of admissibility to arise. Similarly, one must read the phrase \u201cthe probative value\u201d as implying conscious rejection of the alternate phrasing \u201cthe probative value, if any.\u201d For further guidance, we turn to the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-4\">B. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1135-5\">The legislative history of Rule 609, although not conclusive, supports the view that all felony convictions are probative of credibility to some degree.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> It begins with <em>Luck v. United States, </em>348 F.2d 763, 768 (D.C.Cir.1965), where we interpreted a D.C. Code provision that prior convictions <em>\u201cmay </em>be given in evidence\u201d (emphasis added) to permit the trial judge to exclude a prior conviction where \u201cthe prejudicial effect of impeachment far outweighs the probative relevance of the prior conviction to the issue of credibility.\u201d This approach became the dominant one under federal common law as well.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In 1970, however, Congress expressly rejected <em>Luck </em>for the District of Columbia, amending the D.C.

The subcommittee\u2019s version roughly paralleled the Advisory Committee\u2019s earlier draft:</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">[A prior conviction] is admissible only if the crime (1) was [a felony] unless the court determines that the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value of the evidence of the conviction, or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">H.R.Rep.

This version was in turn rejected by the House Judiciary Committee, which decided to permit impeachment \u201conly if the prior crime involved dishonesty or false statement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">The House adopted the Judiciary Committee version. The House debate does not suggest a consensus on whether all felonies have some probative value. Supporters of automatic admissibility argued, of course, that all felonies were probative of credibility because, <em>e.g., </em>\u201c \u2018they entail substantial injury to and disregard of the rights of other persons.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> And Representative Smith, the chairman of the House subcommittee and the principal spokesman for the subcommittee version giving discretion to the trial judge, explained that the subcommittee had \u201cno doubt that there is probative value in the evidence of previous felonies,\u201d but was concerned about prejudice to the defendant if all prior felonies were admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> However, Representative Dennis, the principal proponent of limiting impeachment to crimes of dishonesty or false statement, argued that many other felonies had \u201cno connection to [the witness\u2019] credibility at all.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1136-8\">The Senate Judiciary Committee agreed with the House that the defendant himself should be impeached only by a prior conviction for a crime of dishonesty or false statement. However, it amended Rule 609(a) to permit impeachment of other witnesses by any felony if \u201cthe probative value of such evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect against the party offering that witness.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1277, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 14 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 7051, 7061 (\u201cS.Rep.\u201d). The Committee also changed the House phrase \u201cis admissible\u201d to \u201cmay be elicited,\u201d although this change was not explained in the committee report. Thus, the Senate Judiciary Committee version read:</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-9\">[A prior conviction] may be elicited from [a witness] ... but only if the crime (1) involved dishonesty or false statement or (2) in the case of witnesses other than the accused, was [a felony], but only if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-10\">H.R. 5463 (Senate Judiciary Committee version), \u00a7 609(a) (1974). On the Senate floor, this provision was again debated, and rejected by a narrow margin in favor of the automatic admission rule of the D.C.Code:</p>\n<p id=\"AoR\">[A prior conviction] shall be admitted if elicited from [a witness] . .. but only if the crime (1) was [a felony] or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">120 Cong.Rec. 37,076 (1974) (statement of Sen.

Hart) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">The Conference Committee report suggests that the Committee accepted the Senate understanding that all prior felonies are probative of credibility to some degree. First, the Committee took the Senate version as its starting point; it \u201cadopt[ed] the Senate amendment with an amendment.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1597, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1974) <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 7098, 7102 (\u201cConf.Rep.\u201d). Second, the Committee explained its rule not as permitting the trial judge to exclude prior felony convictions because they may not be probative, but rather as removing judicial discretion over prior convictions involving dishonesty or false statement because \u201c[s]uch convictions are <em>peculiarly </em>probative of credibility.\u201d <em>Id., </em>1974 U.S.Code Cong. -&amp; Ad.News at 7103 (emphasis added). Third, the Committee determined that only \u201cthe prejudicial effect <em>to the defendant </em>\u201d was to be weighed against probative value. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). For other witnesses \u201cthe danger of prejudice ... [was] outweighed by the need for the trier of fact to have <em>as much relevant evidence on the issue of credibility as possible.\" Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the Committee must have assumed that prior felony convictions are indeed relevant evidence.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-10\">This history is not wholly satisfying. Congress never focused on the narrow question whether all felonies have at least some probative value on' the issue of credibility. Also, the Conference Committee, with a variety of earlier drafts to choose from, chose the ambiguous final text (prior convictions \u201cshall be admitted ... but only if ... the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect\u201d) over the clearer language of the House subcommittee and Advisory Committee drafts (a prior conviction \u201cis admissible ... unless ... the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value\u201d) and the clearer negative language of Rule 609(b) (a conviction over 10 years old is \u201cnot admissible ... unless ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>Moreover \u2014 and an important caveat \u2014 we have deliberately used the phrases \u201csomewhat probative\u201d or \u201cprobative to some degree\u201d for no stronger statement could be made. Congress recognized, and it is obvious, that some prior convictions have little relationship to credibility while others are highly probative. For example, Rule 609(b) reflects Congress\u2019 belief that \u201cconvictions over ten years old generally do not have much probative value.\u201d S.Rep. at 15, 1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 7061.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This implies that many 9-year-old convictions are only slightly probative; probativeness does not suddenly vanish when the 10-year mark is reached. Similarly, the line between felonies and misdemeanors (which are admissible only if they involve dishonesty or false statement) will not always be sharp. A felony conviction could conceivably be based on conduct which would be a misdemeanor in another jurisdiction. Presumably, such a conviction would be only slightly probative of credibility.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-4\">Nevertheless, on the available evidence, and subject to the caveat in the last paragraph, we must conclude that Congress believed that all felonies have some probative value on the issue of credibility. <em>Accord NLRB v. Jacob E. Decker &amp; Sons, </em>569 F.2d 357, 363 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201cWhen Congress adopted [Rule 609(a)] it determined that felonies ... did bear on the credibility of witnesses.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-5\">III. Inquiry into Background Facts and Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">Part II established that all felony convictions are probative of credibility to some degree. However, evidence that a witness is a convicted criminal can also seriously prejudice the defense, especially when the witness is the defendant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-10\">The jury is told to consider the defendant\u2019s prior conviction only on the issue of credibility and not on the overall issue of guilt. But limiting instructions of this type require the jury to perform \u201ca mental gymnastic which is beyond, not only their powers, but anybody\u2019s else.\u201d <em>Nash v. United States, </em>54 F.2d 1006, 1007 (2d Cir.) (L. Hand, J.), <em>cert. denied, </em>285 U.S. 556, 52 S.Ct. 457, 76 L.Ed. 945 (1932). In the words of Justice Jackson: \u201cThe naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury, all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction.\u201d <em>Krulewitch v. United States, </em>336 U.S. 440, 453, 69 S.Ct. 716, 723, 93 L.Ed. 790 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring) (citations omitted). The transcript in this case ironically confirms these observations. It includes the following interchange between the trial judge and the prosecutor:</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">THE COURT: Say again why [Lipscomb\u2019s prior robbery conviction] is probative of his guilt in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-12\">MR. CORNELL: It is not probative. If it was probative of his guilt\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-13\">THE COURT: Probative of his credibility. Why is it probative of his credibility? <footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-14\">When the defendant is impeached by a prior conviction, the question of prejudice, as Congress well knew, is not <em>if, </em>but how much.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Congress in Rule 609(a)(1) there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>fore instructed the courts to admit evidence of a prior felony conviction \u201conly if ... the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">In this part, we consider how much information the trial judge needs to perform this balance. To meet its burden of justifying admission of the conviction, the government at a minimum must furnish the district court with the name of the crime (to show that it is a felony) and the date of the conviction (to show that the conviction is less than 10 years old). At issue here is when the district court can or must seek additional information, and how much. Lipscomb argues that the district court must usually inquire into the underlying facts and circumstances, while the government argues that the district court should not be permitted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">We note preliminarily that the district court must carefully and thoughtfully consider the information before it to determine if probativeness outweighs prejudice to the defendant. This balancing must not become a ritual leading inexorably to admitting the prior conviction into evidence. Rather, the final version of Rule 609(a)(1) must be understood as a compromise between the House preference for excluding all prior convictions unless the crime involved \u201cdishonesty or false statement\u201d and the Senate preference for admitting all prior felony convictions. In particular, there can be no legal presumption of admissibility. To the contrary, as noted earlier, the burden is on the government to show that the probative value of a conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant. <em>Accord United States v. Fountain, </em>642 F.2d 1083, 1092 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 993, 101 S.Ct. 2335, 68 L.Ed.2d 854 (1981); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>608 F.2d 1175, 1187 (9th Cir.1979) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1034, 100 S.Ct. 706, 62 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1139-10\">There is less risk of prejudice when a defense witness other than the defendant is impeached through a prior conviction because the jury cannot directly infer the defendant\u2019s guilt from someone else\u2019s criminal record.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The jury may, however, still presume guilt or lack of credibility of the defendant by association or may unduly discount the defense witness\u2019 testimony. And Rule 609(a)(1) still requires the trial judge to balance probativeness against prejudice to the defendant before admitting the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>A. <em>Plain Meaning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-4\">A comparison of Rule 609(a)(1) with Rule 609(b) strongly suggests that Rule 609(a)(1) does not require the district court always to inquire into the facts and circumstances underlying a prior felony conviction. Under Rule 609(b), a felony conviction more than 10 years old can be admitted only if \u201cthe probative value of the conviction <em>supported by specific facts and circumstances </em>substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Rule 609(a)(1), in contrast, does not require that the probative value of the conviction be supported by specific facts and circumstances. We must presume that the omission was intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">On the other hand, Rule 609(a)(1) is broadly phrased to require balancing of pro-bativeness against prejudice, with no specific instructions as to how the balance is to be performed. The language of the Rule gives no hint that Congress intended to preclude the district court from considering all relevant evidence. And Rule 609(b) shows Congress\u2019 belief that the \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d of the prior crime are relevant to the balancing inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">In addition, Rule 609(b) controls admission of convictions for which more than 10 years have elapsed \u201csince the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from the confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date.\u201d To determine if the defendant was released from confinement less than 10 years ago even though the conviction occurred more than 10 years ago, the trial judge must inquire into some of the background facts; in particular, the sentence imposed and the release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-9\">Moreover, Rule 609(a)(2) creates a <em>per se </em>rule that probativeness outweighs prejudice for crimes \u201cinvolving] dishonesty or false statement.\u201d Often, however, the trial judge will not be able to determine from the name of a crime whether the defendant\u2019s conduct involved dishonesty or false statement. All circuits that have considered the question, including our own, have held that the prosecution may adduce specific facts to bring a prior conviction within Rule 609(a)(2). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>551 F.2d 348, 364 n. 28 (D.C.Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> It seems equally appropriate to permit the district court to elicit such facts in balancing probativeness against prejudice under Rule 609(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-10\">We conclude from the language of Rule 609, then, that the district court can inquire into the background facts and circumstances, but need not always do so. Because the Rule does not indicate when the district court should seek this additional information, we further conclude that the district court has discretion to decide when it should do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-11\">B. <em>Legislative History</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOb\">1. <em>Rule 609(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1140-12\">Congress did not focus its attention on when the trial judge should inquire into the background facts and circumstances of a prior conviction. But the legislative history of Rule 609(a) suggests that Congress probably intended neither to require the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>judge to routinely inquire into the background facts and circumstances nor to preclude the judge from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">Our review of that history begins, once again, with <em>Luck v. United States, </em>348 F.2d 763 (D.C.Cir.1965). In <em>Luck, </em>we listed, as factors that \u201cmight be relevant\u201d to the district court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude a prior conviction:</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">the nature of the prior crimes, the length of the criminal record, the age and circumstances of the defendant, and, above all, the extent to which it is more important to the search for truth in a particular case for the jury to hear the defendant\u2019s story than to know of a prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 769 (footnote omitted). But we also emphasized the \u201cinescapable remoteness of appellate review\u201d and the need for the trial judge to exercise discretion \u201cin the light of the record as it develops before him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">In <em>Gordon v. United States, </em>383 F.2d 936 (D.C.Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 1029, 88 S.Ct. 1421, 20 L.Ed.2d 287 (1968), we again considered the relevant factors, this time listing whether the prior conviction \u201crest[s] on dishonest conduct,\u201d its \u201cnearness or remoteness\u201d in time, subsequent \u201clegally blameless life,\u201d and whether the prior conviction .was \u201cfor the same or substantially the same conduct for which the accused is on trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. But we recognized that \u201cmany other factors .. . may be relevant ... in a particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Luck, </em>348 F.2d at 769). Thus, our early decisions suggest that we thought it unwise to limit artificially the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">The Advisory Committee on the Rules of Evidence, in an early draft, codified the <em>Luck-Gordon </em>rule<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> and reaffirmed the broad discretion granted to the district court. The Committee\u2019s explanation for the Rule quotes our discussion in <em>Luck </em>of the relevant factors and then continues:</p>\n<p id=\"ao7-dedup-0\">The application of <em>Luck </em>has been refined and clarified in numerous subsequent decisions of the court which rendered it, notably in <em>[Gordon],... </em>Judge, now Chief Justice, Burger suggested in Gordon' various factors to be considered ...: [list of <em>Gordon </em>factors]. It will be noted that [Rule 609(b) ] imposes a specific time limit and that [Rule 609(c)] deals with aspects of rehabilitation; these provisions should be construed only as imposing outer limits upon the judge\u2019s determination <em>and not as restricting his decision within them.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-12\">Proposed Fed.R.Evid. 609(a) advisory committee note, 51 F.R.D. 315, 393 (rev. draft 1971) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-13\">As noted earlier, this discretionary approach was adopted in modified form by the House subcommittee that considered the \u25a0Rules of Evidence, rejected by the House Judiciary Committee in favor of excluding all prior felonies, and rejected again after debate on the House floor. The Senate Judiciary Committee excluded all prior felony convictions for the defendant, but gave the trial judge discretion to balance proba-tiveness against prejudice for other witnesses. The full Senate, however, made all felonies automatically admissible. Finally, the Conference Committee crafted the current compromise.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-14\">Nothing in this lengthy history supports either Lipscomb\u2019s contention that the district court must usually inquire into the facts and circumstances underlying a prior conviction or the government\u2019s contention that the district court cannot so inquire. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>Thus, Representative Hungate, the House floor manager for the Rules of Evidence, explained the discretionary approach in simple terms: \u201cWe give discretion to the judge....\u201d 120 Cong.Rec. 2378 (1974). Similarly, Senator Burdick endorsed \u201cthe \u2018Luck Rule\u2019 \u201d under which admissibility was left \u201cto the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37,079.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">Some remarks do suggest, however, Congress\u2019 implicit understanding that the court can inquire into the background facts and circumstances if it wants to. Thus, Representative Brasco thought that the defendant should be able to show that a prosecution witness \u201cmade a sweetheart deal with the prosecution\u201d in return for testifying. 120 Cong.Rec. 2378 (1974). Representative Smith, the principal House proponent of the discretionary approach, replied that this was \u201can exact case under which the compromise I offer would apply,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2379, thus implicitly assuming that evidence of a witness\u2019 plea bargain is properly part of the balancing analysis. Similarly, Senator Biden believed that one underlying fact, whether the defendant had pled guilty, was relevant; a guilty plea \u201cin a way is almost speaking for their credibility, having acknowledged they did it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37,082. Also, an important part of the Conference Committee compromise was placing the burden on the government to show that the probativeness of a prior conviction outweighs prejudice to the defendant. It is implausible that the Committee would at the same time severely restrict the district court\u2019s ability to enforce that burden by precluding the court from asking the government for information beyond the name and date of the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">2. <em>Rule 609(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">The legislative history also refutes any implication that because Rule 609(b) refers to \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d and Rule 609(a)(1) does not, judges should not look at specific facts and circumstances under Rule 609(a)(1). Rule 609(b), as proposed by the Advisory Committee and adopted with minor changes by the House, made convictions more than 10 years old automatically inadmissible.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The Senate Judiciary Committee, however, added the \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d language to permit the trial judge to admit a dated conviction in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d S.Rep. at 15, 1974 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 7061-62. Thus, the discretionary approach of Rule 609(a)(1) was already well-developed before \u201cspecific facts and circumstances\u201d entered Rule 609(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">Moreover, the Senate did not debate Rule 609(b). Thus, nothing suggests that the full Senate, by accepting this change in the Rule, meant to alter the understanding that the trial judge could inquire into all relevant facts under Rule 609(a)(1). Indeed, the opposite inference seems more plausible: The Senate assumed that the trial judge could look at specific facts and circumstances in all cases, and chose to require the judge to do so in one class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-11\">C. <em>Policy Considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-12\">The government argues that even if the district court <em>can </em>look into the facts and circumstances underlying a prior conviction, we should discourage the court from doing so because the inquiry would be burdensome and time consuming and \u201cis likely to yield nothing more than the fact, for example, that a larceny was a typical larceny.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> A sufficient response is that Congress did not discourage such inquiry. But we are also unconvinced as a policy matter that we ought to discourage the district court from inquiring into the underlying facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-13\">First, the facts of this case contradict the government\u2019s assertion that the additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>information will generally be of little help to the district court in assessing probative value. Smith\u2019s and Little\u2019s robberies seem fairly typical robberies. However, the extra information requested by the trial court and belatedly furnished by the government shows that both pled not guilty and were convicted after trial.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The record does not indicate whether either Smith or Little testified in his own defense, but if the government had shown that to be so, \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict ... is in a sense a <em>de facto </em>finding that the accused did not tell the truth when sworn to do so.\u201d <em>Gordon, </em>383 F.2d at 940 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">Moreover, the extra information on Lipscomb \u2014 in particular, his more recent burglary conviction \u2014 shows that he has not been rehabilitated since his robbery conviction, and therefore enhances the probativeness of the robbery conviction. And Green, although convicted only for accessory after the fact to manslaughter, had in fact been part of a group, another member of which had robbed and stabbed an 18-year-old boy; the group members then fled to Green\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">The reported cases supply numerous other examples of the relevance of background information. In some cases, the specific facts will make a conviction automatically admissible under Rule 609(a)(2).<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> In others, one specific fact \u2014 the date of release from confinement \u2014 will determine whether the district court rules on admissibility under Rule 609(a)(1) or under the much stricter standards of Rule 609(b).<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> In yet others, specific facts will simply prove relevant to the Rule 609(a)(1) balancing. The cases suggest the broad range of potentially relevant information. <em>See, e.g., Jackson, </em>627 F.2d at 1210 n. 28 (manslaughter conviction; defendant had shot his wife and \u201cthe man who was with his wife at the time\u201d); <em>United States v. Rosales, </em>680 F.2d 1304, 1307 (10th Cir.1981) (defense witnesses were serving substantial prison terms, hence would have \u201csome motivation to testify falsely in a dispute with prison guards\u201d); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>647 F.2d 696, 700 (6th Cir.) (prior crime was committed when defendant was only 20 years old), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 898,102 S.Ct. 399, 70 L.Ed.2d 214 (1981); <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>553 F.2d 824, 828 (2d Cir.) (defendant had been convicted after testifying in own defense), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 867, 98 S.Ct. 204, 54 L.Ed.2d 143 (1977).<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-11\">Nor do we consider the burden on the government or possible delay of the trial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>be serious problems. First, the district court is fully capable of taking possible burden or delay into account in deciding how much information it needs.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Second, in many cases, the district court may be satisfied with readily available information \u2014 perhaps the witness\u2019 case jacket or presentence report, if available. Such information was sufficient to satisfy the district court in this case. The burden on the government to obtain this information is slight, and may well be outweighed by the possibility that \u2014 as for Lipscomb and Green \u2014 the extra information will strengthen the government\u2019s argument for admitting the convictions. Also, there need be no delay at all if the government makes a regular practice of obtaining this basic information before trial. We join the district court in urging the government to do so. <em>See </em>Tr. II, <em>supra </em>note 2, at 283-84 (\u201cas a matter of practice in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office ..., you would be better served if you would come in with more detail about ... the previous conviction ... [e.g.], a copy of the indictment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Third, extra information is most likely to be important for the defendant because prejudice is far greater when the defendant himself is impeached. But we find it hard to imagine a conscientious prosecutor not making a reasonable effort to obtain at least some details of the defendant\u2019s past convictions before deciding whether to seek an indictment, which charges to bring, or what sort of a plea bargain to offer.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Finally, we are unwilling to tell the trial judge to decide without adequate information the important question of whether to admit a prior conviction, simply because the government finds it a nuisance to gather the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-10\">D. <em>Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-11\">In sum, we hold, based on the language of Rule 609, the legislative history, and sound policy, that the district court has discretion to determine when to inquire into the facts and circumstances underlying a prior conviction and how extensive an inquiry to conduct. We decline at this time to establish general guidelines for determining when inquiry beyond the name and date of a conviction is necessary, although our discussion below of the specific convictions at issue in this case may shed some light on the matter. We will review the district court\u2019s decision as part of our overall deferential review of whether a decision to admit or exclude evidence is an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-12\">IV. Admissibility of the Prior Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-13\">The remaining question is whether the district court abused its discretion by admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>ting into evidence the prior convictions of Lipscomb, Smith, Green, and Little. We conclude that all of the convictions were properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">A. <em>Lipscomb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">1. <em>Reviewability when Defendant Does Not Testify</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">As an initial matter, we must determine whether Lipscomb has properly preserved his objection to the district court\u2019s ruling. Lipscomb did not formally establish on the record that he would have testified at the second trial if- the court had excluded his prior robbery conviction. The government therefore argues that Lipscomb waived any objection to use of the conviction to impeach his testimony.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">We have previously assumed without explicitly stating that a defendant does not need to state that he would testify if his prior conviction were excluded in order to appeal a ruling that the conviction is admissible. <em>Jackson, </em>627 F.2d at 1210; <em>United States v. Fearwell, </em>595 F.2d 771, 779 (D.C. Cir.1978); <em>Smith, </em>551 F.2d at 356. Most other circuits agree. <em>See, e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Kiendra, </em>663 F.2d 349, 352 (1st Cir.1981) (explicit); <em>United States v. Fountain, </em>642 F.2d 1083, 1087 &amp; n. 3 (7th Cir.) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 993, 101 S.Ct. 2335, 68 L.Ed.2d 854 (1981).<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The government, however, urges us to follow <em>United States v. Cook, </em>608 F.2d 1175, 1186 (9th Cir.1979) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1034, 100 S.Ct. 706, 62 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980), which holds that a defendant must \u201cestablish on the record that he will in fact take the stand and testify if his challenged prior convictions are excluded.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> We find persuasive the reasoning in <em>Kiendra </em>and <em>Fountain </em>and hold that when a defendant requests an advance ruling on the admissibility of a prior conviction, and later decides not to testify, the ruling is reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-13\">First, when a defendant seeks an advance ruling on admission of a prior conviction, it is reasonable to presume that the ruling will be an important factor in his decision whether to testify. <em>See Kiendra, </em>663 F.2d at 352.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Second, advance rulings on admissibility are preferable because \u201c[cjounsel need to know what the ruling will be on this important matter so that they can make appropriate tactical decisions.\u201d 3 J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger, <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>1f 609[05], at 609-82 (1981), <em>quoted in Jackson, </em>627 F.2d at 1209. To limit review of advance rulings would undercut the value of such rulings. <em>See Kiendra, </em>663 F.2d at 352-53. Third, and most important, the <em>Cook </em>rule will probably serve merely as a trap for unwary defendants or defense counsel. Under the <em>Cook </em>approach, a knowledgeable defendant has a strong incentive to state before trial his intent to testify if the prior conviction is excluded. The defendant incurs no risk by doing so, because even if the court excludes the conviction, he can later decide not to testify without penalty. <em>See Fountain, </em>642 F.2d at 1087 n. 3 (requiring defendants to disclose their in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>tent to testify \u201cmay amount to nothing more than a <em>pro forma </em>requirement which can only penalize ... unsophisticated defendants\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">2. <em>Admissibility of </em>Alford <em>Plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">Lipscomb argues that he was never \u201cconvicted\u201d of robbery within the meaning of Rule 609 because he pled nolo contendere while maintaining his innocence pursuant to <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970).<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">First, Lipscomb did not plead nolo; rather, like the defendant in <em>Alford, </em>he pled <em>guilty </em>while maintaining his innocence. Moreover, even if an <em>Alford </em>plea is somehow analogous to a nolo plea, the legislative history makes it clear that a nolo plea results in a \u201cconviction.\u201d An early Advisory Committee draft of Rule 609 permitted the district court to admit \u201cevidence that [a witness] has been convicted of a crime, except on a plea of <em>nolo </em>contendere.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The exception for nolo pleas was deleted from the Advisory Committee\u2019s final draft and did not reappear. We must presume that Congress knew about and approved the deletion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">Second, we concluded in part III that the district court has discretion whether or not to inquire into background facts and circumstances such as the exact nature of a plea. It is implausible that Congress intended to make determinative a fact that the court may never learn about. Third, we see no policy reason why the government can impeach a defendant who does not admit guilt, goes to trial, and is convicted, but cannot impeach a defendant who does not admit guilt but concedes that he will be convicted if he goes to trial and therefore makes an <em>Alford </em>plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-13\">We hold therefore that an <em>Alford </em>plea, like a nolo plea, does not preclude subsequent use of a conviction under Rule 609. <em>Accord United States v. Williams, </em>642 F.2d 136 (5th Cir.1981) (nolo plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-14\">3. <em>The Pre-Trial Balancing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-15\">The district court explicitly ruled that the probativeness of Lipscomb\u2019s prior robbery conviction outweighed the prejudice to him. It also partially complied with our request in <em>Smith, </em>551 F.2d at 357 n. 17, and <em>Crawford, </em>613 F.2d at 1050, for \u201csome indication of the reasons for the finding,\u201d explaining that credibility was important to Lipscomb\u2019s defense and that someone \u201cdesperate enough to rob someone\u201d is also \u201cdesperate enough to lie on the witness stand.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-16\">A fuller explanation of the district court\u2019s reasoning, including some discussion of prejudicial effect, would have been desirable. Nevertheless, we hold that its decision to admit Lipscomb\u2019s prior conviction was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Jackson, </em>627 F.2d at 1208-09 (\u201cexplicit finding of admissibility ... [is .not] an absolute requirement the nonperformance of which mandates reversal\u201d).<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Robbery is general<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>ly less probative than crimes that involve deception or stealth. But it does involve theft and is a serious crime that shows conscious disregard for the rights of others. Such conduct reflects more strongly on credibility than, say, crimes of impulse, or simple narcotics or weapons possession.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The age of the conviction (eight years ago) and Lipscomb\u2019s age when it was committed (16) reduce the probativeness of the conviction. On the other hand, credibility was central to the trial, and prejudice was not especially great because the previous crime was not similar to the present one. <em>Cf. Gordon, </em>383 F.2d at 940 (\u201cconvictions which are for the same crime should be admitted sparingly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">4. <em>Post-Trial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">Any possible doubt on the propriety of admitting Lipscomb\u2019s prior robbery conviction is eliminated by the underlying facts that were submitted to the district court after the close of trial. This additional information shows that Lipscomb, although convicted eight years ago, had been released from prison only a year-and-a-half ago, and was a repeat offender with a more recent burglary conviction which the government had not proffered to impeach his credibility.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> This subsequent conviction enhances the probativeness of Lipscomb\u2019s earlier robbery conviction because it shows that the robbery was not merely an isolated criminal episode from which Lipscomb has since been rehabilitated. <em>Cf. Gordon, </em>383 F.2d at 940 (subsequent \u201clegally blameless life\u201d affects probativeness of prior conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-10\">Lipscomb objects to use of this additional evidence because (1) late submission of evidence should be discouraged and (2) defense counsel could have used the evidence to rehabilitate him.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The first point is well-taken, and in the future, we expect the government to respond promptly to the district court\u2019s request for background facts and circumstances. In this case, however, we are unwilling to punish the government for its good faith belief that it did not have to submit such information. Moreover, even if the district court had misapplied Rule 609(a)(1) at trial, we would not immediately order a new trial but would instead remand to the district court to reconsider whether the prior conviction should have been admitted. <em>See, e.g., Crawford, </em>613 F.2d at 1053; <em>Smith, </em>551 F.2d at 366 (both following this approach). The district court would then almost certainly reaffirm its ruling, based on all the evidence, that the convictions were properly admitted. We decline to engage in such a pointless remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-11\">The second point is specious. Defense counsel could have readily obtained the information himself by asking his client a few questions. Moreover, Lipscomb does not explain, and we cannot see, how defense counsel could have used information on Lip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>scomb\u2019s extensive criminal record to rehabilitate him.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">B. <em>Little</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">We also find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to permit Little to be impeached by a five-year-old armed robbery conviction. Little\u2019s conviction, like Lipscomb\u2019s robbery conviction, involves theft and indicates a conscious disregard for the rights of others. In addition, Little was an eyewitness to the arrest; thus, his credibility was important. Moreover, there was presumably less prejudice to Lipscomb from admission of Little\u2019s conviction than from the admission of Lipscomb\u2019s own conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">C. <em>Smith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">Smith\u2019s one-year-old conviction for armed robbery was also properly admitted into evidence. As to probativeness, the conviction was recent, involved theft, and was for a serious crime. Also, Smith\u2019s credibility was important because he corroborated Lipscomb\u2019s story that Smith had borrowed Lipscomb\u2019s car earlier in the week and that on the day of the arrest, Lipscomb had driven Smith to Smith\u2019s mother\u2019s house, dropped off his girlfriend at her house, and was returning to pick up Smith to take him home when he was arrested. Moreover, prejudice to Lipscomb due to possible guilt by association does not seem especially severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">D. <em>Green</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-9\">For Green, as for Smith and Little, credibility was important (Green was an eyewitness to the arrest) and prejudice to the defendant was relatively low. Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s decision to admit Green\u2019s five-year-old conviction for accessory after the fact to manslaughter is troubling for two reasons. First, one cannot determine much about the degree of proba-tiveness of a conviction for accessory after the fact to manslaughter from the name of the crime. Such a conviction could mean merely that an otherwise law-abiding person had sheltered a close friend or family member and failed to seek out the police to inform them that the person had been involved in a hit-and-run accident or a fight in a bar. Such conduct might not indicate any propensity to lie on the witness stand; On the other hand, the accessory after the fact conviction could be based on actively lying to the police to misdirect an investigation \u2014 conduct that is closely related to credibility. Second, the record contains only the court\u2019s bare conclusion that probativeness outweighed prejudice to the defendant, with no indication of its reasons.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-15\">It would be a close question whether the district court abused its discretion by admitting Green\u2019s prior conviction without explaining its reasons and without any inquiry into the background facts and circumstances. <em>Compare United States v. Oakes, </em>565 F.2d 170, 173 (1st Cir.1977) (no abuse of discretion to admit prior manslaughter conviction where \u201ccredibility was crucial to the case\u201d) <em>with United States v. Gross, </em>603 F.2d 757, 758 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam) (abuse of discretion to admit prior narcotics convictions without explanation; government had also \u201coffered no theory\u201d why the probative value of the convictions outweighed their prejudicial effect). Fortunately, we do not need to resolve that question here. If we concluded that the district court erred, we would normally remand to the court to reconsider, in light of all the evidence, whether the conviction was properly admitted. Here, the district court has already made that determination in ruling on Lipscomb\u2019s motion for a new trial. The additional post-trial evidence shows that Green had been part of a group, another member of which had robbed and stabbed an 18-year-old boy; the group members then fled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>Green\u2019s home.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Given this evidence of Green\u2019s participation in the crime, the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\">We are mindful that the prejudicial effect of impeachment of several defense witnesses by prior convictions may be enhanced because the jury may presume guilt by association from the fact that the defendant associates frequently with convicted felons. However, even considering the cumulative effect of the impeachment of Lipscomb, Little, Smith, and Green, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">Rule 609(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Evidence embodies a congressional belief that all felony convictions less than 10 years old have at least some probative value on the issue of credibility. The trial court has discretion to determine, based on the circumstances of each case, whether the probative value of admitting a prior conviction outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant, and also has discretion to determine how much information it needs to perform this balancing. In this case, we find that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the prior convictions of the defendant and of three defense witnesses. The conviction is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1127-12\">.

(Op. at 1056-1059). However, by resorting to the plain meaning of the words the problem of interpretation becomes considerably less difficult. The court\u2019s difficulty in interpretation stems from an apparent reluctance to accept fully the fact that the Rule recognizes the relevance of convictions for <em>all </em>capital crimes and felonies on the issue of the credibility of witnesses. In the last analysis, Part V of the court\u2019s opinion reaches this recognition but the reasoning and rationale expressed throughout the opinion may lead to considerable difficulty for the court and counsel in performing the required balancing. While the opinion for the court recognizes that major crimes have \u201csome\u201d probative value on the issue of credibility, the body of the opinion contains a number of statements that tend to play-down the probative value of capital crimes and felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-14\">The Rule plainly provides that all felonies and misdemeanors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> involving dishonesty and false statement are automatically admitted without balancing. Example: The felony of perjury, false statement to 'the government, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, <em>et seq., </em>need not be balanced. In my view, other convictions for timely capital offenses and felonies are <em>all </em>made admissible if the probative effect of the defect in character of the witness, as represented by the elements of the crime for which he was convicted, outweighs the prejudicial effect to the defendant. In this connection, the Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes to the Rules of Evidence, as submitted by the Supreme Court to the Congress on Rule 609, recognize that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-15\">The weight of traditional authority has been to allow use of <em>felonies generally without regard to the nature of the particular offense </em>and of crimen falsi without regard to the grade of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"AxA\">House Document No. 93-46, 93d Congress, 1st Session, February 5, 1973 (emphasis added). This was the approved view of its Rule as submitted to Congress by the Supreme Court. And the rule that <em>finally </em>emerged from Congress is substantially the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>rule as presented by the Supreme Court, with only balancing added. See discussion, <em>infra. </em>So I would interpret the Rule to \u201callow [the balancing] of <em>felonies generally . ...\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">Because of the plain language of the Rule and the Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes, I am forced to disagree with the statement in the court\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe language of the Rule also <em>weakly suggests </em>that all felony convictions less than ten years old have at least some probative value.\u201d (Op. at 1056) (emphasis added). My disagreement is with the characterization of the Rule as a <em>weak suggestion. </em>Rule 609 plainly states that \u201cevidence that he has been convicted of a crime <em>shall be admitted ... </em>but only if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which he was convicted, and the court determines that the probative value of admitting the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant ... . \u201d This is a plain direct statement by Congress that all capital crimes and felonies <em>\u201cshall be admitted\u201d </em>if the balancing test is met. I see no weakness in that expression of congressional intent \u2014 rather, the statement in the court\u2019s opinion is an unsupported attempt to weaken the express direction of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">After years of consideration by the Advisory Committee, the Chief Justice of the United States, by direction of the Supreme Court, transmitted to the Congress the Rules of Evidence of the United States Courts and Magistrates which had been adopted by the Supreme Court pursuant to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-11\">Despite the lengthy legislative history that is recounted in the court\u2019s opinion, the end result in Congress was that the language of Rule 609(a), with which we are here primarily concerned, was <em>not </em>materially altered from that presented by the Supreme Court. To illustrate this, the Rule as presented, and as finally adopted, is set forth below. The only <em>two words </em>that were deleted from the Supreme Court draft are enclosed in brackets [], and new matter added by Congress is set forth in italics.</p>\n<p id=\"aoi-dedup-0\">Rule 609. Impeachment by Evidence of Conviction of Crime</p>\n<p id=\"A-Y\">(a) General rule. \u2014 For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that he has been convicted of a crime [is admissible] <em>shall be admitted </em>if elicited from him or established by public record during cross-examination but only if the crime (1) was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which he was convicted, <em>and the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the defendant, </em>or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">Before Congress amended Rule 609(a) the balancing provided in Rule 403<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> could always be invoked by a defendant\u2019s objection to the introduction of a conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As transmitted by the Chief Justice Rule 609 provided that prior convictions were \u201cadmissible,\u201d whereas amended Rule 609(a) states such evidence <em>\u201cshall be admitted.\u201d </em>Rule 609(a) as enacted provides when admission is <em>mandatory </em>and Rule 403 continues to provide when exclusion is <em>discretionary. </em>Thus, given the intangible nature of the elements of the crimes to be weighed, the nuances inherent in the inverse standards to be applied, the mandatory direction of Rule 609(a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the highly dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>cretionary standard of Rule 403, the two rules (as proposed by the Supreme Court and as enacted) in practical application are essentially functional equivalents. Congress thus ended up <em>requiring </em>the admission of prior convictions by a standard that did not vary materially from the combination of Rules 609 and 403 as transmitted by the Chief Justice. And since the only amendments to the Rule that survived were those made by the Conference Committee the rest of the extensive legislative history is irrelevant. As to Rule 609(a) the Advisory Committee\u2019s Notes in most respects are more relevant. See extract therefrom quoted at p. 1051, <em>supra. </em>The Conference Committee Report as quoted at p. 1077, <em>infra, </em>is even stronger.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">The persuasive argument for admitting all \u201cfelonies generally,\u201d and not just crimes with veracity related elements, was made by Senator McClellan:</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">[A] person who has committed a serious crime \u2014 a felony \u2014 will just as readily lie under oath as someone who has committed a misdemeanor involving lying. Would a convicted rapist, cold-blooded murderer or armed robber really hesitate to lie under oath any more than a person who has previously [only] lied? Would a convicted murderer or robber be more truthful than such a person?<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"axr-dedup-0\">120 Cong.Rec. 37076-77. A negative answer is indicated by the mere posing of the question. This was the common sense logic from which the Advisory Committee and the Supreme Court proceeded and that ultimately prevailed in Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">The court\u2019s opinion also states that the legislative history is \u201cnot wholly satisfying\u201d because \u201cCongress <em>never focused </em>on the narrow question whether all felonies have at least some probative value on the issue of credibility.\u201d (Op. at 1061) (emphasis added). This statement is an implicit admission that Congress <em>never restricted </em>the general language of the Rule, i.e., all convictions of crimes \u201cpunishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year,\u201d <em>\u201cshall be admitted </em>\u201d if they survive balancing. By including capital offenses and felonies <em>without limitation, none of which include any element of \u201cdishonesty or false statement\u201d </em>because of the operation of (a)(2), Congress indicated by the scheme of the Rule that veracity related elements were <em>not </em>required for such crimes to be balanced. Thus, the probative value to be balanced flows from the elements of the crime and the magnitude of the defect of individual character, the disrespect for law, that flows from the conviction of <em>any </em>such major crime. The scheme of the Rule therefore implicitly assumes that convictions for <em>all </em>such capital offenses and felonies bear on credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">The court\u2019s opinion, under the guise of deferring to a \u201ccompromise\u201d which occurred in the Conference Committee, fails to fully recognize the plain meaning of the Rule as unanimously adopted by the Conference Committee and enacted by Congress. As shown above, Congress did a complete circle returning to its starting point; the \u201ccompromise\u201d was nothing more than a reversion to the Rule as transmitted from the Supreme Court, with a minor modification of Rule 403 balancing added. Moreover, there is nothing in the so-called \u201ccompromise\u201d that constitutes a valid basis, for <em>altering </em>the ordinary meaning of the plain words of the Rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>cussion of legislative history while interesting is largely inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">The Application of the Rule \u2014 Balancing</p>\n<p id=\"ASd\">As to the procedure to be followed in balancing, it is my view that the court can request any information it considers it needs to exercise its discretion. While ordinarily the name of the crime, the date of the conviction, and the date the witness was released from confinement would be sufficient to perform the necessary balancing, the court has <em>wide </em>discretion to request any information that it considers would be helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">Therefore, recognizing the breadth of the court\u2019s discretion, I would not fetter that discretion by specifying or inferring that the trial judge should consider any particular factors because to do so unnecessarily narrows his discretion. Trial judges should not be placed in straight jackets in the exercise of their discretionary authority. It must also be remembered that in many trials no transcript is prepared and that review by a subsequent court of the proof at trial of a prior conviction could be a very time consuming adventure. In the majority of cases the elements of the statutory offense indicated by the indictment and the jury verdict and the relevant dates, together with such representations as defense counsel might make, should normally be sufficient for the court to perform all the balancing that is fairly required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">The balancing process to be carried out by the judge must of necessity have some practical limitations. In <em>United States v. Boyer, </em>150 F.2d 595, 596 (D.C.Cir.1945), Judge Edgerton wrote with respect to the evidence needed by a jury in considering the effect of a prior conviction on a witness\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">It is generally agreed that in order to save time and avoid confusion of issues, inquiry into a previous crime must be stopped before its logical possibilities are exhausted; the witness cannot call other witnesses to corroborate his story and the opposing party cannot call other witnesses to refute it. The disputed question is whether inquiry into a previous crime should stop (1) with proof of the conviction of the witness or (2) with any reasonably brief \u201cprotestations on his own behalf\u201d which he may wish to make. The second alternative will seldom be materially more confusing or time-consuming than the first, if the trial judge duly exercises his \u201cconsiderable discretion in admitting or rejecting evidence.\u201d [Bracey <em>v. United States, </em>79 U.S.App.D.C. 23, 142 F.2d 85, 89]</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-11\">Many of the same considerations that are applicable to the impeachment of witnesses before a jury also apply to a considerable extent to the procedure by which the judge will balance under the Rule. The considerations expressed by Judge Edgerton are as applicable today as when they were written when it was recognized that the trial judge had \u201cconsiderable discretion in admitting or rejecting evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\">It can also be concluded from the plain language of the Rule that while there is no legal presumption that all capital offenses or felonies are automatically admissible the Rule states directly that timely convictions of such crimes <em>shail be admitted </em>subject to balancing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This language operates to create an initial burden supporting admission that the party opposing admission must overcome or evidence of the conviction will be admitted. The strong inference in the Rule favoring the admission of convictions of such crimes is further supported by the Conference Committee Report:</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-13\">Such evidence [of convictions of capital crimes and felonies] should <em>only </em>be excluded where it presents a danger of <em>improperly </em>influencing the outcome of the trial by persuading the trier of fact to convict the defendant on the basis of his prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>Notes of Conference Committee, House Report No. 93-1597 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">Finally, I strongly object to the statement in the court\u2019s opinion that \u201cthe district court [should obtain] ... perhaps the witness\u2019 case jacket or presentence report .... \u201d (Op. at 1068). With respect to defendants both of these items would raise serious due process considerations. Judges trying cases, whether in a bench trial or with a jury, should not have access to the extensive details of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record unless absolutely necessary. Courts generally are not allowed to have that information until after a verdict has been rendered. Trial judges can be influenced in their rulings by prior knowledge of extensive criminal records. It is submitted that a defendant\u2019s rights are generally better protected when the evidence surrounding prior convictions that is presented to the court is limited to the bare essentials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">The D.C. statute, originally enacted in 1901 (31 Stat. 1357), which provided for the manner of proving a prior conviction, and which is still applicable to D.C. offenses, could well be sufficient in most cases under Rule 609:</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">[T]o prove conviction of crime, it is not necessary to produce the whole record of the proceedings containing the conviction, but the certificate, under seal, of the clerk of the court wherein the proceedings were had, stating the fact of the conviction and for what cause, shall be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">D.C.Code \u00a7 14-305(c) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">Limiting Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"AZn\">The statements by Judge Hand and Justice Jackson which are quoted in the opinion for the court are frequently referred to but seldom analyzed. The court\u2019s opinion follows that practice. (Op. at 1062). This leaves the inference that it is unfair to admit prior convictions of defendants. However, what is significant about those statements is that the judges did <em>not </em>advocate eliminating the practice of introducing such evidence followed by limiting instructions to juries directing them to confine their consideration of evidence of prior conviction to the witness\u2019 credibility and not to guilt. The reason that such judges did not advocate eliminating such rule is because the high purpose of a trial is that it constitutes a <em>search for truth </em>and <em>the rule of admissibility of prior convictions serves that purpose. </em>Judge Hand in <em>Nash v. United States, </em>54 F.2d 1006, 1007 (2d Cir.1932) expressed this opinion when he commented that \u201cthe Rule probably furthers, rather than impedes, the <em>search for truth ... </em>and this perhaps excuses the device which satisfies form while it violates substance.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-12\">Every court in this nation, except in Montana and Hawaii, admits prior convictions to some extent to impeach the credibility of witnesses, IIIA, J. Wigmore (Chadbourn), <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 987 (1970 and Supp.1982), and all presumably give routine limiting instructions. Thus, contrary to the desires of those who quote the statements in an effort to discourage admission of prior felony convictions, such efforts have not been successful; convicted felons are <em>not </em>generally permitted to stand pristine before a jury with the same credibility as that of a Mother Superior. Fairness is not a one-way street and in the search for truth it is a legitimate concern that one who testifies should not be allowed to appear as credible when his criminal record of major crimes suggests that he is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-13\">Moreover, such evidence is not as prejudicial as some think. Those who try criminal cases generally recognize that attacking a witness before a jury because of a prior conviction may be a two-edged sword:</p>\n<p id=\"AJW6\">unless you can break down his <em>evidence; </em>you will not do that by hammering away at his <em>character....</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-14\">There cannot be a greater mistake than to suppose that a man who is suffering punishment for a crime, and who comes into the box to give evidence, will not be believed because of his character. You will generally find that he is regarded with sympathy to begin with. The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>will weigh his evidence scrupulously; and their attention will be naturally drawn towards the <em>probabilities </em>of his story. If <em>yoii cannot touch these, you will make little effect by constantly referring to his misdeeds....</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">IIIA, J. Wigmore (Chadbourn), <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 980 (1970) (quoting R. Harris, <em>Hints on Advocacy) </em>(emphasis added). Harris was referring to a convict testifying for a criminal defendant, but the same observation applies to a previously convicted felon testifying in his own behalf <em>if he has a reasonable defense on the facts. </em>If a defendant has a reasonable factual defense, he will find that juries are conscientious and he can prevail despite prior convictions of crimes. It is an everyday occurrence for juries to accept the testimony of convicted felons, accomplices and those guilty of major crimes, many of whom are compelled to testify under our immunity statutes or under agreements with prosecutors that resulted in lesser punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">Some citizens, lawyers, legislators and judges focus upon what they consider to be the question of fair play for the criminal from a purely technical viewpoint. They lose sight entirely of society\u2019s right to have major criminals convicted and of the necessity that witnesses, both for the prosecution <em>and </em>defendant, not be permitted to appear as credible when in fact they may not be. They also completely lose sight of the fact that our criminal law, when viewed as a whole, already affords the accused far more rights than do the laws of any other nation. In fact, there is widespread respectable opinion that our system of criminal justice is unfairly weighted in favor of the criminal in many respects. The present controversy, focusing entirely upon the admissibility of prior convictions of defendants who are witnesses, grew out of a myopic view and incomplete knowledge of English trial practices that, in some instances, restrict the admission of prior convictions of defendants. Yet, when an English criminal trial is viewed in its entirety it is far less favorable to defendants than criminal trials are in the United States.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Those who suggest the adoption of isolated \u201cimprovements\u201d of criminal procedures from foreign jurisdictions should look to the <em>complete </em>criminal procedure to see to what extent \u201cimprovement\u2019^?) is necessary or justified when the rights of society and defendants are considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">The primary purpose of a criminal trial is to search for truth, and the jury\u2019s determination of a witness\u2019 credibility is one of its most essential duties. Rule 609 is directed to this task, and juries should not be denied critical evidence that bears on this determination by the failure, when balancing, to recognize the <em>full </em>probative force of convictions of capital crimes and felonies. In this respect I find the Rule on its face to be clearer and more forceful than the court\u2019s opinion is willing to recognize. No so-called \u201ccompromise\u201d in the legislative history in any way restricts the probative force of <em>all </em>the major crimes which are to be considered in the balancing process under Rule 609(a)(1). Convictions of major crimes, even those that do not include veracity-related elements, represent a defect of character in the individual that bears strongly on his credibility as a witness. I would also point out that the Rule vests the trial judge with a <em>wide </em>discretion in weighing the probative value and prejudice of pripr convictions. However, because of due process considerations and to avoid unnecessary trial delay, evidence of prior criminal activity of the defendant offered in the balancing process should be limited to the minimum the judge considers necessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1149-16\">.

While Great Britain might be more restrictive in the use of prior convictions to impeach a defendant in some cases, when a criminal trial in Britain is compared to one in America our procedures provide a trial that is much more favorable to the defendant. For example, a few comparisons: In criminal trials in England the judge in \u201csumming up\u201d may comment to the jury on the failure of the defendant to testify, <em>Rex v. Rhodes </em>(1898) 1 Q.B. 77; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Voisin </em>(1918) 1 K.B. 531. The judge in a proper case may direct a jury to convict, <em>Rex v. Ferguson </em>(1970) 54 Cr.App.R. 410; and that they should not acquit, but should decide whether the defendant is guilty of murder or manslaughter, <em>Rex v. Larkin, </em>K.B. 174;\u2019 29 Cr.App.R. 18; <em>Rex v. Black </em>(1964) 48 Cr.App.R. 52. The bad character of the defendant may be admitted for the jury to consider the likelihood that a person with such character would commit the offense. Criminal Evidence Act 1898, s. l(f)(i). The court can charge the jury <em>for </em>conviction and after a reasonable period of deliberation the jury is not required to be unanimous. Practice Direction issued by Lord Parker, C.J., 51 Cr. App.R. 454. Two hours may be considered as a reasonable period. Juries Act, 1974; Practice Direction (1970) 1 W.L.R. 916; 54 Cr.App.R. 373. After a certain time it is also possible to accept a \u201cmajority verdict,\u201d Lord Parker, C.J. (1967) 51 Cr.App.R. 454. The burden of proof is not guilt beyond a reasonable doubt (that phrase is outlawed) but <em>only </em>that the jury \u201cfeel sure of guilt,\u201d <em>Rex v. Rees </em>(1930) 21 Cr.App.R. 35; <em>Rex v. Summers </em>(1953) 36 Cr.App.R. 14; <em>Walters v. Queen </em>(1969) 2 A.C. 26, 30. If the attack by the defense involves imputations on the character of the prosecutor or the witnesses for the prosecution, then prior convictions of the defendant are admissible. Criminal Evidence Act 1898, s. l(b)(ii). Whether the prosecutor will argue the case to the jury depends on the case. It depends on the extent that the accused has put in an affirmative defense. <em>Rex v. Bryant and Oxley </em>(1978) Crim.L.R. 307 C.A. In any event, the judge more or less performs that function in \u201csumming up\u201d the case when he has the wide authority, discussed above, to comment on the evidence and to charge for conviction in an appropriate case. These are just a few of the differences from our practice, but they are sufficient to illustrate that it is wrong to argue that we should adopt a procedure somewhat related to one isolated feature of British practice and ignore the context in which it exists and is used in England.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
