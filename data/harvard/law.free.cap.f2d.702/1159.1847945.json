In the first case, No. 81-1810, because there was sufficient evidence upon which the jury could find appellee guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, we vacate the judgment of acquittal and remand with directions to reinstate the jury verdicts. In the second case, No. 81-1827, we hold that the indictment was properly dismissed as time-barred. The indictment was filed outside the five-year statutory period, and the Government failed to prove that the statute of limitations was tolled by ap-pellee\u2019s fugitive status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">On the evening of September 8, 1975, a Gino\u2019s fast food restaurant on the corner of Florida Avenue and North Capitol Street in Northeast Washington, D.C., was robbed by two men, one of whom brandished a sawed-off shotgun taken from a zippered bag. Moments after the robbery, appellee Macio Singleton was stopped approximately twenty-five yards from the door of the restaurant. He was taken to Gino\u2019s for identification, and three of four counterwomen on duty positively identified him as the man who had wielded the gun during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">In October 1975, Singleton was indicted on four counts of armed robbery,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one count of possession of an unregistered firearm,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one count of possession of a firearm not identified by a serial number.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Singleton did not appear for arraignment and was not rearrested until February 1981. In April 1981, a separate indictment was filed charging him with one count of failure to appear, a Bail Reform Act violation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">The trial judge declined to consolidate the Bail Reform Act and the armed robbery cases, and appellee was tried on the latter charges in late April. After the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts, the district court granted Singleton\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the same time, the district court granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the Bail Reform Act charge as barred by the statute of limitations. The Government noted appeals from both rulings, and the appeals were consolidated before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-18\">On appeal, the Government argues that the district court misapplied the standard for determining whether to grant a judgment of acquittal and submits that the evidence adduced at trial was more than sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. The Government also contends that the district court erred in dismissing the Bail Reform Act charge as untimely. Singleton was a fugitive from justice, it is argued, and therefore not entitled to the benefit of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-19\">II. No. 81-1810</p>\n<p id=\"AM5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-20\">At the outset, we must consider whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. Although the Supreme Court has never addressed the precise jurisdictional issue presented here, we believe that its decisions construing the Criminal Appeals Act of 1970, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 (1976),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment make it clear that post-verdict judgments of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence may be appealed. At least eight other circuits have addressed this issue, and all have reached the same conclusion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>The Supreme Court has held that in enacting section 3731, \u201cCongress intended to remove all statutory barriers to Government appeals, and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 337, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1018, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975). In <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 101 S.Ct. 426, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980), the Court stated that \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a Government appeal from a ruling in favor of the defendant after a guilty verdict has been entered by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130,101 S.Ct. at 434.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits Government appeals only where there is a danger of subjecting the defendant to a second trial for the same offense. <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>420 U.S. 358, 365, 95 S.Ct. 1006, 1010, 43 L.Ed.2d 250 (1975);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Wilson, </em>420 U.S. at 352-53,95 S.Ct. at 1026. Reversal of a post-verdict judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of evidence would result in reinstatement of the jury verdict without placing defendant/appellee in jeopardy again. Thus, we hold that the Government may appeal, pursuant to section 3731, a post-verdict judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-8\">Having decided that the Government\u2019s appeal is properly before this court, we must determine the applicable standard of review. Until now, our review of district court rulings on sufficiency of evidence has been in the context of appeals from the <em>denial </em>of motions for judgments of acquittal. In such cases, the standard for appellate review is the same as that employed by the trial judge in passing on the motion. <em>See Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 16-17, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2149-2150, 57 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>1 (1978); <em>United States v. Foster, </em>584 F.2d 997, 1000 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1006, 99 S.Ct. 620, 58 L.Ed.2d 682 (1978). Thus, the proper inquiry in reviewing denials of motions for judgments of acquittal is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, according the Government the benefit of all legitimate inferences, and recognizing that it is the jury\u2019s province to determine credibility and to weigh the evidence, a reasonable jury <em>must necessarily </em>entertain a reasonable doubt on the evidence presented. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>Curley v. United States, </em>160 F.2d 229, 232 (D.C. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>331 U.S. 837, 67 S.Ct. 1511, 91 L.Ed. 1850 (1947). \u201cIf the evidence reasonably permits a verdict of acquittal or a verdict of guilt, the decision is for the jury to make.\u201d <em>Curley, </em>160 F.2d at 237.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We hold that this standard of review is equally applicable on appeal from the <em>grant </em>of a motion for judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> All other circuits that have had occasion to review the grant of a post-verdict judgment of acquittal have also applied the traditional standard for reviewing the sufficiency of evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">In <em>United States v. Steed, </em>646 F.2d 136 (4th Cir.1981), a panel in the Fourth Circuit held that on the Government\u2019s appeal from a post-verdict judgment of acquittal, the court of appeals must defer to the district court\u2019s assessment of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 142. This decision was resoundingly rejected by the Fourth Circuit sitting en banc. <em>United States v. Steed, </em>674 F.2d 284 (4th Cir.1982) (en banc). Judge Butzner, writing for the court, stated that \u201c[wjhether the assessment of the evidence is at the behest of the government or the defendant, the function of the reviewing court is unchanged and consequently the same standard of review is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. We agree. We have a responsibility to ensure that the Government\u2019s right to appeal is not an empty one; we must conduct our review of Government appeals with the same care afforded appeals by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">We have reviewed with considerable care the fifteen-volume transcript in this case, and we are convinced that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury\u2019s verdicts of guilty. The evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdicts will be summarized briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-10\">The trial testimony shows that on the evening of September 8, 1975, Officer John Betts<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and his partner, Officer Joyce Willis Hardy, were in a marked cruiser stopped in traffic on Florida Avenue directly in front of Gino\u2019s. Betts saw two black men exiting the restaurant and heading toward the officers. When they spotted the squad car, however, the men began to run the other way. Betts, an experienced officer familiar with the high crime nature of the neighborhood, suspected that Gino\u2019s had been robbed and instructed Officer Hardy to give chase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>by foot. As Officer Hardy chased the two suspects through Gino\u2019s parking lot, one of the men turned left toward North Capitol Street, and the second continued straight ahead and entered an alley. Hardy pursued the second man but lost sight of him in the alley.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Betts drove around the corner onto North Capitol Street in an effort to cut the suspects off. No more than ten seconds after he initially observed the men leaving Gino\u2019s, and only about twenty or twenty-five yards away from the door of the restaurant, Betts observed a black male wearing the same apparel as one of the men he had seen leaving Gino\u2019s.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The suspect, later identified as Singleton, had been walking at a fast pace, but slowed to a normal gait when he noticed the police car. Betts approached the suspect and advised him of an apparent robbery at Gino\u2019s. Meanwhile, Officer Hardy came out of the alley and saw her partner approximately thirty feet away with Singleton. While walking toward them, she recovered a gym bag containing a sawed-off shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Singleton was taken immediately to Gino\u2019s for a showup, and three of the four counterwomen present when the robbery was committed positively identified him as the man with the gun. Testimony regarding these identifications was the keystone of the Government\u2019s case against appellee. Brenda Hardy, one of the counterwomen, testified that the robber with the gun was in her sight for about two minutes at a distance of three to four feet, and that although she was primarily staring at his gun, she could still glance up at him. When the police brought Singleton into Gino\u2019s, she identified him as the man with the gun. Ms. Hardy told the jury that she was \u201cvery positive\u201d of her identification, that on her way to work about two days after the robbery she saw the man again,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that she \u201cnever forgot how he looked.\u201d Trial Transcript (Tr.) at 29-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-8\">Ruth Taylor, another counterwoman, testified that she recognized Singleton as soon as the police brought him through the door of Gino\u2019s, even before she was asked to identify him. Although she glanced at the robber\u2019s face only once, Ms. Taylor was sure at the time of her identification that appel-lee was the man with the gun.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1240-9\">Lutherina Baptist, yet another counter-woman at Gino\u2019s, told the jury that at one point she looked directly at the man with the gun, who was within an arm\u2019s length of her. When the police brought the suspect into the restaurant, she was \u201cmore than positive\u201d that h\u00e9 was the same man because the incident was \u201cfresh in [her] mind\u201d and \u201chis face was implanted on [her] mind.\u201d Tr. at 123-24. The fourth counterwoman to testify, Catherine Allen, was so frightened by the robbery that she was unable to recall whether she was even asked by police to identify appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-10\">Arguing that the district court correctly ruled that this evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts, appellee contends that there was a broad divergence between the witnesses\u2019 recollections of the robber\u2019s appearance and Singleton\u2019s appearance on the evening of the robbery. Government Exhibit Number Four, a photograph taken at the police station after his arrest, shows Singleton with a beard, mustache, and bushy hair. The apparel worn by appellee in the photograph consisted of a dark zippered jacket with jagged cut-off sleeves, light brown pants and white tennis shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-11\">At trial, Brenda Hardy recalled that the robber wore a short or medium bush hairstyle, a goatee, and perhaps a mustache. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>She testified that he was dressed in blue jeans and a green jacket with long sleeves buttoned at the wrist. Ms. Baptist stated that although \u201cit was a long time ago,\u201d Tr. at 114, and she didn\u2019t remember exactly what the man with the gun looked like, he had no beard, but might have had a mustache. Ms. Baptist had no recollection of the robber\u2019s clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">Ms. Taylor recalled that the man with the gun had bushy hair. She stated that his face was \u201ckind of clean,\u201d Tr. at 70, and that, although he may have had a mustache, he did not have a beard. According to Ms. Taylor, the robber with the gun was wearing an open, faded jean jacket with long sleeves and an orange knitted cap. Ms. Taylor stated that her identification at Gino\u2019s was based, at least in part, on her recollection of the robber\u2019s clothing. Looking at Government Exhibit Number Four,' she testified that she was positive that the clothes shown in the photograph were not the clothes the man with the gun had on at the time of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">Officer Betts testified that the man he saw leaving Gino\u2019s and later apprehended was wearing a dark jacket and dark pants, and that he had noticed no color distinction between them. Betts also stated that Government Exhibit Number Four accurately represented the clothing Singleton was wearing when he was apprehended. On cross-examination, however, Betts admitted that a distinct difference between the color of Singleton\u2019s pants and jacket is evident from the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-12\">In a Supplemental Memorandum and Order filed on September 3, 1981, the district judge expressed his concern regarding the suggestive nature of the showup conducted at Gino\u2019s<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and emphasized that the independent recollections of the witnesses substantially contradicted the showup identification. In his view, these factors, considered together, reduced the weight of the identification evidence to the point where the jurors <em>must </em>have had a reasonable doubt as to the identification of the robber with the gun.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, the district judge concluded that the judgment of acquittal was required. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-13\">We share the concern of the trial judge regarding the showup in this case; it was undoubtedly conducted in a highly, perhaps even unnecessarily, suggestive manner.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We do not believe, however, that the suggestiveness was a factor which, considered with the conflicting testimony of the witnesses, necessitated or justified a verdict of acquittal. Immediate on-the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>scene showup identifications, while recognized as inherently suggestive, have long been upheld by this court. <em>See, e.g., Russell v. United States, </em>408 F.2d 1280, 1284 (D.C. Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 928, 89 S.Ct. 1786, 23 L.Ed.2d 245 (1969); <em>Wise v. United States, </em>383 F.2d 206, 208 (D.C.Cir.1967), <em>cert, denied, </em>390 U.S. 964, 88 S.Ct. 1069, 19 L.Ed.2d 1164 (1968). \u201cBalancing all the doubts left by the mysteries of human perception and recognition, it appears that prompt confrontations ... will \u2018if anything promote fairness by assuring reliability ....\u201d\u2019 <em>Russell, </em>408 F.2d at 1284 (quoting <em>Wise, </em>383 F.2d at 209). Notwithstanding its suggestive elements, the showup at issue here took place under circumstances that would tend to promote reliability.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The showup took place within two or three minutes after the robbery, at the scene of the crime. The witnesses had ample opportunity to view the culprits at close range in good lighting conditions.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In addition, the witnesses were quite certain of their identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">Once admitted, identification evidence is for the jury to weigh.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Suggestive procedures often vitiate the weight of the evidence, and the jury may tend to discount the resulting identification. <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98,112 n. 12, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2252 n. 12, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977). The suggestiveness of the identification procedure used in this case was argued vigorously to the jury in defense counsel\u2019s closing argument. Closing Argument Transcript at 46-49. \u00c1s Justice Blackmun so eloquently stated in <em>Manson,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1242-7\">[w]e are content to rely upon the good sense and judgment of American juries, for evidence with some element of un-trustworthiness is customary grist for the jury mill. Juries are not so susceptible that they cannot measure intelligently the weight of identification testimony that has some questionable feature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-8\">432 U.S. at 116, 97 S.Ct. at 2253.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">Nor do we find fatal the incongruence in the testimony of the witnesses. There are variations, to be sure, between the recollections of the witnesses as to the robber\u2019s facial appearance and clothing and Singleton\u2019s appearance as shown by the photograph taken on the night of his arrest. Such discrepancies are to be expected, however, especially since the witnesses were recalling an event that happened over five years earlier. \u201cIt would be a rare case indeed if all the testimony of the prosecution were in perfect harmony.\u201d <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Petersen, </em>507 F.2d 898, 901 (3d Cir.1975). Again, we note that the weight to be given to the testimony of the witnesses is for the jury to determine. <em>Sewell v. Cardwell, </em>454 F.2d 177, 179 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>(6th Cir.1972). The inconsistencies in testimony were emphasized on cross-examination and argued to the jury in defense counsel\u2019s closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\">Appellee also complains about the failure of the Government to attempt to elicit an in-court identification. Brief for Appellee at 6. Both before and during trial there was discussion on the issue of whether an in-court identification should be conducted in this case. Neither the Government nor defense counsel thought such an identification advisable in light of the number of years that had passed before trial. Furthermore, pretrial identifications are often more probative than ritualized in-court identifications. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hallman, </em>439 F.2d 603, 604 (D.C.Cir.1971).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This is particularly true when a substantial period of time has elapsed between the out-of-court identification and the trial. <em>United States v. Higgans, </em>507 F.2d 808 (7th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">In sum, we find that the evidence is sufficient to find appellee guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Three of the four coun-terwomen on duty at Gino\u2019s on the night of the robbery told the jurors they identified Singleton on the evening of September 8, 1975, and each expressed certainty about her identification. In addition, the combined testimony of Officers Betts and Hardy suggested to the jurors that one of the robbers was observed fleeing toward the location where Singleton was stopped, which was also near the spot where the bag with the shotgun was recovered. Finally, appellee elected to testify in his own defense, and the jurors obviously chose to disbelieve his testimony-.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The judgment of acquittal entered by the district court is, accordingly, vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-12\">III. No. 81-1827</p>\n<p id=\"AYu\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-13\">The basis for the indictment charging Singleton with violation of the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3150 (1976),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> was his failure to appear for arraignment on the armed robbery charges on November 7, 14, and 21 of 1975.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The indictment was filed on March 12, 1981, more than three months after the five-year statute of limitations had run. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282 (1976).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>response to appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment as barred by the statute, the Government sought to invoke the tolling provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3290 (1976), which provides that \u201c[n]o statute of limitations shall extend to any person fleeing from justice.\u201d A hearing was held on the motion to dismiss on May 5, 1981, and the trial judge granted the motion on June 19, the same day it orally granted the motion for acquittal in Number 81-1810, the armed robbery case. Although the district court gave no reasons for granting the motion to dismiss, our review of the record makes it clear that the Government failed to carry its burden of proving that Singleton was \u201cfleeing from justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-5\">At the hearing on the motion to dismiss the Bail Reform Act charge, Singleton testified that when he was originally arrested in 1975, he lived at 1708 5th Street, Northwest, in the District of Columbia, and that his mother lived at 8 Channing Street, Northeast. Bail Transcript (Bail Tr.) at 18, 20.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> He lived at the same address for some two years after his arrest, and then he moved to a \u201cbigger apartment\u201d located at 76 Randolph Place, Northwest, where he lived at the time of his rearrest in February of 1981. Singleton\u2019s mother remained at the Channing Street address for about three years following his arrest. Bail Tr. at 19-20. At the time of his arrest, Singleton worked at the Congressional Country Club, where he continued to work for eighteen months thereafter. Bail Tr. at 20. Singleton testified that at his preliminary hearing on the armed robbery charges he was told he would receive something in the mail regarding the date of his next court appearance and that he never received such notice. Bail Tr. at 20-21. During the armed robbery trial, Singleton testified that he had heard that the case against a second man charged with the robbery had been dismissed and assumed that the case against him had been dismissed as well. Tr. at 368-69. Appellee also testified that he did not know of any attempts by United States Marshals or police to locate him and that he saw Betts, the arresting officer in the robbery case, on many occasions after his arrest, and the missed court appearances were never mentioned. Bail Tr. at 21-23. Singleton also stated that since his original arrest he had left the District of Columbia only in the course of his employment, for trips into suburban Maryland and Virginia to lay carpet. Bail Tr. at 23-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-10\">The Government conducted no cross-examination of appellee and presented no evidence contradicting his statements. The Government called Deputy United States Marshal James M. McCarthy as a witness, but he could only testify to several efforts to locate Singleton in 1979.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Mr. McCarthy stated that Marshal\u2019s Office records indicated that no attempts were made to locate the appellee in 1980 or 1981. Bail Tr. at 44. Since very poor records, or no records at all, were kept prior to 1979, the Deputy Marshal could not testify to attempts to locate Singleton during 1975-1978.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Bail Tr. at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-12\">This court has seldom been called upon to construe the language contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3290 and has apparently never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>addressed the question whether one who does not physically flee the jurisdiction can be a fugitive from justice in the sense contemplated by this section.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Other circuits applying section 3290 have held that in order to find that an accused was \u201cfleeing from justice,\u201d it is necessary to show he acted with the intent to avoid prosecution or punishment, whether or not he actually left the jurisdiction. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Wazney, </em>529 F.2d 1287 (9th Cir. 1976); <em>Jhirad </em>v. <em>Ferrandina, </em>486 F.2d 442 (2d Cir.1973); <em>Donnell v. United States, </em>229 F.2d 560 (5th Cir.1956). The Ninth Circuit in <em>Wazney </em>stated that physical absence from the jurisdiction is not required to trigger the tolling provision of section 3290. 529 F.2d at 1289. \u201cIt is enough that an accused leaves his usual place of abode and conceals himself for the purpose of avoiding arrest or prosecution .... In modern large and heavily populated districts it is almost as easy to avoid arrest or prosecution by concealing oneself within the district as by fleeing the district.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1245-5\">We agree that flight from the jurisdiction is not required to trigger the tolling provision. It would be neither logical nor supportive of the policy underlying section 3290 to interpret the law in such a way that one who leaves and is found without the jurisdiction is \u201cfleeing justice\u201d regardless of his intent, while one who actively evades authorities and conceals himself within the jurisdiction can receive the benefit of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-7\">The crux of the Government\u2019s argument in this case is that by changing his address and failing to maintain contact with his attorney or the court, appellee rendered himself \u201ceffectively beyond the reach of justice,\u201d thereby triggering the tolling provision of section 3290.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Brief for Appellant at 21. The Government argued before the district court, and appears to argue here as well, that \u201cone who does not appear as ordered is ... a fugitive until and unless he, not the Government, can show otherwise.\u201d Bail Tr. at 12. Proceeding on this assumption, the Government failed to present evidence that Singleton was notified of his court dates, or that efforts were made to locate him within a reasonable period of time after his failure to appear for arraignment. The Government relied instead upon testimony that the Marshal\u2019s Office sought to locate Singleton on two consecutive days during the more than five years prior to his rearrest and on the very fact that Singleton failed to appear in court to prove that he was a fugitive from justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1245-8\">We do not believe that failure to make a court appearance in itself necessarily renders one a fugitive from justice. In a normal case, the facts that Singleton failed to appear, that he did not notify the bail agency of his change of address, and that he failed to maintain contact with his attorney would tend to indicate flight. This is not, however, a normal case. More than five years passed between appellee\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>appear in 1975 and his rearrest in 1981. Appellee lived at the same address for two years following his initial arrest and then moved to another apartment. There is no evidence that the Marshal\u2019s Office attempted to contact Singleton at any time prior to, or after, June' 1979. Furthermore, there is no showing that the Marshals sought to discover Singleton\u2019s phone number or new address <em>(e.g., </em>through the Post Office or the phone book) or that they ever tried to locate him at the country club where he worked at the time of his arrest and for eighteen months thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\">As the <em>Wazney </em>court stated, the accused should not be held responsible for a delay caused by \u201can open move to a new residence where [he] is readily accessible to <em>careful </em>law enforcement officers.\u201d 529 F.2d at 1289 (emphasis added). It appears that the Marshal\u2019s Service made only minimal efforts to locate Singleton. Therefore, we cannot infer too much from the fact that these efforts proved fruitless. We conclude that on the facts of this case, the Government failed to show that Singleton acted with the intention of avoiding prosecution. The motion to dismiss the indictment under section 3150 was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-6\">The judgment of the district court in No. 81-1810 is vacated. The case is remanded, and the district court is directed to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdicts of guilty, to enter a judgment of conviction, and to impose sentence. The order of the district court in No. 81-1827 dismissing the indictment for failure to appear is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-7\">\n<em>So Ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-8\">J. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge, dissenting in No. 81-1810 and concurring in No. 81-1827:</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-9\">After a jury found appellee guilty of armed robbery, the District Court granted a motion for acquittal. The judge declared it \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that \u201cwhere the only government evidence, identifications made in a highly suggestive showup, is flatly contradicted by the independent recollections of the same witnesses, reasonable men and women must have reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on its own reading of the trial transcript, the majority reaches a different conclusion and vacates the judgment of acquittal ordered by the lower court. Because, in my opinion, the majority misconstrues the standard of review articulated by the <em>en banc </em>court in this case and because, in any event, the record amply vindicates the District Court\u2019s disposition, I dissent in No. 81-1810.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-15\">My disagreement begins with the standard for review adopted by the majority. In my judgment, the majority fails to apply the appropriate principles of appellate review announced today in <em>United States v. Singleton, </em>and <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>702 F.2d 1182 (D.C.Cir.1983) (en <em>banc) (per curiam). </em>Instead, the majority conducts a completely <em>de novo </em>review of the record, according no consideration whatever to the lower court\u2019s careful assessment of this case. <em>See </em>Part I <em>infra. </em>Nevertheless, even without considering the District Court\u2019s judgment, I would disagree strenuously with the conclusions of the majority. The government based its case on eyewitness identifications made during a showup.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The showup, conducted in an extraordinarily suggestive manner, cannot suffice to support a criminal conviction. Indeed, the showup was so suggestive that it constituted a denial of due process. <em>See </em>Part. II <em>infra. </em>There is, however, even <em>less </em>to the government\u2019s case than simply dubious identifications. Here, the very witnesses who made the identifications testified at trial in ways that fatally undermined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>defendant\u2019s alleged guilt. <em>See </em>Part III <em>infra. </em>Under these circumstances, no reasonable jury could maintain \u201can abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the District Court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">I. The Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"A14\">On July 9,1982 this same panel issued an opinion in this case, accompanied by my dissent. By order of October 4, 1982 the full court vacated the panel\u2019s judgment and opinion and granted rehearing <em>en banc </em>of the case. The <em>en banc </em>court limited its consideration of the case to a determination of the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">What degree of deference, if any, is due to a district court\u2019s assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence in granting a post-verdict motion for acquittal?</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">In its <em>per curiam </em>decision, the full court determined that while we must reach our own independent judgment on the sufficiency of the evidence, <em>\u201cwe may consider and be influenced by the opinion of the expert trial judge who has lived with the case </em>\u2014 just <em>as we give weight to one another\u2019s views.\u201d United States v. Singleton, supra, </em>702 F.2d at 1183 (emphasis added). Such consideration is particularly appropriate when the trial judge, as here, has stated his reasoning with specificity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">The panel majority has completely disregarded the full court\u2019s admonition to accord serious consideration to the District Court\u2019s assessment of the evidence. The District Court, after assessing the sufficiency of the evidence in this case, concluded that a reasonable jury must have a reasonable doubt. The court therefore granted a motion for acquittal after the jury had returned a guilty verdict. In reviewing such determinations under the Criminal Appeals Act of 1970,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the majority holds that an appellate court should conduct <em>de novo </em>precisely the same inquiry as the District Judge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In so doing, the majority completely ignores the conclusion reached by the trial judge. Such an approach contravenes not only the plain language of the <em>en banc </em>court\u2019s decision in this case, but the important principles that demand serious appellate consideration of the trial court\u2019s assessment of the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1247-14\">To begin with, the Supreme Court has stressed the \u201cconstitutional significance\u201d of a District Court\u2019s determination that the government\u2019s evidence was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction. <em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 572, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 1355, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977). <em>See, e.g., Sanabria v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 68-69, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 2180-81, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978). Such a ruling \u201crelate[s] to \u2018the ultimate question of guilt or innocence,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 98 n. 11, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2197 n. 11, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978) <em>(quoting Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 490, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 3050, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976)), and can \u201c \u2018establish the criminal defendant\u2019s lack of criminal culpability\u2019 * * *.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, supra, </em>437 U.S. at 98, 98 S.Ct. at 2197 (majority opinion <em>quoting id. </em>at 106, 98 S.Ct. at 2201 (Brennan, J., dissenting)). <em>Cf. Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 15, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2149, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978) (distinguishing reversal for evidentiary insufficiency as opposed to trial error in terms of implications for guilt or innocence). Furthermore, determinations of the sufficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>of the evidence can allow the trial judge to perform an important \u201cprotective\u201d role. <em>See </em>15 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3939 at 345 (1981 Pocket Part). <em>Cf. United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., supra, </em>430 U.S. at 574-575, 97 S.Ct. at 1356 (determinations of evidentiary sufficiency may protect a defendant by filtering out deficient prosecutions). These considerations should not preclude appeals from post-verdict grants of acquittal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but appellate courts should only reluctantly overturn such a weighty ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">Powerful practical considerations also suggest the need for according serious consideration to the District Court\u2019s determination. A grant of acquittal by a trial judge <em>prior </em>to a jury verdict is final and not reviewable even if based on an \u201cegregiously erroneous foundation.\u201d <em>Fung Foo v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 141, 143, 82 S.Ct. 671, 672, 7 L.Ed.2d 629 (1962). By contrast, post-verdict grants of acquittal are not merely reviewable but, under the majority\u2019s approach, the District Court\u2019s determination receives no consideration at all. Faced with a choice between a non-reviewable pre-verdict grant of acquittal and a post-verdict grant that will be utterly ignored, a District Judge may opt for the former. This result would be extremely unfortunate. Not only would it preclude review even where the lower court has seriously erred, it also would not afford a trial judge the maximum opportunity to consider with care a pending acquittal motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Where all the evidence has been presented, District Judges should be encouraged to pass on motions for acquittal <em>after </em>a jury has returned its verdict.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Refusal to accord lower courts any consideration at all can only tend to discourage this better practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-8\">Most crucially, a District Court\u2019s judgment that the evidence cannot suffice to support a conviction should significantly influence the appellate court\u2019s determination because the trial judge is in a far better position to make such assessments. The trial judge has a fresh personal knowledge of the evidence given and the witness\u2019 testimony. He has a \u201csuperior opportunity to get \u2018the feel of the case\u2019 * * <em>Noonan v. Cunard Steamship Co., </em>375 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir.1967) (Friendly, J.). <em>See Cone v. West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co., </em>330 U.S. 212, 216, 67 S.Ct. 752, 755, 91 L.Ed. 849 (1947). A typewritten transcript available to a reviewing court can never completely convey the full import of the facts and circumstances adduced at trial. Appellate courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>are well equipped to make rulings of law, but here the legal ruling is intimately tied to a knowledge of the trial evidence. This constitutes a \u201csound and proper reason for conferring a substantial measure of respect to the trial judge\u2019s ruling * * Rosenberg, <em>Appellate Review of Trial Court Discretion, </em>79 F.R.D. 173, 183 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Finally, the District Court\u2019s judgment in this case is \u201cparticularly\u201d worthy of serious consideration because the trial judge \u201chas set forth his reasons with specificity.\u201d <em>United States v. Singleton, supra, </em>702 F.2d at 1183. By detailing the numerous contradictions between the witnesses\u2019 identifications in the highly suggestive showup and their subsequent independent recollections of the criminal events,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the trial judge has provided the specificity of explanation that certainly should influence the reviewing court\u2019s ultimate determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">Thus, in my judgment, the majority errs by failing to follow the <em>en banc </em>court\u2019s decision that in deciding this case, this court should \u201cconsider and be influenced by\u201d the District Judge\u2019s assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> After all, it is he who was \u201cthe expert trial judge who has lived with the case[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Singleton, supra, </em>702 F.2d at 1183. Even without any consideration of the District Court\u2019s judgment, however, it is clear from the record that the District Court\u2019s order of acquittal should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-16\">II. The Defective Showup</p>\n<p id=\"AFsf\">On the night of his 29th birthday,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Macio Singleton was walking in the general direction of his mother\u2019s house<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> when he was stopped by a policeman. He was taken to a nearby Gino\u2019s carry-out restaurant that had just been robbed by two men, one of whom had held a sawed-off shotgun taken from a zippered bag. At the restaurant three of the four eounterwomen on duty identified Mr. Singleton as the man who had held the shotgun. These identifications constituted the <em>sine qua non </em>of the government\u2019s case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See </em>maj. op. at 1164 (\u201cTestimony regarding these identifications was the <em>keystone </em>of the Government\u2019s case against appellee.\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-17\">When the government\u2019s entire case rests on showup identifications, the circumstances surrounding the pretrial confrontation assume special significance. Here, the District Judge wondered \u201c[wjhether extrajudicial identifications comparable to those in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>this case, standing alone, would suffice to support a criminal conviction * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> I share the District Court\u2019s concern. Indeed, under the totality of the circumstances, the showup in this case was so suggestive as to pose a very substantial likelihood of mis-identification. Therefore, the showup violated due process, and testimony based on it should never have been admitted.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 198, 93 S.Ct. 375, 381,34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972) (standard for admissibility is whether a very substantial likelihood of misidentification exists). Because, in my judgment, the showup violated due process, it necessarily follows that identifications based on the showup cannot suffice to support a criminal conviction.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">In deciding whether a pretrial identification violates due process, a court must balance \u201cthe corrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself\u201d against indicia of reliability of the identification. <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2253, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977). In this case the corrupting effect of an extraordinarily suggestive identification exists. Meanwhile, countervailing indicia of reliability are either nonexistent or relatively insignificant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">A. <em>Extraordinarily Suggestive Aspects of the Identification</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">The majority admits that the showup in this case \u201cwas undoubtedly conducted in a highly, perhaps even unnecessarily, suggestive manner.\u201d Maj. op. at 1165. The court attempts to minimize the significance of this concession by noting that all showup identifications are \u201cinherently suggestive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1165-1166. However, the fact that showup identifications are inherently suggestive does not immunize all such identifications. While approving the use of show-ups in general, our court has never approved and has always distinguished show-ups that take place under \u201cunusually suggestive\u201d circumstances. <em>Russell v. United States, </em>408 F.2d 1280, 1284 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 928, 89 S.Ct. 1786, 23 L.Ed.2d 245 (1969). <em>See Wise v. United States, </em>383 F.2d 206, 210 (D.C.Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 964, 88 S.Ct. 1069, 19 L.Ed.2d 1164 (1968) (noting that no aspects of the particular identification in that case diverged from \u201crudimentary fairness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">Indeed, because showup identifications are by their nature suggestive,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> it is imperative that police officers avoid introducing needless additional elements of suggestiveness.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Yet in this case the police signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>cantly aggravated the situation by actions that needlessly and unmistakably suggested defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">1. Placement of incriminating physical evidence next to defendant at the showup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">When Mr. Singleton was brought to Gino\u2019s for identification, the police placed near him the zippered bag,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and also apparently the shotgun,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that had been used in the robbery. These items were <em>not </em>in Singleton\u2019s possession when he was arrested by Officer Betts; the government concedes that \u201cappellee was not carrying anything when stopped * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Rather, they were found separately by Officer Hardy after she had lost sight of the robbers.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">The three identifying witnesses had all seen the bag during the holdup; one of them had even \u201cfocused\u201d her attention on it.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Similarly, the shotgun hardly escaped their notice.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> By placing physical evidence near the defendant, the police substantially increased the risk that the identification would be the product <em>not </em>of spontaneous and independent judgment, but rather of insinuation. The identifying witnesses would inevitably tend to infer guilt based on their positive identification of the physical evidence as opposed to recognition of Mr. Singleton himself.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Also, the chosen procedure obviously suggested that Mr. Singleton had been captured in possession of the physical evidence, which was simply untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-11\">In evaluating the suggestiveness of an identification for due process purposes, one of the key factors that courts in this circuit have explicitly identified is whether \u201cany tangible objects related to the offense [were] placed before the witness that would encourage identification.\u201d <em>United States v. Neverson, </em>463 F.2d 1224, 1230 n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1972); <em>Clemons v.

United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 383, 88 S.Ct. 967, 970, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968) (emphasis added; footnote omitted) (discussing photographic identification).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">In this case, placement of physical evidence near Singleton could only serve to pollute the identification process. This suggestive practice, specifically disapproved in our prior cases, substantially increased the risk of misidentification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">2. Statements of the police to the witnesses prior to the showup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">Past decisions in this circuit have also stressed that statements made to witnesses prior to a confrontation can increase the suggestiveness of the identification process. <em>See, e.g., Clemons v. United States, supra, </em>408 F.2d at 1245 n. 16; <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>282 F.Supp. at 965.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Here, before presenting Mr. Singleton to the counterwomen at Gino\u2019s, the police officers went into a back room at the restaurant and spoke to the four women. The police stated that they had a suspect in custody and they asked for \u201cpositive identifications.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> As one of the identifying witnesses testified, the police asked if she \u201cwould come forth and give them a <em>positive identification </em>that the man that they had was in fact the same man that had held us up.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">Presentation of a single suspect to victims of a crime creates a situation \u201cpregnant with prejudice. The message is clear: the police suspect <em>this </em>man.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> When the suspect is in handcuffs, as Singleton was,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the message grows stronger. But when police officers prepare the witnesses by soliciting positive identifications, they needlessly predispose the witnesses and thereby magnify the risks of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-15\">3. Grouping of witnesses during the identification process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-16\">When the police presented the witnesses to Singleton, the three counterwomen who identified him stood very close together, roughly within an arm\u2019s length of one another.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> At some point they signified their recognition, perhaps by nodding their heads.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The grouping of the witnesses strongly suggests that each identification did not result from the exercise of independent judgment. There are obvious dangers that the identifications were \u201cthe product of mutual reinforcement of opinion among witnesses simultaneously viewing defendant[.]\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>282 F.Supp. at 965 (discussing indicators of suggestiveness). <em>Accord, Clemons v. United States, supra, </em>408 F.2d at 1245 n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-17\">The dangers of group identifications are starkly demonstrated by the testimony of one of the witnesses, Ms. Taylor. In response to government questioning, Ms. Taylor testified that another counterwoman, Ms. Allen, had stated to the police during the showup that she thought Mr. Singleton was one of the robbers.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> However, Ms. Allen was the one counterwoman who <em>never </em>identified Singleton<footnotemark>37</footnotemark>; indeed, she was apparently in the back room at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>showup!<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Thus, the collective identification atmosphere caused one witness to imagine a nonexistent corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">The police could easily have eliminated this defect in Singleton\u2019s identification. The witnesses should have been brought to the suspect one at a time and kept apart until all the attempted identifications ended. Instead, the officers needlessly increased the risks of misidentification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">B. <em>The Absence of Certain Key Indicia of Reliability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">The police should obviously never act so as to exacerbate the inherent suggestiveness of a showup. But equally important, in my judgment, the police should undertake measures to minimize the risks of mis-identification. Otherwise, the dangers attendant to the use of an \u201cinherently suggestive\u201d procedure go unchecked and serious doubt must be cast on the reliability of the resulting identifications. In this case, for no apparent reason the police failed to implement basic safeguards that would have reduced the odds of misidentification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">1. The police officers\u2019 failure to obtain a description of the robbers prior to the showup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">One crucial procedure for obtaining independent verification of the accuracy of a subsequent showup is for the police to secure descriptions of the suspects from each witness individually <em>before </em>a confrontation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In cases where the showup produces positive identifications, this procedure allows comparison of verbal descriptions of the alleged criminal with the actual characteristics of the suspect. Significant discrepancies between the suspect as described by witnesses and the suspect identified in a showup would substantially undercut the showup evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">The majority admits that \u201cthe police never asked the victims for a description of the robbers before the showup, which they certainly could and <em>should </em>have done.\u201d Maj. op. at 1165 n. 20 (emphasis added). I doubt that the majority\u2019s admonition will give Mr. Singleton much solace. Moreover, the Supreme Court long ago listed \u201cthe accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal\u201d as a key factor to be considered in evaluating whether a confrontation procedure was suggestive. <em>Neil v. Biggers, supra, </em>409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. at 382. Since no such description exists, the reliability of the subsequent identification is diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-14\">2. The failure to arrange a lineup after the showup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-15\">The majority discounts the absence of an in-court identification in this case. Maj. op. at 1167. I agree with the court that \u201critualized in-court identifications\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> have little value. Of greater significance, however, is the government\u2019s failure to conduct a lineup at any point after Mr. Singleton\u2019s arrest, especially prior to the indictment..' This failure is troubling because a fair lineup<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> is generally considered \u201c[t]he best method yet devised for the avoidance of suggestion in corporeal identifications \u2014 a method \u2018infinitely better\u2019 than the presentation to the witness of a single suspect * * <footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-16\">To be sure, the reliability of positive identifications from a lineup that follows a showup can be questioned. The image of a suspect suggestively presented during a showup may remain vivid and undermine the independent value of a subsequent confrontation. Thus recognition at a lineup may merely confirm that a suspect was present at the showup, but <em>not </em>at the crime. On the other hand, a fair lineup forces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>witnesses to identify a suspect with a minimum of suggestion. If the witnesses cannot select a suspect from those on line, it will inevitably raise doubts about the initial showup identification.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> For instance, in the case at hand the showup identification may have resulted more from recognition of physical evidence than of personal characteristics; a subsequent lineup would highlight such a deficiency. Also, witnesses seemingly confident of their identifications during a showup may display real doubts in the face of a lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">While the failure to conduct a subsequent lineup, taken alone, deserves no special weight, such a lineup can serve as a useful check on the showup process. Because the government must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it should take such precautions in cases involving suggestive showups in order to reduce doubt.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">C. <em>Indicia of Reliability Asserted by the Majority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">Despite all the infirmities of the showup, the majority nonetheless contends that \u201cthe showup at issue here took place under circumstances which would tend to promote reliability.\u201d Maj. op. at 1166. In particular, the majority lists three aspects of the showup that supposedly buttress its reliability<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Each of these indicia is discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-12\">1. Opportunity to view the culprits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-13\">The majority asserts that the witnesses had \u201cample opportunity to view the culprits at close range in good lighting conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Whatever their <em>opportunities </em>for viewing the culprits, the record makes clear that the witnesses did not in fact get a very good look at the man with the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-14\">Ms. Taylor was apparently the first coun-terwoman to identify Singleton.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Yet, she waited on the \u201cother robber,\u201d <em>not </em>the man with the shotgun.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Indeed, it was not until the \u201cother robber\u201d told her to open her register and put the money in the bag that she even realized that there was \u201canother dude standing on the next register robbing the other counter girls.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> She only \u201cglanced\u201d at the robber with the shotgun \u201cjust once\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> at a distance of 12 to 15 feet.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Even so, she testified that she \u201cdidn\u2019t really glance up at him\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t take a glance at his face that good.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The reason was simply that she \u201cwas so busy watching the gun * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> A second coun-terwoman, Ms. Hardy, also \u201cwas staring at the shotgun,\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> although she \u201ccould still glance up at [the robber], too.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Psychological studies have shown that individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>under high stress tend to focus on relatively few features of their environment.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Where a weapon is brandished it tends to capture a good deal of attention, thereby reducing the ability to recognize and to recall details about an assailant.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> This \u201cweapon focus\u201d phenomenon<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> appears evident here. The third witness, Ms. Baptist, also averted her gaze. As she testified, \u201c[M]y attention was on the bag and the money and anything other than [the robber with the shotgun]. I just didn\u2019t want to look at him to make him nervous.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> These facts hardly seem conducive to reliable identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-4\">2. Certainty of the identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\">The majority claims that the witnesses were \u201cquite certain\u201d of their identifications. Maj. op. at 1166. Yet innumerable authorities have concluded that a witness\u2019 degree of certainty in making an identification generally does not measure its reliability. <em>E.g., </em>P. Wall, Eyewitness Identification in Criminal Cases 15-16 (1965); Clifford &amp; Scott, <em>Individual and Situational Factors in Eyewitness Testimony, </em>63 J. Applied Psychology 352 (1978); O\u2019Connor, <em>\u201cThat\u2019s the Man\u201d: A Sobering Study of Eyewitness Identification, </em>49 St. John\u2019s L.Rev. 1, 4-6 (1974). <em>See </em>Note, 29 Stan.L.Rev. 969, 985 &amp; n. 57 (1977) (citing several studies); <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>389 Mich. 155, 217-229 &amp; n. 42, 205 N.W.2d 461, 493-494 &amp; n. 42 (1973) (citing psychological studies).<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Indeed, a <em>negative </em>correlation sometimes exists between a witness\u2019 confidence and the accuracy of the identification.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-12\">At the same time, if we are to rely upon the certainty of the witnesses, it is crucial to keep in mind that the witnesses were also positive about a number of aspects of their testimony that directly conflict with their identifications. <em>See </em>Part III <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-13\">3. Timing and location of the showup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-14\">The majority also notes that the showup took place \u201cwithin two or three minutes after the robbery, at the scene of the crime.\u201d Maj. op. at 1166. That the show-up took place \u201cat the scene of the crime,\u201d hardly a neutral location, does little to support its reliability.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> On the other hand, this court has justifiably cautioned against delays of several hours in arranging show-ups.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In contrast, the showup in this case took place unusually promptly. But the exceptional speed in arranging the showup was not without drawbacks. In their haste the police failed to secure descriptions from the witnesses prior to the showup.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Also, \u201ctwo or three minutes after a robbery,\u201d those present at a crime undoubtedly remain under a good deal of stress and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>therefore <em>less </em>reliable as witnesses.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> For instance, one of the counterwomen, Ms. Allen, could make no identification<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> despite having seen the man with the shotgun<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> because she was still so \u201cscared.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\">D. <em>Evaluating the Showup</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-5\">The conduct of the police in this case needlessly and seriously aggravated an already inherently suggestive identification procedure. At the same time, the indicators of reliability of the showup seem relatively minor. On balance, in my view, the record substantiates a showup so suggestive that it posed a very substantial likelihood of misidentification. Testimony based on it should have been excluded on due process grounds. <em>See Neil v. Biggers, supra, </em>409 U.S. at 198, 93 S.Ct. at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-6\">At the very least, I do not see how the showup identifications can suffice to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, the majority is willing to give the jury a free hand in such cases.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> <em>See </em>maj. op. at 1166. Yet a number of authoritative studies have concluded that juries are unduly receptive to such evidence. <em>See, e.g., </em>E. Loftus, <em>supra, </em>at 8-19; P. Wall, <em>supra, </em>at 19-23; G. Williams, The Proof of Guilt 119-120 (3d ed. 1963); Hammelman &amp; Williams, <em>Identification Parades </em>\u2014 II, Crim L.Rev. 545, 550 (1963). Experimental studies starkly support this proposition.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-13\">The serious hazards of eyewitness identifications can clearly justify intervention by a trial judge. The Supreme Court has cautioned that \u201c \u2018[t]he influence of improper suggestion upon identifying witnesses probably accounts for more miscarriages of justice than any other single factor \u2014 perhaps it is responsible for more such errors than all other factors combined.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 229, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1933, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967) <em>(quoting </em>P. Wall, <em>supra, </em>at 26). <em>See, e.g., Jackson v. Fogg, </em>589 F.2d 108, 112 (2d Cir.1978) (Lum-bard, J.) (\u201cCenturies of experience in the administration of criminal justice have shown that convictions based solely on testimony that identifies a defendant previously unknown to the witness is highly suspect.\u201d); F. Frankfurter, The Case of Sacco and Vanzetti 30 (1972) (\u201cThe identification of strangers is proverbially untrustworthy. The hazards of such testimony are established by a formidable number of instances in the records of' English and American trials.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-14\">The District Court concluded that this ease presented \u201ca clear-cut example of the dangerous potential of the one-man \u2018show-up\u2019 for tragic misidentification.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> I agree. Based on the infirmities of the showup alone, the District Court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>III. Independent Testimony from the Identifying Witnesses Undermines the Showup Identifications</p>\n<p id=\"Aqf\">According to the District Court, the showup identifications were \u201cflatly contradicted by the independent recollections of the [identifying] witnesses * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The majority admits the presence of \u201cincongruence in the testimony of the witnesses.\u201d Maj. op. at 1166. <em>Accord id. </em>(conceding \u201cvariations, to be sure\u201d in witness\u2019 testimony). Nonetheless, the majority finds such discrepancies only natural given the lapse of time before trial, noting that it would be \u201c \u2018a rare case indeed if all the testimony of the prosecution were in perfect harmony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1166 <em>(quoting Gov\u2019t of the Virgin Islands v. Petersen, </em>507 F.2d 898, 901 (3d Cir.1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">In my opinion, key testimony in this case did not merely fail to harmonize; it was resoundingly dissonant. In particular, in describing the clothing and facial appearance of the man with the shotgun (supposedly Mr. Singleton), the identifying witness\u2019 testimony diverges dramatically from Mr. Singleton\u2019s appearance the night of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">With respect to clothing, Ms. Hardy testified that the man with the shotgun wore a long-sleeved \u201cPeterson\u201d jacket buttoned around the wrists<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> and blue jean pants.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> According to Ms. Taylor, the same robber wore an old, faded blue jean jacket with hook buttons and long sleeves rolled down.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The third identifying witness, Ms. Baptist,</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-17\">had no recollection of what the robber with the shotgun wore.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> <em>In contrast to the descriptions, </em>Government Exhibit No. 4 \u2014 a color photograph taken during processing at headquarters \u2014 depicts Mr. Singleton as he actually appeared when arrested. On that night the defendant wore a black zippered shirt-jacket that had <em>short </em>sleeves cut off above the elbow in a conspicuously jagged manner.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> The photo also shows Singleton in a pair of light tan trousers.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Thus Mr. Singleton\u2019s clothing in all respects contradicts the witness\u2019 descriptions. Indeed, when shown the photograph, Ms. Taylor testified that she was \u201cpositive\u201d that the man who held the shotgun did <em>not </em>have on Mr. Singleton\u2019s clothes.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-18\">As for facial appearance, Ms. Baptist was \u201cpretty sure\u201d that the robber with the shotgun did not have a beard, though she was unsure about the presence of a mustache.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> His hair was a \u201csmall\u201d close-cut afro.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Ms. Taylor thought the man might have had a mustache, but she <em>\u201cknew </em>he didn\u2019t have a beard. * * * His face looked kind of clean.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> She remembered the robber\u2019s hair as \u201cbushy,\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> although she recalled that the robber also wore an orange knitted cap on his head.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Ms. Hardy had little recollection of the robber\u2019s facial appearance,<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> but she thought the individual had a goatee,<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> \u201ca little bit of hair on the chin.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> In reality, Government Exhibit No. 4 shows Singleton with a <em>beard </em>and mustache and very bushy though receding hair, without any cap.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>Other inconsistencies in the witnesses\u2019 testimony abound.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> The key point, however, is that the witnesses\u2019 independent descriptions of the robber conflict directly with Mr. Singleton\u2019s actual clothing and facial appearance on the night of the robbery. Under these circumstances, any jury surely must entertain a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-5\">Thus, I initially part company with the majority because of its failure to accord consideration to the District Court\u2019s assessment of the evidence as required by the <em>en banc </em>court in this case. Nonetheless, even under its own approach, the majority in my judgment seriously errs. The showup conducted in this case cannot suffice to support a criminal conviction; indeed, it violated due process. When, in addition, the identifying witnesses testify in a manner that contradicts their showup identifications, any reasonable jury surely must entertain a reasonable doubt if that term is to have any meaningful content.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">I therefore respectfully dissent in No. 81-1810.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1236-17\">.

In illustrating this point, the Court referred to two cases that hold that the Government can appeal post-verdict judgments of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence. <em>See United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 130, 101 S.Ct. 426, 433, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1980) (citing <em>United States v. Rojas, </em>554 F.2d 938, 941 (9th Cir.1977), and <em>United States v. De Garces, </em>518 F.2d 1156, 1159 (2d Cir.1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">The dissent suggests that <em>DiFrancesco </em>lends no support to our holding that jurisdiction exists in this case because it involved Government appeal of <em>sentences, </em>and the Court there went to great lengths to distinguish acquittals from sentences. <em>See </em>dissenting opinion (dis. op.) at 1172 n. 8. All of the cases relied upon by the Supreme Court in making this distinction, however, were cases where a successful appeal would have necessitated a second trial. <em>See, e.g., Fong Foo v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 141, 82 S.Ct. 671, 671, 7 L.Ed.2d 629 (1962); <em>Kepner v. United States, </em>195 U.S. 100, 24 S.Ct. 797, 49 L.Ed. 114 (1904). A careful reading of <em>DiFrancesco </em>and other recent Supreme Court cases in the Double Jeopardy area reveals that the Court\u2019s primary concern lies with denying the Government successive opportunities to convict a defendant. <em>See, e.g., DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 132, 101 S.Ct. at 434 (\u201c[T]he prohibition against multiple trials is the \u2018controlling constitutional principle.\u2019 \u201d); <em>id. </em>at 136, 101 S.Ct. at 437 (\u201cThe double jeopardy considerations that bar reprosecution after an acquittal do not prohibit review of a sentence.... [T|he basic design of the double jeopardy provision ... is[ ] as a bar against repeated attempts to convict .... \u201d). <em>See also United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 90, 91, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2193, 2194, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978); <em>United States v.

Just as these considerations have \u201cno significant application\u201d in the context of appellate review of a sentence, <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. at 136, 101 S.Ct. at 437, they are inapplicable in the instant circumstances where, as noted <em>infra </em>in text, the jury verdict can be reinstated upon remand and there is no threat of the type of governmental oppression against which the Double Jeopardy Clause is designed to protect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">.

These cases, both involving defendants who had left the District of Columbia, suggest that the defendant\u2019s intent is irrelevant in determining whether he has fled justice. \u201cThe question is not whether [the defendant] remained out of the District for any particular reason, or at all; it is enough that he did not remain ... within the District.\u201d <em>Green, </em>188 F.2d at 48 (quoting <em>McGowen, </em>105 F.2d at 792). In this case, the Government has offered no proof that appellee left the jurisdiction.

However, the Court has never addressed the appealability of acquittals resting on an evaluation of the evidence. <em>But see </em>15 C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E.

One-third of the jurors were given only this evidence; only 18% of these jurors judged the defendant guilty. Another group of 50 jurors received an additional piece of prosecution evidence. They were told that a clerk testified that he had seen the defendant shoot the two victims, although defense counsel claimed he was mistaken. Of these jurors, 72% voted for conviction. A third version of the case was given to another 50 jurors. They were told of the clerk\u2019s testimony but were informed that the defense had discredited him by showing that he had not been wearing his glasses at the time and, since he had uncorrected vision poorer than 20/400, he could not possibly have seen the face of the robber from where he stood.
