The complaint alleged that defendants Evan, Schnertre,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the \u201cCity of New York, Kings County\u201d and the State of New York violated his and his children\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sixth and fourteenth amendment rights of access to the courts, due process and equal protection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Asserting a violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976), the complaint alleges that Evan and Schnertre, clerks of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Kings County, refused to accept applications for a writ of habeas corpus, for a restraining order, for an order to show cause, and for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>which others sought to file on his behalf. Le Grand\u2019s proposed state court action sought to compel various state officials to disclose the whereabouts of his children and to allow them to visit him in prison. In his present complaint, he further alleges that Evan and Schnertre did not state any \u201clegal\u201d reasons for their refusal and that they acted in bad faith and with malice because they knew Le Grand was a convicted murderer and had filed other <em>pro se </em>applications in both state and federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">Attached to the complaint was an affidavit stating that defendants Evan, Schner-tre, and the Attorney General of the State of New York had been served copies of the complaint on April 27, 1981. Although no document formally labeled a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>was appended, accompanying the complaint was a form affidavit signed by Le Grand establishing <em>in forma pauperis </em>status. The various papers were filed on April 27, 1981, without payment of fees or a determination of <em>in forma pauperis </em>status. No summonses were issued and the court did not direct service of process on the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">The Attorney General, on behalf of defendants Evan, Schnertre, and the State, moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, lack of personal jurisdiction over Evan and Schnertre, and the immunity of the State of New York from suit. An affidavit submitted in support of the motion disclaimed the existence of any court clerk named \u201cSoal Schenrtre\u201d and stated that Evan was on military duty on the date of the purported personal service. Attached were Evan\u2019s orders from the Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">In response, Le Grand moved to amend his complaint to substitute the name \u201cJohn Doe\u201d for Soal Schnertre until he could ascertain the identity of the other clerk, to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and to direct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>federal marshal to serve process on the defendants. He also submitted affidavits from two persons who had sought to obtain summonses from the Eastern District <em>pro se </em>clerk on his behalf but were informed that the court would direct service of process. These papers were received by the Eastern District Clerk on May 27, 1981, but were not filed until May 29, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">On May 29, 1981, Judge Mishler granted the state\u2019s motion and dismissed Le Grand\u2019s complaint without a statement of reasons. He never ruled on the requests for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and to direct service of process. He did deny Le Grand\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint on September 9, 1981, three months after entry of the dismissal. Le Grand appealed the dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Dismissal as to defendant Schnertre, the City of New York, and the State of New York was proper. By virtue of the eleventh amendment, the State of New York is immune from a suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 without its consent. <em>Quern v. Jordan, </em>440 U.S. 332, 341-45, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 1145-47, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979); <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 662-63, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1355, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), which it has not given. <em>See Leonhard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>633 F.2d 599, 621 (2d Cir. 1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 908, 101 S.Ct. 1975, 68 L.Ed.2d 295 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The complaint also failed to state a claim against the City of New York because the alleged acts of court clerks employed by the Supreme Court, a state entity, cannot constitute the implementation of an \u201cofficial policy\u201d of the city. <em>See Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>Leonhard, </em>633 F.2d at 621-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Dismissal of the complaint against Schnertre was also proper since he appears at this time not to exist. However, Le Grand\u2019s motion to amend by naming a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d clerk as defendant until the true name could be determined should have been granted. The district court may have believed that Le Grand\u2019s motion was submitted after dismissal of the complaint since the motion to amend was not filed until May 29 and not docketed until June 5. However, the motion was actually received by the clerk\u2019s office on May 27, prior to service of a responsive pleading and to dismissal of the complaint. It should, therefore, have been granted as a matter of right. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Dismissal of the complaint as to Evan on the grounds of improper service was also erroneous. While Le Grand\u2019s intent to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>might have been inferred from the affidavit attached to his complaint, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), his presentation of a formal motion two days before the dismissal of his complaint was certainly sufficient evidence of that intention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Until that motion was determined, it was neither Le Grand\u2019s duty nor his right to serve the summons and complaint. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(c) (1976) provides \u201cThe officers of. the court shall issue and serve all process, and perform all duties in such cases.\u201d The affidavits submitted by Le Grand demonstrate that the Eastern District <em>pro se </em>clerk told his representatives that Judge Mishler would determine whether a summons would issue. Since Le Grand can\u2019t be required to serve a summons that the clerk had not yet issued, his suit was not subject to dismissal for improper service.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Since it is the practice of the Eastern District to determine whether a complaint is \u201cfrivolous or malicious\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) (1976) before issuance of a summons, Le Grand\u2019s complaint may have been dismissed on those grounds. If so, that would also be error, since Le Grand\u2019s allegations against Evan (and against \u201cJohn Doe\u201d) were sufficient to withstand pre-ser-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>vice dismissal under the \u201cfrivolous or malicious\u201d standard. Considering its allegations as truthful, <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Beto, </em>405 U.S. 319, 322, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 1081, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972), Le Grand\u2019s complaint alleges enough to raise a colorable claim that Evan deprived him of federal rights while acting under color of state law, <em>Gomez v. Toledo, </em>446 U.S. 635, 640, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980). The refusal of a clerk of a court to accept the papers of a litigant seeking to commence an action under a state statute may deprive that litigant of federal constitutional rights. <em>See Henriksen v. Bentley, </em>644 F.2d 852, 854 (10th Cir. 1981); <em>Williams v. Wood, </em>612 F.2d 982, 984-86 (5th Cir.1980); <em>McCray v. Maryland, </em>456 F.2d 1, 6 (4th Cir.1972); <em>Marty\u2019s Adult World of New Britain v. Guida, </em>453 F.Supp. 810, 817 (D.Conn.1978) (Daly, J.). Although we have not passed on the issue, many courts have accorded clerks only a qualified \u201cgood faith\u201d immunity from liability arising from ministerial acts. <em>See Gutierrez v. Vergari, </em>499 F.Supp. 1040,1047 n. 5 (S.D.N. Y.1980) (Ward, J.). <em>See also Henriksen, </em>644 F.2d at 856; <em>Marty's Adult World of New Britain, </em>453 F.Supp. at 816; <em>but see Morrison v. Jones, </em>607 F.2d 1269, 1273 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 962, 100 S.Ct. 1648, 64 L.Ed.2d 237 (1980). Whether the immunity of clerks is so limited need not be resolved at this stage since we need determine only that the allegations raise a non-frivolous issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the case remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-9\">. Schnertre\u2019s last name is spelled variously in the record as \u201cSchenrte,\u201d \u201cSchenrtre,\u201d \u201cSchen-tre,\u201d and \u201cSchnertre.\u201d We choose the last spelling only for purposes of internal consistency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-11\">. Le Grand filed the complaint on behalf of himself and his minor children Torcilious and Yarkalayan Le Grand. Whether Le Grand should be permitted to represent his children pro <em>se </em>is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-16\">. The complaint, written on a \u00a7 1983 <em>pro se </em>form, contains few factual details of his claims. However, details were provided in a \u201cmemorandum of law\u201d submitted with the complaint. In view of the canon that a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s papers should be liberally construed, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), and the \u00a7 1983 <em>pro se </em>form complaint\u2019s direction that the plaintiff attach necessary additional sheets, we read the complaint to adopt the factual allegations in the memorandum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\">. The motions and responsive papers filed by Le Grand on May 27, 1981, were timely filed if they were to be treated as opposition papers to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, which had a retum date of May 29, 1981. E.D.N.Y. Local Rule 9(c)(3) (opposition papers must be filed before noon of the day preceding the return date).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
