Aaron Wesley Wyatt seeks restitution of $100,000 allegedly loaned or advanced to Silverstein and Beilin LLC (S&amp;B). Wyatt also seeks restitution of a success fee in the amount of $695,000 that S&amp;B allegedly failed to earn. By counterclaim, Ira Silverstein and S&amp;B assert that the $100,000 constituted neither a loan nor an advance, but a paid fee for legal services. Silverstein and S&amp;B also assert that S&amp;B earned and properly collected the $695,000 success fee when Wyatt sold his interests in Pilot Air Freight to Richard Phillips, a business partner. Finally, Silverstein and S&amp;B claim that Wyatt owes S&amp;B $389,615 for legal services rendered from February 1,2003 to January 19, 2004, under a quantum meruit theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"Ayc\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">(1) Silverstein is an attorney licensed to practice in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

This amount reflects services rendered in connection with the Phillips litigation ($389,377.5); plus the Grant Thornton litigation ($26,735); plus the Schnader, Harrison, Segal &amp; Lewis litigation ($41,497.5); plus the John Edwards litigation ($23,667.5); plus the Kearns estate and KPMG litigation ($8,340); minus the retainer payments from February 1,2003 to January 19, 2004 ($213,200); minus the one-time fee of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">(61) The court finds in favor of defendants/counterclaim plaintiffs Sovereign and S&amp;B in the amount of $169,617.50, and against plaintiff/counterclaim defendant Aaron Wesley Wyatt.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">And now, January 11,2007, after trial upon stipulated facts, upon consideration of the record, and in accordance with the findings of fact and conclusions of law issued contemporaneously herewith, it is ordered that plaintiff/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>counterclaim defendant Aaron Wesley Wyatt shall pay damages to defendants/counterclaim plaintiffs Ira Silverstein and Silverstein &amp; Beilin LLC in the amount of $169,617.50.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\">.Amended statements of stipulated facts, \u00b61.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-12\">. <em>Id. at%2.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b510-13\">. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b510-14\">. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b510-15\">. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b510-16\">. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b510-17\">. <em>Wyatt v.
