Beennan, Je., J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao\">Plaintiff sued in the Camden County District Court to recover rents under written leases, one for an apartment and another for a garage, which were vacated by defendant before the end of the term. The defense was willful fraud. The trial judge found that fraud had been proved and entered judgment for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">The fraud charged consisted in alleged willfully fraudulent misrepresentations by one Ecklund, plaintiff\u2019s superintendent, on two occasions prior to defendant\u2019s execution and delivery of the leases and once thereafter before he took possession, \u201cthat it was the policy of the company to forfeit a month\u2019s deposit in case a tenant had to move before the end of the term and nothing more would be required of him\u201d; \u201cthat the term of the lease is nothing to worry about.\u201d Defendant, an electronics engineer and a college graduate, read the leases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>before executing them and vas avaro, that each provided a term beginning January 15, 1949, and ending December 31, 1951. He deposited one month\u2019s rent as security, applicable, according to a provision in each lease, except in case of default, to the last month\u2019s rental. He vacated in September, 1950. His testimony vas that he signed the leases in reliance upon Ecklund\u2019s alleged representations, after telling Ecklund at the times mentioned that he could not sign three-year leases because he vas uncertain of his tenure in the position he then held and might change his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Ecklund denied the making of the alleged representations or that there had been discussed at any time the contingency that defendant might change his employment. He and plaintiff\u2019s president testified that vhen applicants vere reluctant to sign three-year leases for such reasons it vas the practice for Ecklund to make an appropriate note upon the lease application and for plaintiff then to consider each case and if satisfied of its merit to attach riders to the three-year leases specifying the conditions upon vhich they vere terminable before their expiration date. Defendant\u2019s application is in evidence and bears no such notation.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The judgment must be reversed. Defendant signed the leases vith knovledge that their specific provisions bound him until December 31, 1951. The alleged oral misrepresentations, being contradictory of the undertakings expressly dealt vith by the vritings, are not effectual in that circumstance to avoid the obligations he knovingly assumed. \u201cThe general rule is clear that a parol agreement vhich is in terms contradictory of the express vords of a contemporaneous or subsequent vritten contract, properly interpreted, necessarily is ineffectual and evidence of it inadmissible, vhether the parol agreement be called collateral or not.\u201d <em>Williston, Contracts (Rev. ed. </em>1936), <em>sec. </em>639; <em>Restatement, Contracts </em>(1932), <em>vol. </em>1, <em>sec. </em>231. Men are usually bound by the import of documents signed by them and vhich they had the ability and opportunity to read. See <em>Commercial Credit Corp. v. Coover, </em>101 <em>N. J. L. </em>530 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1925) ; <em>Williams v. Leisen, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>72 <em>N. J. L. </em>410 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1905); <em>Peter </em>W. <em>Kero, Inc., v. Terminal Construction Corp., </em>6 <em>N. J. </em>361 (1951). Notable exceptions are when the signature is obtained by fraud or imposition in-the execution of the contract, as by reason of a willful misrepresentation .as to its purport or contents; <em>McDonald v. Central R. R. Co., </em>89 <em>N. J. L. </em>251 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1916); <em>Peter W. Kero, Inc., v. Terminal Construction Corp., supra; Alexander v. Brogley, </em>63 <em>N. J. L. </em>307 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1899), <em>Dunston Lithograph Co. v. Borgo, </em>84 <em>N. J. L. </em>623 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1913); <em>Christie v. </em>Lalor, 116 <em>N. J. L. </em>23 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1935); and when the fraudulent misrepresentation inducing the signature is as to a thing not dealt with at all in the agreement. <em>Schlossman\u2019s v. Niewinski, </em>12 <em>N. J. Super. </em>500 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The general rule controls in this case. Defendant knew when he signed the leases that the specific written obligations he assumed under them bound him until December 31, 1951. Although the testimony as to the alleged oral misrepresentations was received without objection from plaintiff, and the question of the propriety of its admission will not be considered on appeal, <em>Slovak Catholic Sokol v. </em>Foti, 13 <em>N. J. Super. </em>458 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), this testimony was insufficient in law to relieve defendant of rental obligations he knew were imposed by the express terms of the leases when he signed them. The rule that a specific undertaking in a written agreement is not .to be varied or contradicted by parol is a rule of substantive law and not of evidence merely. See <em>Downs v. Jersey Central Power Light Co., </em>117 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>138 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1934)., affirming 115 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>348 <em>(Ch. </em>1934); 9 <em>Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. </em>1940), <em>secs. </em>2400 <em>et seq., cf. Marcus &lt;&amp; Co., Inc., v. KLG Baking Co., Inc., </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>202 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1939); <em>Adams v. Camden Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>389 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1938) .</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The parties stipulated that if plaintiff was entitled to a judgment it should be in the sum of $540. The judgment is reversed and remanded with direction to enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $540.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
