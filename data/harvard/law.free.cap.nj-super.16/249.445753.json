Kulinka v. Flockhart Foundry Co., </em>9 <em>N. J. Super. </em>495 <em>(Cty. Ct. </em>1950), except in two particulars. The statement that \u201cIt is conceivable that his foot may have struck the edge of the closed portion of the side of the cab, when he attempted to swing his leg over the rail\u201d is unnecessary. Under the facts found by the County Court, the- petitioner proved an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment without any need, under the circumstances, to prove that the loss of balance which brought about his fall from his hazardous perch was caused by any particular movement. <em>Cf. Jochim v. Montrose Chemical Co., 3 N. J. </em>5 (1949); <em>Reynolds v. Passaic Valley Sewerage Commrs., </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>437 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943), affirmed 131 <em>N. J. L. </em>327 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1944). In the conclusion that \u201cthe respondent has not excluded the particular hazards of Kulinka\u2019s employment task as a possible cause or contributory or concurring cause of his fall\u201d the words \u201cpossible cause\u201d should be \u201cprobable cause.\u201d We think the use of the word \u201cpossible\u201d instead of \u201cprobable\u201d was inadvertent, but in any event our examination of the record leads us to\u2019 concur in the conclusion as corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
