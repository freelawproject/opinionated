On the authority of that decision, we affirm the conviction of the defendant for having a loaded firearm under his control in an automobile in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">There was evidence that on April 19, 1975, two police officers stopped a car in which the defendant was a passenger, and that the defendant reached into his waistband, pulled out a loaded revolver, and put it under the seat. The defendant testified, but there was no evidence with respect to a license. The judge instructed the jury substantially in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the language of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 7, adding, \u201cA presumption is a rule of law which compels you to reach a certain conclusion in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d The defendant was convicted and sentenced to one year in a house of correction, and he appealed pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G. Execution of the sentence was stayed pending appeal of the <em>Jones </em>case, and we transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the ground that G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 7, is unconstitutional was properly denied. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra. </em>The charge to the jury may have been confusing, since no issue with respect to a license was before the jury and there was no need for them to reach any conclusion on any such issue. But there was no error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
