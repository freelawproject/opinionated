Szklarz was robbed and killed. Farland was tried first. When the trial was well under way he pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree and armed robbery. Sentencing on the armed robbery was deferred. Farland agreed to give testimony in the forthcoming trial of the present defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When called as a prosecution witness in that trial, Farland answered some of the prosecutor\u2019s questions but refused answers to a number of others, claiming a privilege against self-incrimination. The jury found the defendant guilty of the crimes as charged. On his present appeals pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7\u00a7 33A-33G, from the judgments of conviction, the defendant argues two assignments, both in effect claiming error in the judge\u2019s denial of a motion to declare a mistrial when Farland left the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">There would be agreement about some general propositions. When a witness in a criminal case refuses to answer questions on the ground of self-incrimination, lay triers may readily, although improperly, make invidious inferences associating the witness with the defendant in all illegal enterprise;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the prejudice to the defendant may be especially hard to remove because he cannot cross-examine the witness as to \u201ctestimony\u201d which is in the form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>of a kind of riddling silence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, as has been observed, convictions are not vulnerable to reversal in all cases where witnesses assert Fifth Amendment privileges in the face of a jury. There are two general occasions for reversal. It may be called for when there is definite prosecutorial misconduct \u2014 questioning of a material witness in order to provoke a claim of privilege with a deliberate design to raise those improper inferences in the minds of the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, quite apart from misconduct of the prosecutor, there is reversible error when the impression made on the jurors by the witness\u2019s demurral is thought to add the \u201ccritical weight\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that brings about the verdict of guilty. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>361 Mass. 720, 722 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Granito, </em>326 Mass. 494, 497-499 (1950); <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 733-737 (1969); <em>Namet </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 179, 185-191 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Attempting to relate the present case to the foregoing propositions, we first summarize the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses including Farland (the defense rested without offering any witnesses). We then dwell on the prosecutor\u2019s conduct with respect to Farland. Finally we make our appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">1. On July 21, 1974, a Sunday, about 11:30 A.M., the victim Szklarz, who had been serving as a sexton at mass at Ascension Church, No. 40 Vernon Street, was walking toward the rectory, located next to the church, carrying two bags which contained the collections made at the service. A sound was heard, like that of a firecracker; the victim threw up his hands and fell. In an instant a male figure, emerging from the side of the church and running toward the victim, picked up one of the bags lying on the ground, crossed Vernon Street to No. 39, and ran on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>path by the side of that house leading to the side stairs. There he was lost to view.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Police, quickly summoned by another sexton who had seen the happening, arrived in a minute\u2019s time. The victim was dead of a wound originating in his left upper chest caused by a .22 caliber projectile which, as later appeared, could have been fired from No. 39, at a distance of about eighty-three feet.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The involvement of the defendant and Farland was shown by the converging testimony of a number of witnesses. The defendant with his wife and three children occupied the first floor of No. 39, a \u201cthree-decker.\u201d On the night of July 20, Farland had called the defendant at the latter\u2019s request, and agreed to come to the defendant\u2019s apartment the next morning at 8 a.m. (The two worked at the same plant and had been friendly.) Farland testified that he drove his car next morning to Pattison Street near Vernon Street, parked it, and appeared at the defendant\u2019s apartment as agreed. He spent some time with the defendant and his wife, and about 10 a.m. entered the church, inquired of a sexton about the time of mass, and returned to the defendant\u2019s apartment with a copy of the church bulletin. Later he left the apartment. Around this time a woman from the third floor of No. 39 saw Farland, whom she knew, engaged \u2014 strangely, she thought \u2014 in chopping some branches from a tree in front of No. 39 (and so in a line of sight from the first-floor front bedroom to the vicinity of the church across the way).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">After the gunshot and the flight of the robber, the defendant came out of No. 39, approached the victim\u2019s body, and then turned back to No. 39, where he encountered Robert Pardee, occupant of the second floor. The defendant remarked that \u201cwhoever did shoot him was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>pretty good shot because he shot him once right through the heart.\u201d Pardee reminded the defendant of a conversation they had had the previous November when Pardee was out of work and needed money. According to Pardee, the defendant (in the presence of their wives) had suggested that it would be an easy matter for someone to shoot the sexton on his regular Sunday walk to the rectory, with a confederate picking up the collection bag. The defendant now answered Pardee that he wouldn\u2019t try anything like that.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Around 12:30 p.m. the defendant with his wife left No. 39 and drove to the house of Mrs. Barbara Lizotte. There they picked up Mrs. Lizotte and her two children, together with their own three children who had been with Mrs. Lizotte, and all proceeded to Boston. After a visit with a friend of Mrs. Lizotte at a hospital, they went to the Franklin Park zoo. On the return to Worcester starting at 4:30 p.m., the defendant said reflectively to his wife in the hearing of Mrs. Lizotte that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean to kill the guy.\u201d Mrs. Martin said, \u201cYou... Peter. Now she knows, too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In the early evening, the police spoke to the defendant at No. 39. The defendant said he knew Farland. He had last seen Farland leaving No. 39 about 9 a.m. The police had reason to believe that the latter statement was a lie.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Farland was surprised by police at his parked car, taken to the detective bureau sometime after 7:30 p.m., and later that night gave a statement which enabled the police to procure a warrant for search of the defendant\u2019s premises. In the search about 1 a.m., July 22, the police found and took from the apartment the bag and contents stolen from the victim; two rifles, one of these a .22 caliber Winchester model 190 semi-automatic; live cartridges fitting the .22 rifle;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a \u201cscope\u201d apparently fitting the .22 rifle; and a shirt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>blue jeans, and tennis shoes that could match Farland\u2019s description of the clothes he was wearing that morning. Tests carried out later by the police indicated that the spent .22 projectile taken from the victim\u2019s body could have been fired from the .22 rifle, though there was not sufficient basis for a positive opinion that it had been so fired.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">2. In his opening speech to the jury, to which no objection was taken,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the prosecutor indicated that Farland\u2019s contribution as a witness would be to admit that he was the man who seized the collection bag, and otherwise to fill in the actions and observations from his side. Thus \u2014 omitting mention of matters on which evidence was actually received at trial, as summarized above\u2014 Farland was expected to testify: At the defendant\u2019s apartment on the morning of July 21, there was talk (with the defendant\u2019s wife present throughout) of the defendant\u2019s shooting the sexton. The defendant loaded the .22 rifle. He gave Far-land a hatchet and sent him out to remove branches in order to clear the view. Farland\u2019s instructions were to rim after the pickup to No. 39 and throw the bag into the defendant\u2019s apartment through the side door that would be kept open; to go to the cellar where he would change his shirt, and remove the mascara with which he would be earlier provided; and to remain there until signalled. This plan was substantially carried out. When Farland came upstairs after the signal,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> he saw the defendant clean the rifle and there was discussion of how the money would be split. Farland was further to change his clothes and to stay in the apartment while the defendant and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>wife went to Boston. (It appears that Farland in fact did not leave the apartment until the evening. The encounter at his parked car and his later statement to the police have been noted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">So much for the prosecutor\u2019s statement. Called as the sixth of the prosecution\u2019s nineteen witnesses, Farland testified in general terms up to the point where he gave the defendant the church bulletin. Asked whether he left No. 39 sometime later, Farland said, \u201cFifth Amendment.\u201d The jury being withdrawn, the judge reminded Farland that he had pleaded guilty and agreed to testify. At first Farland said he realized after his plea that he had not acted voluntarily, that his attorney had been overbearing; but in the later colloquy he receded from this explanation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The judge sent for Farland\u2019s counsel and said he thought Farland had no privilege. The defendant\u2019s counsel broke in to suggest that the prosecution could represent that no further proceedings would be brought against Farland based on the Ascension Church episode, which would, presumably, assure the elimination of any privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Continuing discussion with the judge, Farland freely admitted he had been \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of the scheme to rob the church, but he was not clear \u2014 did not exactly remember\u2014 could not say \u2014 who killed the sexton; probably it was the defendant, probably the defendant\u2019s wife, probably someone else. Farland was now told that he need only testify to his own best recollection. The prosecutor added his blanket promise that Farland would not be further prosecuted. On his counsel\u2019s statement that the only way he could get into trouble would be to lie from the witness stand, Farland indicated he would testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">But after further conference with Farland, his counsel returned to say that he didn\u2019t really know what Farland would do. It had occurred to counsel that, in the face of the statute providing a fixed procedure for granting immunity to witnesses (see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20F), the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>tor might not be empowered otherwise to agree effectively not to prosecute. Although as a practical matter Farland had better testify, counsel thought he might have a technical privilege; possibly he could still be charged with conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Counsel conferred again with Farland and reported giving him this \u201cpractical\u201d and \u201ctechnical\u201d advice. According to counsel, Farland now felt he didn\u2019t want to testify. The judge said he would inform Farland he had no privilege and order him to answer proper questions. When the prosecutor said he would continue with Farland, Farland\u2019s counsel said that was \u201cgood news.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Recalled to the stand (the defense did not object at the time), Farland repeated his claim of privilege as to the question whether he left No. 39 that day. The judge in this and subsequent instances ordered Farland to answer. Farland similarly refused an answer to the question whether he recognized an exhibit picturing an area in front of No. 39. Defense counsel then interposed to suggest that, to avoid prejudice, the witness be excused, or the prosecutor move to a different line. The prosecutor said he would put just a few more questions. Farland answered some five questions about having talked to the prosecutor and the police. He then asserted privilege on the questions where he was located when he first talked to the police on the evening of July 21; whether he had given a signed statement; whether he had pleaded guilty. When the prosecutor asked how long Farland talked with the police at their first encounter, defense counsel objected, whereupon the prosecutor indicated he was concluding with the witness. He asked whether Farland had made a tape that night, and on eliciting a refusal, closed the interrogation. Defense counsel said he had no questions and moved for a mistrial, which was refused. The judge immediately instructed the jury that in deciding the guilt or innocence of the defendant they were to put out of consideration the witness\u2019s claims of privilege and refusals to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">3. Of course the prosecutor was acting in good faith when, in his opening speech, he gave the jury a pr\u00e9cis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the testimony to be expected from Farland, for he had Farland\u2019s agreement to testify. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>346 Mass. 482, 486 (1963); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Clark, 292 Mass. 409, 410 (1935) (\u201cAs a general rule, counsel is free to state in his opening anything that he expects to be able to prove by evidence\u201d). Farland\u2019s claim of privilege came without warning after he had given consecutive testimony.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The prosecutor did not attempt to persist in his questioning.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the seesawing conversations out of the jury\u2019s hearing, it was first assumed by all that Farland had no privilege, at least if the prosecutor should promise, as he proceeded to do, that he would forbear any further prosecution. At this point Farland seemed prepared to testify to his best recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">After Farland\u2019s counsel introduced the thought that Farland\u2019s immunity might not be complete,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it remained doubtful what Farland would do: he might take his counsel\u2019s practical rather than technical advice. When Far-land\u2019s counsel said that the procecutor\u2019s decision to recall Farland was \u201cgood news,\u201d he may well have meant that his client now would have, and might take, the opportunity to testify fully, and thus possibly better his chances on sentencing day. The factual situation sums up as one where a prosecutor need not go on an assumption that a witness, if called, will balk at testifying, but may make the test by actually calling him. See <em>Weinbaum </em>v. <em>United States, </em>184 F.2d 330 (9th Cir. 1950); <em>People </em>v. <em>Scheldt, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>182 Colo. 374, 384 (1973).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In all events it was evident that as to some matters not central to the killing, as Far-land perceived them, he would testify as he had done earlier.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The prosecutor did get answers on the periphery, but as he approached the center Farland claimed his privilege. The questioning was not insistent or extended, nor did it suggest particularized states of fact from which the jury might the more easily draw harmful inferences. Compare <em>Cota </em>v. <em>Eyman, </em>453 F.2d 691, 694 (9th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 949 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>268 Minn. 513, 520-521 (1964), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 984 (1965), with <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>332 F.2d 724, 726 (D.C. Cir. 1964); <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>State, </em>164 Tex. Crim. 448, 450-453 (1956). If the prosecutor went too far in his final questions, that distance was small and the fault venial. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKuin, </em>434 F.2d 391, 397-398 (8th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 911 (1971); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>362 F.2d 914, 916-917 (6th Cir. 1966). In his closing argument the prosecutor did not mention the witness\u2019s refusal to testify. See <em>Cota </em>v. <em>Eyman, supra </em>at 694-696; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>366 F.2d 853, 870 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Parness </em>v. <em>United States, </em>386 U.S. 919 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">As to the \u201cweight\u201d that Farland\u2019s negatives might lend improperly to the case against the defendant, we note again that the questions put, and refused answers, were not themselves \u201cfact laden\u201d;<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but then we have to recall that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement was rather de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tailed in its forecast of what Farland might say. Yet the usual asseverations had been made by counsel and the judge that the remarks of counsel were not evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It is hard to say whether the judge\u2019s ordering the witness to testify, indicating that the claim of privilege was invalid, would encourage or discourage the jurors in drawing the prohibited inferences. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DuVal, </em>453 Pa. 205, 217 (1973). In all events, the jury received promptly a cautionary instruction not to build on Far-land\u2019s claim. <em>United States </em>v. <em>McKuin, supra </em>at 398. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brickey, </em>426 F.2d 680, 688 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 828 (1970). That the entire Farland interlude did not loom large is suggested by the fact that defense counsel let the judge\u2019s final instructions pass without seeking a further curative charge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>268 Minn. 513, 520 (1964), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 984 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">But perhaps the more significant point is that the entire record makes a thoroughly convincing case against the defendant on the charges of the indictments entirely apart from any dubious aid the jury might have attempted to derive from Farland\u2019s behavior on the stand. Consider the evidence of a prior criminal conception from Pardee\u2019s testimony, of step by step execution of a plan, of possession of the means and fruits of the commission of the crime, of admission of guilt in Mrs. Lizotte\u2019s presence, and of prevarication to conceal. For affirmance of the conviction we need not find that no \u201cweight\u201d was added, although that may indeed have been the case; we need only find, as we do, that what was added could not have made the difference between acquittal and conviction. Compare <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 735 (1969); <em>Namet </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 179, 189 (1963); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brickey, </em>426 F.2d 680, 688 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 828 (1970), with <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Small, </em>371 F.2d 793, 795 (1st Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>1967); Fletcher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>332 F.2d 724, 726-727 (D.C.
