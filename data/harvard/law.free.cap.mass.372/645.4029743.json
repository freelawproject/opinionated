The appeal was entered in the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case here. G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10 (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">The sole issue presented is the validity of the trial judge\u2019s exclusion from evidence of a copy of the Directory of Medical Specialists (directory), also known as Marquis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Who\u2019s Who, Inc., which the plaintiffs sought to introduce to establish the expertise of authors of various medical treatises. We find there was no error in the exclusion, and therefore affirm the judgments for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The plaintiffs did not present evidence bearing on negligence through the testimony of expert witnesses; they rather sought to obtain such evidence by examining the defendant, and also intended to submit statements from various medical treatises or textbooks under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the statute requires \u201cthat the writer of such statements [be] recognized in his profession or calling as an expert on the subject,\u201d the plaintiffs sought to elicit from the defendant whether he was familiar with the authors of certain medical treatises and whether such authors were recognized in their field as experts. The defendant had not heard of several of the authors of the treatises; he was unwilling to express any view on the qualifications or training of those he had heard of. Thus, the plaintiffs were unable to supply directly the necessary authentication of expertise of the authors of the treatises through the testimony of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Later in the trial, the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel continued the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>direct examination of the defendant and brought to his attention a Directory of Medical Specialists, which was said to be known as Marquis Who\u2019s Who, Inc., vol. 2, dated 1963-1964. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected. After the colloquy quoted in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the judge excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>the directory. There was no offer of proof relating to the contents of the directory; it was not marked as an exhibit; and the plaintiffs did not ask the judge to make any preliminary findings of fact regarding the directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The only question before us is whether it was error to exclude the directory from which, it may be assumed, the plaintiffs sought to show that various authors of medical treatises were recognized experts and that the treatises would therefore be admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C. No question of the ultimate admissibility of the treatises is presented in this case* I**<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because the plaintiffs were unable to pass the threshold test of establishing the expertise of the authors. Nonetheless, the exclusion at issue must be considered in the context of a remedial legislative mandate (G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C) to permit the introduction of authoritative medical texts and thereby overcome the longstanding obstacle of the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>While the plaintiffs did not urge upon the trial judge any particular grounds of admissibility of the directory, in this court they contend that it should have been admitted under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79B.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 79B, inserted by St. 1947, c. 385, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201c[statements of facts of general interest to persons engaged in an occupation contained in a list, register, periodical, book or other compilation, issued to the public, shall, in the discretion of the court, if the court finds that the compilation is published for the use of persons engaged in that occupation and commonly is used and relied upon by them, be admissible in civil cases as evidence of the truth of any fact so stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">This statute appears to have been based to some extent on Rule 528 of Model Code of Evidence (1942). See Eighteenth Report of the Judicial Council (December, 1942), 28 Mass. L.Q. (No. 1) 23-24 (1943); Twenty-First Report of the Judicial Council (December, 1945), 30 Mass. L.Q. (No. 4) 56 <em>(1945); </em>Twenty-Second Report of the Judicial Council (February, 1947), 32 Mass. L.Q. (No. 1) 78-79 (1947). The Judicial Council, in its several annual reports cited above, urged passage to permit the introduction of newspaper reports of market prices, city and telephone directories and the like, to modify the rule of exclusion stated in <em>National Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>175 Mass. 257 (1900). In that case, Chief Justice Holmes, for the court, held that newspaper reports of stock quotations were inadmissible hearsay. <em>Id. </em>at 261.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Doherty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>v. <em>Harris, </em>230 Mass. 341 (1918) (\u201cThe Commercial Bulletin,\u201d a trade journal publishing prices of goods, excluded). The sketchy legislative history contained in the reports of the Judicial Council and the comment to rule 528 does not expressly mention professional directories such as the one at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The rationale for this limited exception to the hearsay rule is twofold. First, admitting commercial lists and registers is necessary because of the inaccessibility of the authors and compilers, and the practical inconvenience in summoning them. 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1702 (Chad-bourn rev. 1976). Second, the trustworthiness of such lists is assured through general reliance on them by those in a particular profession, and the consequent motivation of the compiler to foster this reliance by his accuracy. 6 J. Wigmore, <em>supra. </em>See Fed. R. Evid. 803 <em>(17); </em>4 J.B. Weinstein\u2019s Evidence, par. 803 (17) [01] <em>(1976); Note, </em>Commercial Lists, 46 Iowa L. Rev. 455 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Two of our prior cases have touched on the admissibility of a professional directory under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79B. In <em>Reddington </em>v. <em>Clay man, </em>334 Mass. 244 (1956), this court found no error in the exclusion of medical treatises offered by the plaintiff under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C. The problem in that case, as in this one, was compliance with the statutory requirement that the writer of the treatise be \u201crecognized in his profession or calling as an expert.\u201d The court first rejected the claim that biographical data in the front of the book itself could permit the judge to find this preliminary question of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 247. The court then discussed the method of proof at issue here: \u201cThe offer of the Directory of Medical Specialists and of an English edition of Who\u2019s Who (1946) to vouch the professional standing of the authors and the text was not supported by [G. L. c. 233] \u00a7 79C____There is no basis for asking the court to take judicial notice of these books____These books were not offered below under G. L____c. 233, \u00a7 79B ... so there was no opportunity for the judge to make the necessary preliminary findings under that statute that they were compilations issued to the public and published <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>for the use of persons engaged in the'particular occupation and commonly used and relied on. Such compilations conceivably might by their own statements show that they are issued to the public for a stated use, but it would appear necessary, at least in the usual case, that there be some independent evidence that they are commonly used and relied on to permit such a finding to be made\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 247-248. Several points in the discussion are relevant here. First, where the trial judge was not informed about G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79B, he could not make the findings which were the prerequisite foundation for admitting the directory. Second, independent evidence of the statutory requirements of common use and reliance was called for. Third, judicial notice was deemed inappropriate. In these circumstances, this court did not decide the admissibility of the directory under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79B.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In <em>Ramsland </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>341 Mass. 56, 63-64 (1960), the plaintiff sought to introduce excerpts from a medical treatise under \u00a7 79C, and sought to establish the necessary preliminary finding of the expertise of the author through the testimony of the city librarian of Lowell who produced a 1957 edition of \u201cWho\u2019s Who.\u201d On exception, the portions of the treatise and the \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d which were excluded were made part of an offer of proof. The trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion, excluded the treatise and the \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d excerpt.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">This court did not decide whether the \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d excerpt was admissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court commented, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>that \u201c[s]uch evidence, of course, would not be admissible at common law____Its admissibility must be found in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79B.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">It may well be that these two cases, as commentators have asserted,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>have made introduction of medical treatises difficult. Yet our past cases have not foreclosed the use of a factual compilation under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79B, as a means of establishing the authentication and expertise of medical treatises under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79C. Section 79B requires, at the minimum, persuading the trial judge to make the preliminary findings that the proposed exhibit is (1) issued to the public, (2) published for persons engaged in the applicable occupation, and (3) commonly used and relied on by such persons. See <em>Ricciutti </em>v. <em>Syl-vania Elec. Prods. Inc., </em>343 Mass. 347, 350 (1961). We think \u201ccompilation,\u201d as used in the statute, connotes simple objective facts, and not conclusions or opinions. Perhaps the most expeditious means of satisfying these requirements would be by the testimony of a physician who used and relied on the directory, but there would no doubt be other means. If the plaintiffs had satisfied these threshold requirements, the trial judge in his discretion could have admitted the directory in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Yet in this case, there was no offer of proof relating to the proffered contents of the directory, nor was it marked as an exhibit.\u00ae Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not refer to any common law or statutory basis for permitting the directory to be introduced in evidence. The plaintiffs did not inform the court of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79B, the statute on which they now claim error, nor did they assert or seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>to establish that the directory was anything other than a collection of unverified self-serving statements as suggested by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">On this state of the record, it was not error to exclude the directory. See <em>Ricciutti </em>v. <em>Sylvania Elec. Prods. Inc., supra </em>at 351; <em>Reddington </em>v. <em>dayman, supra </em>at 248. Yet we do not suggest that it would have been error to admit it. A professional directory that was the authorized publication of medical boards, which verified or certified the information contained therein, or was based on adequate investigation and authentication, would be admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79B. The matter is entrusted by statute to the discretion of the trial judge, who should consider the remedial purpose of \u00a7 79C, and who should not frustrate legitimate attempts to qualify authoritative treatises through \u00a7 79B.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The trial judge had no way of knowing whether the Directory of Medical Specialists satisfied these requirements and was provided with no basis for making preliminary findings of fact. His exclusion was not error. While the plaintiffs now argue that the trial judge should have permitted further inquiry before excluding the exhibit, the colloquy quoted above shows that the plaintiffs provided no intimation that further inquiry would have been productive.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\"> General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 79C, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 425, provides as follows: \u201cStatements of facts or opinions on a subject of science or art contained in a published treatise, periodical, book or pamphlet shall, in so far as the court shall find that the said statements are relevant and that the writer of such statements is recognized in his profession or calling as an expert on the subject, be admissible in actions of contract or tort for malpractice, error or mistake against physicians, surgeons, dentists, optometrists, hospitals and sanitaria, as evidence tending to prove said facts or as opinion evidence; provided, however, that the party intending to offer as evidence any such statements shall, not less than thirty days before the trial of the action, give the adverse party or his attorney notice of such intention, stating the name of the writer of the statements, the title of the treatise, periodical, book or pamphlet in which they are contained, the date of publication of the same, the name of the publisher of the same, and wherever possible or practicable the page or pages of the same on which the said statements appear.\u201d Discussions of the legislative history and background of the statute are found in Goldman, Malpractice Cases in Massachusetts, 40 Mass.

This directory, there is no showing as to how this directory is compiled, whether this is done by some experts, so called, or specialists in the field who pick out certain people and say these people are specialized and then I would want to know who they were and what qualifications they had to make such a \u2014 I suspect and I don\u2019t know, and this is what is bothering me, and I think I should put it in the record, that this directory is like a lot of other directories, they simply write to people in various professions or businesses, whatever it may be, like Who\u2019s Who and Who\u2019s Who in this and the other thing and people write in and they write their own ticket, so to speak. They give their own resume of what their qualifications are and so in a sense I suppose they are really self serving statements by these people.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-18\">\u201cNow, the fact they are compiled in a directory doesn\u2019t give them any greater standing than if they were just individual pieces of paper, as far as this Court can see, and that is the reason for the exclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-19\">Counsel for the plaintiffs: \u201cYour Honor, all I can say is this: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>There is no self assertion in there with regard to the individual. It is just a record of their degrees and their training, and if the Doctor was allowed to testify or be cross examined with regard to this particular area, I believe that it might be found from his testimony that he agrees that they have expertise within the particular area, and as a result if I can get such an admission from the Doctor then I believe I should be able to introduce the particular treatises which I intended to introduce last week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The judge: \u201cDo you want to say anything further?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Counsel foe the defendant: \u201cOnly that the statute clearly calls for physicians who are generally recognized by members of their profession and specialty to be authorities in their field.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">\u201cNow, the fact that another one has his name listed in a book of this sort and it says he went to Harvard College and then he went to Harvard Medical School and then he got his Board in a certain specialty doesn\u2019t satisfy me that he is recognized as an authority in this field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-11\">Counsel fob the plaintiffs: \u201cIt might satisfy the Doctor since he is also listed in the particular book.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-12\">The judge: \u201cI don\u2019t think it is proper and I am going to exclude it and your rights of course are saved.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b662-13\"> There was no offer of proof as to the treatises. Further, the plaintiffs did not ask the trial judge judicially to notice the treatises.
