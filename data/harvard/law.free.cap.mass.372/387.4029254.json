The parties submitted a statement of agreed facts which a judge of the Superior Court adopted as his findings of fact. We summarize these facts as supplemented by the record that was before us in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>367 Mass. 605 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">On September 29, 1972, the plaintiff was charged by Norfolk County indictments (the Norfolk indictments) with assault with intent to rape and rape, assault and battery, sodomy, and the commission of an unnatural and lascivious act. On October 10, 1972, he pleaded not guilty to these charges and was released on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">On January 17, 1973, the plaintiff was arrested on an entirely separate charge which led to an indictment in Suffolk County (the Suffolk indictment), apparently for committing an unnatural and lascivious act. On that day he was remanded to the Suffolk County jail in lieu of bail, and he remained there for fourteen days, until January 31,1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">From January 25 to February 1, 1973, he was tried and then found guilty by a Norfolk County jury on all four Norfolk indictments. He received sentences of from five to ten years on the rape charge, five to seven years to be served concurrently on the sodomy charge, and three to five years to be served concurrently on the unnatural and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>lascivious act charge. The assault and battery charge was filed. On February 1, 1973, the plaintiff was committed to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole and began serving these Norfolk sentences. He meanwhile appealed these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">On May 2,1974, the plaintiff was convicted on the unrelated Suffolk indictment. He was sentenced to a term of from three to five years, minus fourteen days\u2019 credit under G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A, to be served from and after the Norfolk sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">All of the Norfolk sentences were reversed on appeal. On May 16, 1974, the conviction on the rape indictment was reversed by the Appeals Court because of erroneous evidentiary rulings. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 838 (1974). On May 2, 1975, the remaining convictions were reversed by this court for evidentiary errors. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>367 Mass. 605 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">On remand the plaintiff, on June 10, 1975, pleaded guilty to the Norfolk unnatural act charge and received a suspended sentence of from three to five years and two years\u2019 probation to be served from and after the Suffolk sentence he was then serving.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">These facts have produced a whirlpool of argument about the computation of the plaintiff\u2019s sentence. The defendants have given the plaintiff credit for time served after May 2,1974, when the Suffolk sentence was imposed, and they have also given him credit for the fourteen days served prior to the imposition of the Norfolk sentence. As recomputed, the plaintiff\u2019s sentence is considered to have begun on April 18, 1974.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The plaintiff argues that G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A, and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129B,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> entitle him to credit on the Suffolk sentence for the entire period of time served since his arrest and incarceration on the Suffolk indictment, that is, from January 17, 1973, to the present. He claims that the time served under the vacated Norfolk sentences, even though prior to the imposition of the Suffolk sentence on May 2, 1974, must be credited to the Suffolk sentence. His contention is that otherwise he will have served \u201cdead time,\u201d i.e., time served under an invalid sentence for which no credit is given. See <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>350 F. Supp. 249, 251 (N.D. Ga. 1972); Wagner, Sentence Credit for \u201cDead Time,\u201d 8 Grim. L. Bull. 393 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The defendants argue that when the first of the two consecutive sentences was reversed, the second sentence took effect from the day of its imposition, May 2, 1974. Time served on the vacated sentences prior to the imposition of the second sentence, it is argued, cannot be the basis of credit toward the later Suffolk sentence. They assert, in effect, that this result is required by precedent and is necessary to prevent multiple credits for time that has already been once credited to the plaintiff\u2019s ultimate suspended Norfolk sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The trial judge adopted the defendants\u2019 view by confirming their recomputation of April 18,1974, as the effective date of the Suffolk County sentence, and denying credit for the fifteen months served under the vacated Norfolk sentences. The plaintiff appealed to the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case on our own motion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>G. L. c. 211A, \u00a7 10 (A). We reverse and order that the plaintiff\u2019s sentence be recomputed to account for the time served under the invalidated Norfolk sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument depends largely on his reading of two statutes. General Laws c. 127, \u00a7 129B, as appearing in St. 1961, c. 74, provides as follows: \u201cThe sentence of any prisoner in any correctional institution of the commonwealth or in any house of correction or jail, who was held in custody awaiting trial shall be reduced by the number of days spent by him in confinement <em>prior to such sentence and while awaiting trial, </em>unless the court in imposing such sentence had already deducted therefrom the time during which such prisoner had been confined while awaiting trial\u201d (emphasis added). Of like effect is G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A, as appearing in St. 1961, c. 75: \u201cThe court on imposing a sentence of commitment to a correctional institution of the commonwealth, a house of correction, or a jail, shall order that the prisoner be deemed to have served a portion of said sentence, such portion to be the number of days spent by the prisoner in confinement <em>prior to such sentence awaiting and during trial\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">These statutes grant a prisoner credit for time served in jail up to the imposition of sentence. If the statutes are read literally, and the original Norfolk sentences are ignored, the plaintiff\u2019s argument has force. He was arrested on a Suffolk charge on January 17,1973, and he remained in jail continuously until May 2, 1974, when he was convicted on that charge. Had no intervening, later vacated sentence been interposed, these two statutes would undoubtedly apply and would compel jail time credit (\u201cdays spent... \u2018awaiting and during trial,\u2019 \u201d G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>364 Mass. 272, 274-276 (1974); 1955 Senate Doc. No. 750 at 75; <em>Stearns, petitioner, </em>343 Mass. 53, 56 (1961) (\u201cThere can be no doubt that [G. L. c. 127] \u00a7 129B applies to the time spent in jail between the day of arrest and the day the indictment was reached for trial\u201d). If the intervening Norfolk sentences had not existed, credit would be required as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>If the intervening Norfolk sentences had been valid, however, there is equally no doubt that the plaintiff would not be entitled to have time served on the Norfolk sentences attributed to the \u201cfrom and after\u201d Suffolk sentence. In <em>Needel, petitioner, </em>344 Mass. 260, 262 (1962), we held that the jail time credit statutes did not apply to confinement pursuant to a sentence for an unrelated crime: \u201cThe statutory purpose [of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 129B] was not to allow deductions for time served under sentence for another crime, but was to afford relief to those not convicted and not serving any sentence but who because of inability to obtain bail, for example, were held in custody awaiting trial.\u201d In <em>Libby </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>353 Mass. 472 (1968), we relied on <em>Needel, petitioner, supra, </em>and refused to grant credit on a Norfolk County sentence for time spent in custody pursuant to a Suffolk County sentence on an unrelated charge. Had the original Norfolk sentences not been reversed, the plaintiff\u2019s argument would have no merit in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">No statute settles whether this case is to be treated as if the reversed sentences were never imposed or as if the reversed sentences are to be given some effect for the purpose of computing credit. Indeed, the defendants do not even address the plaintiff\u2019s statutory argument in their brief. At the very least, however, the jail time credit statutes suggest a legislative policy of requiring automatic, and not discretionary, credit for time served<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> if the statutes apply. While it is not so clear that these statutes were intended to provide credit where there is an intervening sentence, we confront this problem with a strong indication by the Legislature that a prisoner is entitled to credit for the time he has spent in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Both parties seek support from <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>336 Mass. 718 (1958). In the <em>Brown </em>case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the plaintiff was convicted on three Middlesex County indictments on May 13, 1952, and received three consecutive sentences, each from five to seven years. On September 23, 1952, he was convicted on five Suffolk indictments and was sentenced to five concurrent sentences, each from three to five years, to be served from and after the Mid-dlesex sentences. This court set aside the three Middlesex convictions in March of 1957. Brown pleaded guilty to two of the three Middlesex indictments on April 30, 1957, and was placed on probation for one year on each.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">The question for decision was whether, as the plaintiff contended, the Suffolk sentences commenced when imposed on September 23, 1952, or, as the correctional officials contended, the Suffolk sentences commenced when the plaintiff ultimately pleaded guilty in April, 1957, following the reversal of the Middlesex convictions. We held that the Suffolk sentences began when imposed and that such a rule \u201cis the better and more humane view, for only in this way can a prisoner receive credit, not as matter of grace, but as of right, for time served under an erroneous conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">By recomputing the plaintiff\u2019s sentence as beginning when it was imposed, the defendants here have adhered to the letter of the <em>Brown </em>holding. Yet the <em>Brown </em>case did not require this court to reach the questions presented in this case. The relief sought in <em>Brown </em>was limited to credit from the imposition of the Suffolk sentences and that relief was sufficient. The plaintiff in <em>Brown </em>was entitled to immediate release based on that date, so the additional question of credit for time served before the imposition of sentence was not presented.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the <em>Brown </em>case was decided entirely on when a \u201cfrom and after\u201d sentence would commence, and was not concerned with the jail time credit statutes which strongly indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>the appropriateness of credit in the present circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Finally, in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>this court rejected \u201can overly legalistic approach in matters of this sort,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 722, and adopted a rule that would remedy the injustice of a prisoner serving time for which he receives no credit. Liberty is of immeasurable value; it will not do to read statutes and opinions blind to the possible injustice of denying credit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The defendants\u2019 arguments against this result must be dealt with. The defendants argue that the judge clearly took into account the time served under the erroneous sentence when the plaintiff was resentenced on the Norfolk offense to three to five years, suspended, and placed on probation for two years. This statement has no support in the statement of agreed facts and we will not construct an irrebuttable presumption to that effect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no basis in the record for assuming that the suspended sentence can be accounted for by a grant of credit rather than, for example, by a plea bargain based on a reappraisal of the case after a substantial lapse of time. In any event, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>even if the judge took into consideration the time already served, two reasons, set forth in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra, </em>still require credit. First, without such a rule as we adopt, a defendant cannot insist on credit as a matter of right. <em>Id. </em>at 721. Second, consideration in resentencing would not provide credit where a prisoner is acquitted upon retrial of a case instead of pleading guilty as here. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff here is serving a Suffolk sentence and it is the computation of that sentence that is disputed. There is no doubt that the plaintiff has received a sentence, albeit suspended, for the Norfolk charge. Whenever a defendant has served a portion of a sentence on a conviction which has been reversed and he is resentenced, the judge should take care to have the record disclose what consideration has been given to the time already served. This is even more important when other sentences have been imposed subsequent to the one which has been reversed. Nothing before us permits a decision that credit has already been given on any sentence. Hence, the argument that the plaintiff is receiving a windfall or double credit must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The defendants also seem to argue that the result we reach permits a prisoner to \u201cbank time\u201d against future offenses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This indeed would be a matter of concern; it is not our intention to grant prisoners license to commit future criminal acts with immunity. Indeed, the fear of authorizing \u201ca line of credit for future crimes,\u201d <em>Sills </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>mem. dec. 12,045 (4th Cir. 1968), as quoted in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>443 F.2d 1019, 1021 (4th Cir. 1971), has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>troubled a number of courts. See <em>Meadows </em>v. <em>Blackwell, </em>433 F.2d 1298, 1299 (5th Cir. 1970); <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>357 F.2d 115,118 (4th Cir. <em>1966); Sancinella </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>380 F. Supp. 1393 (N.D. Ga.), aff\u2019d, 502 F.2d 784 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Such concerns are not appropriate here. The Suffolk crime, for which the defendants imply the plaintiff seeks to bank time, was committed before the plaintiff was incarcerated. Indeed, he was originally arrested and imprisoned first on the Suffolk charge, and then tried on the Norfolk charges. Credit allowed when the subsequent conviction is for <em>an offense committed before the reversal of the first sentence </em>in no way permits credit for future criminal acts. See Agata, Time Served Under A Reversed Sentence Or Conviction \u2014 A Proposal and A Basis for Decision, 25 Mont. L. Rev. 3, 46-47 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Finally, the defendants argue that \u201c[n]o appellate court has ever held that a sentence consecutive to an invalid sentence can take effect prior to the date of its imposition.\u201d This may be incorrect. See <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Page, </em>482 P.2d 615 (Okla. Crim. App. 1971). But see <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>State, </em>540 P.2d 1195 (Okla. Crim. App. 1975); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>513 P.2d 345 (Okla. Crim. App. 1973); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Page, </em>484 P.2d 1319, 1321 (Okla. Crim. App. 1971). Cf. <em>United States ex rel. DiRienzo </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>423 F.2d 224, 226-227 (3d Cir. 1970). More importantly, this statement misconstrues the problem. Of course no court would hold that a sentence takes effect before it is imposed. The problem is not when a sentence is imposed but rather what to do to or for a prisoner who has served time under a sentence that is reversed. The jail time credit statutes indicate legislative policy that credit be granted. Familiar equitable principles require an interpretation that does not leave a prisoner having served bad or dead time for which no credit is given. A prisoner who had proceedings free from error would have time served credited to a sentence. A prisoner should not be penalized or burdened by denial of a credit simply because he had successfully appealed a criminal conviction. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(1969). See Whalen, Resentence Without Credit for Time Served: Unequal Protection of the Laws, 35 Minn. L. Rev. 239 (1951); Van Alstyne, In Gideon\u2019s Wake: Harsher Penalties and the \u201cSuccessful\u201d Criminal Appellant, 74 Yale L.J. 606 (1965). The result we reach neutralizes the effect of the erroneous Norfolk sentences on the valid Suffolk sentence, and causes the plaintiff to serve no more and no less than he should pursuant to the Suffolk sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">A general rule of sentence credit, analogous to that which we deem appropriate as a matter of fairness in this particular case, has been adopted by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Standards and Goals (1973),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and by the American Bar Association in its Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures (1968).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">So <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\"> The remaining Norfolk indictments were disposed of as follows: the assault and battery charge was filed after the plaintiff\u2019s guilty plea; the rape and sodomy charges were filed with the plaintiff\u2019s not guilty pleas left outstanding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\"> An abbreviated account of the sequence of events may clarify the controversy: 1. January 17 to February 1, 1973 (fourteen days). The plaintiff held in jail awaiting trial on the Suffolk charge. This period has been credited to the Suffolk sentence. 2. February 1, 1973. The Norfolk sentences were imposed. 3. February 1, 1973, to May 2, 1974 (456 days). The plaintiff held in custody following the Norfolk con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>victions. <em>This period is in dispute. </em>The plaintiff claims this time should be credited to his Suffolk sentence. 4. May 2, 1974. The plaintiff convicted on the Suffolk charge. The defendants claim this day, with fourteen days\u2019 credit, is when the plaintiff began serving the Suffolk sentence. 5. May 16, 1974; May 2, 1975. Norfolk convictions reversed by the Appeals Court and by the Supreme Judicial Court, respectively. 6. June 10, 1975. On remand, the plaintiff pleaded guilty to two Norfolk charges, sentenced on one charge to three to five years suspended, from and after the Suffolk sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\"> While the plaintiff\u2019s complaint asserted sundry constitutional claims, those claims have not been argued or briefed and will not be considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\"> General Laws c. 279, \u00a7 33A, inserted by St. 1955, c. 770, \u00a7 101, permitted the sentencing court to grant credit \u201cin its discretion.\u201d Statute 1958, c. 173, removed this discretion by adding the current imperative language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b407-6\"> One commentator suggested at the time that <em>Brown </em>be extended to \u201caward credit for time served from the <em>commencement </em>of a prior erroneous conviction\u201d (emphasis in original).

The brief deduces the corollary that his non-existent punishment cannot possibly be \u2018increased.\u2019 As other corollaries it might be suggested that he is liable in quasi-contract for the value of his board and lodging, and criminally liable for obtaining them by false pretenses.
