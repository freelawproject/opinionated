DeCenzo, brings this appeal from a decision of the Appellate Tax Board (board), which upheld the denial by the appellee, board of assessors of Framingham (assessors), of his application under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twenty-second, for an exemption from a 1973 real estate tax on his home in Fram-ingham. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">On January 1, 1973, DeCenzo and his wife were the owners, as tenants by the entirety, of a single family home in Framingham occupied by them as their residence. The assessors valued the property at $18,100 and assessed a tax for 1973 of $923.10 to DeCenzo and his wife. The tax was paid on October 15, 1973, and on that day, DeCenzo made his application for an exemption under cl. Twenty-second.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The application was denied by the assessors be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>cause DeCenzo\u2019s wife, who is a blind person, had received an exemption on the same property for the tax year 1973 under G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Thirty-seven.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">That DeCenzo meets all necessary conditions for receiving a veterans\u2019 exemption under cl. Twenty-second is not disputed here. The sole issue before this court is whether DeCenzo is barred from receiving such an exemption because his wife, with whom he owned the property in question as tenants by the entirety, received a blind persons\u2019 exemption under cl. Thirty-seven for the same property.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">We have been cited to no authority which controls the issue presented. The assessors rely on <em>Sylvester </em>v. Assessors <em>of Braintree, </em>344 Mass. 263 (1962), to support their position. However, that case dealt with the availability of multiple exemptions under a single clause, G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Seventeenth, and we relied heavily on the fact that where the Legislature intended to grant double exemption under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the same clause, it expressly provided for such exemption. Compare G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twenty-second, with G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twenty-second E. <em>Sylvester </em>does not control the case now before us in which exemptions are sought on entirely different grounds under two separate clauses of \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The preamble to \u00a7 5 reads as follows: \u201cThe following property shall be exempt from taxation; provided, however, that any person who receives an exemption under the provisions of clause... Twenty-two... [or] Thirty-seven ... shall not receive an exemption on the same property under any other provision of this section----\u201d G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, as amended by St. 1970, c. 270, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issue thus becomes the meaning of the word \u201cperson\u201d for the purposes of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The board has given us no guidance as to the reasons for its decision. The assessors argue that the taxpayer and his wife are essentially one person for tax purposes because they hold the property as tenants by the entirety, and the wife\u2019s exemption inured to the benefit of the taxpayer. We find no legislative intent so to limit exemption in the context presented by this case. The blind persons\u2019 exemption of cl. Thirty-seven is expressly applicable \u201cwhether such property is owned by... [the blind person] separately or jointly or as a tenant in common____\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This language supports the availability of the exemption to DeCenzo\u2019s wife regardless of the fact that she and her husband hold the property as tenants by the entirety. It would be a curious result indeed if eligibility for these exemptions was dependent on the order of application, and the language of cl. Thirty-seven suggests that DeCenzo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>wife would have been entitled to an exemption even if DeCenzo had been previously granted a veteran\u2019s exemption on the same property.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Prior to 1973, real property acquired by husband and wife either by devise or decree was deemed to be held by them as tenants by the entirety based on the old common law concept of the unity of husband and wife, unless the instrument expressly negated an intent to hold the property in that manner. See, e.g., <em>Fekkes </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>354 Mass. 303, 304 (1968); <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Finn, </em>348 Mass. 443, 446 (1965); <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Wajda, </em>325 Mass. 242, 243 (1950). The presumption that husband and wife hold property as tenants by the entirety was reversed by a 1973 amendment to G. L. c. 184, \u00a7 7, St. 1973, c. 210, \u00a7 1, which made tenancies by the entirety merely one option available to married persons. See <em>D\u2019Ercole </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ercole, </em>407 F. Supp. 1377 (D. Mass. 1976); <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>367 F. Supp. 583 (D. Mass. 1973), aff\u2019d 416 U.S. 953 (1974). General Laws c. 184, \u00a7 7, as amended, severely limits the common law unity concept with respect to form of property ownership.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">While the DeCenzos hold the property in question as tenants by the entirety, we do not think that the Legislature intended such form of ownership to bar them from receiving both exemptions in this context. Such a result could be justified only by relying on the unity of husband and wife as one taxpayer, a result we decline to reach. There is nothing in \u00a7 5 which would compel a conclusion that the Legislature so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">We conclude that DeCenzo and his wife are entitled to receive the exemption for which each qualifies. We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>in past decisions characterized the veterans\u2019 exemption as a \u201chardship\u201d exemption, one based on the perceived special needs of the classes of veterans and veterans\u2019 families specified by cl. Twenty-second as entitled to exemption. See <em>Assessors of Saugus </em>v. <em>Baumann, </em>370 Mass. 36, 36-37 (1976); <em>Assessors of Everett </em>v. <em>Formosi, </em>349 Mass. 727, 730 (1965); <em>Opinion of the </em>Justices, 324 Mass. 724, 732 (1949). However, unlike the hardship exemption granted by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 5, Eighteenth, the cl. Twenty-second exemption is not made a matter within the discretion of the assessors. See <em>Assessors of Saugus </em>v. <em>Baumann, supra. </em>The blind persons\u2019 exemption of cl. Thirty-seven is likewise predicated on the special hardship of such persons and is not a matter within the discretion of the assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">It follows that the decisions of the board and of the assessors must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-15\"> General Laws c. 59, \u00a7 5, Twenty-second, as amended through St. 1971, c. 1110, \u00a7 2, provides in part: \u201cReal estate of the following classes of persons who are legal residents of the commonwealth and who are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>veterans ... and whose last discharge or release from the armed forces was under other than dishonorable conditions and who were domiciled in Massachusetts for at least six months prior to entering such service, or who have resided in the commonwealth for five consecutive years next prior to date of filing for exemptions under this clause ... provided such real estate is occupied in whole or in part as his domicile by such person...
