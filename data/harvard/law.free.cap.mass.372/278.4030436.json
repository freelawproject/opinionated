A judge of the Superior Court decided that the plaintiff has the right he claims, and the defendants appealed. We uphold the right as part of the \u201cfree fishing and fowling\u201d granted by the colonial ordinance of 1641-1647, found in the 1649 codification, The Book of the General Lawes and Libertyes, at 50. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>365 Mass. 681, 685 (1974). With a minor change for clarification, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">We summarize the statement of agreed facts. The plaintiff and the defendants own lots of land fronting on Center-ville Harbor. A jetty built in 1957 at public expense ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>tends from the beach on the defendants\u2019 land into the water, and the defendants do not claim to own the jetty. A prior owner of the defendants\u2019 land allowed the plaintiff and members of the public to cross the defendants\u2019 beach between mean high water and mean low water to enable them to reach the jetty and to walk on the jetty for the purpose of fishing. Since the defendants acquired the land, they have refused to permit such walking and fishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The judge ordered judgment declaring that the plaintiff has the right to use the defendants\u2019 \u201cproperty between the high and low water mark as a means of access to the jetty,\u201d and a right to fish from the jetty, and directing the defendants not to interfere with those rights. The defendants appealed, and we brought the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The colonial ordinance was in the nature of a grant of ownership, \u201csubject to a reserved easement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alger, </em>7 Cush. 53, 81 (1851). The right of fishing on the part of the public is not excluded, and extends to the taking of clams-from flats open to the natural ebb and flow of the tide. <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Sampson, 8 </em>Cush. 347, 355 (1851). Our cases \u201cshow too plainly for further discussion, that, if there is a right to go upon flats and to disturb the soil for clams, <em>a fortiori </em>there is a right to pass over them for fishing, in the stricter sense of the word.\u201d <em>Packard </em>v. <em>Ryder, </em>144 Mass. 440, 441 (1887). In both the <em>Weston </em>and <em>Packard </em>cases the \u201cfishing\u201d was done on the flats of the complaining owner by people who came by boat. But we think the same principle applies to access over flats on foot to property of others, so long as the purpose is \u201cfishing.\u201d In <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>365 Mass. 681, 687 (1974), we said, \u201cWe are unable to find any authority that the rights of the public include a right to walk on the beach.\u201d But that language is not to be taken as limiting the right of fishing. We have here no question of taking soil as fertilizer, as in <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Shehan, </em>7 Gray 435, 437 (1856), or of bathing, as in <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>195 Mass. 79, 83-84 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The first paragraph of the judgment appealed from is to be modified by inserting, after the words \u201cas a means of access to the jetty,\u201d the words \u201cin order to fish from the jetty.\u201d As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
