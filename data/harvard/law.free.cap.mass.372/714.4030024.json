Each policy provided that an amount twice the amount shown on the face of the policy would be paid \u201cupon receipt of due proof that the death of the Insured occurred as the result, directly and independently of all other causes, of bodily injury caused solely by external, violent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>and accidental means.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court concluded that the plaintiff failed to prove compliance with the policy requirement of due proof of accidental death, and he ordered the entry of judgment for the defendant notwithstanding a jury verdict in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff has appealed from that judgment, and we granted her request for direct appellate review. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">An essential part of the plaintiff\u2019s case was to establish either that she furnished the defendant with due proof that the death was accidental or that the company waived the requirement of due proof. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>329 Mass. 301, 303 (1952). <em>Howe </em>v. <em>National Life Ins. Co., </em>321 Mass. 283, 288-289 (1947). <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>304 Mass. 564, 569 (1939). Due proof in connection with a policy of the type involved in this case is provided when the proof furnished to the insurer shows on the whole \u201cthat the claim is of a class within the protection of the policy, so that if the proofs should be accepted as true the insurer reasonably might pay the claim.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>300 Mass. 477, 481 (1938). See <em>King </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>359 Mass. 46, 54 (1971). \u201cDue proof\u201d thus requires evidence indicating the truth of the facts stated, which in turn show that an event has occurred on which the insurer has promised to pay. <em>Krantz </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>335 Mass. 703, 711 (1957). <em>Howe </em>v. <em>National Life Ins. Co., supra </em>at 285. See generally Annot., 170 A.L.R. 1262 (1947). The requirement, therefore, goes beyond mere notice to the company. <em>Hovhanesian </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>310 Mass. 626, 629-630 (1942). <em>Belbas </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>300 Mass. 471, 473-474 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">An assertion of facts perhaps supporting a claim that the death was accidental, accompanied, however, by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>death certificate (or other medical evidence) giving a non-accidental cause of death, consistent with the facts asserted, does not constitute due proof that the death was caused solely by accident. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, supra </em>at 304. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>National Life Ins. Co., supra </em>at 287-288. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Commercial Travellers\u2019 E. Accident Ass\u2019n., </em>225 Mass. 335, 337 (1916). The issue here is whether the plaintiff seasonably presented sufficient proof to the insurer to create a jury question whether she had presented \u201cdue proof,\u201d as provided in the contract of insurance and as interpreted by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We summarize the information which was submitted to the insurer on which the plaintiff relies in establishing due proof of accidental death. The plaintiff submitted a proof of death form which permitted the cause of death to be shown either by a physician\u2019s statement or by a death certificate. The plaintiff submitted no separate information from a physician. Instead, she delivered a medical examiner\u2019s certificate of death which stated, as to the cause of death, \u201cDOA Wesson Memorial Hospital presumably of Coronary Sclerosis.\u201d The words \u201cAccident, suicide, or homicide\u201d were crossed out and the words \u201cnatural cause\u201d written in.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The plaintiff also submitted two letters, one from her and one from her son-in-law. In her letter, dated February 15, 1972, she wrote that she and her husband went to a funeral home on January 16,1972, to attend the wake of a relative. Her husband kneeled at the kneeler, and, when he was about to get up, he \u201cfell over backwards and hit his head hard.\u201d He said he was all right. He left the room shortly thereafter, spoke to several relatives, and within ten minutes after the fall had a seizure, lost consciousness, and died. The letter concluded by saying that, if the cause of death was coronary sclerosis, \u201cit was brought on by the fall.\u201d The letter from the plaintiff\u2019s son-in-law, dated February 24,1972, indicated that five people saw the deceased fall accidentally; the deceased then sat down for a few minutes and spoke to his wife; he got up, walked around, and spoke to others. He left the room to comb his hair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>and collapsed and died in another room. The letter indicated that the fall was mentioned to a doctor in the emergency clinic in the hospital but apparently the fact was not transmitted to the medical examiner and thus \u201cthe death certificate was completed in a vague and incorrect manner.\u201d The letter ended by asking for the forms necessary to file a claim for accidental death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In June, 1972, the manager of the insurer\u2019s group life claims division wrote the deceased\u2019s employer, and the manager of the \u201cP.L.I. Claims Division\u201d of the insurer wrote the plaintiff, substantially identical letters rejecting the claims under the policies. The letters, significant portions of which are set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> neither invited the submission of additional information nor foreclosed the possibility of a further submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">At the trial the plaintiff offered medical testimony that the sole cause of the deceased\u2019s death was the fall. The doctor\u2019s expert opinion, which had not been furnished to the insurer previously, was based in part on the fact that after the fall the deceased complained of a severe headache and stiffness of the neck. The plaintiff testified that after the fall the deceased said he had a \u201cterrific headache\u201d and that his neck was \u201ca little stiff.\u201d These facts were not presented in the information previously furnished to the insurer in support of the claim for accidental death benefits. The plaintiff\u2019s expert agreed that, in distinguishing between a heart attack or the fall as the cause of death, the deceased\u2019s complaints of a stiff neck and a headache were significant. He agreed that the deceased\u2019s other symptoms, collapse, body twitching and eyes rolling, were consistent with a heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">We think it clear that due proof was not furnished as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>required by the insurance policy and by this court\u2019s longstanding interpretation of the meaning of due proof in an insurance policy. The information submitted to the insurer prior to trial was consistent with death from a heart attack. It certainly did not support a theory that an accident was the sole cause of death. Essential facts were not disclosed concerning the deceased\u2019s condition just before his death, which would have tended to support a medical conclusion that death was caused by the blow to the deceased\u2019s head. The only medical information submitted was inconsistent with the plaintiff\u2019s theory of accidental death. We do not accept testimony offered at trial as due proof. Consequently, the judge was correct in concluding that the plaintiff had failed to submit due proof of accidental death.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The plaintiff argues briefly that the insurer waived the requirement of due proof because its responses to her submissions were insufficient to fulfil an affirmative duty to request additional information. We will assume that the insurer was bound by the consequences of the rejection letters sent out under its name. We accept the proposition that, in particular instances, an insurer may have a duty to advise a claimant that additional information may be submitted to explain or supplement information previously furnished, and that an insurer\u2019s failure to fulfil such a duty constitutes a waiver of the requirement of due proof. 3 J.A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 1449 (Supp. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">One purpose of the requirement of due proof is to enable the insurer \u201cto form an intelligent estimate as to whether the death came within the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Howe </em>v. <em>National Life Ins. Co., </em>321 Mass. 283, 285 (1947). <em>Krantz </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>335 Mass. 703, 707 (1957). Additionally, the requirement prevents the practice of fraud and deception on the insurer and enables it to make an investigation in order to determine its rights and liabilities. 3 J.A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 1391, at 3 (1941). However, the requirement of due proof is not a shield behind which an insurer may hide silently in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>the hope that the claimant will fail to submit due proof of what is a valid claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Thus, as we have said, an insurer may have a good faith duty in particular circumstances to request additional information. If the initial proof is inconclusive but contains information reasonably suggesting that the claim may be valid, an insurer has the duty of further inquiry, at least to the extent of inviting the submission of further information in support of the claimant\u2019s position. We have long recognized that an insurer may request further proof and any additional submission should be considered in assessing whether the claimant submitted adequate proof under the policy. See <em>Traiser </em>v. <em>Commercial Travellers\u2019 E. Accident Ass\u2019n, </em>202 Mass. 292, 294-296 (1909).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">We think, however, that the response of the insurer in this case did not constitute a waiver of the requirement of due proof and that, in the circumstances, there was no obligation to state affirmatively that additional proof might have been submitted. The only evidence submitted supported the medical conclusion that the death was not accidental. The plaintiff\u2019s submission did not merely leave the question in doubt; at the least it showed affirmatively a medical opinion that the cause of death was not entirely accidental. None of the facts submitted indicated that that medical opinion might be in error. The letters sent by the insurer (see note 3 <em>supra) </em>did not foreclose the submission of additional information. Indeed, those letters explicitly pointed out the deficiency in the proof submitted and impliedly invited the submission of additional proof. \u201c[H]is death <em>appears </em>to have been due either wholly or in part to disease\u201d (emphasis supplied). \u201cIt has not been <em>satisfactorily established </em>that Mr. Washington\u2019s death resulted solely from bodily injuries sustained through accidental means\u201d (emphasis supplied). In this circumstance, the requirement of due proof was not waived, or otherwise eliminated, as an element of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The plaintiff makes no claim that the insurer had a duty of further inquiry based on the information received by it. We have recognized that, in particular circumstances, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>insurer may have an obligation to investigate possibly relevant information beyond the material submitted where it \u201chas knowledge that such facts exist and unimpeded access thereto.\u201d <em>Krantz </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>335 Mass. 703, 708 (1957). Only the plaintiff testified to the deceased\u2019s statements concerning a headache or a stiff neck, and she did not submit those facts to the insurer as part of her proof or subsequently. None of the persons disclosed in the plaintiff\u2019s submission to have been present at the funeral home was shown to have information which would have supported a contrary medical conclusion. If the insurer had reviewed the Wesson Memorial Hospital record, as far as appears before us, that record would not have supported or suggested a medical conclusion of accidental death. Thus, any inquiry would have been fruitless except as to the plaintiff herself. The insurer did not have the duty to inquire hypothetically of her. The plaintiff had the opportunity to submit additional information, and the insurer\u2019s conduct did not relieve her of the obligation to submit due proof. The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was properly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">The plaintiff does not challenge the requirement of due proof as unconscionable or contrary to public policy. Nor does she argue that we adopt a new principle that the failure to furnish due proof is a relevant defense only if the insurer was materially prejudiced by the failure to furnish that proof. We express no opinion on what the result would be if such an argument were presented in an appropriate case. The duty was on the plaintiff to furnish adequate supporting information, and she did not do so at any time before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\"> For convenience in this opinion we shall refer to these circumstances as accidental death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\"> The defendant waived any reliance on the fact that the proof of death was submitted beyond any specified policy period. One policy was a group policy issued through the deceased\u2019s employer; the other two apparently were purchased directly from the insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\"> \u201cIt has not been satisfactorily established that Mr. Washington\u2019s death resulted solely from bodily injuries sustained through accidental means. Indeed, his death appears to have been due either wholly or in part to disease, namely, coronary sclerosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">\u201cBecause Mr. Washington\u2019s death has not been established as one within the provisions and limitations of the Additional Indemnity Benefit provision of the policies, I am sorry we could not justify the payment of this additional benefit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
