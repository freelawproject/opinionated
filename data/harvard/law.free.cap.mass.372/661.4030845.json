L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, to collect the balance due it on a public works project. This appeal concerns only the question whether the judge\u2019s allowance of the claimant\u2019s legal fees was proper. The defendants argue that that portion of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which permits a successful claimant to recover reasonable legal fees, is unconstitutional. They claim that they are denied equal protection of the laws because \u00a7 29 grants legal fees only to a successful claimant. They argue further that the refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>ence in \u00a7 29 to recommended fee schedules of bar associations renders \u00a7 29 void because such fee schedules violate the antitrust laws of the United States. Additionally, the defendants argue that, even if \u00a7 29 is valid, they were improperly denied discovery and a hearing on the reasonableness of the legal fees allowed. We granted the defendants\u2019 application for direct appellate review. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">1. The allowance of reasonable legal fees to a successful claimant under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, but not to a successful defendant, does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or similar provisions of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. We pass by the unargued question whether unsuccessful defendants, such as these defendants, have any standing to challenge the absence of a provision allowing reasonable legal fees to successful defendants. See <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 610 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The question for decision is whether the defendants have met their heavy burden of showing that the classification of litigants made by \u00a7 29 does not rationally further a legitimate State purpose. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petralia, ante, </em>452, 455 (1977). <em>Zayre Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., ante, </em>423, 432-433 (1977). The defendants concede that a statute is not repugnant to equal protection requirements simply because legal fees are allowed only to successful claimants. See <em>Old Colony R.R. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>309 Mass. 439, 447 (1941); <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 180,189-194 (1932); <em>Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McCray, </em>291 U.S. 566, 569-570 (1934); <em>Dohany </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>281 U.S. 362, 368 (1930); <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern Ry. </em>v. <em>Nye Schneider Fowler Co., </em>260 U.S. 35, 43-45 (1922); <em>Missouri, Kan. &amp; Tex. Ry. </em>v. <em>Cade, </em>233 U.S. 642, 650 (1914). They argue, however, that the distinction made in \u00a7 29 is arbitrary because it lacks any rational basis in the circumstances of this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">There is ample justification for the legislative determination, expressed in \u00a7 29, to allow reasonable legal fees to successful claimants and not to successful defendant contractors and sureties. The encouragement of prompt pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ment of general contractors\u2019 obligations to subcontractors and materialmen is a substantial object of \u00a7 29. In <em>LaBonte </em>v. <em>White Constr. Co., </em>363 Mass. 41, 45 (1973), a case involving each of the defendants before us in this case, we noted that \u00a7 29 is a remedial statute which should be construed broadly to achieve the purpose of affording security to subcontractors and materialmen on public works. Prompt payment of subcontractors on public works is a consistent legislative purpose. See G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 39F (1). The provision in \u00a7 29 concerning the allowance of reasonable legal fees to successful claimants was added by St. 1972, c. 774, \u00a7 5. The heading of that act is instructive in identifying its legislative purpose: \u201cAn Act expediting payments to general contractors and to subcontractors and improving the flow of funds in the construction industry.\u201d Plainly, a provision which places the expense of litigation on a contractor and a surety who decline to pay a rightful claim tends to achieve the legislative goal of expeditious payments to subcontractors. Moreover, such a provision may encourage subcontractors to bid on public works projects and tends to alleviate concerns of subcontractors which might prompt higher bids as a precaution against unreasonable delays in the flow of funds to them. The defendants have failed to establish that the legislative classification lacks a rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">2. The defendants next argue that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, is unlawful because it directs the judge, in determining counsel fees, to consider bar association schedules of recommended fees. The claim is that recommended fee schedules violate the Federal antitrust laws and that any statute is void which prescribes such fee schedules as a measure of the minimum level of reasonableness of a fee. There is no indication that the judge considered any bar association fee schedule or, indeed, that there was any recommended bar association fee schedule applicable in the circumstances. Section 29 does not mandate that there be bar association recommended fee schedules but only that, if there are such schedules, they must be considered. If the recommended fee schedules do violate the antitrust laws, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>a point we need not consider,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the over-all legislative goal of allowing reasonable legal fees can be achieved by severing and disregarding any reference to unlawful fee schedules. See <em>DelDuca </em>v. <em>Town Adm\u2019r of Methuen, </em>368 Mass. 1, 13 (1975), and cases cited. Here, in any event, there was no showing that there was any recommended fee schedule applicable in the circumstances. Thus, the judge could not have considered an allegedly unlawful recommended fee schedule. Clearly, \u00a7 29 is not void in its entirety simply because it refers to recommended minimum fee schedules of bar associations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">3. Finally, the defendants argue that they were improperly denied their right to discovery and their right to an evidentiary hearing concerning the reasonableness of the legal fees allowed by the judge. After a master\u2019s report was filed, the plaintiff moved for confirmation of that report and for entry of judgment. An accompanying affidavit concerning legal fees was submitted in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim for the allowance of legal fees in the amount of $2,500. A judgment was entered on March 18, 1976, in which the judge determined that legal fees in the amount of $2,500 were reasonable and proper and allowed the recovery of that amount along with the principal sum owed ($7,374.69), plus interest and deposition costs. The defendants then moved to stay entry of judgment and to vacate the judgment; they also moved for a rehearing of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment; and they sought discovery concerning the reasonableness of the fees. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>judge entered an order denying each of these motions. He stated that \u201c[t]he sole question argued on the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment was the constitutionality of the statute (c. 149 s. 29) as it provided for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The Court was led to believe that the reasonableness of the fee was <em>not </em>disputed. Plaintiff had submitted sufficient substantiating material by way of affidavit and records for the Court to conclude that the fee requested was reasonable\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Nowhere in their brief or their reply brief do the defendants explicitly state that they pressed the question of the reasonableness of the legal fees sought by the plaintiff at the time of the hearing before the judge on the plaintiff\u2019s motions to confirm the master\u2019s report and to enter judgment for the plaintiff. They were entitled to an eviden-tiary hearing if they requested one. See <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Tarbell, </em>272 Mass. 142, 146 <em>(1930); Abdallah </em>v. <em>Boumil, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 499, 500-501 (1976). See also <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Brink, ante, </em>257, 264 (1977). However, the judge did not believe that the defendants had sought to challenge the reasonableness of the legal fees before him. Although, by attempts at discovery, the defendants had once undertaken to investigate the reasonableness of the legal fees, they make no claim that they offered evidence on the reasonableness of the fees, that they requested a continuance so that their earlier attempts at discovery concerning the reasonableness of the legal fees could be carried to completion, or that they raised the question of the reasonableness of the fees in any other way.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>shows clearly that the plaintiff was pressing for the allowance of legal fees and that, at the appropriate time, the defendants did not challenge the reasonableness of the amount claimed.* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Meeker </em>v. <em>Lehigh Valley R.R., </em>236 U.S. 412, 431-432 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">4. The plaintiff is entitled to the costs of this appeal, and the judgment shall be modified to allow the plaintiff reasonable legal fees in connection with this appeal in accordance with G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29. The judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b676-12\"> The relevant paragraph of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, was inserted by St. 1972, c. 774, \u00a7 5, and reads as follows: \u201cA decree in favor of any claimant under this section shall include reasonable legal fees based upon the time spent and the results accomplished as approved by the court and such legal fees shall not in any event be less than published rate of any recommended fee schedule of a state-wide bar association or of a bar association in which the office of counsel for claimant is located, whichever is higher.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b679-6\"> In <em>Goldfarb </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bar, </em>421 U.S. 773 (1975), the Supreme Court ruled that a minimum fee schedule which was mandatory in effect violated \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act and noted that a purely advisory fee schedule would present a different question. <em>Id. </em>at 781. We note also that the <em>Goldfarb </em>case did not deal with a statute which referred to bar association fee schedules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b679-7\"> In their reply brief, the defendants assert that there are no applicable minimum fee schedules in the Commonwealth and erroneously conclude that \u00a7 29 is inoperable in the absence of such schedules. The defendants have persisted in failing to note that \u00a7 29 calls for the use of bar association recommended fee schedules only if an applicable fee schedule exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b680-6\"> The defendants had attempted to take the deposition of plaintiff\u2019s counsel. However, they had not sought leave of court to do so as Mass. R. Civ. P. 30 (a), 365 Mass. 780 (1974), requires if, as here, \u201cthere has been a hearing before a master.\u201d They also had requested that plaintiff\u2019s counsel produce documents under Mass. R. Civ. P. 34, 365 Mass. 792 (1974). That rule runs only against parties and not their counsel. See 8 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2208, at 615 (1970); 4A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice pars. 34.02 [1], 34.05 [1], 34.17 n.8 (2d ed. 1975). See also <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 504 (1947). The information sought was not material furnished to counsel by the plaintiff. The defendants requested that plaintiff\u2019s coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>sel produce records concerning fees in other G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29, proceedings and time sheets, billing records, and memoranda concerning legal fees in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b681-15\"> There is no question here concerning the extent to which disbursements and costs of a successful claimant\u2019s counsel may be recoverable as \u201clegal fees\u201d under \u00a7 29. The only such item which was allowed was the cost of depositions, which are taxable under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (e), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), in the judge\u2019s discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
