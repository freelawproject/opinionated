L. c. Ill, \u00a7 128H,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Regulations on Rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Visitation for Migrant Workers (regulations) promulgated by the Department of Public Health (department) pursuant to the statutory mandate are unconstitutional on their face and as applied to Consolidated. It further sought a declaration that the statute and regulations are inapplicable to its tobacco harvesting facilities. The department filed a counterclaim for injunctive relief. Both parties moved for summary judgment. A judge of the Superior Court declared the rights of the parties in his order for judgment. G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 1. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Kenco Optics, Inc., </em>369 Mass. 412, 418 (1976). The judgment enjoined Consolidated from further violations of the regulations. We granted an application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">As a procedural matter, we think resort to declaratory relief particularly appropriate here. See G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To require the statute and the regulations to be challenged only in an enforcement proceeding would delay the vindication of rights belonging to the public and to a group classified by the Legislature as requiring special protection. Cf. <em>Norcisa </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Provincetown, </em>368 Mass. 161 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>We also think it appropriate to note that the motions for summary judgment and the accompanying affidavits were well prepared, thus enabling the trial judge to determine accurately that there was no genuine issue of material fact to be tried. The effective and proper use of Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974), in this case has eliminated an unnecessary trial, and has resulted in a more prompt disposition of this matter than would otherwise have been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The pertinent facts, accurately and artfully recounted in the Superior Court judge\u2019s order for judgment, are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Consolidated plants, harvests, and processes shade-grown tobacco in the Connecticut River Valley area, including parts of Massachusetts. Consolidated employs a number of young persons (ages fourteen to seventeen) during their school vacations under a special summer work program. These young persons are housed in facilities furnished by Consolidated and supervised by teachers or principals recruited by Consolidated from the home areas of the young workers. Consolidated obtains signed employment contracts from the parents or guardians of these young people.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The contracts drafted by Consolidated purport to regulate the nonworking activities of its young workers, as well as access by visitors to the housing facilities. Guests must obtain administrative approval from Consolidated in order to visit the young employees. Exceptions are made only for public agencies rendering emergency aid, medical personnel employed by Consolidated, and teachers sent by the Migrant Resource Center of the Massachusetts Depart-, ment of Education.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Consolidated invoked this contractual provision in 1974 and 1975 to deny access to certain persons seeking to enter its young person facilities. Among persons barred from entry were a paralegal employee of Neighborhood Legal Services, Inc., of Hartford, Connecticut, and a chaplain affiliated with the Springfield Council of Churches and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>some of their supporting personnel. Consolidated sought judicial relief between the 1974 and the 1975 harvesting seasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The major dispute before us centers on the right of persons housed in the young person facilities to receive visitors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consolidated claims that the statute and the regulations are inapplicable to it for the reasons (1) that the young persons whom they employ during the school vacations are not \u201cmigrant farm workers\u201d; (2) that the statute and regulations are unconstitutional; and (3) that the regulations, even if constitutional, exceed the scope of the enabling statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">1. <em>Applicability of the regulations to Consolidated\u2019s young person facilities. </em>The department is obligated to inspect annually \u201call farm labor camps as defined in the state sanitary code____\u201d G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 128G, inserted by St. 1967, c. 718, \u00a7 5. Pursuant to G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 127A, the department promulgated regulations which define farm labor camps as: \u201c[A]ny tract of land, including all buildings, vehicles, and other structures located thereon, any part of which contains sleeping facilities made available in connection with the employment of laborers in farm activities and living apart from the operator\u2019s household and which are occupied or intended for occupancy by two or more such laborers ... and for whom the facilities are provided in connection with their employment.\u201d State Sanitary Code, art. III, regulation 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">The Legislature recognized that a migrant worker at such farm labor camps shall \u201chave reasonable rights of visitation in his living quarters outside of regular working hours,\u201d and authorized the department to promulgate regulations setting forth \u201csuch minimum standards relating to the rights of visitation... as will ensure the adequate protection of said rights.\u201d G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 128H.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>In accordance with this legislative mandate, the regulations were promulgated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Consolidated urges that its youthful employees are not \u201cmigrant workers\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 128H, because the term connotes agricultural laborers who \u201cfollow the crops.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It seeks to buttress this argument by reference to the United States House of Representatives report which accompanies Federal legislation now codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2861 (1970) et seq. The report defines a \u201cmigrant agricultural employee\u201d as a worker \u201c (a) whose primary employment is in agriculture... and (b) who establishes with his family... a temporary residence.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 1458, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in [1964] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 2900,2924.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Initially, we note that we are not bound by the definition of the term which other jurisdictions have embraced where the meaning of the legislative enactment is clear from the text of the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such is the case with G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 128G and 128H. There is no doubt that Consolidated\u2019s facilities are \u201cfarm labor camps\u201d within the meaning of the State Sanitary Code. Further, it is readily apparent that \u201cmigrant workers\u201d are those workers who are employed to perform farm labor and are housed in farm labor camps. The Legislature has sought to insulate farm workers from potential exploitation <em>while they are housed </em>in farm labor camps; to condition such protection on the individual\u2019s activities before or after his term of employment in such a setting would be to frustrate the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Because the corporation either owns or leases the facilities in which its employees are housed, Consolidated claims that those workers are not \u201cliving in quarters apart from the living quarters of [their] employer,\u201d G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 128H, and, therefore, the Connecticut River Valley operations are exempt from the statutes and regulations. We do not agree. This exempting clause is a simple concession to the fact that farm operators who house their employees in their own homes stand on a different footing in regard to visitation rights from those operators who own, operate, or lease housing facilities, but do not reside therein. Neither the fact of ownership of the facility nor the presence of the corporation\u2019s agent in the dormitory is a relevant factor in triggering this exempting clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The department has interpreted \u201cliving in quarters apart from the living quarters of [their] employer [s]\u201d (\u00a7 128H), as meaning \u201cliving apart from the operator\u2019s household.\u201d State Sanitary Code, art. Ill, regulation 1.1. The importance of an administrative interpretation of a statute is \u201cnever greater than where, as here, an agency must interpret a legislative policy which is only broadly set out in the governing statute.\u201d <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>362 Mass. 417, 442 (1972), citing <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo's, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 343-344 (1964). Adopting the administrative construction of this statutory phrase, we conclude that the exempting clause pertains only to the situation where the farm operator houses his employees in his own home.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">2. <em>Constitutionality.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The parties have argued extensively on the constitutionality of the statute and the regulations, but their arguments were limited to the applicability of the \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>pany town\u201d doctrine. See <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Hudgens </em>v. <em>NLRB, supra. </em>While it is clear that Consolidated has \u201cbusiness and property for which... [it can] claim protection,\u201d <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 535 (1925) ,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it is, in our view, the reasonableness of the statute and the regulations promulgated pursuant to the statute which should be the focal point of our constitutional inquiry. The Legislature has spoken. Its acts are presumed constitutional. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s Dry wall Co., </em>366 Mass. 539 (1974). Consolidated bears the heavy burden of showing an invalid exercise of legislative power or an impermissible infringement of its property rights. We believe it has not met its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Consolidated urges that the regulations deprive it of property rights. However, the enjoyment of private property may be subordinated to reasonable regulations that are essential to the peace, safety, and welfare of the community. <em>Durgin </em>v. <em>Minot, </em>203 Mass. 26, 28 (1909). In order for a limited incursion to survive constitutional attack, it must satisfy two requirements. First, the apparent objective of the legislation must be rationally related to the promotion of the public safety, health, morals or general welfare. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>368 Mass. 857, 861 (1975). <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>361 Mass. 401, 413 (1972). <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962). Second, the means chosen to effectuate the legislative purpose must be reasonable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s Drywall Co., supra </em>at 543. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., </em>348 U.S. 483, 487-488 (1955). The wisdom of the particular remedial legislation is not for us to judge. <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haver-hill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 138-139 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Sections 128G and 128H were added originally to G. L. c. Ill by St. 1967, c. 718, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 5A, respectively, ostensibly in response to a report on migratory labor commissioned by the Legislative Research Council. See 1967 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Senate Doc. No. 1303 at 14-53. We may consider this report for any light it might shed on the resulting legislation. See <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>New Bedford, Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>330 Mass. 422, 429 (1953). The report recognized that the earnings of migrant workers were among the lowest in our economy and that such workers were excluded from many social advances available to other segments of the working population, including minimum wage rates, adequate child labor protection, unemployment insurance, full workmen\u2019s compensation, social security coverage, and collective bargaining. It further noted their special problems in the areas of housing, sanitation, transportation, education, and health services, and observed that migrant workers lack cohesiveness with the community into which they have temporarily settled. The Legislative Research Council concluded that \u201cin the absence of federal or state protections or coordinated programs,\u201d the migrant worker \u201cseems destined to a continual life of poverty and deprivation.\u201d 1967 Senate Doc. No. 1303 at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Seeking, as it does, to protect this class of persons from the above mentioned conditions, the legislation bears an obvious rational relationship to the promotion of the public health and welfare. See <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Next, we must determine whether the means selected to effectuate the purpose of the legislation \u201care reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose.\u201d <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Hempstead, supra </em>at 595, quoting from <em>Lawton </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>152 U.S. 133, 137 (1894). Statute 1967, c. 718, established a minimum wage for farm workers, encouraged the development of recreational and educational opportunities for such workers, and recognized their rights of free ingress to and egress from the premises of their employers, as well as rights of visitation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>For purposes of the instant case, we need consider only one aspect of this remedial legislation \u2014 the provision which controls the access of visitors. At the very least, such access provides a means to alleviate the isolation that the farmworkers necessarily experience. See Sherman &amp; Levy, Free Access to Migrant Labor Camps, 57 A.B.A.J. 434, 435 (1971). Further, it helps supply necessary supportive services which the workers would otherwise have to seek in the surrounding community or else forgo. \u201cWhen he seeks help, the migrant has neither the time, the money nor the transportation to leave the grower\u2019s fields or the confines of the residential camp to find assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434. Other courts have recognized the right of access as a necessary concomitant of the right to organize. See e.g., <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>16 Cal. 3d 392, appeal dismissed for want of substantial Federal question sub nom. <em>Kubo </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd., </em>429 U.S. 802 (1976). Finally, access for attorneys and paralegal persons serves as a means of assuring that the migrant workers are informed of their statutory and constitutional rights. See generally, Spriggs, Access of Visitors to Labor Camps on Privately Owned Property, 21 U. Fla. L. Rev. 295 (1969).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that access as guaranteed by the statute and the regulations is a reasonable means to attain the goals set by the Legislature to regulate reasonably the working and living conditions of migrant workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">Consolidated argues, alternatively, that the access regulation is so broad that it permits access for those whose presence in the camp would in no way aid in achieving the ultimate legislative goal, thus needlessly encroaching on its property rights. As we have already stated, our role is not to evaluate the wisdom of any particular statute or regulation. <em>Druzik </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Haverhill, </em>324 Mass. 129, 138-139 (1949). Nor is this a situation wherein the administrative body need find the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d regulation. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leis, </em>355 Mass. 189,195-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>196 (1969), and cases cited. Moreover, Consolidated has failed to present, as it is required to do, any factual basis in the record which would demonstrate the constitutional overbreadth of the statute or any of the regulations. See <em>Colella </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>360 Mass. 152, 156 (1971). We therefore hold that G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 128G and 128H, and their accompanying regulations, are a valid exercise of the police power, and that they do not offend against the due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Finally, the appellant urges that the statute which seeks to regulate only farm labor camps violates its rights to the equal protection of the laws in derogation of both the United States Constitution and art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. It claims that other types of temporary housing facilities are not similarly regulated. We think it a major difference, however, that Consolidated stands in an employer-employee relationship with those in its facilities. Thus, the classification rests on \u201csome ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced [are] treated alike.\u201d <em>F.S. Royster Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>253 U.S. 412, 415 (1920). <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>371 Mass. 773 (1977). Moreover, \u201c[w]hen legislative authority is exerted within a proper area, it need not embrace every conceivable problem within that field. The Legislature may proceed one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>361 Mass. 401, 417 (1972). We find that a rational basis exists for the classification and therefore Consolidated\u2019s equal protection claim fails. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s Drywall Co., </em>366 Mass. 539, 545 (1974); <em>San Antonio Independent School Dist. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">3. <em>Validity of the regulations. </em>Consolidated next mounts a frontal attack on the facial validity of the visitation regulations promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 128H. While the statute recognizes the rights of farmworkers to receive visitors, the regulations authorized by the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>speak in terms of the rights of visitors to gain access to those residing within the farm labor camps. Even where no individual employee invites the particular visitor, the visitor\u2019s access is guaranteed. This, the appellant argues, is an administrative venture beyond the scope of the delegated authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">We note that where litigation focuses on the power of an administrative agency to act as the department did, the controversy is \u201cespecially susceptible of resolution by a declaratory decree.\u201d <em>Boston Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fawcett, </em>357 Mass. 535, 537 (1970). <em>Ciszewski </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Bd., </em>367 Mass. 135, 139 (1975). In addition, we are mindful that the regulations arguably do lend themselves to the construction urged by Consolidated. However, we are bound to test the regulations by the same standard which would apply to a statute. Thus, we must apply all rational presumptions in favor of the validity of the administrative action and not declare it void unless its provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate. <em>Colella </em>v. <em>State Racing Comm\u2019n, supra </em>at 156-157. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Westwood, </em>226 Mass. 268 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The purpose of \u00a7 128H, as declared in its title, is to \u201cfurther [regulate] the visitation rights of migrant workers living in quarters apart from the living quarters of their employer.\u201d St. 1971, c. 373. In accordance with this stated objective, the department was vested with broad authority to effectuate the purposes of the act. In such a situation, \u201cthe validity of a regulation promulgated thereunder will be sustained so long as it is \u2018reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mourning </em>v. <em>Family Publications Serv. Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 369 (1973), quoting from <em>Thorpe </em>v. <em>Housing Auth. of Durham, </em>393 U.S. 268, 280-281 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Aware that the Legislature has recognized the necessity of administrative flexibility to prevent the abuses which the act seeks to remedy, we conclude that the regulations are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The regulations create two general classes of people who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>might seek entry to farm labor camps: visitors, reg. 2 A, and those affiliated with one of six specifically enumerated public agencies or service organizations who seek access in their official capacities, reg. 2 B. See note 4 <em>supra. </em>The \u201cvisitors\u201d class includes those who, although within one of the six categories, seek admission in nonofficial capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Certain restrictions are placed by the regulations on those who are classified as visitors. First, their access is limited to specific time periods. Reg. 2 A. Second, if the operator so desires, he may \u201cask a visitor for reasonable identification but shall not deny access on this basis.\u201d Reg. 4 B. We read this latter provision as requiring that this visitor (1) identify himself and (2) state in general terms the purpose of his visit. However, the operator may not require the general visitor to furnish him with a specific form of identification, nor may he unreasonably deny access on the basis of the visitor\u2019s stated purpose. In addition, such visitor need not, in order to gain admission, demonstrate that he or she was invited by a particular employee or that he or she obtained advance approval from the operator for the particular visit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At the time of the visitor\u2019s arrival at the facility, the operator may inquire only as to the general nature of the visit in order to determine that it is not illegal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The department has recognized that an individual employee may have the right to decline visitation in a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>instance. To prevent abuse of this right, the department requires oral communication of this desire from the employee to the visitor. Reg. 2 C, note 4 <em>supra. </em>In addition, the agency realized that the power to terminate could be misused; absent a provision to the contrary, the operator could enlist the aid of one or several employees to block access to the entire population by the mere exercise of the veto right. Thus, reg. 2 C states: \u201cA worker may terminate a visitation with regard to himself only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">So construed, the regulations strike a balance between the operator\u2019s contractual obligation to ensure the welfare of the employees, and the young farmworkers\u2019 statutorily recognized right to receive visitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">On the other hand, those specifically enumerated in reg. 2 B are not \u201cvisitors,\u201d and their access is not restricted by the provisions which affect the admission of those who are properly characterized as visitors. The department has recognized that persons within these categories serve the welfare of the farm labor camp populace as a whole and, therefore, broader access is guaranteed them. Accordingly, such persons face a heavier burden of identification. They must (1) identify themselves; (2) demonstrate that they indeed fall within one of these special classes; and (3) show that they seek admission in their official capacities. Once the individual has complied with these threshold requirements, his or her access cannot be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Consolidated argues that this regulation underscores the department\u2019s encroachment into areas beyond the authority delegated to it, for G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 128H, states only that \u201c[a] worker... shall have reasonable rights of visitation in his living quarters <em>outside of regular working hours\u201d </em>(emphasis added). However, as we have stated, persons within this classification are not properly characterized as visitors. Instead, they provide necessary services such as medical care or spiritual guidance or they ensure the operator\u2019s compliance with various statutory and administrative requirements. Regulation 2 B operates as an exemption from the provisions of reg. 2 A. The department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>is also empowered to inspect farm labor camps, to involve local and State agencies in the development of recreational and educational opportunities for these workers, and to inform farm workers of their rights. G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 128H. The access provision is aimed at effectuating these legislative purposes and does not exceed the powers delegated to the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">We hold that those who provide necessary services may not be barred by application of the time restrictions which pertain to visitors. We do think, however, that the requirement of reasonableness which applies expressly to workers\u2019 rights to receive visitors applies to those providing necessary services as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Because the record contains no evidence of any person from this class having been refused admission, we need not surmise as to the outer limits of reasonable access. Nor are we confronted with a situation wherein a worker declined to visit with such a person. We leave for another day the question whether some aspect of the department\u2019s actions goes beyond the contours of the statute\u2019s delegation. We hold that, on the facts before us, the regulations are reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation, <em>Mourning </em>v. <em>Family Publications Serv., Inc., supra, </em>and therefore they are valid. Nevertheless, factual situations \u201cmay show up particular features of the regulations in a new light and in that event we shall not be foreclosed from reconsidering the views here expressed.\u201d <em>Cambridge Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub.

Ill, \u00a7 128H, as amended by St. 1971, c. 373, reads as follows: \u201cThe department of public health shall, as a part of its in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>spection of a <em>site </em>for a farm labor camp, determine what educational and recreational opportunities may be available for migrant workers, and shall, as far as is practical, encourage the development of such opportunities in cooperation with local and state agencies. The department shall protect the right of the migrant worker to enter and leave the premises of the employer during the period of his employment, and shall include in its certificate of occupancy a notification to the worker that such right exists, notwithstanding any contract provision to the contrary. A worker living in quarters apart from the living quarters of his employer shall have reasonable rights of visitation in his living quarters outside of regular working hours and the certificate of occupancy issued by the department shall include notification, in English and in Spanish, of said rights. The department shall establish, by promulgation of regulations, such minimum standards relating to the rights of visitation under this section as will ensure the adequate protection of said rights. The superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity upon petition brought by the department in the name of the commonwealth to restrain and enjoin violations of this, or of section one hundred and twenty-eight G, or regulations promulgated thereunder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b859-7\"> Consolidated filed the requisite affidavit declaring that \u201creliance upon administrative relief would be futile.\u201d G.

Since it places few if any visitation restrictions on the adults, the discussion of visitation issues by us relates primarily to the younger workers, although applicable to all migrant workers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b862-4\"> The Regulations on Rights of Visitation for Migrant Workers, 13 Code of Mass.

Visiting hours on working days will begin after working hours or at 6:00 p.m., whichever is the earliest, and end no earlier than four (4) hours after the end of the working day or at 10:30 p.m., whichever is the latest. On non-working days visiting hours will be in effect from at least 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-10\">\u201cB.

Another definition, entitled to no less weight than that cited by Consolidated, is: a \u201cseasonal farmworker who performs or has performed during the preceding twelve months agricultural labor which requires travel such that the worker is unable to return to his/her domicile (accepted place of residence) within the same day.\u201d 42 Fed.
