County Court (Ledina, J.) held a reconstruction hearing. Following that hearing, County Court determined that defendant was present during the interview of the juror in question, as well as during all the other juror interviews that were conducted by the court. Upon our review, we find no basis to disturb County Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, raised for the first time in his supplemental reply brief, are not properly before this Court <em>(see Stewart v County of Albany, </em>300 AD2d 984, 985 n 1 [2002]; <em>People v White, </em>244 AD2d 765, 767 [1997], <em>lv denied </em>91 NY2d 1014 [1998]) and, in any event, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Mercure, Spain, Lahtinen and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
