Reordered to facilitate review, they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">I. Whether the circuit court erred in instructing the jury that self-defense is not a defense to affray;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">II. Whether the circuit court erred in allowing the jury to consider affray as an unlawful underlying act for involuntary manslaughter because the State failed to show that the fight occurred in public or caused terror to the people; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">III. Whether the circuit court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that defense of property may be a defense to assault and affray.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">Because the circuit court erred in instructing the jury that self-defense is not a defense to affray, we reverse and remand. We shall, however, briefly address the two remaining issues, as they are likely to arise again if there is a retrial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">On Saturday, July 2, 2011, Justin Carter and his wife, Evelyn Carter, held a cookout on the back porch of their home in Gaithersburg, Maryland, to kick off the July 4th weekend. Among the guests were Susie Palencia, Mrs. Carter\u2019s sister. Ms. Palencia and appellant were, at that time, a couple and together the parents of two daughters. Sometime that evening, appellant called the Carters\u2019 home, looking for Ms. Palencia. Upon learning that the Carters were hosting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>cookout and that Ms. Palencia and his daughters were there, appellant drove, on his moped, over to the Carters\u2019 home. At some point after appellant arrived, Ms. Palencia left the party, taking their two children with her, but appellant stayed behind.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The witnesses to the tragic occurrence that followed provided accounts of that incident, which, while consistent in some respects, varied as to others, reflecting perhaps the divided loyalties of the witnesses or the significant amounts of alcohol consumed by them at the cookout, a consumption in which both appellant and the victim, Justin Carter, were not reluctant participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Undisputed by all accounts, however, is that what began at the cookout as a \u201cplayful\u201d wrestling match between appellant and Carter escalated into a fistfight; that, after that fight was broken up, it was revivified when Carter\u2019s wife tripped and fell, a fall that Carter attributed to appellant; and that, after that confrontation ended, it re-erupted when Carter, enraged over the refusal of appellant to shake his hand, kicked appellant\u2019s parked moped and walked towards him and took the first swing. Several punches later, Carter fell unconscious to the ground and died that night from blows he had received to his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The next day, appellant was arrested and was thereafter charged, in a single-count indictment, with involuntary manslaughter. In March 2012, he was tried by a jury in the Montgomery County circuit court and convicted of that offense. After receiving a \u201cflat sentence\u201d of five years\u2019 imprisonment, he noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">We begin our review of the three issues before us by first defining an \u201caffray.\u201d An \u201caffray,\u201d a common law offense, has been defined as \u201cthe fighting together of two or more persons, either by mutual consent or otherwise, in some public place, to the terror of the people.\u201d 2 Joel Prentiss Bishop, <em>Bishop on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 1, at 1 (9th ed.1923). <em>Accord Hickman v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 238, 248, 996 A.2d 974 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The \u201cpublic place\u201d and \u201cterror to the people\u201d elements of affray are closely related. Indeed, evidence that a fight occurred in a \u201cpublic place\u201d may be sufficient to establish, ipso facto, that the fight resulted in \u201cterror to the people.\u201d But the next question is, whether a fight in a public place, where the only witnesses to the fight are those participating in it, may constitute \u201cterror to the public.\u201d <em>Hickman, </em>193 Md.App. at 247-48 n. 7, 996 A.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">To answer that question, we turn to <em>Briscoe v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 462, 240 A.2d 109 (1968). Though not precisely on point, <em>Briscoe </em>provides a compelling analogy. In that case, the crime at issue was not \u201caffray\u201d but the common law offense of \u201criot,\u201d which, in <em>Briscoe, </em>occurred on the grounds of a Maryland prison. As an affray, the crime of riot requires that the conduct in question poses a terror to others. Specifically, that offense is defined as \u201cthree or more persons \u2018unlawfully assembled to carry out a common purpose in such violent or turbulent manner as to terrify others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schlamp v. State, </em>390 Md. 724, 737, 891 A.2d 327 (2006) (quoting <em>Cohen v. State, 173 </em>Md. 216, 221, 195 A. 532 (1937)).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Pointing out that the State had \u201coffered no direct evidence to show that any of the witnesses, inmates of the penitentiary, or residents of the City of Baltimore were placed in fear or terror as a result of the riot,\u201d Briscoe claimed that the evidence did not support his conviction for that offense. We rejected that claim, observing that \u201cthere may be a riot, even though no person or persons are actually terrified, if the violent and turbulent execution of any unlawful act committed by a sufficient number of persons tends to alarm and terrify law-abiding citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468-69, 240 A.2d 109. In <em>Schlamp v. State, </em>390 Md. 724, 891 A.2d 327 (2006), the Court of Appeals cited <em>Briscoe </em>with approval, asserting that \u201cit was not necessary to prove that any particular persons were placed in fear or terror,\u201d and reversed Schlamp\u2019s conviction for \u201criot\u201d because \u201cthere was no evidence of other tumultuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>behavior that struck terror or was likely to strike terror in anyone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736-37, 891 A.2d 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">We reach the same conclusion as to an affray, as there is no rational basis for drawing a distinction between \u201criot\u201d and \u201caffray,\u201d for purposes of establishing \u201cterror to the people,\u201d a point a leading treatise makes when it states that, to establish the \u201cterror\u201d element of affray, \u201c[tjerror need not actually exist among the people\u201d; rather, \u201c[i]n a legal sense, fighting in public is to the terror of the people.\u201d Lewis Hochheimer, <em>The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure, </em>ch. 36, \u00a7 243, at 281 (2d ed.1904) (citing <em>State v. Sumner, </em>36 S.C.L. (5 Strob.) 53 (S.C.Ct.App.1850)). Hence, to establish an affray, the State need only show that the acts and surrounding circumstances were \u201clikely to strike terror in anyone,\u201d <em>Schlamp, </em>390 Md. at 737, 891 A.2d 327, not that it actually has in any specific individual. We turn next to appellant\u2019s three claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Appellant\u2019s first claim is that the circuit court erred in instructing the jury that self-defense is not a defense to affray. Although the State acknowledges that self-defense is generally a defense to affray, it insists that appellant, in his opening statement, \u201cconceded\u201d that the fighting which took place was mutual, thereby negating self-defense; and that, in any event, the evidence showed that he invited Carter to step off the patio to fight. In other words, the facts of this case were, according to the State, \u201cinconsistent\u201d with self-defense and, hence, the circuit court arrived at the correct result (though for the wrong reason) and therefore committed no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">To begin with, self-defense, in our view, may be invoked as a defense to affray. An affray, by its very definition, involves \u201cfighting.\u201d And as we said in <em>Bryant v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 237, 574 A.2d 29 (1990), where we contemplated whether self-defense could be used as a defense to maiming, a form of aggravated assault, \u201cthe simple and frequently ne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>glected larger truth is that the defense of self-defense applies to assaultive crimes generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 574 A.2d 29. Consistent with that line of reasoning, the Court of Appeals subsequently, in <em>Jones v. </em>State, 357 Md. 408, 745 A.2d 396 (2000), concluded that self-defense is also a defense to reckless endangerment, reasoning that \u201cthe elements of self-defense necessarily negate a required element of reckless endangerment,\u201d to wit, \u201cthat a reasonable person would not have engaged in the conduct at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 745 A.2d 396. That same reasoning applies to an affray, where fighting is an essential element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">But we may be merely stating what was, at one time, commonly understood.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Hamlin v. State, </em>67 Md. 333, 338, 10 A. 214 (1887) (observing that \u201cwhere two persons are indicted for an affray; if the breach of the peace has been proved, the effort of each traverser would be to show that he was acting in self-defence against the attack of the other\u201d) (Bryan, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Moreover, the appellate courts of other states have reached the same conclusion. In <em>Coyle v. State, </em>72 S.W. 847 (Tex. Crim.App.1903), a case that presents the very same issue now before us, that is, whether a defendant charged with both assault and affray was entitled to a self-defense jury instruction as to both charges, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas considered whether a trial court erred in refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>instruct a jury that self-defense is a defense to affray. In that case, \u201cthere was a quarrel between the parties\u201d and conflicting evidence as to whether Coyle or his opponent \u201coccasioned the quarrel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 848. Coyle was subsequently charged with two counts: aggravated assault and affray. At the conclusion of his trial, the court \u201cgave a charge on self-defense as applicable to the first count on aggravated assault, but failed to give a charge on self-defense as applicable to the second count on affray, although a charge was requested by [Coyle] on this subject,\u201d whereupon Coyle was convicted of affray but acquitted of aggravated assault. <em>Id. </em>at 847. Reversing his conviction for affray, the Texas appellate court observed that, under the circumstances, \u201cit should have been left for the jury, under appropriate instructions, to say whether or not [Coyle] acted in self-defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The Supreme Court of Georgia said much the same thing in <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>13 Ga. 322 (1853), when it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">[W]here the evidence shows that one of the parties acted entirely in self-defence, while the other assaulted and beat him, the aggressor may be guilty of an assault and battery, but neither of them guilty of an affray[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">More recently, appellate courts in Massachusetts and Alaska have embraced this precept. <em>Commonwealth v. Nee, </em>83 Mass.App.Ct. 441, 985 N.E.2d 118, 126 n. 8 (2013) (noting that \u201c[n]othing in the definition of affray precludes a defendant so charged from asserting self-defense or defense of another in justification of his conduct\u201d); <em>Dawson v. State, </em>264 P.3d 851, 854 (Alaska Ct.App.2011) (observing that if \u201cone person unlawfully attacked another, and the other person used force in an effort to defend himself, the instigator was guilty of assault and battery, while the other participant was entirely innocent of crime,\u201d that is, \u201cthere was no affray\u201d). <em>Accord </em>Charles E. Torc\u00eda, 4 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 536 at 194 (15th ed.1996); 2A <em>Corpus Juris Secundum, Affray, </em>\u00a7 15 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Although the State admits that the circuit court gave the \u25a0wrong reason for its ruling, it nonetheless contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>court did not err in instructing that self-defense is not a defense to an affray under the circumstances of this case. The instruction was appropriate, the State insists, because appellant \u201cspecifically conceded\u201d that the fighting was mutual and because the evidence confirmed that mutuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">There is little basis for the State\u2019s assertion that appellant \u201cconceded\u201d that the fight was mutual. Indeed, the only support for its claim, as the State admits, is an assertion made by appellant\u2019s counsel, during opening statement, that \u201c[b]oth men entered that fight willingly\u201d and that they both \u201cpushed and punched and fought until one of them went down and didn\u2019t get up.\u201d An opening statement, of course, is not evidence, <em>see </em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions 3:00 (2d ed.2012) (observing that \u201c[ojpening statements and closing arguments of lawyers are not evidence\u201d) (\u201cMPJI-Cr\u201d), and is often used as a vehicle to present a number of possible defenses and even conflicting factual accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Nor did the trial court find that the evidence presented was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with self-defense. In fact, the court, during a bench conference that occurred just before the jury was instructed, declared that self-defense was \u201cgenerated\u201d by the evidence. Then, upon the urging of the State to limit application of self-defense to just second-degree assault, the court, over appellant\u2019s objection, did so, instructing the jury that, \u201cin the context of this case, self defense is a defense only to the assault and not to an affray.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Before this Court, the State now seems to suggest that self-defense was not generated by the facts of this case, citing the \u201cmutuality\u201d of the affray, which, it maintains, was \u201cinconsistent with self-defense.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To place this claim in perspective, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>we shall address what degree of mutuality is required to prove an affray.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">There are two ways a fight may be deemed \u201cmutual\u201d for purposes of affray. To be found guilty, a person \u201cmust be unlawfully fighting, either by agreement, or have brought on the fight himself.\u201d Justin Miller, <em>Criminal Law, </em>ch. 18, \u00a7 168, at 490 (West 1934); <em>see also </em>Rollin M. Perkins &amp; Ronald N. Boyce, <em>Criminal Law </em>479-80 (3d ed.1982). But whether \u201cmutuality\u201d means that there was an agreement to fight or that the accused provoked the fight, mutuality remains a question of fact and thus falls within the province of the fact finder. <em>Atkins v. State, </em>421 Md. 434, 443, 26 A.3d 979 (2011). In other words, where a defendant has been charged with affray, the question whether he engaged in mutual fighting or, instead, merely acted in self-defense, is for the fact finder to determine and not for the court to decide as a matter of law. That being so, we agree with appellant\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe State\u2019s argument would effectively permit the judge, rather than the jury, to find that [Carter and appellant] engaged in mutual combat.\u201d We therefore conclude that, where a defendant is charged with affray, it is incumbent upon the trial court, upon request, to instruct the jury regarding self-defense, whenever that issue is generated by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">We turn next to the question whether self-defense, specifically perfect self-defense, was generated by the evidence presented below.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The elements of perfect self-defense are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>(1) The accused must have had reasonable grounds to believe himself in apparent imminent or immediate danger of death or serious bodily harm from his assailant or potential assailant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">(2) The accused must have in fact believed himself in this danger;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">(3) The accused claiming the right of self-defense must not have been the aggressor or provoked the conflict; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">(4) The force used must not have been unreasonable and excessive, that is, the force must not have been more force than the exigency demanded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\"><em>State v. Faulkner, </em>301 Md. 482, 485-86, 483 A.2d 759 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\"> To be entitled to a jury instruction as to either perfect or imperfect self-defense, \u201cthe defendant has the burden of initially producing some evidence on the issue ... sufficient to give rise to a jury issue.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Dykes v. State, </em>319 Md. 206, 216, 571 A.2d 1251 (1990) (internal citations and quotations omitted). The \u201csource of the evidence is immaterial; it may emanate solely from the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 217, 571 A.2d 1251; or from a State\u2019s witness. <em>Howell v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 675, 682-83, 468 A.2d 688 (1983). Moreover, it \u201cis of no matter that the self-defense claim is overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary. If there is any evidence relied on by the defendant which, if believed, would support his claim that he acted in self-defense, the defendant has met his burden.\u201d <em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 217, 571 A.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Recently, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed this \u201cany evidence\u201d standard in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>422 Md. 533, 30 A.3d 955 (2011). There, it held that the defendant was entitled to an imperfect self-defense jury instruction to the crime of first-degree murder, even though his claim of self-defense was \u201c \u2018overwhelmed by evidence to the contrary,\u2019 \u201d 422 Md. at 542-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>43, 30 A.3d 955 (quoting <em>Dykes, </em>319 Md. at 217, 571 A.2d 1251), and reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 544, 30 A.3d 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In the ease at bar, there was evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to appellant, <em>State v. Martin, </em>329 Md. 351, 354, 619 A.2d 992 (1993), that suggested that there were three separate confrontations at the Carters\u2019 cookout, a situation not unlike the one before us in <em>Corbin v. State, </em>94 Md.App. 21, 614 A.2d 1329 (1992), where we considered whether a murder defendant\u2019s proposed self-defense jury instruction should have been given. In that case, we said that an inference could be drawn, based solely on the defendant\u2019s testimony, that there were two separate confrontations, only minutes or even seconds apart, \u201crather than one \u2018continuing affray.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 614 A.2d 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In the instant case, Jeremy Vasquez, a guest at the Carters\u2019 cookout, testified that, at the beginning of the fight, \u201c[i]t just looked they,\u201d referring to Carter and appellant, \u201cwere like rough housing.\u201d While they were \u201cwrestling\u201d on the ground, Justin Carter was, according to Vasquez, \u201con top\u201d of appellant. At some point, testified Vasquez, Carter \u201cgrabbed\u201d appellant\u2019s arm and then, according to another guest, \u201cbent it back,\u201d causing appellant to emit \u201ca screech sound, like it hurt\u201d or, as appellant put it, it \u201cfelt like something tore in my arm.\u201d After appellant then \u201cgot up\u201d and told Carter \u201cto get the F. off of\u2019 him, the two men separated, though not without exchanging angry words. But, pertinent to our analysis, their physical engagement, at least for the moment, had ended. Carter then walked over to a chair and sat down, while appellant remained standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">After the \u201cwrestling\u201d had concluded, a verbal altercation ensued between Carter and appellant. Malicki Bangoura, another guest at the cookout, avowed that Justin Carter was the \u201cfirst\u201d to get angry, \u201ctalking to [appellant] all types of ways.\u201d Carter was \u201cyelling,\u201d testified Bangoura, but appellant was not. In fact, appellant, as described by Bangoura, \u201cwas calm like,\u201d suggesting he was \u201cjust going to leave,\u201d just \u201chop on [his] moped and leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>According to Vasquez, the parties\u2019 verbal exchange lasted \u201cprobably, like two minutes, maybe less than that,\u201d when Justin Carter\u2019s -wife, Evelyn, stepped \u201cin the middle of the argument\u201d between Carter and appellant and, in her words, \u201ctripped on this little step\u201d and fell. Carter, apparently believing that appellant had intentionally caused her fall, declared that \u201cnobody knocks my girl over\u201d and then, in Bangoura\u2019s words, \u201chopped out of his chair in an aggressive manner,\u201d ran towards appellant and \u201cgave him a firm angry push,\u201d whereupon both men started throwing punches at each other. Appellant struck Carter several times in the head, causing him to \u201cdrop[ ].\u201d But, according to Bangoura, he \u201cgot right back up,\u201d whereupon Evelyn Carter pushed appellant out of the way and, in appellant\u2019s word, \u201cseparated\u201d the two men. She was, by then, as Vasquez put it, \u201cbasically screaming, telling everybody to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Shortly thereafter, Carter, according to Vasquez, offered to shake appellant\u2019s hand. When appellant declined that offer, Carter, according to Bangoura, \u201cgot more aggressive.\u201d He \u201cran up to [appellant\u2019s] moped\u201d and kicked it over, exclaiming that \u201cif you\u2019re going to (unintelligible) my prize possession, I\u2019m going to (unintelligible) prize possession.\u201d Looking at appellant, Carter \u201ctook a couple steps\u201d towards him and, according to appellant, swung at him and missed. Appellant responded by punching Carter \u201ca couple\u201d of times and knocking him down. Then, \u201cgrabbing] his moped\u201d and pushing it up the street, appellant left the scene, accompanied by Bangoura.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Appellant thus presented \u201csome evidence\u201d of all four elements of perfect self-defense. The testimony, which we have just outlined, when \u201c[considered in the light most favorable to\u201d appellant, <em>Martin, </em>329 Md. at 354, 619 A.2d 992, could, if believed, have led the jury to conclude that appellant was not the aggressor and did not provoke any of the three confrontations but, most importantly, did not precipitate the last and final encounter. Furthermore, the jury could have found that he had reasonable grounds to believe that he faced imminent or immediate threat of serious bodily harm from Justin Car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>ter; that he actually did so believe; and that, in striking Carter \u201ctwo [or] three times,\u201d he did not use excessive force in defending himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In short, there was sufficient evidence to generate a self-defense instruction, and thus the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that self-defense is a defense to affray. And that error, we cannot say, was harmless, since, under the circumstances, there is no way to know whether the jury convicted appellant only on the ground that affray was the underlying unlawful act supporting his manslaughter conviction or that the jury found, instead, an absence of self-defense and that second-degree assault was also an underlying unlawful act, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Appellant claims that the circuit court erred in instructing the jury that it could convict him of involuntary manslaughter, based upon affray, because the State failed to present sufficient evidence either that the fight occurred at a public place or that it caused \u201cterror to the people.\u201d Pointing out that the fight began on the back porch of the Carters\u2019 home, that it thereafter was confined to their yard, and that there was no evidence that the Carters\u2019 barbecue was open to the general public, appellant insists that the fight occurred in the \u201ccurtilage\u201d of a private dwelling, and therefore did not take place at a \u201cpublic place\u201d or in \u201cpublic\u201d and that there were no public bystanders to be terrified.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Although appellant failed to object to this instruction and thus the issue was not preserved for appellate review, we shall nonetheless exercise our discretion and address it, given the likelihood that this issue will arise again upon retrial. Md. Rule 8-131 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Our discussion of that issue begins with the observation that appellant misconstrues the nature of \u201cpublic place,\u201d as that term has been interpreted by courts as an element of an affray. He cites no authority, nor has our research disclosed any, suggesting that the concept of \u201ccurtilage\u201d is relevant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>applicable to the question of what is a \u201cpublic place\u201d in affray cases. Indeed, the overwhelming weight of authority suggests that, if fighting occurs on private land that is sufficiently near a public road or neighboring dwellings, then the \u201cpublic place\u201d element of affray is satisfied. <em>In re May, </em>357 N.C. 423, 584 S.E.2d 271, 274 (2003) (observing that \u201cprivate property that is situated near enough to public thoroughfares that citizens using such thoroughfares could bear witness to the altercation\u201d is deemed \u201cpublic\u201d for \u201cpurposes of proving an affray\u201d); <em>Carwile v. State, </em>35 Ala. 392, 393 (1860) (holding that \u201ca place within an enclosed lot, ninety feet from a street\u201d in a town, \u201cand which could be seen from the street, is a public place, according to the import of the phrase in the common-law definition of an affray\u201d); Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>supra, </em>at 480 (observing that \u201c \u2018public place\u2019 in this sense includes any place open to public view and close enough to the public so that fighting there may tend to cause public alarm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Moreover, the case upon which appellant relies for the contrary proposition, <em>Gamble v. State, </em>113 Ga. 701, 39 S.E. 301 (1901), is, when subjected to scrutiny, not inconsistent with the cases we have just cited. In <em>Gamble, </em>the Supreme Court of Georgia held that a private house, \u201cabout 200 yards from any other residence\u201d and \u201c \u2018near\u2019 a public road,\u201d was not a public place for purposes of affray. But it reached that conclusion based, in part, on the total lack of evidence establishing either the distance from the house to the road or whether the fighting \u201ccould be seen or heard from the road.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302. In so ruling, the <em>Gamble </em>Court, in fact, acknowledged the general rule that a public road is \u201cprima facie\u201d a public place and \u201cmay give that character to places in sight and hearing from the road,\u201d citing, among other authorities, <em>Carwile v. State, supra. Gamble, </em>39 S.E. at 302. We therefore conclude that <em>Gamble </em>merely stands for the unremarkable proposition that there must be some evidence that a public road is, in fact, near enough to a private dwelling to extend its public character to that private dwelling, an evidentiary showing which, though absent in <em>Gamble, </em>was, as we shall explain, satisfied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>It is undisputed that the altercation between appellant and Justin Carter began in a private area. But the third and final confrontation took place on the Carters\u2019 lawn, within a few feet of a street. Furthermore, the aerial photograph of the Carters\u2019 home and its surroundings that was introduced at trial plainly shows that there were several neighboring homes within, at most, a 300-foot radius of the Carters\u2019 home. Moreover, the Carters\u2019 home abuts a public street in a heavily populated, suburban neighborhood, as reflected in the photograph introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Given that it was only necessary that there be \u201csome evidence\u201d that the fight occurred in a \u201cpublic place,\u201d the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that affray could be considered an underlying unlawful act for purposes of establishing manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Appellant asserts that the circuit court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that defense of property is a defense to assault and affray. He claims that such an instruction was generated by the evidence, because all witnesses to the fight testified that he and Carter \u201cresumed fighting immediately after\u201d Carter kicked his moped and that he \u201cindicated\u201d that Carter\u2019s act \u201cdirectly caused them to fight.\u201d This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">A person may \u201cuse reasonable force, not intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily harm, to prevent or terminate another\u2019s intrusion upon\u201d his \u201clands or chattels,\u201d if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">\u201c(a) the intrusion is not privileged or the other intentionally or negligently causes the actor to believe that it is not privileged, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">(b) the actor reasonably believes that the intrusion can be prevented or terminated only by the force used, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-10\">(c) the actor has first requested the other to desist, and the other has disregarded the request, or the actor reasonably believes that a request will be useless, or that substantial harm will be done before it can be made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number><em>Vancherie v. Siperly, </em>243 Md. 366, 371, 221 A.2d 356 (1966) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 77 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Even construing the testimony in the light most favorable to appellant, it is clear that the third confrontation between him and Justin Carter was not a result of an effort by appellant to protect his moped. Appellant never testified that that was what precipitated their final confrontation. In fact, when asked why he struck Carter \u201cat that point,\u201d appellant replied: \u201cBecause he swung,\u201d not because appellant was trying to protect his property. And, in any event, the testimony suggested that, after kicking appellant\u2019s moped, Carter had turned and walked away from it. In other words, Carter\u2019s \u201cintrusion upon\u201d appellant\u2019s \u201cchattel\u201d had ended by the time the fight between Carter and appellant resumed. Thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury as to defense of property, as that issue was not generated by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED. CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\">. We cannot merely rely on <em>Hamlin v. State, </em>67 Md. 333, 10 A. 214 (1887), and say that it settled the question. The Court, in <em>Hamlin, </em>never even considered affray, and the language we are quoting comes from a dissent, where it was expressed in a hypothetical. In the many decades since <em>Hamlin, </em>there are essentially no Maryland appellate decisions addressing the elements of affray, until <em>Hickman, </em>in 2010, and that decision does not address whether self-defense is a defense to affray.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-8\">. The question before the Court in <em>Hamlin </em>was how many peremptory strikes may be exercised when defendants are tried jointly, under statutes then in effect, Art. 50, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 13. Although Judge Bryan dissented from the majority\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutes, his remarks about affray appear to reflect the common understanding of the law of affray at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\">. \"A trial court must give a requested jury instruction where (1) the instruction is a correct statement of law; (2) the instruction is applicable to the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in instructions actually given.\u201d <em>Carroll v. State, </em>428 Md. 679, 689, 53 A.3d 1159 (2012) (citations and quotations omitted). The first requirement was met, as we have just explained, and, in light of the court\u2019s instruction that self-defense applies only to assault and not affray, there is no contention, by the State, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>content of appellant\u2019s requested instruction was fairly covered elsewhere in the instructions actually given.
