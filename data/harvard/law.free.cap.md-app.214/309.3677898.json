KENNEY, III (Ret\u2019d, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">A jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County convicted Ronald Sinclair, appellant, of charges related to carjacking, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, and possession of cocaine. He was sentenced to a twenty-year term for carjacking, a concurrent twenty-year term for conspiracy to commit armed carjacking, a concurrent four-year term for possession of cocaine, a concurrent five-year term for possession of a regulated firearm by a prohibited person, and a consecutive twenty-year term for use of a handgun in a felony or crime of violence. The remaining convictions merged for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Appellant presents three questions, which we have consolidated into two, reordered, and rephrased as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">1. Did the trial court err in ruling that [appellant\u2019s] cell phone could be searched without a warrant incident to his valid arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">2. Did the trial court err in admitting other crimes evidence, and, if not, did the trial court then abuse its discretion in determining that appellant\u2019s statement to his probation officer was proper rebuttal evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">For reasons that follow, we answer \u201cno\u201d to both questions, and, accordingly, affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">FACTUAL and PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AvA\">Motion <em>in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">Immediately before the jury was selected and trial began, appellant, through defense counsel, moved <em>in limine </em>to suppress photographs of car rims found on appellant\u2019s cell phone, which was seized at the time of his arrest. During argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>on the motion, defense counsel stated that at some point after appellant was arrested, \u201c[t]he law enforcement officer opens the cell phone, goes through it, and apparently pulls out what purports to be some photographs.\u201d This search, according to defense counsel, violated appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment \u201cright against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Defense counsel further argued: \u201cI know there\u2019s been some case law about if the phone is just opened, for example, similar to a digital phonebook, that might be permissible, Your Honor, but here the State did more in the absence of a warrant. And in the absence of exigent circumstances.\u201d Defense counsel also argued that the images recovered from appellant\u2019s phone constituted impermissible hearsay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, if it\u2019s just the images, but there\u2019s other information in there to it, which is clearly hearsay. There\u2019s a time stamp on it, it says sent. We don\u2019t know who the other party is. If [it\u2019s] just an image without more, Your Honor, then, you know, I think that\u2019s workable, but any testimony beyond that I think has to come through an expert and the State has not noted one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The court concluded that a witness was not required to authenticate the images on appellant\u2019s phone and denied appellant\u2019s motion, finding that it was \u201ca valid search incident to arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Appellant also moved to suppress the introduction of a recorded phone call that he made from jail to his probation agent following his arrest for carjacking.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this recorded conversation, appellant informed his probation agent that he was with his mother and girlfriend on the day of the carjacking. During argument on the second motion, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The second motion <em>in limine, </em>Your Honor, is that the State has put the defendant on notice that they want to use certain phone calls from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>detention center. And particularly a phone call between the defendant and he calls his probation agent to say, you know, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m always straight with you, I\u2019m at the earliest stages of the case, but don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t have anything to do with this. It gives a little more explanation and says something like I was with my mom and my girlfriend that day or something to that effect. And she [the probation officer] says that\u2019s fine. Just keep me updated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\">The State has said that they want to use that recording by and through the probation agent, Your Honor. I\u2019d object for a couple of reasons. One, it\u2019s hearsay. Two, it\u2019s [sic] prejudicial value, exceeds its probative value. Third, I don\u2019t think the State can use it in [its case-in-chief], Your Honor, unless and until an alibi is generated, and then only if the defendant were to take the witness stand, it could be used potentially as impeachment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">THE COURT: Or if he presents another witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">What is the State\u2019s position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">[THE STATE]: That is the State\u2019s position. It was not our intention to use it in our case-in-chief. The Defense have given a [notice] of alibi witnesses of which I have a motion <em>in limine. </em>That is the reason we be would using it is to rebut [an] alibi witness. Whether it be the defendant or somebody else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">THE COURT: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, that\u2019s pretty significant for a couple of reasons. One [it\u2019s] hearsay. [It\u2019s] not under oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">THE COURT: It\u2019s the statement of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_r\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, but it still\u2014it has to be for some [other] exception to the hearsay rule, Your Honor. Admission against interest. Consciousness of guilt. Any of those, Your Honor, but this is him calling his probation agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">THE COURT: Once again I don\u2019t know anything about this case. They came up to me yesterday afternoon, but pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sumably if you call a witness who is not his mother or his sister [sic] and he says he was with me at the time, that is appropriate rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I think at some stage we should probably hear the recording. It\u2019s four minutes and I don\u2019t think it specifies a time. It\u2019s not under oath, I mean, it\u2019s something that I think is unfairly prejudicial to the defendant because it was not said under oath and it was maybe a two minute [conversation] where he\u2019s not specifically saying this is my alibi or even the time in question, Your Honor. The concern that is it\u2019s going to prejudice the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">THE COURT: Mr. [Defense Counsel], we can deal with that if you do call your alibi witness and that comes up, but the fact it\u2019s not under oath is not significant. The fact that he didn\u2019t say, quote unquote, this is my alibi is not significant. If it impeaches a witness, it is perfectly appropriate. So let\u2019s pick our jury and we\u2019ll leave that and see if that occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">But if you do call a witness who testifies otherwise, it\u2019s admissible, and I will certainly find that the probative value far outweighs any prejudicial value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, why don\u2019t we address that as we get closer. I think I want the court to hear it before the witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Thomas Gaines testified that at approximately 9:00 p.m. on April 29, 2010, he stopped at the CITGO gas station located at 5175 Old Branch Avenue in Temple Hills to get gas for his Dodge Charger. While pumping gas into his car, he observed two men engaged in a heated phone conversation: one was appellant, who \u201chad some plaits or something in his hair at the time.\u201d After the call ended, appellant and the second man approached Gaines. Appellant asked Gaines if he \u201cwanted to buy some weed.\u201d Gaines rejected the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Appellant then \u201cput a gun\u201d in Gaines\u2019s side, and told him not to move. Gaines described the gun as being black; \u201c[i]t looked like a 9mm, like the kind of gun the police have.\u201d The second man went into Gaines\u2019s pockets and took his wallet and cell phone. Gaines testified that he had two or three dollars in his wallet. After his wallet was taken, appellant and the second man fled the scene in Gaines\u2019s car. Gaines identified appellant as the person who brandished the handgun and drove the car away.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Gamadanyau Salami, the cashier at the CITGO gas station where the carjacking occurred, corroborated Gaines\u2019s testimony. Salami testified that while Gaines was pumping gas into a Dodge Charger, he was approached by two men, one of whom had dread locks. Immediately after approaching Gaines, one of the two brandished a gun. After taking Gaines\u2019s wallet, they sped away from the gas station in the Dodge Charger.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The following day, Gaines went to a shopping center in Marlow Heights to purchase a new phone and saw his car in the parking lot. Gaines instructed his girlfriend to flag down the police officer that was also in the parking lot while he \u201cblocked in\u201d his vehicle, so that it could not be driven out of the parking lot. He then \u201cwent looking for the guys that stole it.\u201d At approximately the same time that the officer contacted by Gaines\u2019s girlfriend arrived to help, Gaines saw appellant in a barber shop in the shopping complex. According to Gaines, appellant kept looking back at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Appellant exited the barber shop, talking on his cell phone. A car soon pulled up, appellant got in, and the car drove away. The police stopped that car before it exited the shopping center and ordered appellant out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Officer Kevin Stevenson, Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, testified that he responded to the call for assistance regarding the carjacking at the CITGO station. At the station, Gaines provided Officer Stevenson with a physical description of appellant. Officer Stevenson put out a lookout for the stolen Dodge Charger.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>When Gaines discovered his car the next day, Officer Stevenson came to the shopping center where the Dodge Charger was parked and confirmed that the vehicle belonged to Gaines. After calling a towing company to pick up the car, he, along with Gaines, watched appellant, who, at the time, was still sitting in the barber shop. When appellant was in the barber shop, Gaines identified appellant as the perpetrator of the carjacking. According to Officer Stevenson, Gaines \u201cwas pretty adamant that [appellant] was the guy who carjacked him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Officer Stevenson testified that appellant entered a car driven by another person and containing an additional passenger. He stopped the car almost immediately thereafter and ordered the passengers to get out of the car and sit on a curb. When the occupants of the car were sitting on the curb, Officer Stevenson observed \u201csome marijuana bags lying on the floor in the back seat on the floorboard.\u201d When asked \u201cwho had been seated\u201d where the marijuana was located, Officer Stevenson replied that it was \u201cwhere the defendant was sitting.\u201d After Officer Stevenson \u201cpatted everybody for weapons,\u201d Gaines \u201cwalked up and pointed out the defendant, once again, and said that\u2019s the guy who carjacked me.\u201d Appellant was arrested, and a cell phone as well as a substance that was later determined to be cocaine were seized from his person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Approximately five minutes after arresting appellant, Officer Stevenson examined the cell phone found on appellant\u2019s person. Officer Stevenson testified that the screen saver of the recovered cell phone was a photograph of automobile rims that were confirmed to be identical to the rims on the stolen Dodge Charger. He also located two other pictures of rims that were confirmed to be identical to the rims on the stolen Dodge Charger in the photo library of appellant\u2019s cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In his arrest report, Officer Stevenson wrote that appellant had \u201cdreads to his shoulders\u201d and \u201clooks like the person who carjacked [Gaines].\u201d The report also noted that appellant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u201cstanding near [Gaines\u2019s] vehicle.\u201d On re-direct, Officer Stevenson was asked if there was any evidence that appellant had a haircut while sitting in the barber shop. Officer Stevenson replied: \u201cIt didn\u2019t appear [appellant] ha[d] a haircut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Appellant did not take the stand, but he presented alibi evidence through his father, Ronald Sinclair, Sr. and Jason Slaughter. Mr. Sinclair testified that he let appellant, who did not have a driver\u2019s license, borrow a family car on the date of the carjacking and go out with a family friend, Jason Slaughter, in Largo. According to Sinclair, appellant and Slaughter asked to borrow the car \u201c[a]round 8ish, 7:30\u2014between 7:30 and 8\u201d in the evening. Sinclair was certain that he let appellant borrow (and Slaughter drive) the car on the night the carjacking occurred. He was confident that he correctly remembered this because his day planner for April 29, 2010 had a \u201cnotation\u201d that appellant and Slaughter borrowed a car. He did not bring the day planner to trial because it had been misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Slaughter testified that he was with appellant on the night of the carjacking. According to Slaughter, they were at the Largo Town Center between approximately 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., and eventually went to the Stonefish Grill, where he used to work, for approximately 90 minutes. Slaughter testified that he was able to remember the events so well because on April 30, 2010, the day after the carjacking occurred, he was told to leave his home. On cross-examination, Slaughter acknowledged that he had not shared this information with the police prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">After Slaughter testified, the State called appellant\u2019s probation agent to the stand, and during her testimony, the State presented as rebuttal evidence the recorded phone call that appellant made from jail to her. On cross-examination, there was the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And when you spoke with [appellant], was there any conversation specifically about what\u2014where he was and what times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>PROBATION AGENT: I remember [appellant] mentioning that he was somewhere else. I do recall that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And do you recall whether there were time things on the phone call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">PROBATION AGENT: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Additional facts -will be added as necessary in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A3n\">I. Cell Phone Search</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Appellant contends that the police were required to obtain a warrant prior to searching the recovered cell phone. Therefore the \u201ccourt erred by admitting the photographs of the wheel rims stored on the cell phone.\u201d In support of his argument, appellant cites <em>State v. Smith, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 163, 920 N.E.2d 949 (2009), in which the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201cthe warrantless search of data within a cell phone seized incident to a lawful arrest is prohibited by the Fourth Amendment when the search is unnecessary for the safety of law-enforcement officers and there are no exigent circumstances.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>920 N.E.2d 949 at 955-966.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The State counters that Md. Rule 4-252 \u201crequires that certain issues in a criminal case, including, as here, an allegation of an unlawful search, be raised by written motion filed within 30 days after the appearance of counsel in the case.\u201d Because appellant did not comply with this Rule, the State contends that he has automatically waived this argument. If the issue is preserved for our review, it is the State\u2019s view that defense counsel conceded that Officer Stevenson\u2019s initial opening of the cell phone was constitutional, and, therefore, did not object to its introduction. In other words, appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>as to the cell phone was \u201cintentionally limited to the claim that it was only Officer Stevenson\u2019s conduct in doing \u2018more in the absence of a warrant,\u2019 namely, the examination of the phone\u2019s photo library[.]\u201d Moreover, \u201c[b]ecause the concededly admissible screen-saver photograph duplicates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>essential content of the other photographs from the phone photo library,\u201d it follows that, \u201cthere could be no prejudice from the admission of the other photographs\u201d found on the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">As to the merits of appellant\u2019s contention, the State argues that a majority of jurisdictions confronting the issue have concluded \u201c \u2018that a search of the contents of a defendant\u2019s cellular telephone or other personal electronic device is a lawful search incident to arrest.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>People v. Taylor, </em>296 P.3d 317, 323 (2012)). According to the State,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">[t]hese cases generally emphasize the well-established ability of the police to search, in particular, the person of the arrestee, as opposed to the immediate area around the arrestee, and that a cellular phone is simply a digital method of transporting information that otherwise would have to be carried in physical form, no doubt in some form of a container.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">As we explain below, we are persuaded that appellant\u2019s claim is adequately preserved for our review, but that it fails on the merits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">A. Preservation</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\"> The Court of Appeals has repeatedly held that \u201cthe Maryland Rules are precise rubrics.\u201d <em>Pinkney v. State, </em>427 Md. 77, 87, 46 A.3d 413 (2012); <em>Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. 727, 739, 4 A.3d 976 (2010); <em>Williams v. State, </em>364 Md. 160, 171, 771 A.2d 1082 (2001). Maryland Rules, therefore, \u201care to be read <em>and followed. </em>\u201d <em>Pinkney, </em>427 Md. at 87, 46 A.3d 413 (quoting <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 280, 523 A.2d 597 (1987)) (emphasis added). Additionally, the \u201cinterpretation of the Maryland Rules is a question of law; as such, [an appellate court\u2019s] review [of] a trial court\u2019s determinations on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>matters of interpretation [is] without deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 46 A.3d 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Md. Rule 4-252(b) provides that a motion to suppress \u201cshall be filed within 30 days after the earlier of the appearance of counsel or the first appearance of the defendant before the court[.]\u201d According to Md. Rule 4-252(e): \u201c[a] motion filed pursuant to this Rule shall be in writing unless the court otherwise directs, shall state the grounds upon which it is made, and shall set forth the relief sought.\u201d We have said \u201c[fjailure to make a mandatory motion within the prescribed time limits, <em>absent good cause to forgive the dereliction, </em>bars all claims, even those full of constitutional merit.\u201d <em>Pugh v. State, </em>103 Md.App. 624, 656-57, 654 A.2d 888 (emphasis added), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>339 Md. 355, 663 A.2d 73 (1995). In <em>Pugh, </em>we pointed out that in finding good cause the trial court is vested \u201cwith wide discretion.... Thus the trial judge\u2019s determination is entitled to the utmost respect and should not be overturned unless there was a clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656, 654 A.2d 888 (internal quotations and citations omitted) (ellipses in Pugh).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Here, appellant was arraigned on July 30, 2010 and on August 5, 2010, an attorney, from the Office of the Public Defender, filed an entry of appearance along with an omnibus motion that requested suppression of any evidence obtained in violation of appellant\u2019s 4th, 5th, 6th, and 14th Amendment rights. On September 2, 2010, the State responded that appellant\u2019s motion did not comport with Maryland Rule 4-252(e) and did not put the State on notice of the suppression issues that he actually wished to raise. The State filed discovery on September 7, 2010, and set forth that it would use relevant material on appellant\u2019s cell phone and the testimony of Officer Stevenson.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Appellant\u2019s motions were withdrawn without prejudice on September 24, 2010. The next hearing dates were rescheduled after the State had discovered new evidence but subsequently failed to provide timely discovery. On January 26, 2011, the court reset the motions hearing because appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>had retained a private attorney, who was not prepared to proceed. On March 2, 2011, the court granted the State\u2019s request for a continuance because a new State attorney was assigned to the case. From the record, it appears that on March 11, 2011, motions were again withdrawn without prejudice. The record is unclear, however, as to the subject of those motions and who withdrew them. On March 17, 2011, appellant\u2019s request for a continuance was granted because the State had failed to provide timely discovery. Before trial on April 19, 2011, the appellant made a motion in limine to suppress the evidence recovered from the cell phone. The State\u2019s attorney argued that he had not come prepared to address the motion because they had \u201calready litigated motions, time [had] passed and so on and so forth so [he] had no notice that [the issue would be] raised.\u201d There was no reference to Md. Rule 4-252. The trial court then addressed the issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We have held that omnibus motions, such as the motion filed in this matter, are permitted under Md. Rule 4-252. <em>See Sellman v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 1, 13-14, 828 A.2d 803 (2003). Here, appellant, through counsel, timely filed the omnibus motion within 30 days of his arraignment in accordance with Md. Rule 4-252(b). While appellant\u2019s first counsel withdrew the motion to suppress, it was withdrawn without prejudice, which ordinarily would not preclude a future motion. Appellant\u2019s second counsel then raised the issue before trial in a motion in limine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The issue we must decide is whether withdrawal of the omnibus motion negated appellant\u2019s compliance with subsection (b). Under the circumstances presented by the record, we are not persuaded that it does. The trial court allowed the motion to be withdrawn without prejudice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>which on its face, preserved appellant\u2019s right to raise the issues again. To hold that appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw negated his initial compliance with subsection (b), we would effectively be converting the withdrawal without prejudice into a withdrawal with prejudice. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We recognize that the State challenged the sufficiency of the omnibus motion. The Court of Appeals held in <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 660, 837 A.2d 944 (2003) that sometimes courts will overlook the generality of omnibus motions and permit defendants to make their complaint more specific at a hearing on the motion. On appeal, the trial court\u2019s discretion to allow a defendant to support an unsupported motion has not been disturbed, so long as \u201cthe State is not unduly prejudiced by being called upon to respond immediately to allegations of which it had no notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>From the record, it appears that the appellant did not provide a factual or legal basis for the motion to suppress until the hearing before trial on April 19, 2011. The trial court, however, allowed the appellant to proceed with his argument which provided a factual or legal basis for the motion. We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision because the State was not unduly prejudiced. Even though the State\u2019s Attorney commented that he was not prepared, he was able to argue the motion and the court ruled in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Additionally, we have said that when the State fails to raise the argument at trial that appellant did not comply with the requirements of Md. Rule 4-252, the issue is not preserved for our review. <em>State v. Brown, </em>200 Md.App. 47, 50, 24 A.3d 195 (2011).

The court read <em>Gant </em>as prohibiting a search once an arrestee\u2019s cell phone has been removed from his person on the theory that removal forecloses the ability to use the phone as a weapon or to destroy evidence contained therein.). The issue has yet to be addressed by the Supreme Court or Maryland\u2019s appellate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">We recognize at the outset that a cell phone, especially a so-called \u201csmart phone,\u201d is, unlike some of the items referred to above, capable of storing substantial amounts of personal data. <em>See Smith, </em>920 N.E.2d at 954. For instance, \u201c[a] cell phone \u25a0with just one gigabyte of memory can store over 64,000 pages of Microsoft Word text, or over 100,000 pages of e-mails, or over 675,000 pages of text files.\u201d Charles E.

Murphy, </em>552 F.3d 405 (4th Cir.2009), to be instructive. In <em>Mmphy, </em>the defendant was the front seat passenger in a car traveling northbound \u201cat a high rate of speed\u201d on Interstate 81 in Wythe County, Virginia.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 407. When the vehicle was stopped by a Virginia State Trooper, both the vehicle\u2019s driver and the defendant informed the trooper that they had left their respective driver\u2019s licenses at home; the third passenger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>provided a counterfeit out-of-state driver\u2019s license. Because the defendant provided the trooper with multiple names for himself, none of which could be confirmed, \u201che was arrested for obstruction of justice\u201d and his cell phone was seized. <em>Id. </em>at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">Following the arrest of the two other occupants in the vehicle, officers \u201cbegan an inventory search of the vehicle at the scene,\u201d which was subsequently completed at the local Sheriffs Department <em>Id. </em>While searching inside the vehicle\u2019s trunk, officers discovered a \u201claptop bag containing $14,790 in U.S. currency, which was packaged in stacks containing equal amounts of money, folded and arranged to offset one another, and then banded with rubber bands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant, admitting that the money was his, stated that \u201che was planning to use [it] to purchase shoes and clothing in New York for stores that he planned to operate in Alabama.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408-09. The defendant\u2019s seized cell phone, as well as other cell phones seized from the vehicle, was examined further at the Sheriffs Department, where it was logged as evidence because it \u201ccontained possible incriminating information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409. At some point thereafter, the evidence, including the defendant\u2019s cell phone, was turned over to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). <em>Id. </em>at 409. Nearly two months after the defendant was arrested, a DEA agent examined the contents of the defendant\u2019s cell phone, which contained text messages from an individual who later identified the defendant as his drug supplier. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">On appeal, the defendant challenged the constitutionality of the warrantless search of his cell phone. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held: <em>\u201cThe need for the preservation of evidence justifies the retrieval of call records and text messages from a cell phone or pager without a warrant during a search incident to arrest.\u201d Murphy, </em>552 F.3d at 411 (emphasis added). In explaining its holding, the court noted that officers are typically unable to determine \u201cwhether the text messages and other information stored on a cell phone will be preserved or be automatically deleted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Due to the \u201cvolatile nature\u201d of cell phone information and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201cmanifest need ... to preserve evidence,\u201d it concluded that cell phones may be searched incident to arrest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Here, Officer Stevenson testified that, following appellant\u2019s arrest, he recovered the cell phone from a pocket in appellant\u2019s pants along with what proved to be cocaine. <em>See United States v. Quintana, </em>594 F.Supp.2d 1291, 1300 (2009) (\u201cWhere a defendant is arrested for drug-related activity, police may be justified in searching the contents of a cell phone for evidence related to the crime of arrest, even if the presence of such evidence is improbable.\u201d). Officer Stevenson\u2019s nearly contemporaneous search with the arrest was certainly more timely and far less intrusive than the search in <em>Murphy, </em>as it was conducted within minutes at the arrest scene and he did not explore and read the call history or text messages stored on appellant\u2019s cell phone. He merely opened appellant\u2019s cell phone and immediately saw that the screen saver was a photograph of the rims matching the custom rims on Gaines\u2019s car.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That a person would display a \u201ctrophy\u201d shot of the fruits of a crime as a screen saver may not be probable. But here, the screen saver and two photographs provided evidence directly related to the case which Officer Stevenson was investigating and therefore clearly needed to be preserved. We hold that the court did not err in ruling that the limited and immediate search of appellant\u2019s cell phone was a \u201cvalid search incident to arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>II. Rebuttal Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">After Slaughter testified, the State sought to discredit appellant\u2019s alibi evidence by introducing the recorded phone call in which appellant indicates to his probation agent that, because he was with his mother and girlfriend, he had an alibi for the charges against him. The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">[THE STATE]: We have the audio. It\u2019s a call between the defendant and the defendant\u2019s mother. The defendant asked his mother to call his probation agent. She called his probation agent, [Ms. A.], she\u2019s here. She [the probation agent] will authenticate that she had a conversation with the defendant. I was just wondering if we need to cut out the probation agent and get to the meat of the phone call.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE3\">THE COURT: Well, ordinarily I will think so, but there\u2019s a stipulation in this case that the defendant has, in fact, been convicted of a disqualifying crime. So the jury knows he\u2019s got a prior conviction. There\u2019s no reason to go into [that] any further. In fact it might be to your advantage that they know he has a probation agent as opposed to\u2014<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, a disqualifying conviction doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019s still on probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">THE COURT: No. It could mean that the person committed a murder and is in jail for 50 years as opposed to something else and being out on probation. I don\u2019t see any prejudice, in other words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, our thought will be that the witness testifies from their recollection. Because I think the concern is that it\u2019s going to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">THE COURT: What recollection? Mr. Bailiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">I don\u2019t know. What he\u2019s asking is should we tell the witness not to say she\u2019s a probation agent? And what I\u2019m saying is I don\u2019t see the prejudice in having her say that given the stipulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, Your Honor, our thought on the issue was; one, it\u2019s improper. We addressed this at the very beginning of the trial, Your Honor. Our position is that it\u2019s improper impeachment, because it doesn\u2019t speak to alibi per se. Alibi is defined as to the time of the crime. At least a little more generic in that sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">Putting that aside for right now, Your Honor, the thought will be that it would be prejudicial to the defendant to hear them dial probation, and he gives his mom the number, and then they say the Department of Probation and that he talks to her that the testimony just be elicited from the witness that she spoke with him and he made this statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">THE COURT: All right. Once again, Mr. [State], I\u2019m going to, you know, leave it to you, but I\u2019m not going to order that any part of that be redacted or that she not identify herself. There is consolidated with this case, well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>now it\u2019s down to one. Possession of a regulated firearm because of a prior conviction of a crime of violence. So as far as I can see, it was consolidated. No one ever asked for a separate trial. No one ever asked it be severed. It\u2019s part of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">So we have a jury here who knows that he has a prior conviction for a disqualifying crime. For the jury to know that he was on probation, I don\u2019t see any prejudice. I don\u2019t see any prejudice at all. In fact, like I said, I could\u2014but I\u2019m not going to. I don\u2019t see it. And I think if there is no prejudice, the probative value of knowing why the call was made far outweighs any prejudice. I mean, I think that\u2019s what we are talking about. The probative value of him, the context of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I think that goes to one of the key issues is what\u2019s the purpose for the phone call. Not to assert an alibi defense. It\u2019s to make contact with his agent. And that\u2019s what I was going to suggest. If it\u2019s only a three minute conversation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Appellant contends that the court \u201ccommitted reversible error by admitting evidence that [he] was on probation for another crime\u201d without performing the required legal analysis of whether it fell within an exception to the rule prohibiting evidence of other crimes. More specifically, he argues that \u201c[t]he court never made the legal determination that the other crimes evidence was admissible to prove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or the like.\u201d And, even if the recorded phone call with his probation agent did not in itself constitute evidence of other crimes or a prior bad act, appellant contends that it still should not have been admitted. He argues that \u201c[without more detail\u201d as to when he was with his mother and girlfriend, the statement \u201cwas not impeaching and was not proper rebuttal\u201d evidence and thus its admission was an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Maryland Rule 5^04(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or act is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The purpose of the Rule is to prevent jurors from developing a predisposition of guilt or prejudice toward the defendant based on evidence of other crimes or what we have called \u201cbad acts.\u201d <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 633, 552 A.2d 896 (1989). Bad acts have been defined as an activity or conduct, not necessarily criminal, \u201cthat tend [ ] to impugn or reflect adversely upon one\u2019s character, taking into consideration the facts of the underlying lawsuit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gutierrez v. State, </em>423 Md. 476, 489, 32 A.3d 2 (2011) (quoting <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 547, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999)) (alterations in Gutierrez). Evidence of prior bad acts is only admissible \u201cif it is substantially relevant to some contested issue in the case and it is not offered to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt based on propensity to commit crime or his character as a criminal.\u201d <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Here, appellant correctly points out that the court did not expressly address whether the admission of this telephone call involved the introduction of prior bad act evidence. On the other hand, the record clearly indicates that both counsel and the court recognized the bad acts or other crimes issue in the discussion regarding redaction of some aspects of the telephone call. The court, in light of the stipulation that appellant was previously guilty of a disqualifying crime, expressly found that \u201cthe probative value of knowing why the call was made far outweighs any prejudice\u201d resulting from the other crimes aspect of the evidence and clearly believed that the evidence reflected on the strength and credibility of the alibi testimony offered by appellant through his father and Slaughter. Moreover, during argument on both the motion <em>in limine </em>and at the trial, appellant directed his argument primarily to the unfair prejudice that would result in light of the statement\u2019s lack of relevance because it was not time specific. Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>turn to whether the recorded phone call was substantially relevant to a contested issue in the case to be admitted as rebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In <em>Hyman v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 618, 857 A.2d 1166, <em>cert. denied, </em>384 Md. 449, 863 A.2d 998 (2004), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">Rebuttal evidence is within a trial court\u2019s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Booze, </em>334 Md. 64, 68 [637 A.2d 1214] (1994). Rebuttal evidence is admissible when it \u201c \u2018explains, or is a direct reply to, or a contradiction of, any new matter that has been brought into the case by the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70 [637 A.2d 1214] (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-7\"><em>Hyman, </em>158 Md.App. at 631, 857 A.2d 1166. <em>See also Rollins v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 34, 89, 866 A.2d 926 (2005) (\u201cThe trial court has the discretion to determine what constitutes rebuttal evidence and will be reversed only if it is manifestly wrong and substantially injurious.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted), <em>aff'd, Rollins v. State, </em>392 Md. 455, 897 A.2d 821, <em>cert. denied, Rollins v. Maryland, </em>549 U.S. 959, 127 S.Ct. 392, 166 L.Ed.2d 280 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">What appellant had stated to the probation agent during the recorded telephone call was offered in response to alibi evidence introduced into the case by appellant\u2019s witnesses. At the point in the trial, alibi became a contested issue. In that telephone communication, appellant provided his probation agent with what could be reasonably considered as a different alibi from the alibi offered at trial. He stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything to do with the [carjacking]\u201d because he \u201cwas with [his] mom and girlfriend that day;\u201d he did not state that he was with Slaughter in a car borrowed from his father. As explained above, the court weighed the probative value against any prejudice toward appellant and found the probative value to be greater. <em>See Alban v. Fiels, </em>210 Md.App. 1, 24, 61 A.3d 867 (2013) (\u201cProbative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice when the evidence produces such an emotional response that logic cannot overcome prejudice or sympathy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>needlessly injected into the case.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Because we are persuaded that, in the context of the case, the evidence at issue would not produce such an emotional response, we perceive neither error nor an abuse of discretion in admitting the recorded telephone conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-11\">.

Appellant\u2019s argument rests primarily on <em>Smith, </em>920 N.E.2d 949 (2009).

Under <em>Smith, </em>therefore, an officer could search incident to arrest an arrestee's person, clothing, wallet, and even a brief case, but not the arrestee\u2019s cell phone. Smith's rationale is not persuasive because \u2018\u2018before the innovations made available in current cell phone technology, the information contained within digital files would have been contained in tangible copies and carried in closed containers.\u201d <em>Gracie v.
