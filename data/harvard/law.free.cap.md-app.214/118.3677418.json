The court imposed three consecutive life sentences. The appellant has raised four issues for our review, which we have reworded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>I. Did the court err in instructing the jury on an aggravating factor with respect to both first degree rape and first degree sexual offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">II. Did the court abuse its discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s two motions for mistrial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">III. Did the court abuse its discretion in postponing trial beyond the Hicks<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> date and did the court err in denying the appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss for this reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">IV. Did the court err in permitting a witness to testify about the victim\u2019s prompt report of sexual assault?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">We shall hold that issue I is not preserved for our review and the remaining issues are not meritorious. Accordingly, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">The evidence adduced at trial revealed the following facts. In the fall of 2010, the victim hired the appellant to work as a handyman and to do odd jobs in her Bethesda home. He had been recommended by another contractor. The victim was satisfied with the appellant\u2019s work and she recommended his services to her neighbors. In December 2010, the appellant filled in holes in the victim\u2019s laundry room wall and promised to return later to sand and paint the wall. The victim and the appellant finally agreed that he would return to finish the job on February 5, 2011 at 8:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">On February 5, the appellant called the victim at 6:50 a.m. to say that he was \u201calmost at [her] neighborhood.\u201d It was unusual for the appellant to arrive that early. The victim got dressed and the appellant arrived. The victim thought the appellant was acting strangely. The appellant went to his vehicle to get supplies and the victim went to the kitchen to make tea. While the victim was in the kitchen, the appellant came up behind her and said, \u201clet\u2019s you and me, let\u2019s get it on.\u201d This was the first time the appellant had made a sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>advance toward her. The victim told the appellant that his comment was not funny, and that he should leave. The appellant repeated that he wanted to \u201cget it on.\u201d The victim again told the appellant to leave, and ran out of the kitchen. When the victim reached the entrance area of her home, the appellant grabbed her and pulled out a screwdriver that \u201chad yellow on it.\u201d The victim pushed herself away, but the appellant tackled her, held her down, locked the front door, and told her to be quiet. The victim felt scared because of the screwdriver.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">As they struggled, the victim told the appellant not \u201cto do this,\u201d and that he was a good person. She offered to give him money to leave. The appellant repeatedly tried to pull the victim\u2019s pants down, and she repeatedly pulled them back up. The appellant then said, \u201cenough of this,\u201d and \u201chalf carried\u201d the victim to the living room. He forced her onto a sofa and, against her resistance, pulled off her pants and underwear. After the appellant told her that he would leave if she performed oral sex on him, the victim attempted to do so, but the appellant could not sustain an erection. The appellant then took the victim upstairs to a guest bedroom. He again forced her to perform oral sex on him, briefly performed oral sex on her, and repeatedly attempted to have intercourse with her. According to the victim, the appellant did insert his penis into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The appellant became upset and told the victim, \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to kill you.\u201d In an attempt to escape, the victim offered to make breakfast. They went downstairs to the kitchen. She made scrambled eggs for the appellant and put them on the kitchen counter for him to eat. She then walked out the front door and kept going until she reached an Exxon gas station and called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">After speaking with police officers the victim was taken to a hospital for a forensic examination, which revealed two facial abrasions and some vaginal lacerations. The time the victim might have sustained the vaginal lacerations could not be determined. Naomi Lobosco, who was accepted as an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>in forensic biology and serology, including DNA testing and analysis, testified that the appellant was identified as \u201cthe minor contributor\u201d to a \u201cmixed DNA profile\u201d obtained from the interior front panel of the victim\u2019s underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Officer James Herman of the Montgomery County Police Department went to the victim\u2019s home. He smelled fresh eggs and saw a plate of eggs in the kitchen. He found muddy footprints on a stairwell. The living room couch was \u201cmessed up\u201d and the pillows were strewn about. The bed in the guest bedroom was unmade and the pillows there were also strewn about.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">At 3:09 p.m. on February 5, Special Agent Larry Lee Willis of the Virginia State Police stopped a van traveling southbound on 1-81 in Montgomery County, Virginia. After obtaining a search warrant, Agent Willis found documents bearing the appellant\u2019s name and a screwdriver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When shown the screwdriver during the trial, the victim testified that it \u201ccould be [the screwdriver used during the assault], but I can\u2019t swear that that\u2019s what it was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The appellant first contends that the court erred in instructing the jury on one of the aggravating factors necessary to prove first degree rape and first degree sexual offense, because it was not generated by the evidence. Rape in the first degree requires the State to prove that a defendant 1) \u201cengage[d] in vaginal intercourse with another by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other,\u201d and 2) that the defendant did at least one of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">(i) employ or display a dangerous weapon, or a physical object that the victim reasonably believes is a dangerous weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>(ii) suffocate, strangle, disfigure, or inflict serious physical injury on the victim or another in the course of committing the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">(iii) threaten, or place the victim in fear, that the victim, or an individual known to the victim, imminently will be subject to death, suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement, serious physical injury, or kidnapping;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">(iv) commit the crime while aided and abetted by another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">(v) commit the crime in connection with a burglary in the first, second, or third degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Md.Code (2002), \u00a7 3-303 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d). Sexual offense in the first degree requires proof that the defendant \u201cengage[d] in a sexual act with another by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other,\u201d plus at least one of the same list of aggravating factors. CL \u00a7 3-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">At trial, the appellant agreed with the State that the jury should be instructed on factors (i) and (iii) as to first degree rape, but objected to the jury being instructed on factor (ii). The State argued, and the court found, that factor (ii) was generated by the victim\u2019s testimony that, while they were struggling in the foyer area of her home, the appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">was able to hold me down and turn around and lock the front door. And I was trying to pull and kick and scream and he just said, \u201cYou\u2019d better be quiet.\u201d <em>And he had this, by my neck </em>and I was like, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3l\">(Emphasis supplied). With regard to first degree sexual offense, the State again requested that the court instruct on factors (i), (ii), and (iii), and the appellant agreed. The appellant did not renew his objection to the jury being instructed on factor (ii) after the instruction had been given. On the contrary, after the judge instructed the jury, she called counsel to the bench and asked whether they were satisfied with the instructions. The appellant\u2019s trial counsel replied, \u201cSatisfied, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Maryland Rule 4-325(e) ordinarily requires counsel to object to a jury instruction promptly <em>after </em>the court has given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the instruction. The appellant relies on <em>Bowman v. State, </em>337 Md. 65, 650 A.2d 954 (1994), and <em>Gore v. State, </em>309 Md. 203, 522 A.2d 1338 (1987), for the propositions that substantial compliance with Rule 4-325(e) can be sufficient and that it is not necessary to renew an objection after the court has given the instructions if doing so would be \u201cfutile or useless.\u201d The appellant ignores the fact that his trial counsel agreed with the State that the jury should be instructed on factor (ii) with regard to first degree sexual offense and told the court he was \u201csatisfied\u201d with the instructions as they had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">In <em>Robinson v. State, </em>209 Md.App. 174, 58 A.3d 514 (2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 Md. 221, 64 A.3d 497 (2013), we explained the reasons why Rule 4-325(e) requires objections to be made promptly <em>after </em>instructions have been given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVa\">There are good reasons for requiring an objection at the conclusion of the instructions even though the party had previously made a request. If the omission is brought to the trial court\u2019s attention by an objection, the court is given an opportunity to amend or correct its charge. <em>Moreover, a party initially requesting a particular instruction may be entirely satisfied with the instructions as actually given.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ad8\"><em>Id. </em>at 199, 58 A.3d at 529 (emphasis supplied) (quoting <em>Johnson v. State, </em>310 Md. 681, 686, 689, 531 A.2d 675, 677, 679 (1987) (finding objection to instruction was not preserved in part because, after instruction had been given, defense counsel \u201cspecifically stated that he had \u2018no exceptions\u2019 to the instruction\u201d)). By agreeing with the State that the jury should be instructed on factor (ii) with regard to first degree sexual offense and by expressing his satisfaction with the instructions actually given, the appellant waived any objection and failed to preserve this issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Thus, the appellant asks that we exercise our discretion to undertake plain error review. We decline to do so. We are especially disinclined to take the extraordinary step of noticing plain error where, as here, the appellant affirmatively (as opposed to passively) waived his objection by expressing his satisfaction with the instructions as actually given. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>over, even if the appellant had preserved an objection, we would have found that the court\u2019s instructing on factor (ii) was not erroneous. All that is necessary to generate a requested instruction that is a correct statement of the applicable law and that has not been covered by other instructions is <em>\u201csome </em>evidence.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Arthur v. State, </em>420 Md. 512, 525-26, 24 A.3d 667, 675 (2011) (emphasis supplied). This is a \u201cfairly low hurdle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Martin, </em>329 Md. 351, 359-61, 619 A.2d 992, 996-97 (1993)). The victim\u2019s testimony that \u201che had this, by my neck\u201d was sufficient evidence to generate the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The appellant next contends that the court abused its discretion in denying his two motions for mistrial made after the State\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The appellant\u2019s first motion for mistrial related to a screwdriver with yellow markings that Agent Willis recovered from the van he had stopped and searched in Virginia on the afternoon of February 5. The victim testified that the appellant had threatened her with a screwdriver that \u201chad yellow on it.\u201d When shown the screwdriver Agent Willis had recovered, she testified that it \u201ccould be [the screwdriver used by the appellant], but I can\u2019t swear that that\u2019s what it was.\u201d The court admitted photographs Agent Willis had taken of the interior of the van, including the screwdriver, without objection. When the appellant objected to admission of the screwdriver itself, on the ground that the victim could not identify it as the particular screwdriver used in the attack, the court reminded the appellant that the photographs had already come in, and ruled that the screwdriver would be admitted as the screwdriver Agent Willis had recovered from the van. Nevertheless, the court prohibited the prosecutor from arguing to the jury that the screwdriver was the particular screwdriver that had been used in the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Despite the court\u2019s ruling, the prosecutor argued to the jury-in summation that the screwdriver in evidence was indeed the one used during the attack.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: And she [the victim] puts the tea kettle on the stove and when she turns around, the defendant is standing directly behind her. And she\u2019s startled, because she didn\u2019t even hear him come into the kitchen. And he says to her, \u201clet\u2019s you and me get it on right here, right now.\u201d And she says, \u201cthat\u2019s not even funny, get out of my house.\u201d \u201cNo, come on, you and me, let\u2019s get it on.\u201d And she goes to run around her island and she\u2019s grabbed by the defendant, <em>who holds this </em>screwdriver\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">[PROSECUTOR]:\u2014to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">[THE COURT]: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Who has a screwdriver and holds it to her throat. And she realizes, she\u2019s in huge trouble and she\u2019s trapped in her house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">(Emphasis in appellant\u2019s brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s closing argument, the appellant\u2019s counsel approached the bench and asked for a mistrial. The court found that the prosecutor had violated its previous ruling, but declined to grant a mistrial. Instead, the court gave the following curative instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">All right. With respect to the screwdriver, the State made a statement in closing argument that, that was the screwdriver that [the appellant] used. You are to disregard that argument. There was absolutely no testimony that that was the screwdriver. The victim testified that a screwdriver was used. She was not able to identify that screwdriver. So you are not to consider that screwdriver that\u2019s in evidence as the screwdriver that was used on that particular day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">The appellant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comment that the appellant was \u201cholding] this screwdriver\u201d was an impermissible reference to facts not in evidence. He asserts that, rather than curing any prejudice, the court\u2019s instruction made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the situation worse by highlighting the State\u2019s improper comment. The appellant maintains that he was highly prejudiced because the screwdriver directly related to one of the potential aggravating factors the jury could have found as a basis for first degree rape or first degree sexual offense\u2014use or display of \u201ca dangerous weapon, or a physical object that the victim reasonably believes is a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>See </em>CL \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014 303(a)(2)(i); 3-305(a)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The State contends that the court was correct in denying the motion for mistrial, but submits that it did so for the wrong reasons. In the State\u2019s view, the court\u2019s previous ruling that the prosecutor could not refer to the screwdriver recovered from the van as the particular screwdriver used in the attack improperly infringed on the wide leeway afforded to prosecutors to \u201cmake any comment that is warranted by the evidence or inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>See Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 224, 670 A.2d 398, 421-22 (1995) (quoting <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 676, 612 A.2d 258, 281 (1992)). The State maintains that a reasonable juror could have inferred from the victim\u2019s testimony and the fact that the screwdriver was recovered from the appellant\u2019s van that it was the screwdriver used in the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">As this Court reiterated in <em>Behrel v. State, </em>151 Md.App. 64, 142, 823 A.2d 696, 741, <em>cert. denied, </em>376 Md. 546, 831 A.2d 5 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\"><em>A mistrial </em>is not a sanction designed to punish an attorney for an impropriety. It is rather <em>an extreme sanction that sometimes must be resorted to when such overwhelming prejudice has occurred that no other remedy will suffice to cure the prejudice </em>.... [T]he decision as to whether a mistrial is called for is contingent upon the impact of an error and not upon the motivation behind the error. <em>Moreover, the remarks must be a direct and contributing factor that resulted in egregious prejudice to the defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUf\">(Emphasis supplied) (internal citations and quotations omitted). We review the denial of a motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion and will reverse only where \u201cthe prejudice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>defendant was so substantial that he was deprived of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Cooley v. State, </em>385 Md. 165, 173, 867 A.2d 1065, 1069-70 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Under either the appellant\u2019s theory that the prosecutor improperly commented on facts not in evidence or the State\u2019s theory that the prosecutor properly commented on an inference reasonably drawn from the evidence, the result would be the same: we would hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a mistrial. Even if we were to accept the appellant\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was improper, we still would hold that any potential prejudice was cured by the court\u2019s instruction that the jury \u201cdisregard\u201d that portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument and that the jury \u201cnot ... consider that screwdriver that\u2019s in evidence as the screwdriver that was used on that particular day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In any event, we agree with the State that the court\u2019s previous ruling prohibiting the prosecutor from arguing that the screwdriver was the screwdriver the appellant used in the attack was erroneous. Attorneys are entitled in closing argument to ask the jury to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. <em>See, e.g., Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412, 326 A.2d 707, 714 (1974) (\u201cAs to summation, it is, as a general rule, within the range of legitimate argument for counsel to state and discuss the evidence and all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the facts in evidence; and such comment or argument is afforded a wide range.\u201d). The victim testified that the appellant had used a screwdriver \u201cwith yellow in it\u201d during the attack. A screwdriver with yellow markings was recovered from the appellant\u2019s van. When shown that screwdriver at trial, the victim testified that it <em>\u201ccould </em>be [the one],\u201d but that she could not \u201cswear that that\u2019s what it was.\u201d A reasonable juror could infer from that evidence that the screwdriver was indeed the one the appellant had displayed during the attack. The prosecutor was free to argue to the jury that the screwdriver in evidence was <em>the </em>screwdriver, just as the appellant\u2019s trial counsel was free to argue to the jury that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>As the prosecutor\u2019s comment was permissible, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s first motion for mistrial, albeit for different reasons than those stated by the court. <em>See, e.g., State v. Phillips, </em>210 Md.App. 239, 270, 63 A.3d 51, 69 (2013) (\u201cThis Court may affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision on any ground adequately shown by the record.\u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Rush, </em>174 Md.App. 259, 289, 921 A.2d 334 (2007), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>403 Md. 68, 939 A.2d 689 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The appellant\u2019s second motion for mistrial came at the conclusion of the State\u2019s rebuttal. During rebuttal, the prosecutor had argued, without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">Now, with respect to the credibility\u2014because, really, ... a lot of this case comes down to what [the victim] told you, because when a rape occurs, a rape doesn\u2019t occur in front of a camera. There\u2019s only two people there. In this case, the two people who were there were [the victim] and the defendant. And yesterday, [the victim] came in and she sat here and she told you what happened. And one of the instructions that Her Honor read to you, was the credibility of witnesses instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In requesting a mistrial, the appellant\u2019s trial counsel argued that the prosecutor\u2019s comments \u201ccreate[d] an inference that the defendant should have gotten on the stand and told his story.\u201d The court disagreed, and found that there had been no \u201cinappropriate references to the fact that the defendant did not testify.\u201d On appeal, the appellant again contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments infringed on his absolute right not to testify, as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The State contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were permissible, because the prosecutor never explicitly mentioned the appellant\u2019s decision not to testify. The State asks that we read the prosecutor\u2019s comments in their proper context, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>points out that the portion the appellant quotes in his brief was just the beginning of a lengthy and detailed discussion regarding the victim\u2019s credibility. This was a central issue in the case and one that the appellant\u2019s trial counsel also had discussed in closing. The State relies on the court\u2019s instruction, before closing argument, that \u201cthe defendant has an absolute, constitutional right not to testify,\u201d and that his silence \u201cmust not be held against [him] and must not be considered in any way or even discussed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Maryland law has \u201clong held that a criminal defendant\u2019s rights under Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article preclude comment by a prosecutor on a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify.\u201d <em>Marshall v. State, </em>415 Md. 248, 261, 999 A.2d 1029, 1036 (2010). In evaluating whether a prosecutor has improperly commented on a defendant\u2019s election not to testify, we must determine whether \u201cthe remark [is] <em>\u2018susceptible of the inference </em>by the jury that they were to consider the silence of the traverser in the face of the accusation of the prosecuting witness as an indication of his guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>367 Md. 348, 354, 787 A.2d 152, 155 (2001) (quoting <em>Smith v. State, </em>169 Md. 474, 476, 182 A. 287, 288 (1936)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In <em>Smith, </em>a prosecution for burglary, the prosecutor delivered the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">The Judge has said that you can look backwards in this case. Look to see who ends up with the property and then you can work backwards and here if the recent unexplained possession of stolen property allows you to work backwards to conclude, hey, this guy was the thief, this guy was the burglar. In making that conclusion, ask yourself this. <em>What explanation </em>has been given to us <em>by the defendant </em>for having the leather goods? Zero, none.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">367 Md. at 352, 787 A.2d at 154. The defendant\u2019s objection to this line of argument was overruled. The Court of Appeals concluded, however, that the prosecutor \u201cwent beyond the permissible comment on the absence of the evidence, and impermissibly commented directly on the defendant\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360, 787 A.2d at 159. The Court held that this error was not harmless and, therefore, ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In <em>Marshall, </em>a prosecution for narcotics distribution, the prosecutor remarked in rebuttal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\"><em>Mr. Marshall did not take the stand </em>so I ask you to take that with a great deal of caution when [defense counsel] tries to indicate a health problem for Mr. Marshall because there\u2019s no evidence of that whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">There are several pieces we don\u2019t have. <em>We don\u2019t have Mr. Marshall\u2019s thoughts </em>but we do have so many other pieces and when you put those pieces together, they spell out guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">415 Md. at 255-56, 999 A.2d at 1032-33. The State conceded in <em>Marshall </em>that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks commented upon the defendant\u2019s election to remain silent, but argued that they were permissible under the invited response doctrine. The Court of Appeals found \u201cno impropriety in defense counsel\u2019s closing argument sufficient to warrant the prosecutor\u2019s comments on the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify,\u201d and ordered a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 999 A.2d at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not susceptible of the inference that the jury should consider the appellant\u2019s silence as evidence of guilt. The entire thrust of this portion of the prosecutor\u2019s discussion, which continued for four transcript pages, was that the victim was a credible witness. The remarks that \u201c[t]here [were] only two people there\u201d and that one of those people, the victim, \u201ccame in and ... sat here and ... told you what happened,\u201d are properly read as a submission that the victim should be believed because she was the only eyewitness other than the appellant. The prosecutor did not suggest that the jury should take any negative inference from the fact that the appellant chose not to testify, or that the appellant had any burden to tell his side of the story. The court did not abuse its discretion in denying the appellant\u2019s second motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The appellant also contends that the court abused its discretion in postponing trial beyond the 180-day <em>\u201cHicks </em>deadline\u201d and in subsequently denying his motion to dismiss on that basis. The parties agree that the <em>Hicks </em>date in this case was November 14, 2011, which was also the scheduled trial date. The State filed a motion to postpone trial on October 14, 2011, on the grounds that a DNA analyst was scheduled for training and would be unavailable to testify and the prosecutor was scheduled for trial in another case the same day that had to be tried by November 22 pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (\u201cIAD\u201d). <em>See </em>Md.Code (1999, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 8-401, <em>et seq., </em>of the Correctional Services Article (\u201cCS\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellant opposed that request on October 19, 2011, asserting that the prosecutor \u201cshould have been aware of the conflict in scheduling at the time the trial date was set,\u201d and claiming that he would be prejudiced by the delay because the total prison time he might ultimately serve was \u201cin a state of uncertainty\u201d due to a looming parole revocation in another matter that was being held in abeyance pending resolution of this case. At a motions hearing on October 20, 2011, the trial judge in this case initially declined to grant a postponement, but then, at the State\u2019s request, allowed the parties to go before the acting administrative judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The acting county administrative judge held a hearing later that day, at which counsel made the same arguments as they had in their written motions and in argument before the trial judge. The acting administrative judge found good cause to postpone the case beyond November 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Trial ultimately began on March 12, 2012. On that day, the parties litigated a motion to dismiss for denial of speedy trial rights that the appellant had filed on March 8, 2012. The appellant argued that the Montgomery County Criminal Differentiated Case Management Plan prohibited the acting administrative judge from reconsidering the trial judge\u2019s initial decision not to grant a postponement. The prosecutor did not dispute this, but claimed that she had been unaware of the \u201cnew\u201d policy. The trial judge declined to disturb the acting administrative judge\u2019s decision and denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Maryland law requires that a criminal case be brought to trial within 180 days of the appearance of counsel or the appearance of the defendant before the circuit court, whichever occurs first. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 6-103 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d); Md. Rule 4-271(a). A county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee may, however, grant a postponement beyond the 180-day deadline \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dismissal is the appropriate remedy where the State fails to bring the case to trial within the 180-day period and good cause has not been established. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 318, 403 A.2d 356, 360 (1979), <em>on motion for reconsideration, </em>285 Md. at 334, 403 A.2d at 368 (1979). \u201c[T]he critical postponement for purposes of Rule 4-271 is the one that carries the case beyond the 180 day deadline.\u201d <em>See State v. Brown, </em>355 Md. 89, 108-09, 733 A.2d 1044, 1054 (1999). On review of an administrative judge\u2019s decision to postpone for good cause, \u201cthe trial judge (as well as an appellate court) shall not find an absence of good cause unless the defendant meets the burden of demonstrating either a clear abuse of discretion or a lack of good cause as a matter of law.\u201d <em>See State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 454, 470 A.2d 1269,1286 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In this case, the acting administrative judge\u2019s good cause finding was based on the State\u2019s representations that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>DNA analyst would be unavailable<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to testify on the scheduled trial date and that the prosecutor was scheduled for trial in another case on the same day that was legally required to be tried by November 22. We cannot say that the acting administrative judge clearly abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">At the hearing before the acting administrative judge, the appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the appellant\u2019s \u201crights\u201d should not \u201ctake [a] backseat\u201d to those of the defendant in the prosecutor\u2019s other case scheduled for the same day. We note first that \u201cthe mechanism of the <em>Hicks </em>Rule serves as a means of protecting society\u2019s interest in the efficient administration of justice. The actual or apparent benefits [CP \u00a7 6-103] and Rule 4-271 confer upon criminal defendants are purely incidental.\u201d <em>See State v. Price, </em>385 Md. 261, 278, 868 A.2d 252, 262 (2005). In other words, unlike the Sixth Amendment speedy trial guarantee, the <em>Hicks </em>rule is a statement of public policy, not a source of individual rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Furthermore, the Court of Appeals has upheld a Rule 4-271 good cause finding based upon the unavailability of a prosecutor due to her involvement in other cases. <em>See State v. Toney, </em>315 Md. 122, 135, 553 A.2d 696, 703 (1989). The State is not necessarily required to resolve schedule conflicts by reassigning prosecutors, because \u201cthe State\u2019s interest in maintaining prosecutorial continuity is a significant interest which in some instances may qualify as good cause for a postponement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">As the prosecutor in this case was scheduled to try two cases on the same day, it was inevitable\u2014barring a guilty plea in one of the cases\u2014that at least one of them would have to be postponed. Both cases were subject to similar 180-day trial deadlines. We are not in a position to second-guess the acting administrative judge\u2019s decision to postpone one case instead of the other. The basic premise behind CP \u00a7 6-103\u2019s direction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>that authority to postpone cases beyond the 180-day deadline should be transferred from any judge to the county administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVK\">it is the administrative judge who has an overall view of the court\u2019s business, who is responsible \u201cfor the administration of the court,\u201d who assigns trial judges, who \u201csupervise^] the assignment of actions for trial,\u201d who supervises the court personnel involved in the assignment of cases, and who receives reports from such personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\">Consequently, the administrative judge is ordinarily in a much better position than another judge of the trial court, or an appellate court, to make the judgment as to whether good cause for the postponement of a criminal case exists .... When he postpones a case, he is generally aware of the state of the docket in the future, the number of cases set for trial, and the normal time it will likely take before the case can be tried.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Frazier, 298 Md. at 453-54, 470 A.2d at 1285-86 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The appellant also insists that the acting administrative judge abused his discretion because his reconsideration of the trial judge\u2019s initial decision not to grant a continuance violated the Montgomery County Criminal Differentiated Case Management Plan (\u201cDCM\u201d). This argument fails for a number of reasons. We are not persuaded that violation of a county DCM (as opposed to violation of Rule 4-271) would mandate dismissal. Furthermore, it is not clear to this Court that the DCM prohibits the acting county administrative judge from reconsidering a trial judge\u2019s initial decision in a complex criminal case to deny a request for postponement. Instead, the DCM provides that the trial judge \u201cwill initially hear or review\u201d the request and allows the trial judge to deny the motion or recommend that it be granted, in which case a procedure is prescribed for the acting administrative judge to grant or deny final approval. There is no explicit provision that the administrative judge lacks authority to reconsider a request for postponement that the trial judge has denied. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>any event, at the October 20 hearing before the trial judge, the judge specifically asked the appellant\u2019s counsel whether he agreed that the State had the right to petition the administrative judge for a postponement, and he replied, \u201cI do.\u201d The appellant therefore waived any future objection to the administrative judge\u2019s authority to reconsider the trial judge\u2019s initial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>299 Md. 1, 472 A.2d 436 (1984), is also misplaced. Calhoun\u2019s case had been severed from a co-defendant\u2019s, but both remained scheduled for trial on the same day\u2014five days before the 180-day <em>Hicks </em>deadline expired. On the scheduled trial date, the prosecutor elected to proceed against the co-defendant on an unrelated matter, meaning that Calhoun\u2019s case would have to be postponed. Rather than sending the prosecutor and Calhoun to the administrative judge to seek a postponement, the trial judge merely \u201cexcused\u201d Calhoun. The administrative judge held a hearing fifteen days after the 180-day deadline had expired and implicitly found good cause and ordered a postponement. Calhoun eventually was tried and convicted. On appeal, the Court of Appeals expressed no opinion as to whether good cause existed at the time of the <em>de facto </em>postponement by the trial judge. Instead, the Court held that dismissal was warranted because no action was taken by the administrative judge or his designee before the 180-day period expired and the administrative judge could not ratify the trial judge\u2019s postponement after the 180-day period had expired. In the case before us, the acting county administrative judge properly found good cause for a postponement before the 180-day period expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The trial judge correctly declined to reconsider the acting administrative judge\u2019s finding of good cause. As the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Frazier,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">with regard to the postponement of a criminal trial for good cause, it is the administrative judge\u2019s exercise of judgment with which those later reviewing the matter are concerned. Another nisi prius judge, ruling on a motion to dismiss for an alleged violation of [CP \u00a7 6-103 and Rule 4-271], has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>been deprived of the authority to exercise independent judgment concerning good cause for postponement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">298 Md. at 450, 470 A.2d at 1284. As the acting county administrative judge had found good cause and ordered a postponement beyond the <em>Hicks </em>deadline, before the <em>Hicks </em>deadline passed, there was no basis for the trial judge to grant the appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The appellant finally contends that the court erred in permitting the victim\u2019s sister to testify regarding the victim\u2019s prompt complaint of sexual assault. Before the sister testified, the appellant\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that a report of sexual assault is not admissible except to rebut a defense argument that it was not prompt. The court overruled that objection and the victim\u2019s sister gave the following testimony on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: On February 5 of [last] year, did there come a time when you received a phone call ... from your sister?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">[WITNESS]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: And can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury about that phone call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">[WITNESS]: It was a Saturday morning and it was 9:15 or 9:30. [The victim] called me and I started to talk and she interrupted me and she was hysterical and said, \u201cRalph raped me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to ask for a continuing objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">[THE COURT]: Your objection is noted and overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: So she stated \u201cRalph raped me?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">[WITNESS]: Raped me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: You said that she was hysterical. Can you describe a little bit more what hysterical means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-17\">[WITNESS]: She didn\u2019t sound like herself. She was crying. She was breathy. She wasn\u2019t able to talk to me in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>full sentences. I tried asking her where she was, and she just said, \u201cThe Exxon. The police are coming. The police are coming.\u201d And she couldn\u2019t get full sentences out. She asked me to call my cousin Lynn to come as well and meet her at the Exxon. Lynn is a detective, not in this county. And she just said, \u201cCome here,\u201d and hung up. So it was very garbled and she was not making full sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Five transcript pages of testimony later, the victim\u2019s sister continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: Once you got to the hospital, what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">[WITNESS]: We sat in the emergency waiting room with the police officer and another officer, Lynn, myself and [the victim], kind of in a small area, but on opposite sides. And they took her back ... to have an exam ... And then [the victim] started texting Lynn and I. The police had left when she went back there\u2014that she was alone. And so she was alone and that Ralph kept calling her cell phone. That she was not picking up the phone, but he kept calling her cell phone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">On appeal, the appellant continues to argue that a prompt complaint of sexual assault is not admissible unless the defense has first disputed the promptness with which the victim reported the assault. The appellant asserts that \u201cthe entire point of the prompt-report exception is to rebut an explicit or implicit argument that the complaint was not prompt.\u201d The appellant reasons that, because he never challenged the promptness of the victim\u2019s report, the sister\u2019s testimony was cumulative, unfairly prejudicial, and not harmless. The appellant further argues that the sister\u2019s testimony should have been limited to the victim\u2019s statement, \u201cRalph raped me,\u201d and other narrative details\u2014such as the victim\u2019s statements that she was at the Exxon and the police were coming, her request to have her sister and her cousin go to the Exxon, her text message that she was alone in the hospital room, and her text message that the appellant was calling her\u2014should have been excluded. The appellant also argues that the court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>discretion in permitting the sister to testify immediately after the victim rather than requiring the State to hold the sister in reserve until rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">The State contends that the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony was admissible as a prompt complaint of sexual assault under Md. Rule 5\u2014802.1(d). The State maintains that such complaints are admissible as substantive evidence \u201cto contradict the inference that the failure to complain was inconsistent with the victim\u2019s trial testimony concerning the attack.\u201d The State argues that any narrative details beyond the statement \u201cRalph raped me\u201d were permissible or even necessary descriptions of the circumstances under which the complaint was made. The State also argues that the final part of the sister\u2019s testimony that the appellant claims was improper\u2014the part that came five transcript pages after her initial comments\u2014was not covered by the appellant\u2019s continuing objection and should not be considered on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Whether evidence was properly admitted via an exception to the hearsay rule is an issue of law that we review <em>de novo. </em>As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Bernadyn v. </em>State, 390 Md. 1, 7-8, 887 A.2d 602, 606 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">We review rulings on the admissibility of evidence ordinarily on an abuse of discretion standard.... Review of the admissibility of evidence which is hearsay is different. Hearsay, under our rules, must be excluded as evidence at trial, unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule excluding such evidence or is \u201cpermitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes.\u201d Md. Rule 5-802. Thus, a circuit court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. Whether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Rule 5-802.1(d) is such an exception and allows for the admission of \u201c[a] statement that is one of prompt complaint of sexually assaultive behavior to which the declarant was subjected if the statement is consistent with the declar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>ant\u2019s testimony.\u201d As we said in <em>Gaerian v. State, </em>159 Md.App. <em>527, 537, </em>860 A.2d 396, 401-02 (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">The purpose of Maryland\u2019s prompt complaint of sexual assault exception to the rule against hearsay \u201cis to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony, and not simply to \u2018combat stereotypes held by jurors regarding nonreporting victims.\u2019 \u201d... The victim\u2019s complaint to another is admissible as substantive evidence to contradict the inference that the failure to complain was inconsistent with the victim\u2019s trial testimony concerning the attack.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In a \u201ccredibility battle between the defendant and the victim, the legally sanctioned function of the prompt complaint of a sexual attack is to give added weight to the credibility of the victim.\u201d <em>Nelson v. State, 137 </em>Md.App. 402, 411, <em>768 </em>A.2d <em>738, 743 </em>(2001). The hearsay exception has the following limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">The victim must testify, the complaint must be timely, and references to the complaint \u201cmay be restricted to the fact that the complaint was made, the circumstances under which it was made, and the identification of the culprit, rather than recounting the substance of the complaint in full detail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\"><em>Gaerian, </em>159 Md.App. at 538, 860 A.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The appellant\u2019s contention that a prompt complaint of sexual assault is admissible only if the defendant first challenges the complaint\u2019s promptness is without merit. It is settled law that a prompt complaint of sexual assault is admissible in the State\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">In prosecutions for sex offenses, evidence of the victim\u2019s complaint, coupled with the circumstances of the complaint, is admissible as part of the prosecution\u2019s case if the complaint was made in a recent period of time after the offense[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-11\"><em>State v. Werner, </em>302 Md. 550, 563, 489 A.2d 1119, 1125-26 (1985). <em>See also Nelson, </em>137 Md.App. at 409-10, 768 A.2d at 742 (citing cases). As this Court made clear in <em>Cole v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>83 Md.App. 279, 289, 574 A.2d 326, 331 (1990), a prompt complaint of sexual assault</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\"><em>is not ... rebuttal evidence, </em>because 1) it may be offered in the State\u2019s case-in-chief, 2) it is not hedged in by limiting instructions, and 3) <em>its admissibility is not contingent upon the defendant\u2019s doing something first </em>.... It appears that the timely complaint has evolved as a hybrid form of anticipatory rehabilitation, as <em>something that does not wait to respond to impeachment but instead forestalls it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0k\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In essence, the appellant is arguing that the State may make use of the hearsay exception only if the defense has first challenged one of the preconditions to the exception\u2019s applicability. The rationale for admitting a prompt complaint is not to allow the State to rebut a defendant\u2019s claim that the victim\u2019s report was not prompt; rather, it is to allow the State to forestall the inference that, because the victim did not report the assault, the victim should not be believed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The requirement that the complaint be prompt is intended to ensure its trustworthiness. <em>See Cole, </em>83 Md.App. at 293, 574 A.2d at 333 (\u201cBoth the timeliness of the complaint and the circumstances under which it is made are, of course, circumstantial guarantees of its logical relevance (and also of its trustworthiness; the two criteria here go hand in hand).\u201d). In <em>Cole, </em>we quoted with approval from 4 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>(Chadbourn rev. 1972), \u00a7 1135, \u201cComplaint of rape (continued): (A) First theory: Explanation of an inconsistency; fact of complaint is admissible,\u201d at 298-300:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">So, where nothing appears on the trial as to the making of such a complaint, the jury might naturally assume that none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>was made, and counsel for the accused might be entitled to argue upon that assumption. As a peculiarity, therefore, of this kind of evidence, it is only just that the prosecution should be allowed to forestall this natural assumption by showing that the woman was not silent, i.e., that a complaint was in fact made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">This apparently irregular process of negativing evidence not yet formally introduced by the opponent is regular enough in reality, because the impression upon the tribunal would otherwise be there as if the opponent had really offered evidence of the woman\u2019s silence. Thus the essence of the process consists in the showing that the woman did not in fact behave with a silence inconsistent with her present story. The courts have fully sanctioned this analysis of the situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">83 Md.App. at 289-90, 574 A.2d at 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">There is simply no requirement in Maryland law that, in order for a complaint of sexual assault to be admissible, a defendant must first challenge its promptness. The admissibility of the victim\u2019s statement to her sister, \u201cRalph raped me,\u201d is, thus, unassailable, as the conditions of a prompt complaint were certainly met in this case. The victim testified at trial. The complaint was timely, as it was made within minutes after the victim escaped from the assault. The victim\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony was consistent with the victim\u2019s testimony and it was limited in scope. In fact, the sister gave no substantive description of the assault. The complaint itself was the statement, \u201cRalph raped me.\u201d The victim\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony was limited thereafter to the circumstances under which the victim made the complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">She didn\u2019t sound like herself. She was crying. She was breathy. She wasn\u2019t able to talk to me in full sentences. I tried asking her where she was, and she just said, \u201cThe Exxon. The police are coming. The police are coming.\u201d And she couldn\u2019t get full sentences out---- And she just said, \u201cCome here,\u201d and hung up. So it was very garbled and she was not making full sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>All of those contextual statements were properly admitted as incidental to the victim\u2019s prompt complaint of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\"> Other testimony within that discussion was arguably unrelated to the victim\u2019s complaint of sexual assault: the victim\u2019s statement, \u201cShe asked me to call my cousin Lynn to come as well and meet her at the Exxon,\u201d and the sister\u2019s explanation, \u201cLynn is a detective, not in this county.\u201d The victim\u2019s statement was hearsay not covered by the prompt report of sexual assault exception. The sister\u2019s explanation was material only insofar as it explained the victim\u2019s statement. As we shall explain more fully below, this testimony was not clearly within the scope of the appellant\u2019s continuing objection to a prompt complaint of sexual assault and thus is not properly before us in this appeal. Nevertheless, even assuming that this testimony was inadmissible hearsay and was properly objected to, it posed little or no risk of prejudice to the appellant. If there was error in admitting these statements, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The victim\u2019s sister\u2019s later testimony regarding other statements by the victim was clearly not related to the complaint of sexual assault. Accordingly, it also was not covered by the appellant\u2019s continuing objection to testimony regarding a complaint of sexual assault. Before the victim\u2019s sister testified, the appellant stated the grounds for his objection as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: My understanding is that the State is going to call the sister of [the victim] to testify about a prompt report. We haven\u2019t done any cross-examination whatsoever saying that she delayed in reporting this incident. So I think it\u2019s premature at this point for them to call a witness to basically bolster what\u2019s already been done in this case. If we ever at some point attack the promptness of her report, then they\u2019re free in their rebuttal case to bring out the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">[Y]ou can\u2019t rebut something that hasn\u2019t been done. This is an anticipatory action on the State\u2019s part, which I don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>think they are allowed to do under <em>Parker [v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 252, 846 A.2d 485 (2004) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Five transcript pages after the appellant noted a continuing objection and the victim\u2019s sister testified to the victim\u2019s prompt complaint of sexual assault, she was asked about what happened after she and the victim arrived at the hospital. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">We sat in the emergency waiting room with the police officer and another officer, Lynn, myself and [the victim], kind of in a small area, but on opposite sides. And they took her back ... to have an exam ... And then [the victim] started texting Lynn and I. The police had left when she went back there\u2014that she was alone. And so she was alone and that Ralph kept calling her cell phone. That she was not picking up the phone, but he kept calling her cell phone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Maryland Rule 4-323(b) provides that a \u201ccontinuing objection is effective only as to questions clearly -within its scope.\u201d The appellant\u2019s continuing objection was limited to testimony regarding the victim\u2019s complaint of sexual assault. The prompt complaint was limited to the victim\u2019s statement to her sister, \u201cRalph raped me,\u201d and the circumstances under which that statement was made. It did not include the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s recollection of statements the victim made some time later\u2014hours later, the State suggests\u2014when she and the victim and their cousin were waiting for the victim to be examined at the hospital. This testimony was not clearly within the scope of the appellant\u2019s continuing objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Not only was the subject matter of this testimony not covered by the appellant\u2019s continuing objection, but this later testimony was separated from the continuing objection by five transcript pages of testimony discussing, according to the State, \u201cseveral hours of time on the day of the attack, and a long recitation of testimony utterly unrelated to the victim\u2019s prompt complaint of sexual assault.\u201d Continuing objections do not persist in perpetuity. As this Court noted in <em>Hall v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 377, 390-91, 705 A.2d 50, 56-57 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>[A]s Professor McLain points out, <em>if the improper line of questioning is interrupted by other testimony or evidence and is thereafter resumed, counsel must state for the record that he or she renews the continuing objection. </em>McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 103.12. Otherwise, it would be impossible for an appellate court to determine whether the trial judge regarded the continuing objection as remaining in effect. An appellate court will reverse or vacate a judgment only for judicial errors. Unless it appears that the trial judge is or should be aware, when a question is asked and no objection is voiced, that counsel is relying on the continuing objection, the appellate court cannot conclude that the judge erred in not sustaining the \u201ccontinuing\u201d objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">(Emphasis supplied). The appellant\u2019s continuing objection was severed by the intervening testimony and not renewed. As such, the appellant preserved no objection to this testimony and we shall not consider it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The appellant\u2019s argument that the court abused its discretion by allowing the victim\u2019s sister to testify immediately after the victim is without merit. \u201c[T]he conduct of a criminal trial is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of abuse.\u201d <em>See Bruce v. State, </em>351 Md. 387, 393, 718 A.2d 1125, 1127 (1998). <em>See also </em>Rule 5-611(a). We see nothing in this record suggesting an abuse of that discretion. As we have explained, a prompt complaint of sexual assault is admissible in the State\u2019s case-in-chief. There was no reason for the court to require the State to hold the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s testimony for rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
