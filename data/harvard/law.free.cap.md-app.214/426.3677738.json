Freeman, who is buried in Arlington Cemetery of Chizuk Amuno Congregation (\u201cArlington\u201d) in Baltimore City. The issue presented is one of subject matter jurisdiction, i.e., where a will is probated in one state and the deceased is buried in another state, which court has jurisdiction to resolve a subsequent dispute regarding the proper place of burial. The answer depends on the nature of the claim raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">Elizabeth Unger, appellant, filed a Petition for Disinterment and Complaint for Specific Performance in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, alleging that Ms. Freeman\u2019s Last Will and Testament (the \u201cWill\u201d) directed Marilyn Berger, appellee, to bury Ms. Freeman\u2019s remains in a burial plot next to her deceased husband in King Solomon Cemetery (\u201cKing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Solomon\u201d) in New Jersey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ms. Berger filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, which the circuit court granted on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">On appeal, Ms. Unger raises a single question for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">Did the circuit court err in dismissing the Complaint on the grounds that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">On August 28, 2007, while residing in Florida, Ms. Freeman executed the Will and appointed Ms. Berger as her Personal Representative. The Will indicated that Ms. Freeman previously had made arrangements to be buried at King Solomon, and she had directed her \u201cPersonal Representative to take whatever action may be necessary to assist in fulfillment of those instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">At some point after executing the Will, Ms. Freeman moved to DeKalb County, Georgia, where she resided with Ms. Berger until she required hospitalization. In October 2009, she moved into Summer\u2019s Landing, an assisted living facility in Georgia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">On April 21, 2010, Ms. Freeman died in Georgia. Ms. Freeman was deeply religious, and therefore, Ms. Berger arranged for her body to be cared for in accordance with strict Jewish law, including the ritual bathing of her body by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Jewish burial society and a watcher who guarded her body prior to burial. Ms. Freeman\u2019s body was then transported from Georgia to Maryland and buried in Ms. Freeman\u2019s family plot in Arlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Ms. Berger asserts that Ms. Freeman was buried at Arlington because, after executing the Will, Ms. Freeman \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d instructed Ms. Berger to bury her there. Ms. Berger explained that, in addition to being Personal Representative, she also had a full power of attorney and authority over Ms. Freeman\u2019s affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">On February 28, 2011, Ms. Unger filed a petition to probate the Will with the Probate Court of DeKalb County, Georgia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the petition, Ms. Unger sought to have the Will admitted to probate \u201cso that she can petition for sanctions against [Ms. Berger] for failing to carry out the deceased\u2019s burial instructions as set forth in ... the Will.\u201d Both Ms. Unger and Ms. Berger engaged counsel in Georgia to represent them in the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On August 9, 2011, prior to a ruling by the DeKalb County Probate Court, Ms. Unger filed a voluntary dismissal of her petition, without prejudice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Three days after filing her voluntary dismissal in the DeKalb County Probate Court, a Notice of Disinterment was published in <em>The Daily Record </em>in Maryland on behalf of Ms. Unger and Ted Freeman, Ms. Freeman\u2019s step-grandson. On September 21, 2011, Ms. Unger filed an unverified <em>ex parte </em>Petition for Disinterment and Reinterment in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On November 1, 2011, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the circuit court dismissed the <em>ex parte </em>petition, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was \u201cimproper as it was not brought as an adversarial action\u201d against Ms. Berger.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">On November 15, 2011, Ms. Berger, in her capacity as Personal Representative, filed a Complaint for Damages in the Superior Court of DeKalb County against Ms. Unger and Mr. Freeman, seeking damages for their unlawful actions and wrongful conduct with respect to Ms. Berger\u2019s administration of Ms. Freeman\u2019s estate. Ms. Unger and Mr. Freeman subsequently filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint, asserting that the Superior Court did not have personal jurisdiction over them. On April 11, 2012, the Superior Court denied Ms. Unger and Mr. Freeman\u2019s motion finding that it did have personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In the interim, on December 20, 2011, Ms. Unger filed the Petition for Disinterment and Complaint for Specific Performance that is the subject of this appeal. Ms. Unger asserted that \u201c[t]his case involves the willful disregard of Ann R. Freeman\u2019s Last Will and Testament, wherein she directed her Personal Representative, Defendant Marilyn Berger, to bury her in New Jersey, in a burial plot next to her deceased husband.\u201d Ms. Unger alleged that, in addition to the explicitly stated desires in the Will, Ms. Freeman also had expressed to Ms. Unger, in \u201cmultiple conversations,\u201d her desire to be buried beside her husband. The Complaint contained three counts: (1) a petition for disinterment, alleging that the Will unequivocally reflected Ms. Freeman\u2019s intention to be buried in New Jersey, but that Ms. Berger wrongfully had buried her in Maryland; (2) Ms. Berger had breached her fiduciary duty as Personal Representative by failing to carry out the express terms of the Will; and (3) specific performance against Ms. Berger and Arlington. The Complaint requested that Ms. Freeman be disinterred from her current burial site, that her remains be reinterred in New Jersey, and that Ms. Berger pay the costs associated with this relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">On March 12, 2012, Ms. Berger filed a motion to dismiss asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that the circuit court did not have subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>matter jurisdiction because the Georgia probate court had original, exclusive jurisdiction over controversies arising from the administration of Ms. Freeman\u2019s estate. She asserted that the proper procedure was to seek relief in the probate court, in Georgia, and in the event that Ms. Unger was successful, to then seek disinterment in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">On July 9, 2012, the court held a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, noting that \u201cthe true subject matter in this case\u201d was not where the body was buried, but rather, \u201cthe testamentary and estate issues,\u201d which the court found should be litigated in the Georgia probate court. Accordingly, it granted Ms. Berger\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u201c \u2018The proper standard for reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss is whether the trial court was legally correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Public Service Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>171 Md.App. 254, 264, 909 A.2d 1087 (2006) (quoting <em>Britton v. Meier, </em>148 Md.App. 419, 425, 812 A.2d 1082 (2002)). <em>Accord Reichs Ford Road Joint Venture v. State Roads Comm\u2019n of the State Highway Administration, </em>388 Md. 500, 509, 880 A.2d 307 (2005) (\u201cWe review the grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo.\u201d). </em>We will find that dismissal was proper only \u201c \u2018if the alleged facts and permissible inferences, so viewed, would, if proven, nonetheless fail to afford relief to the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sprenger v. Public Service Comm\u2019n of Maryland, </em>400 Md. 1, 21, 926 A.2d 238 (2007) (quoting <em>Pendleton v. State, </em>398 Md. 447, 459, 921 A.2d 196 (2007)) (citations omitted). Dismissal of an action on a preliminary motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is proper only if the facts and allegations establish a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Lewis v. Murshid, </em>147 Md.App. 199, 203, 807 A.2d 1170 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Ms. Unger contends that the circuit court erred in ruling that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction for three reasons. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>First, she argues that, because Ms. Freeman\u2019s remains are buried in Maryland, they are \u201cin the custody of Maryland law,\u201d and only a Maryland court has subject matter jurisdiction over the claim for disinterment of the remains. Second, she asserts, \u201cthe language in the Will concerning Ms. Freeman\u2019s burial wishes is clear and unambiguous and, therefore, does not require any interpretation.\u201d Third, Ms. Unger contends that, \u201cwhether Ms. Berger breached her fiduciary duties as the Personal Representative is irrelevant to the determination of whether Ms. Unger should be permitted to disinter Ms. Freeman\u2019s remains.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Ms. Berger contends that the circuit court \u201cproperly dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this testamentary dispute.\u201d She argues that both Georgia and Maryland law provide that the county where the deceased was domiciled is the proper probate court, and therefore, the \u201cproper venue for probating the Will and administration of the Estate lies in DeKalb County, Georgia.\u201d Ms. Berger asserts that the proper procedure would be for Ms. Unger to re-file her petition to probate the Will in the Georgia probate court, and if she is successful in enforcing the provision in the Will concerning the place of burial, \u201cMs. Unger could then seek disinterment of Ms. Freeman\u2019s body in Maryland and reinterment in New Jersey with the proper legal support of an Order from the DeKalb County Probate Court\u2014the court with subject matter jurisdiction over this testamentary dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">In her Reply Brief, Ms. Unger concedes that \u201cGeorgia is the appropriate venue for an action to probate the Will or an action concerning the administration of Ms. Freeman\u2019s Estate.\u201d She argues, however, that this was not the issue before the circuit court; rather, the \u201cprimary relief\u2019 sought in the circuit court was an order for the disinterment of Ms. Freeman\u2019s remains for the purpose of reinterring them in New Jersey.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number> It is clear that courts have jurisdiction to resolve disputes regarding disinterment; once a body has been buried, it \u201cis subject to the control of a court of equity.\u201d <em>Dougherty v. Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Co., </em>282 Md. 617, 620, 387 A.2d 244 (1978). <em>Accord Radomer Russ-Pol Unterstitzung Verein of Baltimore v. Posner, </em>176 Md. 332, 339, 4 A.2d 743 (1939). There is, however, no right to disinterment. <em>Kline v. Green Mount Cemetery, </em>110 Md.App. 383, 388, 677 A.2d 623 (1996). Rather, it is a disfavored action, and a request for disinterment generally is granted only for good cause. <em>See Dougherty, </em>282 Md. at 620, 387 A.2d 244 (\u201c \u2018The dead are to rest where they have been laid unless reason of substance is brought forward for disturbing their repose.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Yome v. Gorman, </em>242 N.Y. 395, 152 <em>N.E. 126, 129 </em>(1926)); <em>Kline, </em>110 Md.App. at 398, 677 A.2d 623 (\u201cthe normal treatment of a corpse, once it is decently buried, is to let it lie\u201d). <em>Accord In re Estate of Thomas, </em>431 N.J.Super. 22, 66 A.3d 205, 214 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.2013) (If \u201cprivate interests generate the request, disturbance of a decedent\u2019s remains should not occur \u2018unless it be clearly shown that good cause and urgent necessity for such action exist.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Petition of Sheffield Farms Co., 22 </em>N.J. 548,126 A.2d 886, 891 (1956)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Here, however, the issue before us is not whether disinterment is proper. Rather, the issue is whether the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>properly found that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to address the issues raised in the Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Under Georgia law, probate courts \u201chave authority, unless otherwise provided by law, to exercise original, exclusive, and general jurisdiction of ... (3) <em>All controversies in relation to the right of </em>... <em>administration </em>\u201d of wills and estates, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-9-30(a)(3) (emphasis added), as well as over \u201c(10) All other matters and things as appertain or relate to estates of deceased persons.\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-9-30(a)(1). Georgia probate courts have broad power over all matters within their jurisdiction. <em>Heath v. Sims, </em>242 Ga.App. 691, 531 S.E.2d 115, 117 (2000) (\u201c[Wjith respect to areas in which the probate court has been given exclusive, original subject matter jurisdiction, its authority is broad.\u201d). That broad authority extends to claims regarding whether an executor has breached a fiduciary duty. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Accordingly, the Georgia probate court had exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of Count II of the Complaint, which asserted that Ms. Berger breached her fiduciary duty as Personal Representative by failing to follow the provisions of the Will stating Ms. Freeman\u2019s intent to be buried in New Jersey. Indeed, as indicated, Ms. Unger conceded at oral argument that the court\u2019s ruling dismissing this count was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">With respect to Count I, however, which sought disinterment of Ms. Freeman\u2019s remains, the analysis differs. Ms. Unger argues that the Baltimore City circuit court is the only court with jurisdiction over Ms. Freeman\u2019s remains, and therefore, it had subject matter jurisdiction to order the body disinterred. In support, Ms. Unger relies on <em>In re Estate of Robert Lee Medien, </em>286 Ill.App.3d 860, 222 Ill.Dec. 220, 677 N.E.2d 33 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In <em>Medien, </em>the petitioner filed a petition in the probate case to have the decedent exhumed for DNA testing, alleging that the decedent was the father of her daughter, who was entitled to workers\u2019 compensation death benefits. <em>Id. </em>222 Ill.Dec. 220, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>677 N.E.2d at 34. One of the issues on appeal was whether the court had jurisdiction to order the decedent\u2019s body exhumed in another state. <em>Id. </em>222 Ill.Dec. 220, 677 N.E.2d at 35. In concluding that it did not, the Illinois appellate court explained that, although relatives of the deceased have \u201ca quasi-property right in the body; this right arises out of their duty to bury the dead,\u201d and once the body is buried, it becomes \u201c \u2018part and parcel of the ground to which it is committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>222 Ill.Dec. 220, 677 N.E.2d at 36 (quoting 25A C.J.S. <em>Dead Bodies </em>\u00a7 2 (1966)). The dead body \u201cforms no part of the decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court stated: \u201c[Bjecause the dead body, after burial, becomes part of the land and is said to be within the \u2018custody of the law,\u2019 we believe that a court can only resolve a dispute over disinterment when the body is within that state\u2019s territorial jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In response to the petitioner\u2019s argument that, because the court had personal jurisdiction over the interested parties, it therefore had the power to act in an extraterritorial manner over the body, as property, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">The court had jurisdiction over the estate and the parties, but neither the body nor the land in which it is buried is in the possession of the parties or the estate. The court could not act indirectly on the dead body by acting directly on the parties before it because the body was not within their control. The body became part of the land of West Virginia and is in the custody of the law of that jurisdiction. By ordering an exhumation, the court was ordering someone in West Virginia, over whom it had no jurisdiction, to do something.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\"><em>Id. </em>222 Ill.Dec. 220, 677 N.E.2d at 36-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The Court concluded that, \u201c[ajlthough exhumation disputes are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit court, the court cannot order an exhumation when the body is buried in another state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>222 Ill.Dec. 220, 677 N.E.2d at 37. Accordingly, it held that petitioner needed to file her petition for exhumation in West Virginia, where the body was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>We are persuaded by this analysis and similarly hold that a court cannot order a disinterment of a body that is not within the court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. Accordingly, we agree with Ms. Unger that only a Maryland court can order disinterment of Ms. Freeman\u2019s remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The question then is whether it is necessary for the Georgia probate court to first determine whether the initial burial in Maryland was improper. We hold that such a finding is not required because, contrary to the decision of the circuit court, this is no longer an estate issue subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Georgia court. As indicated, once the body is buried, it \u201cforms no part of the decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d <em>Medlen, </em>222 Ill.Dec. 220, 677 N.E.2d at 35. <em>See also Snyder v. Holy Cross Hospital, </em>30 Md.App. 317, 329, 352 A.2d 334 (a dead body is not part of the assets of the estate), <em>cert. denied, </em>276 Md. 750 (1976). Accordingly, the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction over Counts I and III, seeking disinterment of the body in Baltimore City, and we reverse the ruling dismissing those counts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On remand, the circuit court should hold a hearing to determine if there is good cause justifying the disfavored relief of disinterment. In that regard, the court should look to the terms of the Will and other evidence regarding Ms. Freeman\u2019s wishes. <em>See </em>B.C. Ricketts, Annotation, <em>Validity and Effect of Testamentary Direction as to Disposition of Testator\u2019s Body, </em>7 A.L.R.3d 747 \u00a7 3(b) (1966) (\u201cCourts have held that a person\u2019s testamentary directions for the disposition of his remains may be altered or canceled informally.\u201d) (collecting cases); <em>In re Scheck\u2019s Estate, </em>172 Misc. 236, 14 N.Y.S.2d 946 (N.Y.Surr.Ct.1939) (\u201c[T]he right of a particular decedent, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>time to time in his discretion, to vary the directions respecting disposal of his remains, [requires] that the inquiry of the court must be directed to the ascertainment of the latest expression of wish by the testator on the subject.\u201d). <em>See also Edery v. </em>Edery, 193 Md.App. 215, 235, 996 A.2d 961 (2010) (deceased\u2019s statements regarding where she wanted to be buried were admissible under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

In <em>Radomer Russ-Pol Unterstitzung Verein of Baltimore City v. Posner, </em>176 Md. 332, 4 A.2d 743 (1939), the Court of Appeals stated that the following factors are to be considered in determining whether to order disinterment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">(1) the wishes of the deceased, when they can be ascertained, and in connection with this, the influence of his religious faith in the decision or request; (2) the wishes of the widow or widower, and next after them, next of kin, if near enough to have their wishes respected; (3) the agreement or regulation of the body maintaining the cemetery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 338, 4 A.2d 743.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\">. There are, however, some practical issues generated in proceeding in this manner. Although we need not address them in this opinion, we note that, as part of the relief requested, Ms. Unger seeks an order requiring Ms. Berger to pay the costs for the disinterment and reinterment in New Jersey. No authority for granting such relief has been asserted in this Court to support: (1) assessing costs against Ms. Berger without a finding of a breach of fiduciary duty; or (2) ordering New Jersey to reinter Ms. Freeman\u2019s body.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
