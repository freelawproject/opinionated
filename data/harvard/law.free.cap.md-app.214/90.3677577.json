(\u201cMHG\u201d), Douglas H. Riggs, III, Warren Brown, Paul and Sara Arey, Charles and Marilyn Mess, Audrey Hill, and Milton Johnson (together, \u201cappellees\u201d) have \u201ctaken steps to prevent access to and use of [appellants\u2019] properties\u201d adjacent to \u201cFarm Road\u201d in Sandy Spring, Montgomery County, Maryland; and (2) the Commission \u201chas refused to issue [appellants] addresses, and in some cases rescinded addresses,\u201d for appellants\u2019 properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">The circuit court granted motions to dismiss all counts. Appellants appealed, raising four issues, which we reorder and rephrase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>I. Did the circuit court err in dismissing Count One through Count Four for lack of proper notice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">II.

Did the circuit court err in dismissing Count Twelve and Count Thirteen because MHG and Riggs did not owe a duty to appellants?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">For the reasons below, we answer questions I, II, and III \u201cno,\u201d and we do not reach question IV. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">On August 11, 2011, appellants filed a Complaint in the circuit court. On October 17, 2011, appellants filed an Amended Complaint in the circuit court. As to the Commission, the Amended Complaint includes: Count One (substantive due process); Count Two (procedural due process); Count Three (regulatory taking); and Count Four (declaratory judgment that the Commission exceeded its authority). As to all appellees, including the Commission, the Amended Complaint includes Count Five through Count Eleven (declaratory judgment that appellants have an easement to use Farm Road and a ten-foot right-of-way).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to the Commission, MHG, Riggs, Brown, and the Areys, the Amended Complaint includes Count Twelve (wrongful interference) and Count Thirteen (slander of title).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">In the Amended Complaint,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellants allege as follows:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Appellants\u2019 properties are adjacent to \u201cFarm Road, which has provided the only means of ingress and egress\u201d to appellants\u2019 properties. A ten-foot right-of-way accompanies Farm Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">\u201cIn or around 1994, [] Brown, a real estate developer, began developing the area around Farm Road[.] ... Brown began developing the \u2018Dellabrooke\u2019 subdivision in the area to the east of Farm Road[.] ... Brown also began developing the \u2018Dellabrooke Forest\u2019 subdivision to the west of Farm Road.\u201d \u201cAs part of his development efforts, Brown eliminated the northern access to Farm Road from Goldmine Road. In addition, Brown created a fictional \u2018conservation easement\u2019 ... and included it in subdivision plans submitted to the Commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201cTo facilitate development of \u2018Dellabrooke\u2019 and \u2018Dellabrooke Forest,\u2019 Brown engaged [MHG] to prepare certain documents for submission to the Commission. [ ] Riggs was the [MHG] employee primarily responsible for the preparation of the documents.\u201d \u201cBrown directed Riggs to create \u2018survey\u2019 documents for submission to the Commission that falsely depicted \u2018Dellabrooke\u2019 and \u2018Dellabrooke Forest\u2019 as being unencumbered by either Farm Road or the [ten-f]oot [r]ight-of-[w]ay, that misrepresented the title history of the land[,] and that resulted in the Commission deleting Farm Road from the State\u2019s property map.\u201d \u201c[T]he Commission approved Brown\u2019s, [MHG]\u2019s and Riggs\u2019[s] submissions.\u201d On August 3, 2000, the Commission approved Plat 21707 \u201cfor the Dellabrooke subdivision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u201cIn or around 2003, the Areys purchased 69 acres of the fictional \u2018conservation easement\u2019 ... from Brown for purposes of developing the property.\u201d \u201c[T]he Areys, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>before their purchase of the 69 acres, worked behind the scenes with Brown to develop \u2018Dellabrooke\u2019 and \u2018Dellabrooke Forest,\u2019 to cut off the northern access to Farm Road, and to eliminate Farm Road entirely[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-4\">\u201cThe Commission\u2019s own documentation shows that it once issued ... addresses to ... the properties that certain [appellants] now own. Inexplicably, however, the Commission struck the addresses from its records.\u201d \u201cWhen they learned that their addresses no longer existed, [appellants] attempted to obtain addresses from the Commission.\u201d On November 7, 2007, Rounds \u201cvisited the Commission[,]\u201d which \u201crefused to issue [appellants] addresses for their properties on the grounds that there were \u2018errors\u2019 on the 1966 Tax Map involving mislabeling of certain parcels.\u201d The Commission \u201curged [ ] Rounds and Gaither to contact the Maryland Department of Planning (\u2018MDP\u2019) to have the 1966 Tax Map corrected if they wanted addresses[.]\u201d \u201cRounds arranged a meeting with the MDP[.]\u201d In \u201ca letter to the Commission dated November 14, 2007, [the MDP] inform[ed] the Commission that ... [it] had \u2018corrected the [MDP]\u2019s Property Map ... to reflect the \u2018Farm Road\u2019 and parcel locations[.]\u201d On November 20, 2007, Rounds and Gaither returned to the Commission, which \u201cagain rejected [ ] Rounds\u2019[s] request for an address.\u201d \u201c[T]he Commission has now taken different positions as to why it is refusing to issue [appellants] addresses. It now claims that it cannot issue [appellants] addresses because they have not presented documentation proving their right to access their properties].\u201d \u201cThe most recently announced reason for denying [appellants] addresses is because the neighbors cannot agree <em>where </em>Farm Road might or might not exist.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">In a letter to the Commission<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> dated February 28, 2008, the Montgomery County Executive stated: \u201cOver the past several months, I have received extensive correspondence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>and inquires about the Farm Road----I hope that you are able to recognize the Farm Road as the private right-of-way that it seems to be and provide the property owners with their rightful recognition.\u201d The Commission still did not issue addresses to appellants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In a letter to the Montgomery County Executive and the Commission dated June 10, 2008, appellants stated that they intended to file suit. In June 2008, appellants sued appellees in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (\u201cthe federal court\u201d). On July 15, 2011, the federal court dismissed the case for failure to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">On May 15, 2012, the circuit court granted motions to dismiss with prejudice all counts in the Amended Complaint as to MHG, Riggs, and Brown. Specifically, the circuit court dismissed with prejudice: (1) Count Five through Count Eleven as to MHG, Riggs, and Brown, who do not own property adjacent to Farm Road and thus are not interested parties; (2) Count Twelve and Count Thirteen as time-barred as to MHG, Riggs, and Brown; and (3) Count Twelve and Count Thirteen as to MHG and Riggs because they did not owe a duty to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">On June 7, 2012, the circuit court granted motions to dismiss all counts as to the Commission, the Areys, the Messes, Hill, and Johnson. Specifically, the circuit court dismissed: (1) Count One through Count Four, with prejudice, as to the Commission for lack of proper notice; (2) Count Five through Count Eleven, without prejudice, as to the Commission, the Areys, the Messes, Hill, and Johnson, for failure to join necessary parties; and (3) Count Twelve and Count Thirteen, with prejudice, as to the Commission, the Areys, the Messes, Hill, and Johnson, as time-barred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">An appellate court reviews <em>de novo </em>a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss. <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128, 142, 46 A.3d 443 (2012). The appellate court reviews only \u201cthe four corners of the complaint and its incorporated supporting exhibits, if any.\u201d <em>Forster v. Office of Pub. Defender, </em>426 Md. 565, 604, 45 A.3d 180 (2012) (citation omitted). The appellate court assumes the truth of\u2014and views in the light most favorable to the plaintiff\u2014\u201call well-pleaded facts and allegations contained in the complaint, as well as all inferences that may reasonably be drawn from them[.]\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 142, 46 A.3d 443 (citation omitted). Because the plaintiff must plead the complaint\u2019s factual allegations \u201cwith sufficient specificity[,]\u201d <em>Forster, </em>426 Md. at 604, 45 A.3d 180 (citation omitted), however, the appellate court does not consider \u201cbald assertions [or] conclusory statements[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>(citation omitted), and construes against the plaintiff \u201c[a]ny ambiguity or uncertainty in the [factual] allegations[.]\u201d <em>Shenker v. Laureate Educ., Inc., </em>411 Md. 317, 335, 983 A.2d 408 (2009) (citation omitted). The appellate court affirms the grant of the motion \u201conly if the [factual] allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford relief to the plaintiff, <em>i.e., </em>the [factual] allegations do not state a cause of action for which relief may be granted.\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>427 Md. at 142, 46 A.3d 443 (citation omitted). The appellate court may affirm the grant of the motion \u201con any ground adequately shown by the record, whether or not relied upon by the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">I. Count One Through Count Four (Proper Notice)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">(A) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in dismissing Count One through Count Four for lack of proper notice. Specifically, appellants argue that the notice requirement of the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d), Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Code Ann., Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.P.\u201d) \u00a7 5-301 <em>et seq., </em>does not apply to state constitutional torts. Alternatively, although appellants concede that they did not comply with the LGTCA notice requirement, appellants assert that they showed good cause not to comply with the LGTCA notice requirement because they \u201csolicited the assistance of [the] County Executive[,]\u201d and \u201crelied upon the Commission\u2019s ever-changing, and misguided, explanations for the denial of addresses before determining that the instant suit was necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The Commission responds that the circuit court did not err in dismissing Count One through Count Four for lack of proper notice. Specifically, the Commission contends that the LGTCA notice requirement applies to state constitutional torts, and that appellants did not show good cause to excuse compliance with the LGTCA notice requirement because appellants never provided \u201cnotice to anyone in authority who works at\u201d the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">(B) Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">An appellate court reviews for abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s conclusion as to whether a plaintiff showed good cause to excuse compliance with the LGTCA notice requirement. <em>See Prince George\u2019s Cnty. v. Longtin, </em>190 Md.App. 97, 124, 988 A.2d 20 (2010) <em>(\u201cLongtin I </em>\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>419 Md. 450, 19 A.3d 859 (2011) <em>(\u201cLongtin II </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">(C) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">(1) The LGTCA Notice Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\u201c[A]n action for unliquidated damages may not be brought against a local government ... unless the notice of the claim ... is given within 180 days after the injury.\u201d C.J.P. \u00a7 5-304(b)(1). \u201c[U]nless the defendant can affirmatively show that its defense has been prejudiced by lack of required notice, upon motion and for good cause shown the court may entertain the suit even though the required notice was not given.\u201d C.J.P. \u00a7 5-304(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Under C.J.P. \u00a7 5-304(d), a plaintiff has shown good cause to excuse compliance with the LGTCA notice requirement where the plaintiff: (1) \u201cprosecuted his [or her] claim with that degree of diligence that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances[,]\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Hous. Auth. of Balt. City, </em>200 Md.App. 176, 207, 26 A.3d 1012 <em>cert. denied, </em>423 Md. 452, 31 A.3d 920 (2011) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); or (2) delayed because government representatives made \u201cmisleading\u201d representations to the plaintiff. <em>Longtin II, </em>419 Md. at 469, 19 A.3d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">(2) The LGTCA Notice Requirement\u2019s Applicability to State Constitutional Torts</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">To date, in directly considering the issue, no Maryland appellate court has expressly held that the LGTCA notice requirement applies to state constitutional torts; however, in multiple cases, Maryland appellate courts have indicated as much in <em>dicta. See Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 107 n. 19, 660 A.2d 447 (1995) (\u201c[T]here is no exception in the [LGTCA] for constitutional torts. In fact, there is no exception in the statutory language for any category of torts.\u201d); <em>Thomas v. City of Annapolis, </em>113 Md.App. 440, 457, 688 A.2d 448 (1997) (\u201cThe LGTCA ... applies to all torts without distinction, including ... constitutional torts.\u201d (Footnote omitted)); <em>Ransom v. Leopold, </em>183 Md.App. 570, 579, 962 A.2d 1025 (2008) (same) (quoting <em>Thomas, </em>113 Md.App. at 457, 688 A.2d 448); <em>Hansen v. City of Laurel, </em>420 Md. 670, 682 n. 7, 25 A.3d 122 (2011) (\u201c[T]he plain language ... of the LGTCA indicates a legislative intent to make the notice requirement broadly applicable to tort actions brought directly against local governments^] Whether the [LGTCA notice] requirement applies to constitutional claims, which plaintiffs may bring directly against local governments, remains uncertain. We have intimated as much, however.\u201d (Citing <em>Longtin II, </em>419 Md. 450, 19 A.3d 859; <em>Ashton, </em>339 Md. at 107 n. 19, 660 A.2d 447) (omission in original)); <em>see also Longtin II, </em>419 Md. at 521, 19 A.3d 859 (Harrell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>part) (\u201c[W]e recognize, at least implicitly, that the LGTCA procedural requirements <em>(e.g., </em>notice) apply also to constitutional tort claims.\u201d (Citing <em>Ashton, </em>339 Md. at 107 n. 19, 660 A.2d 447)); <em>Luy v. Balt. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>326 F.Supp.2d 682, 693 (D.Md.2004), <em>aff'd, </em>120 Fed.Appx. 465 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he notice requirements of the LGTCA apply to intentional and constitutional torts.\u201d (Citing <em>Curtis v. Pracht, </em>202 F.Supp.2d 406, 414 (D.Md.2002), in turn citing <em>Thomas, </em>113 Md.App. at 457, 688 A.2d 448)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">In multiple cases involving state constitutional torts, by deciding whether the LGTCA notice requirement would bar plaintiffs\u2019 claims, Maryland appellate courts have discussed\u2014 albeit without expressly deciding\u2014whether the LGTCA notice requirement applies to state constitutional torts. <em>See, e.g., Longtin I, </em>190 Md.App. 97, 988 A.2d 20; <em>Longtin II, </em>419 Md. 450, 19 A.3d 859; <em>Wilbon v. Hunsicker, </em>172 Md.App. 181, 913 A.2d 678 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 Md. 316, 920 A.2d 1060 (2007); <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>163 Md.App. 129, 877 A.2d 1129, <em>cert. denied, </em>389 Md. 401, 885 A.2d 825 (2005); <em>Chappelle v. McCarter, </em>162 Md.App. 163, 873 A.2d 458 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">In <em>Longtin I, </em>190 Md.App. at 117-21, 988 A.2d 20, in dicta,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">The Court of Appeals has consistently said that the LGTCA ... do[es] not exclude State constitutional torts from [its] coverage. Less clear is whether the restrictions of those statutes that would defeat all or partial recovery apply in every respect to State constitutional torts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">On the one hand, the Court of Appeals has said that a State constitutional tort, such as one premised on a violation of a \u201cself-executing\u201d constitutional provision, like Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, is enforceable in a common law action for damages. In addition, a State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>constitutional tort action cannot be defeated by the assertion of official or local government immunity. Thus, it appears to exist independently of the LGTCA, which is premised on a <em>waiver </em>of governmental immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">On the other hand, at least in [ ] cases [that involve the Maryland Tort Claims Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d), Maryland Code Ann., State Government Art. (\u201cS.G.\u201d) \u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq.], </em>the Court of Appeals has indicated that recovery against the State is available as long as the claimant complies with the procedural requirements of the [MTCA]. In addition, in <em>Md. Reclamation </em>Assoc. <em>v. Harford, Cnty., </em>342 Md. 476, 492-93, 677 A.2d 567 (1996), the Court also emphasized that administrative exhaustion requirements apply even in cases of alleged State constitutional violations. Finally, presumably the Court of Appeals, in concluding that constitutional torts were not excluded from the LGTCA and MTCA, intended that such coverage include more than just a deeper pocket for recovery and the protection of employees from individual liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">The issue of the applicability <em>vel non </em>of tort claims act notice of claim requirements to State constitutional torts is one that has arisen in a number of other jurisdictions\u2014 always with the same result. Often citing constitutional concerns, these courts invariably have held that these procedural requirements are inapplicable to actions for violations of a state constitutional right. <em>See Moore Real Estate, Inc. v. Porter Cnty. Drainage Bd., </em>578 N.E.2d 380, 381 (Ind.Ct.App.1991); <em>Dishman v. Neb. Pub. Power Dist., </em>240 Neb. 452, 482 N.W.2d 580, 582 (Neb.1992); <em>Greenway Dev. Co. v. Borough of Paramus, </em>163 N. J. 546, 750 A.2d 764, 768, 770 (N.J.2000); <em>Baumler v. Town of Newstead, </em>198 A.D.2d 777, 604 N.Y.S.2d 372, 373 (N.Y.App.Div.1993); <em>Wolff v. Sec. of S.D. Game, Fish &amp; Parks Dep\u2019t, </em>544 N.W.2d 531, 535 (S.D.1996); <em>Heughs Land, L.L.C. v. Holladay City, </em>113 P.3d 1024, 1027 (Utah Ct.App.2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">Some of these decisions, <em>see, e.g., Greenway Dev. Co., </em>750 A.2d at 770 and <em>Moore Real Estate, </em>578 N.E.2d at 381, rely on the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Felder v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>Casey, </em>487 U.S. 131, 108 S.Ct. 2302, 101 L.Ed.2d 123 (1988). There, the Court held that a state tort claims act 4-month notice of claim requirement could not be applied to an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of an individual\u2019s federal constitutional rights. <em>Id. </em>at 138, 108 S.Ct. 2302. Speaking for the Court, Justice Brennan said that federal civil rights actions \u201cexist independent of any other legal or administrative relief that may be available as a matter of federal or state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, 108 S.Ct. 2302 (citing <em>Burnett v. Grattan, </em>468 U.S. 42, 50, 104 S.Ct. 2924, 82 L.Ed.2d 36 (1984)); that a notice of claim requirement mirrored a conferral of immunity, 487 U.S. at 142, 108 S.Ct. 2302; that \u201c[m]any civil rights victims ... will fail to appreciate the compensable nature of their injuries within the 4-month window,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 146, 108 S.Ct. 2302; and that the state statute \u201cburden[ed]\u201d the exercise of the rights of civil rights victims. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 108 S.Ct. 2302. Pointing out the relative complexity of some constitutional claims, Justice Brennan said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">[M]any other deprivations, such as those involving denial of due process or of equal protection, will be far more subtle. In the latter, and by no means negligible, category of constitutional injuries, victims will frequently fail to recognize within the 4-month statutory period that they have been wronged at all. <em>Id. </em>at 146 n. 3, 108 S.Ct. 2302. These points are particularly telling here, because the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-m\">Court of Appeals has declared Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights to be self-executing and has recognized that there is no official or local governmental immunity from a State constitutional tort. Moreover, if the four and six-month periods of <em>Felder </em>and <em>Burnett </em>were deemed too short for a plaintiffs assertion of a 14th Amendment violation, it would seem to follow that the six-month notice of claim period of [the LGTCA] is too short for the Maryland constitutional analog to the 14th Amendment\u2014Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">(Emphasis, second omission, and some alterations in original) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(D) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">(1) The LGTCA Notice Requirement\u2019s Applicability to State Constitutional Torts</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In this case, we must decide whether the LGTCA applies where a plaintiff sues the Commission for a state constitutional tort.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We consider three points.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">First, \u201cgenerally under common law, the State enjoys sovereign immunity and is thus protected from suit for both ordinary torts and State constitutional torts.\u201d <em>Ford v. Balt. City Sheriffs Office, </em>149 Md.App. 107, 119, 814 A.2d 127 (2002) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Second, \u201cthe Commission is properly characterized as a state agency for the purpose of determining its right to invoke the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>O &amp; B, Inc. v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>279 Md. 459, 466, 369 A.2d 553 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Third, the LGTCA\u2014enacted in 1987, a decade after <em>O &amp; B, </em>id.\u2014constitutes a waiver of the Commission\u2019s sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Longtin I, </em>190 Md.App. at 118, 988 A.2d 20 (\u201c[T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>LGTCA ... is premised on a waiver of governmental immunity.\u201d (Emphasis and footnote omitted)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In sum: (1) sovereign immunity applies to state constitutional torts, <em>Ford, </em>149 Md.App. at 119, 814 A.2d 127; (2) the Commission is entitled to sovereign immunity, <em>O &amp; B, </em>279 Md. at 466, 369 A.2d 553; and (3) the State waived the Commission\u2019s sovereign immunity through the LGTCA, <em>see Longtin I, </em>190 Md.App. at 118, 988 A.2d 20, which sets conditions precedent to a plaintiffs ability to sue. Thus, a plaintiff may sue the Commission for a state constitutional tort only if the plaintiff complies with the LGTCA\u2019s conditions, including its notice requirement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>(2) Good Cause to Excuse Compliance with the LGTCA Notice Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Next, we are satisfied that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that appellants did not show good cause to excuse compliance with the LGTCA notice requirement. For purposes of our analysis under the LGTCA, we assume, as appellants argue, that their injury occurred on November 20, 2007, when the Commission denied Rounds\u2019s and Gaither\u2019s requests for addresses;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> thus, the LGTCA\u2019s 180-day notice deadline occurred in May 2008. Appellants did not send notice to the Commission until June 10, 2008; thus, as they concede, they did not comply with the LGTCA notice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We reject appellants\u2019 contention that they prosecuted their claims with the degree of diligence that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances. <em>See Mitchell, </em>200 Md.App. at 207, 26 A.3d 1012. The Amended Complaint does not state that appellants took any action between November 20, 2007 (the injury date), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>June 10, 2008 (the notice date), aside from contacting the Montgomery County Executive, who, in a letter dated February 28, 2008, encouraged the Commission to issue addresses to appellants. In a seven-month span, persuading one officeholder to write one letter\u2014and taking no further action\u2014does not amount to the degree of diligence that an ordinarily prudent person would have exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Additionally, we reject appellants\u2019 contention that they delayed because the Commission made misleading representations to them. <em>See Longtin II, </em>419 Md. at 469, 19 A.3d 859. According to the Amended Complaint, since November 20, 2007, the Commission has \u201ctaken different positions as to why it [was] refusing to issue\u201d addresses to appellants. However, as noted above, the Amended Complaint does not state that appellants took any action between November 20, 2007 (the injury date), and June 10, 2008 (the notice date), aside from contacting the Montgomery County Executive. Thus, the Amended Complaint fails to explain how the Commission\u2019s different positions misled appellants or caused them to delay in sending notice to the Commission.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">For all the reasons discussed above, the circuit court did not err in dismissing Count One through Count Four for lack of proper notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">II. Count Five Through Count Eleven (Joinder of Necessary Parties)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">(A) Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Appellants contend that the circuit court erred in granting the motions to dismiss Count Five through Count Eleven for failure to join necessary parties.

Appellants assert that this allegation establishes that the \u201cother adjacent property owners\u201d declined to join this case. (Emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Appellees respond that the circuit court did not err in granting the motions to dismiss Count Five through Count Eleven for failure to join necessary parties. Specifically, appellees contend that the Amended Complaint\u2019s allegation\u2014 that other adjacent property owners have agreed not to contest the relief sought\u2014is an \u201camorphous assurance\u201d that did not bind the circuit court. Additionally, appellees argue that appellants needed to join the Montgomery County Executive, who is the only one with the authority to declare Farm Road to be a public highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In a reply brief, appellants respond that, in the Amended Complaint, they did not seek to have Farm Road declared a public highway; rather, they sought a declaratory judgment that they have an easement to use Farm Road and the ten-foot right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">(B) Law</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">C.J.P. \u00a7 3-405(a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">(1) If declaratory relief is sought, a person who has or claims any interest which would be affected by the declaration, shall be made a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">(2) Except in a class action, the declaration may not prejudice the rights of any person not a party to the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">Maryland Rule 2-211 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">(a) Persons to be joined.

MIE Props., Inc., </em>398 Md. 657, 703, 922 A.2d 509 (2007) (citation and some internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIf these objectives are met\u2014especially if the non-joined parties are bound by the decree\u2014the formal non-joinder of necessary parties may not be fatal.\u201d <em>Bodnar v.

In Count Five through Count Eleven, appellants sought a declaratory judgment that they have an easement to use Farm Road and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ten-foot right-of-way.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the Amended Complaint, appellants named the Messes, Hill, and Johnson as the defendants who own property adjacent to Farm Road. In the Amended Complaint, appellants admitted that they had not joined everyone who owns property adjacent to Farm Road. Generally, a trial court should dismiss a claim for declaratory judgment that the plaintiffs have an easement to use a road where the plaintiffs have not joined everyone who owns property adjacent to the road. <em>See </em>C.J.P. \u00a7 3-405(a)(l) (\u201cIf declaratory relief is sought, a person who has or claims any interest which would be affected by the declaration, shall be made a party.\u201d); Md.

Hurricane Exp., Inc., </em>185 Md.App. 25, 41, 968 A.2d 620 (2009), and <em>MIE Props., </em>398 Md. at 704-05, 922 A.2d 509, the circuit court erred in granting the motions to dismiss because the \u201cother adjacent property owners\u201d declined to join this case. In both <em>MIE Props., 398 Md. </em>at 704, 922 A.2d 509, and <em>Serv. Transp., </em>185 Md.App. at 41, 968 A.2d 620, an appellate court held that a trial court did not err where: (1) a business was not joined as a party, and (2) the business knew of the case through its owner or president, who participated in the case. Specifically, in <em>Serv. Transp., </em>185 Md.App. at 41, 968 A.2d 620, the business\u2019s president was a defendant and had been deposed, and in <em>MIE Props., </em>398 Md. at 704, 922 A.2d 509, the business\u2019s owner submitted an affidavit and testified at trial. In both <em>MIE Props., </em>398 Md. at 703, 922 A.2d 509, and <em>Serv.

Indeed, in the Amended Complaint, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>lants merely allege that \u201cother adjacent property owners have agreed not to contest the relief sought[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">For two reasons, we reject appellants\u2019 contention that the circuit court should have denied the motions to dismiss and allowed the case to proceed to discovery\u2014during or after which, presumably, the circuit court would revisit the issue of joinder of necessary parties. First, a trial court should resolve the issue of joinder of necessary parties as early as possible. <em>See S. Mgmt. Corp. v. Kevin Wittes Const. Co., Inc., </em>382 Md. 524, 548 n. 14, 856 A.2d 626 (2004) (\u201c[I]t would have been preferable to have the question of the required joinder ... squarely presented to the trial court at an earlier stage of the proceeding.\u201d (Omission in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Second, by allowing a defendant to move to dismiss for failure to join necessary parties before filing an answer, Maryland Rule 2-322(b)(3) implies that, before discovery, a trial court may resolve the issue of joinder of necessary parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Although we conclude that the circuit court did not err in granting the motions to dismiss Count Five through Count Eleven, we do so only on the ground that appellants failed to join the \u201cother adjacent property owners\u201d; we reject appellees\u2019 contention\u2014and the circuit court\u2019s conclusion\u2014that appellants needed to join the Montgomery County Executive. Although only the Montgomery County Executive has the authority to \u201cdeclare [a] road to be a public highway[,]\u201d Montgomery County Code \u00a7 49-6(a), in the Amended Complaint, appellants did not seek to have Farm Road declared a public highway. Although Count Five is subtitled \u201cPublic Roads[,]\u201d appellants sought the same relief in Count Five that they did in Count Six through Count Eleven\u2014a declaratory judgment that they have an easement to use Farm Road and the ten-foot right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">For all the reasons discussed above, we hold that the circuit court did not err in dismissing Count Five through Count Eleven for failure to join necessary parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>III.

In the third amended complaint, concerning Farm Road\u2019s access to Gold Mine Road, as stated earlier, [the plaintiff] acknowledges two important dates: 1994\u2014 when the Dellabrooke subdivision was initially approved, and 2001\u2014when Plat 21707 was recorded. By stating in the third amended complaint that the northward access of Farm Road to Gold Mine Road been \u201cpermanently cut\u201d in 1994 and access to Gold Mine Road was prohibited in 2001, [the plaintiff], in effect, acknowledged that he \u201creasonably should have known\u201d or with diligent investigation could have known at the time he purchased the property that he could not use Farm Road to access Gold Mine Road.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">(C) Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Here, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in dismissing Count Twelve and Count Thirteen as time-barred. According to the Amended Complaint: (1) \u201c[i]n or around 1994, ... Brown ... began developing the area around Farm Road\u201d; and (2) \u201c[a]s part of his development ... Brown eliminated the northern access to Farm Road from Goldmine Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Although, in the Amended Complaint, appellants do not allege the date on which Brown allegedly \u201celiminated the northern access to Farm Road,\u201d the Amended Complaint implies that Brown\u2019s alleged elimination of northern access to Farm Road occurred sometime in or before 2003. According to the Amended Complaint: (1) \u201c[i]n or around 2003, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Areys purchased 69 acres of the fictional \u2018conservation easement\u2019 and (2) \u201cthe Areys, even before their purchase of the 69 acres, worked behind the scenes with Brown ... to cut off the northern access to Farm Road[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, we assume that Brown\u2019s alleged elimination of northern access to Farm Road occurred sometime in or before 2003 (when the Areys allegedly bought the 69 acres).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Next, we conclude that Brown\u2019s alleged elimination of northern access Farm Road put appellants on inquiry notice that their ability to access Farm Road was in danger. <em>See Bacon, </em>203 Md.App. at 660-61, 40 A.3d 435 (This Court held that the alleged elimination of northern access to Farm Road put the plaintiff on inquiry notice that his ability to access Farm Road was in danger.). Alternatively, we are satisfied that the Commission\u2019s approval of Plat 21707 on August 3, 2000, put appellants on inquiry notice that their ability to access Farm Road was in danger. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Essentially, after Brown\u2019s alleged elimination of northern access to Farm Road\u2014as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>as the Commission\u2019s approval of Plat 21707\u2014appellants \u201cshould have discovered [their injury] through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d <em>Poole, </em>423 Md. at 131, 31 A.3d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Finally, we conclude that appellants did not timely file their claims for wrongful interference with easement rights (Count Twelve) or slander of title (Count Thirteen). As explained above, the accrual date was sometime in or before 2003. In June 2008, appellants sued appellees in the federal court. Thus, appellants did not file within the required three years for wrongful interference with easement rights (Count Twelve), C.J.P. \u00a7 5-101, or the required one year for slander of title (Count Thirteen).

Because we are satisfied that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that appellants did not show good cause to excuse compliance with the LGTCA notice requirement, <em>see </em>Part I.D.2 below, we cannot base our holding on good cause, as we did in <em>Longtin I, </em>190 Md.App. at 121-22, 988 A.2d 20. Because appellants concede that they did not timely comply with the LGTCA notice requirement, we cannot base our holding on timeliness, as the Court of Appeals did in <em>Longtin II, </em>419 Md. at 500, 19 A.3d 859. Because appellants do not contend that they substantially complied with the LGTCA notice requirement, we do not base our holding on substantial compliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b127-11\">. The LGTCA\u2014not the MTCA\u2014constitutes a waiver of the Commission\u2019s sovereign immunity.

To be precise, the LGTCA constitutes a waiver of the Commission\u2019s sovereign immunity insofar as the Commission \"may not assert governmental or sovereign immunity to avoid the duty to defend or indemnify an emp!oyee[,]\u201d C.J.P. \u00a7 5-303(b)(2), who commits \"tortious acts or omissions ... within the scope of employment with the\u201d Commission.

In other words, the LGTCA \"requires [a local] government to assume financial responsibility for a judgment against its employee by abolishing that immunity the government may have had against responsibility for the acts of its employees.\u201d <em>Khawaja v. Mayor &amp; City Council, City of Rockville, </em>89 Md.App. 314, 325-26, 598 A.2d 489 (1991), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>326 Md. 501, 606 A.2d 224 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">It is true that \u201d[t]he LGTCA, by its own terms, contains no specific waiver of governmental immunity when a governmental entity is sued in its own capacity.\u201d <em>Khawaja, </em>89 Md.App. at 325, 598 A.2d 489. In contrast to other types of torts, however, a state constitutional tort can be brought \"directly [against] a local government[,]\u201d as state constitutional torts \"were available prior to the adoption of the LGTCA.\u201d <em>Hansen, </em>420 Md. at 682 n. 7, 25 A.3d 122 (citation omitted). Thus, our reasoning is unaffected by <em>Khawaja, </em>89 Md.App. at 325, 598 A.2d 489, or the cases that have cited <em>Khawaja. See, e.g., Williams v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>123 Md.App. 119, 126, 716 A.2d 1100 (1998), <em>aff'd sub nom. Williams v.

Our conclusion is supported by <em>dicta </em>in various cases that the LGTCA notice requirement applies to state constitutional torts. <em>See, e.g., Ashton, </em>339 Md. at 107 n. 19, 660 A.2d 447; <em>Ransom, </em>183 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>at 579, 962 A.2d 1025; <em>Hansen, </em>420 Md. at 682 n. 7, 25 A.3d 122. We need not rely on such <em>dicta, </em>however, as we base our holding on the Commission\u2019s status as a government entity that is both; (1) a \u201clocal government\u201d subject to the LGTCA, <em>see </em>CJ.P. \u00a7 5\u2014301(d)(6); and (2) a State agency entitled to sovereign immunity. <em>See O &amp; B, </em>279 Md. at 466, 369 A.2d 553.</p>\n<p id=\"Adr\">We do not decide whether the LGTCA notice requirement would apply where a plaintiff sues a different local government for a state constitutional tort.

Additionally, with respect to local governments other than the Commission, we do not reach our <em>dicta </em>in <em>Longtin I, </em>190 Md.App. at 115-21, 988 A.2d 20, in which this Court observed the \u201c[ujneasy [fjit\" between state constitutional torts and the LGTCA notice requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\">. In Part III below, however, we conclude that, for purposes of the statute of limitations, the accrual date was before November 20, 2007. <em>See Halloran v. Montgomery Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Pub.

We need not consider the different positions that the Commission allegedly took before November 20, 2007 (the injury date), as only events after the injury date are relevant to show what caused appellants to delay in sending notice to the Commission.

Our assumption is supported by the fact that, at oral argument, appellants conceded that Brown's alleged elimination of Farm Road occurred before 2003.

For example, in <em>Bacon, id. </em>at 660, 40 A.3d 435 we stated: \"[T]he plat is not a part of [the plaintiffj\u2019s chain of title....

Furthermore, we observe that\u2014despite appellants\u2019 insistence on appeal that the crux of the Amended Complaint is the Commission's denial of addresses for appellants' properties\u2014in none of the Amended Complaint\u2019s thirteen counts do appellants seek addresses for their properties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\">.
