Specifically, those offenses included the following counts: (a) two counts of first-degree arson;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (b) one count of second degree arson;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (c) one count of first-degree burglary;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>one count of third-degree burglary;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (e) one count of fourth-degree burglary;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (f) four counts of reckless endangerment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After a three-day trial concluding on January 13, 2011, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>and one day of deliberation, the circuit court accepted a partial verdict, finding appellant not guilty of one count of reckless endangerment. Thereafter, the court declared a mistrial on the remaining nine counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">A new trial was held on the remaining counts from July 12, 2011, until July 14, 2011. On July 15, 2011, the court accepted a partial verdict\u2014finding appellant guilty of attempted second degree arson\u2014and declared a mistrial on the remaining counts. Appellant subsequently filed a motion for new trial on the basis of what appellant considered prosecutorial misconduct, in violation of appellant\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which the circuit court denied on January 27, 2012. Appellant was sentenced to ten years of incarceration, with all but two years suspended, followed by a period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Appellant noted a timely appeal on February 6, 2012. Appellant presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">I. Did the prosecutor violate Simpson\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment [of the United States Constitution] and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights by repeatedly assuring the jury during opening statement that Simpson \u201cwill tell you\u201d that he committed the alleged offenses!?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">II. Did the trial court err by permitting the State to offer opinion testimony from a fire investigator concerning his canine partner\u2019s alleged detection of an accelerant on and in Simpson\u2019s car and on his shoes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">On November 15, 2009, Jeffrey Byers (\u201cMr. Byers\u201d), his wife, Yolanda Byers (\u201cMs. Byers\u201d), and their daughter, Jenaigh Byers (\u201cJenaigh\u201d), returned to their home on Sandy Bar Drive, Fort Washington, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, at approximately 1:00 a.m. Mr. Byers noticed flickering lights shining through his window blinds and thought it was \u201clike a fire engine, a police truck, or something.\u201d He walked over to his bedroom window to determine the source of the lights, and \u201csaw fire coming out of the front of [his detached, two-car] garage\u201d and its three-bedroom loft. He yelled to his family, alerting them of the fire, and proceeded to telephone the fire department.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Thereafter, Mr. Byers ran outdoors, grabbed his garden hose, and attempted to contain the fire by \u201cspraying it down.\u201d Unfortunately, the garage was engulfed by the blaze, and he soon realized that \u201cthe fire[,] at that point[,] was too much for the water hose.\u201d Nonetheless, Mr. Byers attempted to prevent the fire from spreading to his family\u2019s home. The firemen arrived and asked him to move to a more secure location. Following their advisement, the firemen began spraying down the Byers\u2019 residence. Confused, Mr. Byers\u2019 asked, \u201cwhy, and [one fireman] said because the garage was pretty much already a loss,\u201d and the firemen \u201cwanted to cool down the main house ... to keep the fire from spreading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">By the time the fire was extinguished, there was little left of the garage\u2019s structure. All of the family\u2019s personal property stored within the garage was a total loss. Because the cause of the fire appeared suspicious, the police were called for further investigation. Mr. and Ms. Byers provided the police a list of potential suspects. In addition, Investigator William Murray of the Prince George\u2019s County Fire Department\u2019s Office of the Fire Marshal, an active member of the International Association of Arson Investigators, conducted an investigation of the charred structure in the fire\u2019s aftermath. After assessing the damage to the property and determining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>fire\u2019s origin, he concluded within a reasonable degree of certainty that the fire \u201cwas set by human hand.\u201d As a result, the Fire Department installed surveillance cameras in the area around the Byers\u2019 home, but subsequently removed them on April 3, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">On April 4, 2010, Mr. Byers awoke around 3:00 a.m., and discovered the home was filled with smoke. Concerned for the safety of his family, he proceeded to determine the origin of the smoke, then exited the home to inspect its perimeter. Upon reaching the backside of the home, he \u201csaw the roof above [the] dining room on fire in two places.\u201d Mr. Byers \u201cyelled back\u201d to Ms. Byers, informing her of the fire, and they \u201cstarted calling 911.\u201d Mr. Byers then \u201cran to get the water hose, and ran ... to the back of the house,\u201d and attempted to extinguish the fire. Fortunately, he was able to contain the fire until the Fire Department arrived to extinguish the flames. Lieutenant Brandon Goff of the Office of the Fire Marshal responded to the scene, and detected the strong smell of accelerant in the air. Mr. and Ms. Byers provided law enforcement officers and the fire investigator with an additional list of possible suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Law enforcement officers collected several samples of burned wood, soil, and debris as well as partially burned tar paper and pieces of roofing for testing. They also collected an unburned sample of roofing as a control sample for testing. Forensic Chemist Andrew Hawkins of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives analyzed the samples for ignitable fluids, and determined that all provided samples, but for the control, contained gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Following the fire of April 4, 2010, the Byers family replaced the two-camera surveillance system they originally used at their residence with an \u201ceight-camera system that ha[d] a built-in DVR.\u201d Mr. Byers purchased an additional four cameras for the system, resulting in a twelve-camera surveillance system that monitored the entire perimeter of the Byers\u2019 residence. The system was equipped with infrared motion detection and recording capabilities that enabled the Byers to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>remotely survey the home. Additionally, Mr. and Ms. Byers began sleeping in shifts to monitor the security of their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">During Ms. Byers\u2019 shift on May 16, 2010, at approximately 1:00 a.m., she noted on the surveillance cameras\u2019 footage, that \u201call of a sudden, someone started walking down the street, alongside [the Byers\u2019] yard, and then ... [she] watched [that person] take a left turn into [their] driveway.\u201d The individual was wearing a mask, hood, jacket, jeans, a pair of tennis shoes, and carried a container. Ms. Byers then witnessed the individual approach her Nissan Altima vehicle and begin \u201cdous[ing]\u201d it with an unknown liquid. She then alerted her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Jenaigh Byers also maintained a monitor of the surveillance system in her bedroom. After witnessing the same events as her mother, Jenaigh exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s a man, there\u2019s a man!\u201d Jasmine Byers, Mr. and Ms. Byers\u2019 other daughter was awakened by the family\u2019s commotion. The entire family proceeded to the living room, which maintained a picture window facing the driveway, and Ms. Byers began pounding on the window, shouting to the man, \u201cGet away from the car, get away from my car[!]\u201d In response, the man stepped into the Byers\u2019 yard and gestured to Ms. Byers with a middle-finger. As the family dialed the police, the man retreated, initially dropping a bag and the container with which he was pouring liquid onto Ms. Byers\u2019 vehicle. He subsequently picked up the articles and fled from the Byers\u2019 property, running \u201cback off up the street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">As the family waited, Mr. Byers, Ms. Byers, and Jasmine realized that the man who had attempted to ignite Ms. Byers\u2019 vehicle was appellant, Jasmine\u2019s former boyfriend from high school, based on the man\u2019s posture, walk, and body frame. When the police arrived, the family provided the officers with appellant\u2019s name, indicated that he lived within a five to ten minute drive of the Byers\u2019 residence, and provided the officers with appellant\u2019s address.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Captain Brian Radinsky (\u201cCaptain Radinsky\u201d) of the Prince George\u2019s County Fire Department and EMS, spoke to police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>officers at the Byers\u2019 residence and observed that Ms. Byers\u2019 vehicle had, in fact, been doused with gasoline. He subsequently viewed the surveillance footage and was provided with appellant\u2019s address. Thereafter, he, along with his partner Robert Kaleda (\u201cInvestigator Kaleda\u201d), drove to appellant\u2019s address located on Surrey Circle Drive, Fort Washington, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Captain Radinsky spoke to police officers already there and observed Investigator Kaleda perform an exterior canine scan of the appellant\u2019s vehicle. Investigator Kaleda\u2019s canine partner, Joy, had two positive alerts to the presence of accelerants: (1) at the driver\u2019s door handle, and (2) at the trunk\u2019s keyhole.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">After witnessing Joy\u2019s alert, Captain Radinsky, along with two police officers, knocked on appellant\u2019s door. Appellant answered, \u201cand he asked what was going on.\u201d As Captain Radinsky and the two officers walked inside, they smelled a strong odor of gasoline. Captain Radinsky placed appellant under arrest. Appellant subsequently consented to a canine search of his person, and a canine and physical search of his vehicle. Although no inculpatory evidence was found on the appellant\u2019s person, Joy alerted to the presence of accelerants in appellant\u2019s trunk and underneath the driver\u2019s seat of appellant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Appellant and his father, William Siam Simpson, Jr., also consented to a canine search of his bedroom and the laundry room. During the canine search of appellant\u2019s bedroom, Joy alerted to a pair of black and gray Nike brand athletic shoes located in the appellant\u2019s closet. Inspector Kaleda collected the shoes, placing them each individually in one-gallon cans for forensic laboratory analysis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>En route to transporting appellant to the District IV Oxon Hill police station, appellant blurted out to Captain Radinsky that he did not understand what was going on and that \u201che had been out earlier that night on a date.\u201d Appellant then asked Captain Radinsky \u201cif [he] wanted to see text messages to who[m]ever he was on a date with, to prove it.\u201d Captain Radinsky advised appellant that they could discuss it after their arrival at the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">At the police station, appellant was placed in an interview room and advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rights. He subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>executed an advice of rights and waiver form, and was instructed before answering any questions that the Byers\u2019 had a video surveillance system. Appellant admitted that he had poured gasoline on Ms. Byers\u2019 vehicle and was going to ignite it with a lighter in his front right pocket. He also admitted to burning down the Byers\u2019 garage and setting fire to the roof of the Byers\u2019 home, as reflected in the following colloquy with the captain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: What did you use to ignite the fire in the garage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">[APPELLANT]: Lighter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: On the roof?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">[APPELLANT]: Lighter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: Did you have a lighter with you tonight? [APPELLANT]: Yes. In my right pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A52\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: Why did you set fire to the garage, house, and attempt to burn the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">[APPELLANT]: Grudge against the family, always treated me like shit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: How did you know the family (Byers)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">[APPELLANT]: Dated Jasmine Byers for 17 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axj\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: When did you set the fire in the garage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-13\">[APPELLANT]: Around Nov[.] 2009, about 2am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ6\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: What did you put the gasoline in when you burned the garage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-14\">[APPELLANT]: A big water bottle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-15\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: When did you set the roof on fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-16\">[APPELLANT]: A couple of months ago, middle of the night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-17\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: What did you put the gasoline in when you burned the roof?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>[APPELLANT]: A big water bottle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: What did you put the gasoline in when you tried to burn the Nissan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">[APPELLANT]: Metal canteen kept at house, in garage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ5\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: Did you know that the Byer\u2019s [sic] were home when you burned the roof?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">[APPELLANT]: I assumed everyone was in the main house, I didn\u2019t want to kill anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: Where are the clothes you wore tonight when you attempted to set the Nissan on fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azlm\">[APPELLANT]: In my room, coat is in closet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">[CAPTAIN RADINSKY]: What shoes were you wearing tonight when you attempted to set the Nissan on fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfH\">[APPELLANT]: Grey and black Nike shoes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The dialogue, <em>supra, </em>was transcribed, initialed and signed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Following this dialogue, appellant was provided with a pen and paper to write a statement. After Captain Radinsky exited the room, appellant wrote the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APG\">I[,] William Siam Simpson[,] III[,] burned the garage down of the [B]yers house. I set the fire inside the garage. I ran away and let the fire burned [sic]. I just poured gasoline all over the garage and let it burn. The second attempt was the roof that I set on fire. I just climbed up the tree pour[ed] gasoline and just left. Let the house burned [sic]. My third attempt was tonight. I wore a mask, gloves, leather jacket, [and] poured gasoline all over the [N]issan [A]ltima and tried to burn it. I\u2019m crazy[,] and I need help. I have anger management issues[.] I cannot control myself. Put me in the chair for lethal injection. I\u2019m ashamed of what I [have] become[J I [have] failed my family, friends, and myself. God help me!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Appellant subsequently signed the statement, confirming that it was \u201ctrue and correct to the best of [his] knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aig\">On June 30, 2010, appellant was indicted by grand jury with ten offenses in connection with the three incidents of arson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number><em>supra. </em>The State presented its case against appellant during the course of a three-day trial that concluded on January 13, 2011. After one day of deliberation, the circuit court accepted a partial verdict, finding appellant not guilty of one count of reckless endangerment. Thereafter, the court declared a mistrial on the remaining nine counts. A new trial was held on those counts from July 12, 2011, until July 14, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On July 15, 2011, the court accepted a partial verdict-finding appellant guilty of attempted second degree arson\u2014 and declared a mistrial on the remaining counts. Appellant subsequently filed a motion for new trial on the basis of alleged prosecutorial misconduct in violation of appellant\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which the circuit court denied on January 27, 2012. On that same date, appellant was sentenced to ten years incarceration, with all but two years suspended, followed by a period of probation. Appellant noted a timely appeal on February 6, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Additional facts will be presented <em>infra </em>to the extent they are material to the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">(A) The State\u2019s Opening Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The trial began with the prosecutor presenting her opening statement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">On November the 15th, 2009, the [appellant] came onto the Byers\u2019 property, came to their home, and set their detached garage on fire. It burned down to the ground, along with all of their personal and sentimental property inside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">And on April the 4th, 2010, the [appellant] came back to the Byers\u2019 home and set the roof of their home on fire. There were four family members home at the time. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>woke up in the middle of the night, or in the early morning hours, to a smoke-filled house and flames.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">On May 16th, 2010, yet again, the [appellant] returned back to the Byers\u2019 home, and while on video surveillance poured gasoline on Mrs. Byers\u2019 car and attempted to set it on fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019m going to tell you up front that this is not a who-done-it case, and this is not [a] trial where the facts of how the crime was committed [are] missing, and this is not a case where motive is a mystery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">Ladies and gentlemen ..., the [appellant] himself will tell you, number one, that he burned down that garage\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">At this point, appellant\u2019s counsel noted an objection, which was overruled. The State continued by indicating to the jury that appellant would tell them how he committed the acts of arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Appellant\u2019s counsel presented an additional objection to this argument, which the court overruled. The prosecutor then concluded her opening statement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-10\">And further, he\u2019ll tell you why he did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">But even with the [appellant\u2019s own words, the State\u2014I will bring members of the Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s Fire Marshal\u2019s [Ojffice, and members of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, here to testify before you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-12\">And they\u2019re going to sit right there in that jury box and they\u2019re going to corroborate everything that the [appellant] has said; along with the fire investigators, a forensic chemist, who is going to come in and tell you all about his analysis of the State\u2019s evidence that was collected in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-13\">Ladies and gentlemen, I ask that you give this case your undivided attention, I ask that you pay close attention to what comes from that witness stand, because at the end of this trial[,] I\u2019m going to ask you to listen to what the [appellant] has said, to listen to how his words are corroborated; and when you go back into that deliberation room[,] I\u2019m going to ask that you come back out with a verdict of guilty on all counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Thereafter, the circuit court invited appellant to present opening statement to the jury. Appellant\u2019s counsel affirmatively responded, further advising his intent to present a motion before or after his closing. The circuit court suggested that appellant present his opening statement first, to which appellant\u2019s counsel acquiesced. In his opening, appellant\u2019s counsel responded directly to the prosecutor, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">Based on [the prosecutor\u2019s] suggestion that my client is going to state\u2014to stand up in front of you and admit to all of the offenses, you\u2019re saying, wait a minute, that doesn\u2019t make sense, something doesn\u2019t make sense here; if he\u2019s guilty, why don\u2019t, you know, you say he\u2019s guilty and let us all go about our business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">Well, there\u2019s something that was not entirely clear from the State\u2019s opening statement, because that what she\u2019s referring to is a so-called confession that my client gave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">But if you\u2019ve listened to that presentation where she said it\u2019s not a who-done-it case, we know he did it, he admitted everything; then forget it, forget about asking any questions, forget about your oath to listen to the evidence before you render a decision\u2014because then something\u2019s gone terribly wrong, because my client, William Siam Simpson, III, sits here before you with the presumption of innocence, and it is the State\u2019s job to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he\u2019s guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">And, ladies and gentlemen, until they\u2019ve done that, you must assume that he\u2019s not guilty, that he is not\u2014that he\u2019s innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">Let\u2019s talk about this so-called confession which the State\u2014and I believe they even used the word. They acted like he\u2019s going to come up here and testify in front of you, as if he did all of these things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">My client, on May 16, 2010, signed a statement, and that\u2019s what [the State] was referring to. The statement referred to three incidents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>If you look at this statement ... the problem is, first, that as to the ... the first two incidents\u2014there\u2019s no evidence, other than this statement, that my client had anything to do with those incidents....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">The other problem is, if you look at the statement, it is so vague that it does not have the ring of truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">There\u2019s a law professor who I\u2019m going to paraphrase, and I\u2019ll look at the exact quote for the closing argument, but he said that it\u2019s the hallmark of a false confession when the confession does not fit with the known verifiable facts of a crime. And that\u2019s what you have here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">And bear in mind, this is a very hard case, because all of these witnesses have testified before, including our witnesses, and they\u2019ve been subjected to cross-examination. They know what we\u2019re going to ask and they know our defenses....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Subsequent to the conclusion of appellant\u2019s opening statement, the circuit court excused the jury for lunch, and the following dialogue ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to ask for a mistrial in this case. I think that the State has ... They said my client said that this or that, talking about the statement. But that\u2019s not what he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">I mean, to me, it\u2019s bright-line; you can\u2019t refer to a client\u2019s testimony or non-testimony. That\u2019s a Fifth Amendment right. He has a right not to testify. At the last trial we thought we\u2019d put him on, and decided not to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">You know, this time, I\u2019m probably not likely to put him on, and she just told them what we were going to say and\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJV\">THE COURT: Through the confession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">THE COURT: The confession is admissible in evidence as to what his words are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">[THE STATE]: And those are his words, whether he takes the stand or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>THE COURT: Well, I understand that you don\u2019t like the phrase, but your motion for mistrial is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Before this Court, appellant further alleges prosecutorial misconduct. He avers that \u201c[t]he prosecutor violated [his] rights under the Fifth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights by ... assuring the jury during [her] opening statement that [appellant] \u2018will tell you\u2019 that he committed\u201d the offenses for which he was standing trial. Consequently, he argues that the circuit court erred in overruling his objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statements, for failing to provide the jury with any curative instruction, and for denying his motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Conversely, the State contends that appellant\u2019s arguments are meritless for three reasons: (1) that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not implicate [appellant\u2019s] rights under the Fifth Amendment or Maryland Declaration of Rights, [and] the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled defense counsel\u2019s objection ...;\u201d (2) that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not improper, and the circuit court committed no error in denying appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial; (3) that \u201c[e]ven if the prosecutor\u2019s statements] could be interpreted to be a comment \u2018upon [appellant\u2019s] ultimate decision not to testify,\u2019 any such error in overruling defense counsel\u2019s objections [and in denying defense counsel\u2019s motion for mistrial] was harmless in light of the nature of the statement.]\u201d We find the State\u2019s arguments more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">(B) The Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">At the outset, we begin with a brief discussion regarding the privilege against self-incrimination. The Court of Appeals has acknowledged that \u201c[c]omment upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in a criminal trial was prohibited in Maryland [long] before the United States Supreme Court\u2019s]\u201d decision in <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), which \u201cheld that the federal constitutional right against compelled self-incrimination prohibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>prosecutorial comment on the accused\u2019s silence or failure to testify.\u201d <em>Smith v. State (\u201cSmith II\u201d), </em>367 Md. 348, 353, 787 A.2d 152 (2001). <em>See also King v. State, </em>190 Md. 361, 374, 58 A.2d 663 (1948) (acknowledging that Article 22 precludes prosecutorial comment suggesting an adverse inference to be drawn from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, but concluding that no improper comment had been made in that instance); <em>Smith v. State (\u201cSmith I\u201d), </em>169 Md. 474, 476, 182 A. 287 (1936) (noting that the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks contravened defendant\u2019s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination afforded by Article 22). <em>Cf. Guy v. State, </em>90 Md. 29, 33-35, 44 A. 997 (1899); <em>Brashears v. State, </em>58 Md. 563, 567-69 (1882). Presently, a defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination is protected by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and Section 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Notwithstanding Maryland\u2019s long history, a prosecutor may summarize the evidence admitted at trial and additionally comment on its qualitative and quantitative significance. <em>See Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412-13, 326 A.2d 707 (1974). Indeed, \u201c[attorneys are [ordinarily] afforded great leeway in presenting\u201d opening statements and closing arguments to the jury. <em>See id. </em>at 410, 326 A.2d 707; <em>Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 429, 722 A.2d 887 (1999) (citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>omitted). Therefore, a prosecuting attorney may attempt to assist the jury in analyzing evidence by presenting a comprehensive picture, and is generally free to \u201ccomment legitimately and speak fully, although harshly, on the accused\u2019s actions and conduct if the evidence supports his comments[.]\u201d <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 404, 326 A.2d 707. However, a prosecutor\u2019s comments to the jury are <em>not </em>unfettered, particularly when the comments run afoul of a defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. <em>See generally Smith II, supra, </em>367 Md. 348, 787 A.2d 152 (2001). If the prosecutor\u2019s remarks are fairly and reasonably susceptible of the inference by the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s silence as indicative of his or her guilt, the commentary is improper and requires reversal unless proven harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Smith II, </em>367 Md. at 354, 356 n. 6, 787 A.2d 152 (quoting <em>Smith I, </em>169 Md. at 476, 182 A. 287).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">It matters not that the prosecutor\u2019s challenged remarks were direct or indirect. Rather, we look at the context in which the contended remarks were made. <em>See, e.g., Smith II, </em>367 Md. at 359-60, 787 A.2d 152; <em>Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 295, 681 A.2d 30 (1996); <em>King, supra, </em>190 Md. at 373-74, 58 A.2d 663; <em>Grace v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 520, 522-23, 252 A.2d 297 (1969); <em>Sizemore v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 507, 518-19, 248 A.2d 417 (1969). We objectively consider whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments outwardly conveyed or clearly evinced an intent to reference the defendant\u2019s silence. <em>See, e.g., Marshall v. State, </em>415 Md. 248, 263-64, 999 A.2d 1029 (2010) (concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s statements that the defendant \u201cdid not take the stand\u201d and that the jury did not have the benefit of the defendant\u2019s thoughts, were clearly used to highlight the defendant\u2019s silence and to use the silence as support for the State\u2019s case); <em>Smith II, </em>367 Md. at 360, 787 A.2d 152 (holding that the \u201cprosecutor went beyond the permissible comment on the absence of the evidence, and impermissibly commented directly on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify\u201d when the prosecutor argued that the defendant provided no explanation regarding his acquisition of stolen goods); <em>Woodson v. State, </em>325 Md. 251, 267, 600 A.2d 420 (1992) (observing that the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>remarks during closing were improper when he indicated that the State had kept its promise by providing the jury with evidence and that the defendant had not, demonstrating a sharp contrast that implied guilt from the defendant\u2019s silence); <em>Veney v. State, </em>251 Md. 159, 179-80, 246 A.2d 608 (1968) (concluding the prosecutor\u2019s comments merely implied that the State\u2019s propounded evidence was uncontroverted). <em>Cf. Littreal v. Redwine, </em>252 Md. 662, 667, 250 A.2d 894 (1969) (concluding that the attorney\u2019s \u201cargument cannot be said to have constituted a forbidden comment on the failure of the defendant ] to testify[,]\u201d because \u201c[h]e merely reviewed certain testimony and added, truthfully, that there was no evidence in contradiction.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Additionally, we evaluate whether the challenged remarks, viewed within the context of the entire argument, are directed more at the general weakness of the defendant\u2019s defense rather than the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>Compare Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. at 295, 681 A.2d 30, <em>and King, </em>190 Md. at 373-74, 58 A.2d 663, <em>with Marshall v. State, </em>415 Md. at 263-64, 999 A.2d 1029, <em>and Smith II, </em>367 Md. at 360, 787 A.2d 152. In that regard, we assess whether a <em>reasonable </em>juror would have interpreted the prosecutor\u2019s remarks as an invitation to draw a negative inference from the defendant\u2019s silence. <em>See, e.g., Marshall, </em>415 Md. at 264, 999 A.2d 1029. Other jurisdictions employing the fairly or reasonably susceptible of the inference test characterize the test similarly. <em>See, e.g., Rodriguez v. State, </em>753 So.2d 29, 37-39 (Fla.2000) <em>(per curiam) </em>(recognizing the distinctions between a prosecutor\u2019s impermissible comments on the defendant\u2019s silence and comments on the evidence of the case); <em>Moore v. State, </em>669 N.E.2d 733, 739 (Ind.1996) (examining the challenged statements in the context in which they were made and determining that the prosecutor\u2019s inadvertent reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify did not cause a reasonable jury to infer guilt from the defendant\u2019s silence); <em>Commonwealth v. Feroli, </em>407 Mass. 405, 553 N.E.2d 934, 937 (1990) (observing that a prosecutor is entitled to emphasize the strong points of the government\u2019s case and the weakness of the defendant\u2019s, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>if it prompts some collateral or passing reflection on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, because the \u201cchallenged remark referred principally to the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case\u201d); <em>Davis v. State, </em>685 N.E.2d 1095, 1098 (Ind.Ct.App.1997) (observing that even a prosecutor\u2019s direct comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify will not require the reversal of a conviction as long as the comment could not have reasonably been interpreted by the jury as a suggestion to infer guilt from the defendant\u2019s silence) (citing <em>Moore, supra, </em>669 N.E.2d at 739); <em>Commonwealth v. Buzzell, </em>53 Mass.App.Ct. 362, 759 N.E.2d 344, 348-51 (2002) (indicating that the reviewing court assesses the remarks in context, and observing that a comment characterizing the evidence as being uncontested or undisputed is erroneous if the only thing that could refute such an argument is an explanation from the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">It is insufficient that the language remotely might be construed as an allusion to the defendant\u2019s silence. Therefore, unless the prosecutor\u2019s comments are such that a jury would naturally and necessarily believe them to be an invitation to draw an adverse inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, the remarks are not prejudicially unfair. <em>Smith II, </em>367 Md. 348, 363-66, 787 A.2d 152 (Battaglia, J., concurring in judgment). <em>See also Commonwealth v. Grant, </em>418 Mass. 76, 634 N.E.2d 565, 570 (1994); <em>Buzzell, </em>759 N.E.2d at 349. The Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions in <em>Smith II </em>and <em>Marshall, supra, </em>illustrate this analysis, and present examples of commentary of such a nature that the juries were naturally and necessarily invited to draw an inference of guilt from the defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In <em>Smith II, </em>the defendant, Smith, was charged with the burglary and theft of leather goods from a home. 367 Md. at 351-52, 787 A.2d 152. He was tried by jury in the Circuit Court for Caroline County, presenting neither evidence nor his own testimonial explanation regarding the acquisition of the stolen property. <em>Id. </em>at 352, 787 A.2d 152. During the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor challenged the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>to consider the lack of evidence justifying Smith\u2019s possession of the stolen property, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">The Judge has said that you can look backwards in this case. Look to see who ends up with the property and then you can work backwards and here if the recent unexplained possession of stolen property allows you to work backwards to conclude, [\u201cH]ey, this guy was the thief, this guy was the burglarer.[\u201d] In making that conclusion, ask yourself this[: <em>\u201c~\\What explanation </em>has been given to us by <em>the defendant </em>for having the leather goods?[\u201d] Zero, none.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 352, 787 A.2d 152 (emphasis in original). Smith\u2019s counsel objected to the last comment, but the trial court overruled the objection. Smith was subsequently convicted of first degree burglary, conspiracy to obstruct justice, malicious destruction of property, and four counts of theft.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>He noted an appeal to this Court, and we affirmed the judgment below. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Reversing our judgment, the Court of Appeals concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were fairly and reasonably susceptible to the adverse inference of guilt because, from the reasonable juror\u2019s perspective, the prosecutor \u201ceffectively suggested that the defendant had an obligation to testify at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359, 787 A.2d 152 (citing <em>Mitchell v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 330, 119 S.Ct. 1307, 143 L.Ed.2d 424 (1999), and <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 277-78, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993)). By remarking that the defendant had failed to provide any explanation regarding the acquisition of the stolen property, the prosecutor called the jury\u2019s attention to the absence of evidence that only the defendant\u2019s testimony could supply, thereby shifting the burden of proof to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Smith and nullifying his right to the presumption of innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 359-60, 787 A.2d 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">More recently, the Court of Appeals encountered a similar issue in <em>Marshall v. State, </em>415 Md. 248, 999 A.2d 1029 (2010). There, defense counsel argued during closing that the State had failed to meet its burden of proof demonstrating that the defendant had distributed as opposed to \u201csimply\u201d purchased cocaine. <em>Id. </em>at 253, 999 A.2d 1029. To that end, the defense argued that the State failed to present any evidence definitively tying Marshall to the house in which both he and the cocaine were discovered. <em>Id. </em>In response, the prosecuting attorney rebutted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">... [w]hile the State might not have introduced evidence definitely linking ... Marshall to the home, there [was] no evidence that definitively link[ed] or unlink[ed] him to the home.[ ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 254, 999 A.2d 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Marshall\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that the State\u2019s rebuttal had shifted the burden. <em>Id. </em>at 255, 999 A.2d 1029. The prosecutor, however, continued attacking Marshall\u2019s position, arguing that Marshall\u2019s counsel had testified on his behalf. <em>Id. </em>He indicated that the defense attorney</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APk\">[ ]was testifying and drawing his own conclusions that ... Marshall was buying drugs. And ... that there [wa]s not a piece of evidence ... indicating] that ... Marshall was there purchasing drugs____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">The prosecutor continued, adding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">[ ][Defense counsel] himself said that, again testifying for ... Marshall, he said he\u2019s a cocaine addict. <em>Now, ... Marshall did not take the stand </em>so I ask you to take that with a great deal of caution when [defense counsel] tries to indicate a health problem for ... Marshall because there\u2019s no evidence of that whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">[ ]What [defense counsel] is trying to do, he is trying to create doubt in your mind. He\u2019s trying to disguise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>facts, make you ignore the facts and shroud what\u2019s right before you. The State has presented ample evidence of ... Marshall\u2019s guilt as to felony ... <em>There is no doubt in my mind to that </em>...[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">[ ]A very fair way to explain ... reasonable doubt is if you imagine you\u2019re doing a jigsaw puzzle ... But regardless at some point as you\u2019re putting together your jigsaw puzzle, without ever having seen the picture, you will know what the picture is before all the pieces are in place. You will know ... what the picture is even though you don\u2019t have all the pieces.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">[ jThere are several pieces we don\u2019t have. <em>We don\u2019t have ...

[ ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\"><em>Marshall, supra, </em>415 Md. at 255-56, 999 A.2d 1029 (additions, in part, in original) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Marshall\u2019s counsel moved for mistrial on two grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 999 A.2d 1029. First, he asserted that \u201c[tjwice during the State\u2019s closing, [the prosecutor] pointed to the fact [his] client [had not] testified.]\u201d Marshall\u2019s attorney further articulated that the remarks were fairly and reasonably susceptible of the adverse inference of defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court, however, denied Marshall\u2019s motion, finding that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were mere \u201crhetorical flourish.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 999 A.2d 1029. Marshall was found guilty of possession of cocaine and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 251, 257, 999 A.2d 1029. A panel of this Court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in an unreported opinion, concluding that while the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were a comment regarding Marshall\u2019s silence, they \u201cwere a satisfactorily tailored \u2018invited response[ ]\u2019 \u201d to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument. <em>Id. </em>at 257, 999 A.2d 1029. Thereafter, Marshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>petitioned the Court of Appeals for a writ of certiorari, which the Court granted. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Marshall v. State, </em>404 Md. 658, 948 A.2d 70 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Upon the Court\u2019s contextual review of the record, it concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks infringed upon Marshall\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, guaranteed by Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and Section 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Reasoning that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were manifestly intended to reference the defendant\u2019s silence, the Court specifically observed that the prosecutor\u2019s statements to the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201cMr. Marshall did not take the stand\u201d and \u201c[w]e don\u2019t have Mr. Marshall\u2019s thoughts\u201d were used to highlight the fact that the defendant did not testify in an effort to rebut the State\u2019s evidence. [Therefore, t]he prosecuting attorney clearly was using the defendant\u2019s silence as support for the State\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 263-64, 999 A.2d 1029. Consequently, the Court deduced that the direct reference to Marshall\u2019s silence naturally and necessarily invited the jury to draw an adverse inference of guilt. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper and constituted reversible error due to the scant evidence directly linking Marshall to the house in which both he and the cocaine had been discovered. <em>Id. </em>at 264, 999 A.2d 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Thereafter, the Court rejected the State\u2019s argument that the prosecutor\u2019s comments, italicized <em>supra, </em>fell within a narrow exception of fair responses to impermissible claims of the defense, as recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 32-34, 108 S.Ct. 864, 99 L.Ed.2d 23 (1988).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See also Rodriguez, supra, </em>753 So.2d at 39; <em>Dufour </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>v. State, </em>495 So.2d 154, 160-61 (Fla.1986). Rather, the Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not a permissibly invited response because Marshall\u2019s counsel had not presented any improper argument in his closing. <em>Id. </em>at 257, 267-68, 999 A.2d 1029. Consequently, the Court of Appeals reversed Marshall\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 999 A.2d 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The facts in <em>Smith II </em>and <em>Marshall </em>are inapposite to the case at bar. Unlike the present case, in which we are confronted with the propriety of prosecutorial remarks during opening statement, <em>Smith II </em>and <em>Marshall </em>pertain to remarks made during closing arguments. <em>See Marshall, </em>415 Md. at 255-56, 999 A.2d 1029; <em>Smith II, </em>367 Md. at 352, 787 A.2d 152. <em>See also Oken, supra, </em>343 Md. at 292-93, 681 A.2d 30; <em>Woodson, supra, </em>325 Md. at 265-66, 600 A.2d 420; <em>Veney, supra, </em>251 Md. at 178, 246 A.2d 608; <em>Smith I, supra, </em>169 Md. at 476, 182 A. 287; <em>Davis v.

Although there is sufficient similarity between allegations regarding the impropriety of prosecutorial remarks at the beginning and at the close of trial to permit the application of common principles generally, \u201copening statements in a jury trial cannot be equated to closing arguments made to the jury[.]\u201d <em>Wilhelm, supra, </em>272 Md. at 411, 326 A.2d 707. The law is not to be applied in the abstract, but must be considered in light of the facts within each individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>case. <em>Compare Oken, </em>343 Md. at 295, 681 A.2d 30, <em>and King, </em>190 Md. at 373-74, 58 A.2d 663, <em>with Marshall, </em>415 Md. at 263-64, 999 A.2d 1029, <em>and Smith II, </em>367 Md. at 360, 787 A.2d 152. As observed, <em>supra, </em>the context of the challenged remarks are essential. Because the case <em>sub judice </em>presents a matter of first impression, we turn our attention to sister jurisdictions that have addressed the propriety of prosecutorial remarks made during <em>voir dire </em>or opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">We begin our review with the Supreme Court of Nebraska\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Pierce, </em>231 Neb. 966, 439 N.W.2d 435 (1989). There, the prosecutor iterated during his opening statement that the defendant, Pierce, would \u201ctestify but we do not know which version of the facts to which he will testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439 (emphasis added). Defense counsel immediately requested a mistrial, contending that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks violated Pierce\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>The trial court denied counsel\u2019s motion and provided no curative instruction. Pierce was convicted later of criminal mischief. <em>Id. </em>at 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The Supreme Court of Nebraska reversed, concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement compelled Pierce to testify and, therefore, violated of his privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 445. The court preliminarily observed that \u201ca prosecutor\u2019s comment concerning the necessity of [a] defendant\u2019s testimony or an expression concerning the plausibility or credibility of anticipated testimony from a defendant violates an accused\u2019s right to remain silent,\u201d because the remarks implicitly shifted the burden upon the defendant to prove his or her innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 443-44. It further reasoned that the manifestly intended effect of such remarks was either to coerce Pierce to testify or to induce him to remain silent, \u201cwith the knowledge that the jury had been challenged in the outset to observe whether or not he would go upon the stand, under the goad of the prosecutor\u2019s statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444 (quoting <em>Coleman v. State, </em>111 Ind. 563, 13 N.E. 100, 101 (1887)). Thus, the court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">[t]he prosecutor\u2019s remark immediately made Pierce\u2019s credibility an issue in the case before introduction of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>evidence. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s remark presented a dilemma: Pierce could remain silent and thereby give credence to, or even substantiate, the invidious innuendo that he had previously given inconsistent versions of the incident on which the criminal charge was based, or Pierce could take the witness stand and recount a version without any inconsistency, thereby responding to the prosecutor\u2019s intimation of inconsistency but subjecting himself to cross-examination. If Pierce failed to take the stand, the jury might conclude that his silence buttressed the prosecutor\u2019s remark about Pierce\u2019s multiple versions of the incident, that is, Pierce did not have a consistent credible account of the incident and remained silent to avoid entanglement in a web of inconsistency as an indication of guilt. On the other hand, if Pierce did take the stand, but failed to provide an absolutely consistent account of the incident, the jury might indulge in the belief that Pierce\u2019s guilt or innocence turned on consistency in Pierce\u2019s testimony rather than the State\u2019s meeting its burden to prove Pierce\u2019s guilty by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 444-45. Accordingly, the court determined that the expression of uncertainty regarding \u201cwhich version of the facts to which [Pierce] w[ould] testify,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 439, \u201cinformed the jury that Pierce had expressed more than one version or account of the incident in question[,]\u201d and insinuated that Pierce, at one point, admitted his criminality in the charged offense. <em>Id. </em>at 445. This implication, the court believed, was of such a nature that it naturally and necessarily invited the jury to believe that an adverse inference was to be drawn from Pierce\u2019s silence. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court set aside Pierce\u2019s conviction for criminal mischief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Nine years later, the Mississippi Court of Appeals addressed the propriety of a prosecutor\u2019s opening statements in <em>Leflore v. State, </em>where the prosecutor began his opening statement by outlining for the jury the witnesses he intended to call. 726 So.2d 261, 262 (Miss.Ct.App.1998). Thereafter, however, he remarked that it would likely be a short case because defense counsel likely would call only the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Leflore, to testify on her own behalf. <em>Id. </em>Leflore\u2019s attorney objected to the prosecutor\u2019s comment, arguing that such a comment violated her privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>At the trial court\u2019s behest, the prosecutor explained to the jury that he only assumed that Leflore was going to testify, that she was under no obligation to testify, and that no inference should be drawn from her failure to testify. <em>Id. </em>The court reiterated the prosecutor\u2019s advisory comments, further instructing the jury that Leflore\u2019s silence could not be considered during deliberation. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, the jury ultimately found Leflore guilty, and she subsequently sought reversal of her conviction for felony shoplifting before the intermediate appellate court. <em>Id. </em>at 262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Before the court, she argued that the prosecutor\u2019s opening remarks were analogous to a constitutionally impermissible comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 263. The court, however, rejected Leflore\u2019s argument and concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the court noted a definite distinction between Leflore\u2019s characterization of the challenged statement and what the prosecutor actually said. <em>Id. </em>It concluded that \u201cthe prosecutor was not commenting on Leflore\u2019s failure to testify but on the likelihood that she would.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court distinguished the facts presented in Leflore\u2019s case from those presented in <em>Pierce, supra, </em>and held that prosecutor\u2019s remarks had neither placed Leflore\u2019s credibility at issue before the presentation of any evidence nor compelled her to testify. <em>Id. </em>In addition, the intermediate appellate court observed that even if the prosecutor\u2019s comments had prejudiced Leflore, the trial court had provided instruction on her right to the presumption of innocence, the State\u2019s burden in proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the prohibition against drawing any inference from her silence, thereby nullifying any remote possibility of harm. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not fairly and reasonably susceptible to the inference by the jury to adversely consider Leflore\u2019s silence as indicative of her guilt. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In 2000, the Court of Appeals of Virginia considered the propriety of remarks rendered during a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jury venirepersons in <em>Hazel v.

This burden never shifts to a defendant because the law never imposes upon a defendant in a criminal case the burden of calling any witnesses or producing any evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\"><em>Id. </em>The jury subsequently found Pawlowski guilty of attempted enticement of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) (2006).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Pawlowski noted an appeal to the Third Circuit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>presenting three arguments to the intermediate appellate court.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 207.

After examining the challenged remark, the court determined that the prosecutor\u2019s brief and isolated remark was neither unduly prejudicial nor plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 210. The court observed that \u201c[t]he District Court repeatedly explained to the jury that the government bore the burden of proof and that Pawlowski had an absolute constitutional right not to testify or present evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>More importantly, the court additionally reasoned that defense counsel\u2019s direct response to the government\u2019s opening remarks within his opening statement cured <em>any </em>potential misimpression the jury may have developed. <em>Id. </em>at 210-11. Therefore, it concluded that the comments during opening statements were not fairly and reasonably susceptible of the inference by the jury to adversely consider Pawlowski\u2019s silence as illustrative of his guilt. <em>See id. </em>at 210-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>(C) Did The Prosecutor\u2019s Remarks Invite An Adverse Consideration Of Defendant\u2019s Silence As Demonstrative of Guilt?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">From these cases noted <em>supra, </em>we glean one essential question that must be addressed in determining whether the challenged remarks made during the State\u2019s opening invited the jury to adversely consider a criminal defendant\u2019s silence as demonstrative of guilt: \u201cWhether the remarks challenged the defendant to testify or to face the possible negative implications from remaining silent.\u201d <em>See P\u00e9rez, </em>968 A.2d at 80; <em>Hazel, </em>524 S.E.2d at 139; <em>Leflore, </em>726 So.2d at 263; <em>Pierce, </em>439 N.W.2d at 443-44. <em>See also Lindsey, </em>578 S.W.2d at 904; <em>Clark v. State, </em>256 Ark. 658, 509 S.W.2d 812, 815 (1974). <em>Cf. State v. Morgan, </em>144 Idaho 861, 172 P.3d 1136, 1137, 1139 (Idaho Ct.App.2007). Because this analysis requires an evaluation of the specific context in which the statements were made, we shall consider and balance the following: (1) whether the manifestly intended effect of the comments was to coerce the defendant to testify at trial or induce him or her to remain silent with knowledge that the jury was invited to consider the defendant\u2019s silence or testimony, thereby placing the defendant in a Hobson\u2019s choice; (2) whether the challenged remarks shifted the burden upon the defendant to prove his or her innocence; and (3) whether the comment was merely a remark on the strength of the State\u2019s case. If a balancing of these considerations leads to the conclusion that the challenged statements invited the jury to consider a defendant\u2019s silence as demonstrative of guilt, the reviewing court should determine whether the remarks were unduly prejudicial and harmful by considering: (1) whether the remarks were isolated and present only in the opening; (2) whether the defendant sought curative instruction; (3) whether the defense responded directly to the prosecutor\u2019s comments, clarifying for the jury that defendant had no burden of proof, was entitled to presumption of innocence until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and maintained a fundamental privilege against self-incrimination; and (4) whether the trial court adequately provided clear instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>regarding the defendant\u2019s right to the presumption of innocence and the defendant\u2019s right to silence. <em>See Pawlowski, </em>682 F.3d at 210-11; <em>P\u00e9rez, </em>968 A.2d at 80; <em>Hazel, </em>524 S.E.2d at 136; <em>Leflore, </em>726 So.2d at 262. <em>Cf. Pierce, </em>439 N.W.2d at 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Our evaluation of the record and consideration of the above-referenced inquiry leads to our conclusion that the statements in the case <em>sub judice </em>were not fairly and reasonably susceptible of the inference by the jury to adversely consider appellant\u2019s silence as demonstrative of his guilt. To be sure, her statements were problematic, but the prosecutor was not commenting on appellant\u2019s failure to testify nor challenging him to testify or to face the possible negative implications from his silence. The prosecutor stated that she would bring in witnesses \u201cto corroborate everything that the Defendant has said,\u201d suggesting that the evidence in the form of appellant\u2019s \u201cown words\u201d had already been memorialized before trial. There was no explicit reference to the necessity of appellant\u2019s testimony or any statement that could be seen as questioning the validity of any anticipated testimony. <em>Contra Pierce, </em>439 N.W.2d at 439 (concluding it was improper for the prosecutor to argue that defendant \u201cwill testify but we don\u2019t know which version of the facts to which he will testify\u201d); <em>State v. Turner, </em>433 A.2d 397, 400 (Me.1981) (noting that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury to consider the deficiencies in the defendant\u2019s case that would remain unaddressed if the defendant failed to testify where the prosecutor argued \u201c[t]he defendant will surely try to raise doubts in your mind as to who was driving when it struck [the victim]\u201d); <em>Clark, </em>509 S.W.2d at 813 (concluding that it was improper for a prosecutor in a murder case to argue, \u201cIf you notice, I\u2019m here by myself, and this vacant chair. He might be here to tell his side[,] but he\u2019s not here. The story then that you will have about what happened out there will come from [the defendant].... \u201d). Rather, she merely inartfully summarized the evidence the State intended to offer at trial and commented on its qualitative and quantitative significance. <em>Wilhelm, supra, </em>272 Md. at 412-43, 326 A.2d 707. <em>See, e.g., Oken </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>v.

Thus, while the remarks may have been ill-conceived, we find no violation of appellant\u2019s right against self-incrimination as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and Section 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks came close to a comment on defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, subsequent to the State\u2019s opening statement, appellant\u2019s counsel removed any possibility that the comments would be misinterpreted by the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">...

[t]hey [we]re intended only to help [the jury] understand the evidence and apply the law.\u201d The jury is presumed to follow these instructions. <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 423-24, 326 A.2d 707. \u201c[I]t does not seem at all remarkable to assume that the jury will ordinarily be able to limit its consideration to the evidence introduced at trial.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>394 U.S. at 736, 89 S.Ct. 1420. Indeed, \u201c \u2018it is hard for us to imagine that the minds of the jurors would be so influenced by such incidental statements during this long trial that they would not appraise the evidence objectively and dispassionately.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v.

The fact that the [appellant] did not testify must not be held against the [appellant]. It must not be considered by you in any way or even discussed by you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Yet even after the court\u2019s cautionary instruction, it was <em>appellant\u2019s </em>counsel who returned to an attack of the State\u2019s opening remarks, reaffirming that the prosecutor\u2019s comments related <em>specifically to appellant\u2019s post-arrest confession. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the court committed no error in its refusal to grant appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">(D) The Testimony of Officer Robert Kaleda.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">As its final witness, the State called Officer Robert Kaleda (\u201cInvestigator Kaleda\u201d), a fireman \u201cwith collateral duties as an accelerant canine detection handler\u201d with the Office of the Fire Marshal. The State began its examination by discussing the training of Investigator Kaleda and his canine partner, Joy, in the following dialogue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">[THE STATE]: Okay. And have you and Joy received any training in the identification and detection of accelerants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqs\">[INVESTIGATOR KALEDA]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">[THE STATE]: All right. And please describe that training for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">[INVESTIGATOR KALEDA]: The initial training is in Front Royal, Virginia, at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Canine Academy. It\u2019s a six-week long program. And the dogs are trained with repetitive scents, and they\u2019re rewarded, and that\u2019s their training process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">[THE STATE]: Describe what kind\u2014when you said that they\u2019re repetitive scents, describe what the\u2014well, would you describe that training that you would go through?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>[INVESTIGATOR KALEDA]: Okay. The initial training is pretty much cans, similar to these, and there is substances put in the cans. Some have odor on them and some do not. And when I say \u201codor,\u201d of hydrocarbon-based fuel. The dog repetitively goes over them hundreds of times a day to distinguish between the products and the products with fuel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdQ\">[THE STATE]: And about how many hours of training have you received with regards [sic] to identification and detection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">[INVESTIGATOR KALEDA]: Initially?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">[THE STATE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">[INVESTIGATOR KALEDA]: From the\u2014initially, in the five, six weeks? Or from that, then on? Do you mean cumulative?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">[THE STATE]: Well, why don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about your education and training as a fire investigator at the department!?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">[INVESTIGATOR KALEDA]: Okay. I\u2019m a nationally certified fire investigator with the national qualification board. I\u2019ve been assigned there since 1998. I\u2019ve probably investigated well over 100 fires. Joy and I have probably done\u2014 investigated, well over 100 scenes, all throughout the [S]tate of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">[THE STATE]: And with regards [sic] to your training, and I guess, being a canine handler, what is that like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">Can you describe that, what training that you had to undergo to have a canine partner such as Joy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyZ\">[INVESTIGATOR KALEDA]: The training is\u2014like I said, it\u2019s in Front Royal, at the Canine Academy. It\u2019s really\u2014the dogs are\u2014-when we receive the dogs, they are already imprinted, which is the process of where they are trained to the odors. They know that before we get there. They, indeed, have\u2014and the ATF training staff does that for about 8 weeks, I believe, before we get there. So our six-week program is just pretty much acclimating, and being able to learn how to distinguish what the dog is doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>[THE STATE]: Okay. And that\u2019s the training that you received?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">[INVESTIGATOR KALEDA]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Subsequent to this line of inquiry, the State questioned Investigator Kaleda about his ability to interpret Joy\u2019s actions and the two\u2019s communicative ability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">[THE STATE]: Okay. And how is it that you know\u2014well, describe for the jury what, exactly, Joy does when you are\u2014when you two go out to investigate fires?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">[OFFICER KALEDA]: Joy is a\u2014she\u2019s a good, good dog. She\u2014I give her a command to seek when we go to work, and she\u2014obviously, she sniffs, and when she does that, she\u2014her behavior will change when she gets in the area of an odor, and she will sniff more rapidly, she\u2019ll move around a little more quickly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">When she finds the highest concentration of odor, she will sit and she\u2019ll put her nose on it, and then she\u2019ll be fed. I will ask her to show me the location and she\u2019ll put her nose on the highest concentration of odor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Thereafter, the State proceeded to question Officer Kaleda regarding the canine scan that he and Joy performed at appellant\u2019s home. Officer Kaleda recounted the process by which he and Joy began conducting an exterior search of appellant\u2019s vehicle and Joy\u2019s subsequent alert to accelerants. This prompted an objection by appellant\u2019s counsel, and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">[INVESTIGATOR KALEDA]: Yes, ma\u2019am. I started at the left front fender, and went around the vehicle 360 degrees, pointing to locations that I wanted her to search, and she had two positive alerts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">[THE STATE]: Where were those positive alerts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Object, Your Honor. May we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\">THE COURT: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">(Counsel approached the bench and the following ensued)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, first, I know that we had a discussion before, but I want to renew my objection to this witness testifying as an expert witness effectively without having been properly qualified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">I think under <em>[State v.]Blackwell[, </em>408 Md. 677, 971 A.2d 296 (2009) ] the court made it clear, that if anyone is going to testify based upon special training and experience, that you have to qualify them as an expert. Otherwise, they are limited to the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">This witness, we were never notified that this witness was an expert. I have a notice of expert witnesses, and that\u2019s William Murray, Brandon Goff, and Andrew Hawkins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">Your Honor, we object on the grounds that he was never disclosed as an expert witness, he has never been qualified; and[,] therefore, he should not be permitted to give testimony now as an expert witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">THE COURT: Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor. Except that, if you overrule the objection\u2014and it seems like you\u2019re about to do that\u2014then I would ask to have a standing objection, so I don\u2019t have to keep\u2014and that\u2019s for any testimony that he gives regarding alerts or his conclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYB\">The circuit court overruled appellant\u2019s objection, but granted him a standing objection to Investigator Kaleda\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred when it overruled his objection to testimony by Investigator Kaleda regarding his observations of a canine that had been trained to detect the presence of fire accelerants. Specifically, he asserts that because Investigator Kaleda was neither identified as an expert witness prior to trial nor accepted as an expert at trial pursuant to Maryland Rules 4-268 and 5-702, that his testimony regarding his canine partner\u2019s alerts should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Responding to appellant\u2019s contentions, the State argues that \u201c[bjecause Officer Kaleda\u2019s testimony[,] as to his observations of [the canine,] was neither opinion testimony nor expert testimony, [appellant\u2019s] claims must be rejected.\u201d Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>the State avers that \u201c[e]ven if this Court determines that Officer Kaleda\u2019s testimony constituted not only opinion testimony, but also expert testimony under Rule 5-702, [appellant\u2019s] conviction should nonetheless be affirmed because any error in its admission was harmless in nature.\u201d Although we conclude that it was error to admit Officer Kaleda\u2019s testimony, its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Ragland v. State </em>makes clear that Maryland \u201cRules 5-701<footnotemark>[29]</footnotemark> and 5-702<footnotemark>[30]</footnotemark> prohibit the admission as \u2018lay opinion\u2019 of testimony based upon specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training or education.\u201d 385 Md. 706, 725, 870 A.2d 609 (2005), <em>quoted in State v. Blackwell, </em>408 Md. 677, 690, 971 A.2d 296 (2009). <em>Accord Payne v. State, </em>211 Md.App. 220, 240, 65 A.3d 154 (2013); <em>Coleman-Fuller v.

Therefore, it is error for the circuit court to admit lay opinion testimony based upon specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education when the State has failed to classify it as expert testimony and to provide the defense \u201c[r]eports or statements of experts[,]\u201d and \u201cthe expert\u2019s name and address, the subject matter of the consultation, the substance of the expert\u2019s findings and opinions, and a summary of the grounds for each opinion\u201d without any necessity of the defendant\u2019s request. Md. Rule 4-263(d)(8)(A). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Ragland, </em>385 Md. at 716, 870 A.2d 609. \u201cThe purpose of th[ese] Rule[s] [are] to assist the defendant in preparing his or her defense and to protect the defendant from surprise.\u201d <em>Ragland, </em>385 Md. at 717, 870 A.2d 609. <em>See also Hutchins v. State, </em>339 Md. 466, 473, 663 A.2d 1281 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The question we must resolve is whether Officer Kaleda\u2019s testimony at trial regarding his observations of a canine that had been trained to detect the presence of fire accelerants is expert testimony within the meaning of Maryland Rule 5-702. As a consequence, we turn our attention to the prior decisions of Maryland\u2019s courts that have evaluated the distinctions between lay and expert testimony <em>infra. </em>We begin by reviewing the Court of Appeals\u2019 watershed opinion in <em>Ragland v. State, </em>385 Md. 706, 870 A.2d 609 (2005) (overruling of the Court\u2019s prior holding in <em>Robinson v. State, </em>348 Md. 104, 702 A.2d 741 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In <em>Ragland v. State, </em>the Court of Appeals was asked to consider whether it was error to admit the lay opinion testimony of two police officers who had concluded that a particular series of events had constituted a drug transaction based on their training and experience. 385 Md. at 709, 870 A.2d 609. There, the two officers had witnessed an alleged drug transaction involving the defendant, Ragland, although neither had recovered any contraband from him. <em>Id. </em>at 709-10, 870 A.2d 609. At Ragland\u2019s trial, the first officer testified that he received training in the investigation of drug crimes through several drug recognition courses and seminars. <em>Id. </em>at 711-12, 870 A.2d 609. It was upon this experience that the first officer testified that Ragland had been involved in a drug transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 712, 870 A.2d 609. The second officer additionally testified that, based on his prior training and experience, Ragland was involved in a drug transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 714, 870 A.2d 609. Ragland\u2019s counsel interposed several objections to each of the officers\u2019 testimonies, arguing that the officers had testified as experts without the defense receiving notice that the officers would be offering expert testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 712-13, 870 A.2d 609. The circuit court overruled the objections of defense counsel, perceiving that the officers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>testimonies constituted lay opinions. <em>Id. </em>at 712, 870 A.2d 609<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Ragland was ultimately convicted of distribution of a controlled dangerous substance.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thereafter, he noted a timely appeal to this Court. <em>Id. </em>at 715, 870 A.2d 609. Before we could consider the case, however, the Court of Appeals issued a writ of <em>certiorari </em>on its own initiative. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Ragland v. State, </em>882 Md. 688, 856 A.2d 724 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The Court considered whether the officers\u2019 testimonies constituted lay opinion testimony under Md. Rule 5-701 or expert testimony under Md. Rule 5-702. <em>Ragland, </em>385 Md. at 717-19, 870 A.2d 609. The Court recognized that the bisection between lay and expert opinion testimony is imperfect \u201cbecause at least one class of opinions potentially falls within both categories.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 870 A.2d 609. The Court noted that, in some instances, \u201c[a] witness who has personally observed a given event may nonetheless have developed opinions about it that are based on that witness\u2019s specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, it held that \u201cMd. Rules 5-701 and 5-702 prohibit the admission as \u2018lay opinion\u2019 of testimony based upon specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training or education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725, 870 A.2d 609. In so holding, the Court recognized that \u201cby permitting testimony based on specialized knowledge, education, or skill under ... Md. Rule 5-701 [the rule governing lay opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>testimony<footnotemark>33</footnotemark>], parties may avoid the notice and discovery requirements of [the Maryland Rules] and blur the distinction between\u201d the rules governing expert and lay opinion testimony. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court deduced that the circuit court\u2019s admission of the officers\u2019 testimonies without satisfying of Md. Rules 5-702 and 4-263(d)(8)(A) was an abuse of discretion because the officers\u2019 testimonies were based on their specialized knowledge, experience, and training in narcotics transactions and recovery. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 870 A.2d 609. Further, the Court concluded that the circuit court\u2019s admission of the officers\u2019 testimonies was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, because the primary witness against Ragland was the second officer and because the State had relied, in large part, on the officers\u2019 opinion testimonies to establish that the events that they had witnessed were, in fact, the drug transaction for which Ragland was charged. <em>Id. </em>at 726-27, 870 A.2d 609. Thus, the Court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the case for new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 727, 870 A.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">More recently, the Court of Appeals considered whether an officer\u2019s testimony regarding the administration and observations of a horizontal gaze nystagmus (\u201cHGN\u201d) test to a defendant convicted of, among other things, driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> in <em>State v. Blackwell, </em>408 Md. 677, 971 A.2d 296 (2009). At Blackwell\u2019s trial before the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County, the State\u2019s sole witness was Maryland State Trooper Jeffrey Linger (\u201cTrooper Linger\u201d), who stopped the vehicle Blackwell was operating on the morning we was arrested for the charged offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 681, 971 A.2d 296. Trooper Linger attested that, after stopping Blackwell, he administered two of three field sobriety tests on the defendant: the HGN and walk-and-turn tests. <em>Id. </em>at 681-82, 971 A.2d 296.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> During the State\u2019s direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>examination of Trooper Linger, defense counsel objected to the officer\u2019s description of and conclusions reached from Blackwell\u2019s performance on the HGN test, which were overruled by the court. <em>Id. </em>at 682-84, 971 A.2d 296. At the conclusion of trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 685, 971 A.2d 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Blackwell appealed his convictions to this Court. <em>Id. </em>Relying on <em>Ragland, supra, </em>a panel of this court reasoned that Trooper Linger\u2019s testimony regarding the HGB test was expert testimony \u201cbecause it was based upon the officer\u2019s specialized knowledge and training.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685-86, 971 A.2d 296. Thus, we reversed Blackwell\u2019s convictions regarding the alcohol-related offenses, concluding that \u201cthe trial court erred in admitting Trooper Linger\u2019s testimony without having him qualified as an expert [pursuant to Md. Rule 5-702].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 971 A.2d 296 (additions in <em>Blackwell, </em>408 Md. at 686, 971 A.2d 296). The State filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals, which was granted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Applying the rule of <em>Ragland, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of this Court, concluding that the officer\u2019s \u201ctestimony about Blackwell\u2019s performance on the HGN test constituted expert testimony subject to the strictures of Md. Rule 5-702.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 971 A.2d 296. In reaching its conclusion, the Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9V\">[the officer] reported, among other things, that Blackwell had \u201clack of smooth pursuit\u201d and \u201cdistinct nystagmus at maximum deviation\u201d in each eye. This testimony was not based upon [the officer\u2019s] general knowledge as a layperson but upon his specialized knowledge and training. To be sure, the HGN test is a scientific test, and a layperson would not necessarily know that \u201cdistinct nystagmus at maximum deviation\u201d is an indicator of drunkenness; nor could a lay person take that measurement with any accuracy or reliability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In addition, the Court rejected the State\u2019s assertion that Md. Rule 5-702 was \u201cinapplicable because [the officer] did not expressly provide an opinion \u2018as to Blackwell\u2019s state of intoxication,\u2019 \u201d noting that Md. Rule 5-702 provides that \u201c[e]xpert testimony may be admitted ... in the form of an opinion <em>or otherwise </em>....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 971 A.2d 296 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis in original). The Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">[w]hen an expert describes firsthand observations in court, this basis testimony is generally still a form of expert testimony. Like ordinary percipient witnesses, such experts are reporting direct sense impressions. Unlike the nonexpert witness, however, the ability to make these observations in the first place typically requires expertise. A treating physician\u2019s description of symptoms, a fingerprint examiner\u2019s testimony about similarities or differences between two prints he has examined, or an engineer\u2019s description of what he observed when examining the prior art in a patent dispute are all examples of observational testimony that requires specialized knowledge. A lay observer of the same injuries, fingerprints, or inventions would lack either the vocabulary to describe what she saw with precision or the knowledge of which observation mattered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citing DAVID H. KAYE ET AL., THE NEW WIG-MORE: EXPERT EVIDENCE, \u00a7 3.2.1 (2004)) (emphasis added). As a consequence, the Court determined that \u201c[m]uch like the doctor\u2019s description of symptoms, or the fingerprint examiner\u2019s testimony about the similarities or differences between two prints he had examined\u2014both subjects of expert evidence\u2014\u201d the officer\u2019s observational testimony was based on specialized knowledge and experience and, therefore, expert testimony, because the average juror would not have known the correlation between alcohol consumption and HGN. <em>Id. </em>at 693-94, 971 A.2d 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Subsequent to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Blackwell, </em>this Court considered whether an officer\u2019s testimony relying on the use of cellular phone records and additional cellular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>technology constitutes expert testimony and, accordingly, requires adherence of Md. Rules 4\u2014263(d)(3), 4-263(d)(8)(A), and 5-702. <em>See Payne v. State, </em>211 Md.App. 220, 231, 65 A.3d 154 (2013); <em>Coleman-Fuller v.

In these instances, we observed that the officer\u2019s testimony was based on specialized training, and therefore concluded that the officer \u201cwas required to be qualified as an expert and, as such, the State was, accordingly, also required to fulfill its discovery obligations!)]\u201d provided by the Maryland Rules. <em>Coleman-Fuller, </em>192 Md.App. at 619, 995 A.2d 985. <em>See also Wilder, </em>191 Md.App. at 368, 991 A.2d 172 (\u201cThe trial court ought not have permitted [the officer] to offer lay opinion testimony about the cell site location, and to describe the map created based on the cellular telephone records.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Nonetheless, Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have never considered whether the testimony of an officer\u2019s observations of his/her detection canine qualifies as expert testimony and, therefore, requires adherence of Md. Rules 4-263(d)(3), 4-263(d)(8)(A), and 5-702. We conclude that it does, and therefore requires adherence to the Maryland Rules. <em>Cf. Roberts v.

Admittedly, Maryland\u2019s discussion regarding the admissibility of a canine alert or canine tracking and identification of a suspect is particularly scant.

Among the State\u2019s witnesses at Terrell\u2019s trial were Officer Fred Helton (\u201cOfficer Helton\u201d), an officer of the K-9 Corps, and Terence P. Cahill (\u201cCahill\u201d), a qualified expert in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>training dogs for use by law enforcement agencies. <em>Id. </em>at 343-44, 239 A.2d 128. Both witnesses discussed, at length, their training and expertise in the area of dog handling as well as the rigorous training of the tracking canine, Rocky, that had tracked the defendant to a Plymouth automobile where he was apprehended. <em>Id. </em>at 342-44, 239 A.2d 128. Officer Helton and Cahill\u2019s testimony was admitted at trial over Terrell\u2019s objection. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 239 A.2d 128. At the close of trial, Terrell was convicted of robbery. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Before this Court, Terrell averred that his conviction for robbery required reversal because the circuit court improperly admitted evidence concerning the tracking by a dog trained to follow human scent. <em>Id. </em>In reaching our conclusion that the circuit court had committed no error in admitting the evidence of dog tracking, <em>id. </em>at 358, 239 A.2d 128, we partook in a detailed evaluation of the long-known recognition of trained dogs to follow a human\u2019s trail and noted \u201c[t]hat the ability of a dog to follow the human scent is not an inherent characteristic, but one that must be instilled into the animal through arduous training.\u201d Id. at 344, 239 A.2d 128. Thus, we concluded that testimony about the tracking of a fugitive may be admitted so long as a proper foundation regarding the qualifications of both the dog and the handler must be laid. Id. at 349, 353, 239 A.2d 128. Specifically, we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_r0\">[bjefore any evidence pertaining to the results of the dog\u2019s tracking [may be] admitted, the handler of the dog must testify as to his own qualifications and experience and that of the dog, along with an account of the dog\u2019s ability to track.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Id. at 349, 239 A.2d 128. We noted that upon a proper foundation, \u201cthe evidence may be used to identify the accused as the perpetrator or for some other reason, as long as this evidence is corroborated.\u201d Id. at 353, 239 A.2d 128. We observed, however, that in laying the evidentiary foundation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u201cit is not the dog but the handler who reports the dog\u2019s behavior, training, and ability,\u201d because its is the \u201ctrainer [who] stays with the dogs [and, therefore,] testifies as to his own observations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 355-56, 239 A.2d 128. As a consequence, we concluded that because the handler and trainer are the responsible parties controlling the dog and able to interpret the dog\u2019s actions, it is the trainer or handler who should be examined. <em>Id. </em>at 355, 239 A.2d 128. <em>See also Roberts v. State, </em>298 Md. 261, 269, 469 A.2d 442 (1983) (observing prior to the admission of a so-called \u201cdog lineup,\u201d the circuit judge initially concluded that the tracking canine, \u201cSniffer,\u201d had demonstrated reliability in tracking and that his handler was qualified to interpret the dog\u2019s actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Because the ability of a dog to alert to accelerants or other contraband \u201cis not an inherent characteristic, but one that must be instilled into the animal through arduous training,\u201d C<em>f. Terrell, </em>3 Md.App. at 344, 239 A.2d 128, and because the canine\u2019s handler must be qualified to interpret the dog\u2019s actions signifying an alert, <em>see id. </em>at 355, 239 A.2d 128, we conclude the testimony of an officer\u2019s observations of his or her detection canine qualifies as expert testimony and, therefore, requires adherence of Md. Rules 4-263(d)(3), 4-263(d)(8)(A), and 5-702. <em>See State v. Buller, </em>517 N.W.2d 711, 713 (Iowa 1994) (concluding that \u201c[ejvidence of the reaction at fire scene of a dog trained in accelerant detection is a type of specialized information that will assist a trier of fact.\u201d). Therefore, it was error to admit Officer Kaleda\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">However, we perceive this as harmless error rather than grounds for reversal of appellant\u2019s convictions. \u201cA defendant in a criminal case is entitled to a fair trial, but not necessarily a perfect one.\u201d <em>Gutierrez v. State, </em>423 Md. 476, 499, 32 A.3d 2 (2011) (concluding that, notwithstanding the circuit court\u2019s erroneous admission of expert testimony in contravention of Md. Rule 5-702 and 4-263(d)(8)(A), the error was harmless predicated on a comprehensive review of the record therein) (citing <em>Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 36, 553 A.2d 233 (1989)). We are mindful that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>when an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap3\"><em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) (footnote omitted), <em>quoted in Gutierrez, </em>423 Md. at 500, 32 A.3d 2. <em>See also Blackwell, </em>408 Md. at 697-98, 971 A.2d 296. \u201cLooking to the other evidence on the record, we are confident that the statement would not have persuaded the jury to render a guilty verdict when it would not have otherwise done so.\u201d <em>Gutierrez, </em>423 Md. at 500, 32 A.3d 2. As noted in Parts I and 11(A), <em>supra, </em>appellant signed a detailed confession in which he admitted to committing the crime at issue a mere few hours after the incident\u2019s occurrence. The confession provided both details regarding how he committed the criminal conduct but also his motive for committing it. In addition, the confession provided, with particularity, the style of shoe appellant was wearing during the incident of May 16, 2010. Appellant\u2019s description of the shoes he wore matched a pair of black and gray Nike athletic shoes located in appellant\u2019s closet. Further, diagnostics performed on both shoes confirmed the presence of ignitable liquids. <em>See </em>Part I n. 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Indeed, even appellant\u2019s counsel noted during his opening statement, there was ample corroborative evidence to support appellant\u2019s connection to the charged crime resulting in a guilty verdict. Appellant\u2019s attempt to burn Ms. Byers\u2019 vehicle was recorded on video. Further, Mr. Byers, Ms. Byers, and Jasmine Byers were all conclusively able to identify appellant by his posture and distinctive strut and had observed him on the surveillance video. More importantly, however, appellant\u2019s post-arrest statement accurately reflected the event depicted in the video recording and as described by the Byers at trial. Moreover, admission of Officer Kaleda\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>did not run counter to the purpose of the rule in <em>Ragland: </em>\u201cto assist the defendant in preparing his or her defense and to protect the defendant from surprise.\u201d 385 Md. at 717, 870 A.2d 609. Indeed, appellant acknowledged during his opening that \u201call of thef] witnesses have testified before\u201d and were previously subject to cross-examination. Thus, appellant could hardly argue that the admission of Officer Kaleda\u2019s testimony was unduly prejudicial. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY IS AFFIRMED.
