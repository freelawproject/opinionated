They filed a claim under their homeowners insurance policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) with State Farm Fire and Casualty Insurance (\u201cState Farm\u201d), the appellee. State Farm denied the claim on the ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>carport was not a \u201cbuilding\u201d and that the Policy only covered losses due to collapse of buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The Taylors filed a complaint with the Maryland Insurance Administration (\u201cthe MIA\u201d), alleging that State Farm had violated Md.Code (1995, 2011 Repl.Vol.) section 27-303 of the Insurance Article (\u201cIns.\u201d), prohibiting unfair claim settlement practices, by \u201crefusing] to pay [their] claim for an arbitrary or capricious reason based on all available information\u201d or \u201cfailing] to act in good faith\u201d in settling their claim. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 27-303(2) and (9), respectively. The People\u2019s Insurance Counsel Division (\u201cPICD\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the appellant, intervened on behalf of the Taylors. Following a hearing before the Associate Deputy Commissioner of the MIA, the Insurance Commissioner (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) issued a final decision ruling that State Farm had not violated Ins. section 27-303. PICD filed a petition for judicial review of that decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The circuit court affirmed the final decision of the MIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">PICD presents one question for review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">Was the MIA\u2019s decision finding that State Farm did not violate the Insurance Article when it denied the Taylors\u2019 claim legally correct and supported by substantial evidence in the record?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">For the reasons to follow, we answer that question in the affirmative and shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">\n<em>A. The Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">We begin by setting forth the relevant Policy provisions. \u201cSECTION I\u2014COVERAGES\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>COVERAGE A\u2014DWELLING</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">1. Dwelling. We cover the dwelling used principally as a private residence on the residence premises shown in the Declarations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">Dwelling includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">a. structures attached to the dwelling!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">2. Dwelling Extension. We cover other structures on the residence premises, separated from the dwelling by clear space....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">\u201cSECTION I\u2014LOSSES INSURED\u201d states that the Policy covers \u201caccidental direct physical loss to <em>the property described in Coverage A </em>except as provided in SECTION I\u2014 LOSSES NOT INSURED.\u201d (Emphasis added.) That section provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">1. We do not insure for any loss to <em>the property described in Coverage A </em>which consists of, or is directly and immediately caused by, one or more of the perils listed in items a. through o. below, regardless of whether the loss occurs suddenly or gradually, involves isolated or widespread damage, arises from natural or external forces, or occurs as a result of any combination of these:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXQ\"><em>a. collapse, except as specifically provided in SECTION I\u2014ADDITIONAL COVERAGES, </em>Collapse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">(Italicized and bolded emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">\u201cSECTION I\u2014ADDITIONAL COVERAGES\u201d includes twelve numbered subsections. Subsection 11 governs \u201cCollapse,\u201d providing, as relevant, \u201cWe insure only for direct physical loss to covered property involving the sudden, entire collapse <em>of a building or any part of a </em>building,\u201d including collapse caused by \u201cweight of ice, snow, sleet, or rain which collects on a roof.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Subsection 11 specifically excludes from coverage losses to an \u201cawning, fence, patio, pavement, swimming pool, underground pipe, flue, drain, cesspool, septic tank, foundation, retaining wall, bulkhead, pier, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>wharf or dock\u201d unless such a loss was directly caused by the \u201ccollapse of the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The \u201cDEFINITIONS\u201d section of the Policy does not define \u201cbuilding\u201d or \u201cstructure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\n<em>B. The Taylors\u2019 Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Ms. Taylor owns the West River house, which is located at 1025 Dunnington Place (\u201cthe Property\u201d). She and her husband reside there. In 2007, the Taylors decided to erect a detached carport on the Property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After choosing the design for the carport, Ms. Taylor called Angela Yancey, her State Farm insurance agent, to ask whether a carport would be \u201ccovered\u201d under the Policy. Ms. Yancey replied that it would be \u201ccovered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The 20-foot by 24-foot carport was constructed on an existing asphalt pad next to the house. It had a metal, pitched roof with gable ends. It did not have any walls. The roof was supported by ten metal poles, five on each side, secured to a steel track that, in turn, was secured to the asphalt pad. The carport was not attached to the Taylors\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">On February 10, 2010, a blizzard hit Maryland. The carport collapsed under the weight of more than a foot of snow and ice. It landed on the Taylors\u2019 two cars, a snow blower, and a power washer.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">The next day, the Taylors called Ms. Yancey to report the collapse of the carport, other damage to their house caused by the storm, and the damage to their vehicles and other personal property. Ms. Yancey forwarded the Taylors\u2019 claim to the claims division of State Farm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The Taylors asked Ms. Yancey whether they could arrange for the carport to be removed from the Property so they could gain access to their cars. Ms. Yancey advised them to take pictures of the damage before taking any steps to remove the carport. The Taylors did so and then had the carport removed. On February 24, 2010, Ms. Yancey issued a check to the Taylors for $1,250, to cover the cost of removing the carport. The check was issued from Ms. Yancey\u2019s discretionary funds and did not include a reservation of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Because of the widespread damage caused by the blizzard, State Farm\u2019s Catastrophe Services Division in Alabama assembled a catastrophe team to adjust the claims. Field representatives dispatched to the affected areas were verbally instructed by their on-site team managers that under the standard policy language losses due to collapse only were covered for buildings <em>and </em>that a building is a structure with a roof and at least three walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On March 2, 2010, Jeanie Havens, a member of the catastrophe team, traveled to the Property to adjust the Taylors\u2019 claim. The carport already had been removed, so Mr. Taylor showed Ms. Havens pictures of the collapsed carport. Ms. Havens took one picture with her. She informed Mr. Taylor that the loss to the carport and the personal property inside of it would not be covered because the carport was not a \u201cbuilding.\u201d Mr. Taylor told Ms. Havens to get off the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In a letter dated that same day, Ms. Havens formally advised the Taylors that their claim had been denied. She explained that, based on her inspection and discussion with Mr. Taylor, the \u201cdamage to [the] carport and contents located beneath it was caused by collapse\u201d and that \u201c[d]amage resulting from this cause of loss is not covered by [the Policy].\u201d The letter went on to quote the pertinent Policy provisions, including \u201cSECTION I\u2014LOSSES INSURED, COVERAGE A\u2014DWELLING\u201d; \u201cSECTION I\u2014LOSSES NOT INSURED\u201d; and \u201cSECTION I\u2014ADDITIONAL COVERAG<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ES.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Two months later, on May 12, 2010, Ms. Taylor -wrote to the MIA to request a formal investigation into the denial of the claim, pursuant to Ins. section 27-303, which prohibits insurers from engaging in unfair claim settlement practices. The MIA\u2019s Property and Casualty Division investigated the Taylors\u2019 complaint and, on November 12, 2010, determined that State Farm\u2019s action in denying the claim \u201cha[d] not been shown to be arbitrary, capricious, or lacking in good faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On December 13, 2010, the Taylors requested a hearing before the MIA on their complaint. The hearing was held on February 7, 2012, before the Associate Deputy Commissioner (\u201cADC\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the outset of the hearing, the ADC granted, over State Farm\u2019s objection, PICD\u2019s motion to intervene. Mr. and Ms. Taylor testified in their case. In addition to the above-stated facts, they also testified that wind may have been a factor in the carport\u2019s collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">PICD called an expert witness, Jeffrey Gould. Mr. Gould, a CPA and licensed public adjuster with American Claims Management Services, opined based on his experience handling thousands of homeowners insurance claims that the terms \u201cstructure\u201d and \u201cbuilding\u201d are synonymous. For this reason, he was of the view that the Taylors\u2019 claim should have been covered as a loss due to the collapse of a building. Mr. Gould also testified that in preparation for his testimony he had reviewed homeowners insurance policies of approximately ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>different insurers doing business in Maryland. One of those policies, issued by Allstate, defined the term \u201cbuilding structure\u201d to mean a \u201cbuilding with a roof and four walls.\u201d The other nine policies did not define the term \u201cbuilding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">State Farm called Ms. Havens, Ms. Yancey, and Daniel Hagan, a State Farm claims team manager, as fact witnesses, and called Stanley Lipshultz as an expert witness. Ms. Havens testified about the instructions she had been given by her on-site team manager prior to being dispatched to Maryland to adjust claims resulting from the blizzard. She explained that she had been instructed that a \u201cbuilding would be constituted as a structure that had a roof and at least three enclosed walls permanently affixed.\u201d She handled \u201call collapse claims\u201d in accordance with this instruction. She further stated that she had been given identical instructions in the past concerning the definition of a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Ms. Yancey testified that her decision to issue a check to the Taylors in February of 2010 was discretionary with her office and did not reflect a determination that the claim for the loss of the carport was covered. She also testified that she had no recollection of having a conversation with Ms. Taylor in 2007 concerning the planned construction of the carport. In any event, Ms. Yancey stated that, if she had advised Ms. Taylor that a carport would be \u201ccovered\u201d under the Policy, that would have been a correct statement because for most losses a carport is covered as a dwelling extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Mr. Hagan testified that in May 2010 he conducted a secondary review of the denial of the Taylors\u2019 claim. He concurred with Ms. Havens\u2019s decision to deny the claim for the loss to the carport, but countermanded her decision to deny the claim for the loss to the personal property located inside the carport, <em>ie., </em>the snow blower and the power washer. Mr. Hagan explained his step-by-step coverage analysis under the Policy. First, he determined that the carport was covered as a \u201cdwelling extension\u201d because it was a \u201cstructure on the ... premises separated from the dwelling by clear space.\u201d Second, he determined that a loss to a dwelling extension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>would be covered except as provided in \u201cSECTION I\u2014LOSSES NOT INSURED.\u201d Third, he determined that that section excludes a loss caused by collapse unless specifically included in the \u201cADDITIONAL COVERAGES\u201d section. Fourth, he determined that the \u201cADDITIONAL COVERAGES\u201d section states that loss due to collapse caused by certain named perils, including the weight of ice or snow, is covered, but only if the collapse is \u201cof a building or any part of a building.\u201d Mr. Hagan explained that, when a Policy term is not defined, the standard practice is to use \u201cthe layman\u2019s definition,\u201d which, in the case of the word \u201cbuilding,\u201d is \u201c[a] structure with walls and a roof.\u201d Under that definition, a \u201cpoled carport with a roof is not a building.\u201d He thus concluded that the Policy did not cover the loss of the carport due to collapse because the carport was not a \u201cbuilding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Mr. Lipshultz, a consultant and insurance instructor, opined based on his familiarity with insurance industry practices in adjusting claims that State Farm had not denied the Taylors\u2019 claim arbitrarily or capriciously or without acting in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">On March 23, 2012, the Commissioner issued a \u201cMemorandum and Final Order\u201d denying the Taylors\u2019 complaint based upon the ADC\u2019s findings of fact, which the Commissioner adopted. In the \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d section, the Commissioner credited Ms. Taylor\u2019s testimony that, before the carport was erected, she asked Ms. Yancey whether a carport would be covered under the Policy. The Commissioner further found that there was no dispute that the carport was a permanent structure, that it was not attached to the Taylors\u2019 house, and that it did not have any walls. She also found as a fact that the Taylors\u2019 loss was caused by collapse due to the weight of snow and ice, explicitly rejecting the Taylors\u2019 assertion that \u201cperhaps wind or tree branches\u201d had caused the collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The Commissioner credited Ms. Havens\u2019s testimony that she denied the Taylors\u2019 claim based solely upon the verbal instructions she and the other members of the catastrophe team had received and that these instructions were consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>with instructions she had received in the past concerning the meaning of the term \u201cbuilding.\u201d The Commissioner found Mr. Hagan\u2019s testimony about \u201cthe process by which he determined that the collapse of the carport due to the weight of ice and snow on its roof was not a covered loss\u201d helpful, noting that Mr. Hagan made his claim determination \u201cindependent[ ] of the prior determination [by Ms. Havens]\u201d and that he applied a standard, layman\u2019s definition of the word \u201cbuilding\u201d in reaching his claim determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In the \u201cDiscussion\u201d section of her \u201cMemorandum and Final Order,\u201d the Commissioner set forth the parties\u2019 contentions and the statutory framework governing a complaint alleging unfair claim settlement practices under Ins. section 27-303. She then analyzed the Taylors\u2019 complaint, ruling that they had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that State Farm\u2019s \u201crefusal to pay the Claim was for a reason other than a lawful principle or standard which the Insurer applies across the board to all claimants, was unreasonable based on all available information, based on a whim, or demonstrated a failure to act in good faith.\u201d The Commissioner reasoned that the Policy did not \u201cuse the terms \u2018building\u2019 and \u2018structure\u2019 interchangeably\u201d and that \u201conly a building is covered for collapse.\u201d She emphasized that before the MIA the Taylors, not State Farm, bore the burden of proof and persuasion to demonstrate that State Farm had acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or with a lack of good faith in denying their claim\u2014a burden they did not meet. She specifically rejected the Taylors\u2019 argument that the denial had to have constituted a violation of Ins. section 27-303(2) and (9) because \u201cthe only reasonable interpretation of [the Policy] is that [the Taylors\u2019] permanent carport is a building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Finally, the Commissioner observed that the Taylors \u201crelied heavily, almost exclusively, on the fact that they installed the carport only after [Ms. Taylor] read the Policy and confirmed with [Ms. Yancey] that the carport was covered under the Policy.\u201d She emphasized that Maryland appellate cases make plain that the language of an insurance policy is determinative of coverage and contrary representations by insurance agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>have no impact on whether a loss is covered. For all of these reasons, the Commissioner denied the Taylors\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">On April 19, 2012, PICD petitioned for judicial review of the MIA decision. On August 9, 2012, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the MIA. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In this appeal from the judgment of the circuit court on judicial review of a final agency decision, we look \u201cthrough\u201d the decision of the circuit court and review the decision of the MIA. <em>People\u2019s Counsel v. Country Ridge Shopping Ctr., Inc., </em>144 Md.App. 580, 591, 799 A.2d 425 (2002). <em>See also Ins. Comm\u2019r v. Engelman, </em>345 Md. 402, 411, 692 A.2d 474 (1997) (reviewing a final decision of the Insurance Commissioner). Our review of the agency decision is circumscribed. <em>See Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67, 729 A.2d 376 (1999). It is \u201climited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv. v.

We review purely legal decisions <em>de novo. See People\u2019s Counsel v. Loyola College in Md., </em>406 Md. 54, 67-68, 956 A.2d 166 (2008). Even so, with respect to an agency\u2019s legal conclusions, we give \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to the agency\u2019s \u201cinterpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>at 69, 729 A.2d 376. <em>See also Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 173, 783 A.2d 169 (2001) (appellate court must accord appropriate deference to agency expertise even with respect to conclusions of law). In the context of appellate review of an administrative agency decision on a mixed question of law and fact, we apply the substantial evidence test. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number><em>Charles County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 296, 855 A.2d 313 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">PICD contends State Farm \u201cdid not have a legal basis to deny the Taylors\u2019 claim.\u201d This is so, it argues, because State Farm\u2019s chosen definition of the word \u201cbuilding\u201d is unsupported by case law, dictionary definitions, and State Farm\u2019s own past practice and therefore was a prohibited <em>ad hoc </em>determination made in violation of Ins. section 27-303(2) and (9). Accordingly, PICD maintains, the MIA\u2019s decision that State Farm\u2019s denial of the Taylors\u2019 claim for loss to the carport was not arbitrary, capricious, or made with a lack of good faith was legally incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">State Farm responds that the MIA\u2019s decision that it (State Farm) adjusted the Taylors\u2019 claim in good faith and that it did not deny their claim for loss to the carport for an arbitrary or capricious reason is entitled to deference as a finding on a mixed question of law and fact. It asserts, however, that, even if viewed as a pure question of law, the Policy language is plain and unambiguous and was properly construed by State Farm as not affording coverage for the loss to the carport. Therefore, having denied the Taylors\u2019 claim in accordance with the plain language of the Policy, State Farm could not have been found to have denied the claim for an arbitrary or capricious reason or not in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Ins. section 27-303, entitled \u201cUnfair claim settlement practices,\u201d prohibits insurers from, among other things, \u201crefusing] to pay a claim for an arbitrary or capricious reason based on all available information\u201d and \u201cfailing] to act in good faith ... in settling a first-party claim under a policy of property and casualty insurance.\u201d Ins. \u00a7 27-303(2) and (9). An insurer acts arbitrarily or capriciously when it refuses to pay a claim \u201c \u2018subject to individual judgment or discretion\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018based on an unpredictable whim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berkshire Life Ins. Co. v. MIA, </em>142 Md.App. 628, 671, 791 A.2d 942 (2002) (quoting with approval from a decision of the MIA). An insurer does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>not act in good faith if it fails to make \u201can informed judgment based on honesty and diligence supported by evidence the insurer knew or should have known at the time the insurer made a decision on a claim.\u201d Ins. \u00a7 27-1001(a). If the Commissioner rules that an insurer violated Ins. section 27-303, a penalty of up to $2,500 for each violation may be imposed and restitution may be ordered for each claimant suffering damages as a result of any violation. Ins. \u00a7 27-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The MIA\u2019s decision in this case turned on whether State Farm adopted an unreasonably narrow, <em>ad hoc </em>interpretation of the Policy, in particular of the operative word \u201cbuilding\u201d in the Policy, or denied the claim without engaging in any honest and diligent effort to reach an informed judgment as to whether the loss was covered. The MIA determined for several reasons that the Taylors failed to show that State Farm had done either.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">For the most part, PICD does not dispute the MIA\u2019s first-level factual findings, that Ms. Havens made the initial decision to deny the Taylors\u2019 claim based on the instruction given to her by a supervisor about the meaning of the word \u201cbuilding\u201d; that the instruction was applied across-the-board to all the claims resulting from the blizzard; that the instruction was consistent with instructions Ms. Havens previously had received;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that, subsequent to Ms. Havens\u2019s decision to deny the Taylors\u2019 claim, Mr. Hagan independently reviewed that decision; and that Mr. Hagan reached the same claim determination with respect to the carport but a different claim determination with respect to the snow blower and the power washer. The Taylors did not present any evidence that the definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d used by State Farm in adjusting their claim was inconsistent with the definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d it had used in adjusting other claims. Finally, PICD\u2019s own expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>witness testified that the definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d used by State Farm was consistent with that used by Allstate, the only insurer doing business in Maryland that included a definition including the word \u201cbuilding\u201d in its homeowners insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Whether State Farm refused to pay the Taylors\u2019 claim for an arbitrary or capricious reason or failed to act in good faith in denying the claim are mixed questions of law and fact in that they call upon the MIA to make first-level factual findings and then determine the ultimate legal significance of those findings. As noted, in administrative agency cases, mixed questions of law and fact are subject to judicial review for substantial evidence. <em>See Vann, supra, </em>382 Md. at 296, 855 A.2d 313. This is a function of deference to agency experience, which logically extends not only to the making of first-level factual findings, but also to ascertaining the significance of first-level facts -within the statutory scheme the agency administers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The findings of the MIA in the case at bar constituted substantial evidence to support its ultimate determination that State Farm denied the Taylors\u2019 claim based upon a \u201clawful principle or standard\u201d that the insurer applied consistently to all claims and that State Farm acted honestly and diligently in adjusting the claim, <em>i.e., </em>in good faith. On this basis alone, we would affirm the decision of the MIA. Even if we disagreed with State Farm\u2019s interpretation of its Policy language, we would conclude that the record contains substantial evidence to support the MIA\u2019s decision that State Farm did not adjust the Taylors\u2019 claim arbitrarily or without good faith and hence did not engage in the alleged unfair claim settlement practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number> In fact, we agree with State Farm\u2019s interpretation of its Policy language, as did the MIA, and also would affirm on that basis. An insurance policy is a contract and is construed subject to the principles of contract interpretation. <em>See, e.g., N. River Ins. Co. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balto., </em>343 Md. 34, 39, 680 A.2d 480 (1996). As this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW7-\">The first principle of construction of insurance policies in Maryland is to apply the terms of the contract, to determine the scope and limitations of its coverage. This principle serves to achieve the touchstone of policy construction\u2014to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the parties to the agreement. To divine properly the parties\u2019 intent, the policy is viewed as a whole, without emphasis being placed on particular provisions. Moreover, whenever possible, each clause, sentence, or provision shall be given force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><em>Empire Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>117 Md.App. 72, 96, 699 A.2d 482 (1997) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In construing specific words or terms in an insurance contract, we give them their \u201ccustomary, ordinary, and accepted meaning.\u201d <em>Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc. v. Md. Cas. Co., </em>324 Md. 44, 56, 595 A.2d 469 (1991). \u201cIf the terms are unambiguous, the court may construe the insurance contract as a matter of law.\u201d <em>MAMSI Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Callaway, </em>375 Md. 261, 279, 825 A.2d 995 (2003). A term is ambiguous if \u201c\u2018a reasonably prudent person\u2019 would understand the term as susceptible to more than one possible meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cole v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>359 Md. 298, 306, 753 A.2d 533 (2000)). Whether a term is ambiguous is itself a question of law. <em>Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Co. v. Md. Yacht Club, Inc., </em>129 Md.App. 455, 468, 742 A.2d 79 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In the case at bar, State Farm asserts that the word \u201cbuilding\u201d as used in the Policy is plain and unambiguous and means a structure with a roof and at least three walls. It relies on case law and dictionary definitions to this effect and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>on the way in which the word is used in the Policy. PICD agrees that the word \u201cbuilding\u201d is plain and unambiguous, but maintains that it is synonymous with the word \u201cstructure.\u201d It relies upon a dictionary definition to this effect. It also points out that the Anne Arundel County Code requires that carports have at least two open sides, which means that all carports in that county will be excluded from coverage under State Farm\u2019s definition of the word \u201cbuilding.\u201d Alternatively, PICD maintains that the word \u201cbuilding\u201d as used in the Policy is susceptible of more than one meaning and therefore the Policy should be construed in favor of insurance consumers and against State Farm, as the drafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The broad definition of the word \u201cbuilding\u201d urged by PICD plainly is at odds with how that word is used in the Policy. The words \u201cstructure\u201d and \u201cbuilding\u201d are not used interchangeably in the Policy. A \u201cstructure\u201d that is attached to a dwelling is part of the dwelling. A structure that is \u201cseparated from the dwelling by clear space\u201d or is attached to the dwelling by \u201conly a fence, utility line, or similar connection\u201d is an \u201cother structure\u201d that is covered as a \u201cdwelling extension\u201d under \u201cCOVERAGE A\u201d of the Policy. Thus, \u201cstructure\u201d would include a well, a sewer line, a gazebo, and, as the parties agree, a detached carport.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The word \u201cbuilding\u201d is used more narrowly in the Policy, to mean a structure that contains or encloses property. For example, the Policy specifies at \u201cSECTION I-LOSSES INSURED,\u201d \u201cCOVERAGE B\u2014PERSONAL PROPERTY\u201d that it does not cover losses to personal property <em>\u201ccontained, in a building </em>caused by rain, snow, sleet, sand or dust\u201d unless the damage to the personal property results from \u201cthe direct force of wind or hail damaging] the building causing <em>an opening in a roof or wall.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In this same section, the Policy language states that loss to personal property <em>\u201ccontained in a building\u201d </em>caused by \u201cFalling objects\u201d only is covered if the <em>\u201croof or an exterior wall of the building </em>is first damaged by a falling object.\u201d Clearly, these provisions of the Policy use the word \u201cbuilding\u201d to mean a walled, roofed, enclosed structure\u2014not any structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>With respect to collapse coverage, the relevant subsection of the \u201cADDITIONAL COVERAGES\u201d section limits coverage for collapse to \u201cthe sudden, entire collapse of a <em>building </em>or any part of a <em>building.\u201d </em>By using the word \u201cbuilding,\u201d instead of \u201cstructure,\u201d \u201cother structure,\u201d or the phrase \u201cthe property described in Coverage A,\u201d the Policy plainly narrows the coverage for the named peril. Coverage for collapse under the Policy is more limited than coverage for other perils as collapse coverage generally is excluded and only exists as an <em>exception </em>to the exclusion, as specifically provided in the \u201cADDITIONAL COVERAGES\u201d section.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">This Policy language interpretation also is supported by dictionary definitions and case law. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (unabridged ed.2002) defines \u201cbuilding\u201d to mean \u201ca constructed edifice designed to stand more or less permanently, covering a space of land, <em>usually covered by a roof and more or less completely enclosed by walls </em>and serving as a dwelling, storehouse, factory, shelter for animals, or other useful structure\u2014distinguished from structures not designed for occupancy (as fences or monuments) and from structures not intended for use in one place (as boats or trailers).\u201d (Emphasis added.). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed.1990) defines \u201cbuilding\u201d to mean a \u201c[sjtructure with walls and a roof, esp. a permanent structure.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In <em>Freeform Pools, Inc. v. Strawbridge Home for Boys, Inc., </em>228 Md. 297, 179 A.2d 683 (1962), the Court of Appeals considered whether a swimming pool was subject to the mechanics\u2019 lien law, which applied to \u201cevery building erected and every building improved.\u201d Md.Code (1957), Art. 63, \u00a7 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The Court opined that a building, in its broadest sense, is \u201can erection intended for use and occupancy as a habitation, or for some purpose of trade, manufacture, ornament, or use, such as a house, store, or a church.\u201d 228 Md. at 301, 179 A.2d 683. It also cited the following definition: \u201ca fabric, structure, or edifice, designed for the habitation of men or animals or for the shelter of property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed.1951)). It is implicit that a structure designed for human use or habitation or for the \u201cshelter[ing] of property\u201d will have walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Courts in other jurisdictions also have construed the word \u201cbuilding\u201d in homeowners insurance policies as being more narrow than the word \u201cstructure.\u201d <em>See Bergeron v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>145 N.H. 391, 766 A.2d 256, 259 (2000) (concluding that a dam is not a \u201cbuilding,\u201d and construing that term in the context of policy language identical to that in the Policy here to mean \u201csomething more than anything that is built\u201d); <em>Arkin v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>228 Ga.App. 564, 492 S.E.2d 314, 316 (1997) (holding that a culvert is not a \u201cbuilding\u201d and construing that term to mean \u201c \u2018[sjomething that is built, as for human habitation\u2019; \u2018a relatively permanent construction having a room and walls, used for living, manufacturing, etc.\u2019; \u2018structure designed for habitation, shelter, storage, trade, manufacture ... inclosing a space within its walls, and usually, but not necessarily, covered with a roof.\u2019 \u201d (quoting dictionary definitions)).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">For all these reasons, we conclude that the word \u201cbuilding\u201d as used in the Policy is plain and unambiguous and means a structure that has a roof and walls. Because the carport had no walls and was \u201cseparated from the dwelling by clear space,\u201d it was an \u201cother structure,\u201d but was not a building. As such, it was a covered \u201cdwelling extension\u201d under \u201cCOVERAGE A\u201d of the Policy. Pursuant to \u201cSECTION I\u2014LOSSES INSURED,\u201d a loss to the carport was covered \u201cexcept as provided in SECTION I\u2014LOSSES NOT INSURED.\u201d The \u201cLOSSES NOT INSURED\u201d section excluded as a covered peril \u201ccollapse\u201d except where specifically included as an additional coverage. Subsection 11 of the \u201cADDITIONAL COV<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ERAGES\u201d section only covers losses to a \u201cbuilding\u201d due to collapse under weight of ice and snow. It follows that the collapse of the carport was not covered under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Because State Farm\u2019s decision to deny the Taylors\u2019 claim was based on a correct legal interpretation of the language of the Policy, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or made without good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

That section governed the coverage decision for the loss to the snow blower and the power washer located within the carport. State Farm initially denied the Taylors' claim for the loss to this personal property based upon its determination that the carport was not a building. It later rescinded its denial of this portion of the claim because it determined that the personal property inside the carport was covered under a coverage provision for \u201cFalling objects\u201d peril.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">.

In its reply brief, PICD disputes that Ms. Havens had applied this definition of the term \"building\u201d prior to her deployment to Maryland following the 2010 blizzard.
