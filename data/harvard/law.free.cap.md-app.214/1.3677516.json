(\u201cWestat\u201d), Westat\u2019s Senior Vice President, Renee Slobasky, Westat\u2019s Vice President, Patricia Montalvan, and Westat\u2019s Assistant Director of Survey Operations for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys Project, Katrina Apodaca, alleging violations of Maryland\u2019s Wage and Hour Law and Wage Payment and Collection Law, regarding unpaid overtime wages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellees filed a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint, asserting a failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and that appellant\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The circuit court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>appellees\u2019 motion. Appellant noted an appeal, and presents two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">1. Is [appellant\u2019s claim for overtime wages under the [Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law] barred by the statute of limitations despite being tolled under class action judicial tolling during [appellant\u2019s participation in prior collective action litigation in <em>Syrja v. Westat </em>under the [Fair Labor Standards Act]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-6\">2. Has [appellant stated a claim for overtime wages under the [Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law] in claiming wages which [appellee was required by law to pay [appellant and which [appellee withheld from [appellant during [appellant\u2019s employment and upon her termination?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">For the reasons outlined below, we answer the first question positively, and we need not address the second question. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">The procedural history of appellant\u2019s efforts to obtain her alleged overtime wages originated with <em>Syrja v. Westat, Inc., 756 </em>F.Supp.2d 682 (D.Md.2010). On July 27, 2009, the plaintiff-employee, Steven Syrja (\u201cMr. Syrja\u201d), filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland (\u201cMaryland U.S. District Court\u201d), maintaining that Westat violated the Family and Medical Leave Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because it failed to compensate him for applicable overtime pay. <em>Id. </em>at 683. On August 13, 2009, Mr. Syrja filed an amended complaint, on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated individuals, and further claimed a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Maryland\u2019s Wage Payment and Collection Law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">The Maryland U.S. District Court offered a comprehensive description of Westat and its employees as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Westat is a Rockville, Maryland-based statistical survey research company that collects and analyzes data on various subjects for government agencies, businesses, and foundations. Since the 1980s, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [] have engaged Westat to assist with the collection of medical data for its National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (\u201cNHANES\u201d). The NHANES project, which endeavors to provide a statistical snapshot of the baseline health of Americans, requires that annual data be collected at several thousand selected households throughout the country. The data collected through the NHANES project eventually serve as a source for health science study and analysis for federal agencies, universities, and other public and private research entities. To facilitate the collection of data for NHANES, Westat employs \u201cfield interviewers\u201d\u2014also sometimes referred to as \u201cdata collectors\u201d <em>1 </em>1\u2014whose job is to visit households selected by NHANES statisticians to request their participation in the study and to collect information about the background and health of the households\u2019 members....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-5\">Westat\u2019s NHANES field interviewers work at [specific locations] for approximately 48 weeks each year. They receive two vacation breaks-one in the summer and another in the winter\u2014lasting approximately two weeks each. Given that the interviewers must work at several different [locations] each year, the job requires travel on a full-time basis. The interviewers stay in hotels or apartments in the general vicinity of their assigned [location] and receive per diem allowances to cover expenses for meals and incidentals. After arriving at a [location], each field interviewer receives materials containing addresses and basic information for households that have been identified as possible candidates for the NHANES study. Each field interviewer travels to each address assigned to him, greets the person who answers the door, and describes the purpose of the NHANES project. The field interviewer then conducts a \u201chousehold screening,\u201d a process through which he collects demograph<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ic data about the people in the household, enters the data in a portable computer, and receives feedback from the computer indicating whether one or more candidates for the NHANES study resides in the household. If at least one such candidate is identified, the field interviewer attempts to persuade the candidate(s) to submit to a comprehensive health interview, to be followed by a medical examination to be conducted by a different group of Westat personnel. To a significant degree, Westat\u2019s NHANES field interviewers set their own schedules. Although they are obliged to report to their respective [ ] offices a few times each week, it is generally up to the interviewers to decide when to begin their work days, decide when to take breaks, determine their own daily and weekly travel itineraries, and decide when to end their respective work days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">The quantity and nature of work assignments among field interviewers vary considerably. Some interviewers are assigned as few as 20 households in a [location], others as many as 100. The variations depend upon the geography of the [location], the resulting time travel required, the preferences of the [location\u2019s] managers, and the skill and experience levels of the field interviewers, among other things. The complexity of a given interview also varies from household to household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">Because they generally work alone in the [locations] and largely set their own schedules, the interviewers are responsible for recording and reporting their work hours. To facilitate the reporting process, Westat provides each field interviewer with blank timesheets. On a weekly basis, each field interviewer records his or her work hours on a time-sheet and submits the timesheet to his [or her] study manager for approval. Once the timesheet is approved, the study manager delivers the timesheet to Westat\u2019s payroll department for processing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 683-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Appellant, an Alabama resident, was employed as a Westat field interviewer from April 2003 to May 2007. After this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>position ended, appellant alleged that she too was entitled to overtime wages for working in excess of forty hours per week. On September 15, 2009, in addition to other Westat employees, appellant filed written consent to join the <em>Syrja </em>case, stating, \u201cI hereby consent and agree to opt-in to become a plaintiff in a lawsuit brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, et seq., to recover unpaid wages and overtime wages from my current/former employer, Westat, Inc.\u201d Thereafter, Mr. Syrja filed a motion for conditional class certification relating to his Fair Labor Standards Act claim. <em>Id. </em>The Maryland U.S. District Court determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">[T]he adjudication of multiple claims in this case would require the parties, the Court, and perhaps eventually a jury, to engage in an unmanageable assortment of individualized factual inquiries. At a minimum, these inquiries would require an examination of: each individual field interviewer\u2019s work assignments; the nature and length of the assignments, his [or her] interactions with his [or her] respective managers; the details of how and when he [or she] was instructed to complete his [or her] timesheets; the notes he [or she] took during his [or her] household screenings; the computer entries he [or she] made during his [or her] household screenings; the policies in place regarding hours to be worked in his [or her] particular [location(s) ]; whether he [or she] was ever authorized to work overtime; and whether he [or she] was in fact compensated or uncompensated for his [or her] overtime hours[.][ 1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 688. On November 2, 2010, the Maryland U.S. District Court issued an order that denied Mr. Syrja\u2019s motion for conditional class certification. <em>Id. </em>at 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">On December 2, 2010, appellant and nineteen other <em>Syrja </em>plaintiffs filed a new complaint in the Maryland U.S. District Court, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Maryland\u2019s Wage Payment and Collection Law. In response, appellees filed a motion to sever and dismiss. Following a motions hearing, the Maryland U.S. District Court issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>another order on September 1, 2011, stating (emphasis in original) (capitalization in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">1. Defendants\u2019 Motion to [s]ever and [dismiss [ ] is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. The [m]otion is GRANTED insofar as: (a) the claims of all [the] [plaintiffs <em>other than </em>Judith Adedje are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE from this suit; to the extent those [p]laintiffs wish to pursue their claims against [defendants, they must do so by filing separate lawsuits; and (b) the claims of [p]laintiff Judith Adedje are DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. The Motion is DENIED insofar as the Court declines to address limitations issues at this time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">2. Plaintiffs [M]otion for [L]eave to [A]dd [Plaintiffs [Paper No. 20] is DENIED; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">3. Plaintiff Adedje shall have 20 DAYS to file an [a]mended [e]omplaint containing allegations sufficiently specific to satisfy the plausibility standard articulated by the [U.S.] Supreme Court in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Iqbal </em>[556 U.S. 662], 129 S.Ct. 1937 [173 L.Ed.2d 868] (2009).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Thereafter, on September 30, 2011, appellant filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, alleging that she \u201cwas entitled to overtime premium compensation from [appellees] of one and one-half times her regular rate of pay for hours she worked beyond the forty per week for [appellees,]\u201d pursuant to Maryland\u2019s Wage and Hour Law and Wage Payment and Collection Law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 9, 2011, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>appellees filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that (1) appellant\u2019s claims were time-barred because her employment ended in May 2007, and equitable tolling pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d) did not apply;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) appellant failed to allege a violation of the Wage and Hour Law in the <em>Syrja </em>action; and (3) appellant failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted regarding the Wage Payment and Collection Law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On January 10, 2012, appellant filed an opposition to the motion, maintaining that equitable tolling under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d) did toll the statute of limitations and that there was a valid Wage Payment and Collection Law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">During a hearing on March 15, 2012, appellees submitted three \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d charts that included all the relevant dates relating to appellant\u2019s and other Westat employees\u2019 filings and dismissals. The circuit court offered appellant the option to submit a supplemental brief and/or respond to appellees\u2019 charts. On March 30, 2012, appellant filed a supplemental memorandum and a chart to address alleged inaccuracies in appellees\u2019 charts. On April 16, 2012, appellees filed a response to appellant\u2019s supplemental brief, and averred that appellant\u2019s submission did not survive the motion to dismiss. On May 4, 2012, the circuit court issued an opinion and order, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">... [S]ince the Wage and Hour Law was never asserted by [appellant] in either federal case, the tolling provision of [28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7] 1367(d) will not be applied to Count One.<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> Count One is limited to any alleged claims occurring on and after September 30, 2008. Given that [appellant\u2019s] employment ended in May 2007, Count One is barred by the statute of limitations. [Appellant] did assert the Wage Payment and Collection Law state claim in <em>[Adedje, et al. v. Westat, et al., </em>Civil Action No. 10-3378], filed on December 2, 2010, which was subsequently dismissed September 2, 2011, thereby tolling Count Two of the state law claim for ten (10) months. However, even with the application of the tolling provision, the statute of limitations still expired in March 2011, thereby barring Count Two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">[Appellant] does not assert that Westat failed to pay her regularly or all that was due upon termination, and therefore Count Two of [appellant\u2019s] complaint is dismissed. [ (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">Appellant noted a timely appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">According to the Court of Appeals, under Md. Rule 2-322(b)(2),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">[A] defendant may, in a civil suit in a circuit court, seek dismissal of a case through preliminary motion when the complaint fails \u201cto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d A defendant asserts in such a motion that, despite the truth of the allegations, the plaintiff is barred from recovery as a matter of law....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-10\"><em>North Am.

Alpharma, Inc., </em>421 Md. 59, 72, 25 A.3d 200 (2011)). Similar to motions for summary judgment, we examine the circuit court\u2019s ruling to determine whether it was legally correct. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Parks, </em>421 Md. at 72, 25 A.3d 200) (quotations omitted), <em>accord Doe v. Roe, </em>419 Md. 687, 693, 20 A.3d 787 (2011) (\u201c \u2018In reviewing the [circuit [cjourt\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, our task is confined to determining whether the [circuit] court was legally correct in its decision to dismiss.\u2019 \u201d) (quotations omitted). We therefore review a motion to dismiss pursuant to the de novo standard. <em>Gomez v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>427 Md. 128, 142, 46 A.3d 443 (2012) (citing <em>Reichs Ford Rd. Joint Venture v.

Vol), \u00a7 5-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (hereinafter \u201cCts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\u201d) ] is left to judicial determination.\u201d <em>Shailendra, Kumar, P.A. v. Dhanda, </em>426 Md. 185, 193, 43 A.3d 1029 (2012) (quoting <em>Frederick Rd. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 95, 756 A.2d 963 (2000)). Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-101 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>A civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues unless another provision of the Code provides a different period of time within which an action shall be commenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Therefore, on a general basis, because appellant\u2019s employment ended in May 2007, the filing deadline would have been in May 2010. Appellant filed her complaint in the circuit court on September 30, 2011. Ordinarily, the action would have been a year and four months beyond the filing deadline, and thus, time-barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Appellant acknowledges the abovementioned contention, but maintains that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">[Her claim] was tolled on September 15, 2009, when she opted in to the <em>Syrja </em>collective action.[ ] ..., This added 13 months and 17 days, the time between when [appellant] opted in the <em>Syrja </em>action and when the [Maryland U.S. District] [C]ourt denied certification on November 2, 2010, to the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations was tolled again on December 2, 2010, when [appellant] filed her action in federal court, through the action\u2019s dismissal on September 2, 2011. This added 9 months, plus an additional 30 days, under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1367(d), to the statute of limitations. The [circuit] court [] correctly tolled [appellant\u2019s] claim for the 10 months that the federal <em>Adedje </em>action was pending, but did not address [class action] tolling for the time of the <em>Syrja </em>collection action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Thereby, appellant contends that her claim was timely pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d) and the class action tolling doctrine. Appellees aver that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d) was appellant\u2019s exclusive means of tolling, and that the class action tolling doctrine did not apply to <em>Syrja. </em>Furthermore, appellees alleged that Maryland does not recognize cross-jurisdictional class action tolling, and that appellant only opted-in Mr. Syrja\u2019s Fair Labor Standards Act, not the Wage Payment and Collection Law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number> Although some courts have often merged equitable tolling and class action tolling, we agree with the jurisdictions that have found principal differences between the two, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-\">[W]e believe that there is a fundamental distinction between equitable tolling and class action tolling. In a class action, the putative class representative has satisfied the prerequisites to suit [sic], <em>including filing within the applicable limitations period; </em>tolling is applied to preserve the rights of absent class members during the pendency of certification proceedings. In contrast, equitable tolling seeks to excuse <em>untimely </em>filing by an individual plaintiff and is generally applicable where the plaintiff has been induced or tricked by the defendant\u2019s conduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass. Because the purpose behind class action tolling is different from the purpose behind equitable tolling, we find that the cases concerning equitable tolling are inapposite.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><em>Hess v. I.R.E. Real Estate Income Fund, Ltd., </em>255 Ill.App.3d 790, 195 Ill.Dec. 935, 629 N.E.2d 520, 531 (1993). <em>See also Stransky v. HealthONE of Denver, Inc., </em>868 F.Supp.2d 1178, 1181 (D.Co.2012) (\u201cFurthermore, equitable tolling applies only when a litigant\u2019s failure to meet a legally-mandated deadline unavoidably arose from circumstances beyond that litigant\u2019s control.\u201d) (additional citations omitted) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Hatfield v.

Though distinct, we do acknowledge that jurisdictions can apply the equitable tolling doctrine in their class actions to toll their statute of limitations. <em>See Tigg v. Pirelli Tire Corp., </em>232 S.W.3d 28, 33 (Tenn.2007) (\u201cA majority of other states have adopted a rule allowing equitable tolling during the pendency of a class action in their own courts.\u201d) (additional citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Most of appellant\u2019s argument is predicated on <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al. v. Christensen, et al., </em>394 Md. 227, 905 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>A.2d 340 (2006) [hereinafter <em>\u201cChristensen II </em>\u201d].

Similar to the case at bar, the procedural history of the plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to obtain damages commenced with another case, <em>Richardson, et al. v.

The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals, and argued that if Maryland Courts acknowledged a class action tolling exception, it did not apply. <em>Christensen, </em>394 Md. at 236, 905 A.2d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The Court of Appeals indicated that it would recognize a tolling exception if \u201c(1) there [was] persuasive authority or persuasive policy considerations supporting the recognition of the tolling exception, and (2) [if] recognizing the tolling exception [was] consistent with the generally recognized purposes for the enactment of statutes of limitations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238, 905 A.2d 340 (additional citations omitted). Furthermore, the Court emulated its additional factors from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s <em>American Pipe and Construction Co., et al. v.

The Court found that Mr. Christensen was a member of the <em>Richardson </em>putative class of persons. <em>Id. </em>With an exception for one cigarette manufacturer, the defendants and claims were the same from <em>Richardson. Id. </em>Furthermore, neither party contested that the <em>Christensen </em>plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not accrue prior to the circuit court\u2019s grant of the class action certification in <em>Richardson. Id. </em>at 266, 905 A.2d 340. Because Mr. Christensen was actively involved in <em>Richardson, </em>the defendants possessed sufficient notice of the action. <em>Id. </em>As a result, the Court concluded that class action tolling applied, and the <em>Christensen </em>plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was timely. <em>Id. </em>at 267, 905 A.2d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Appellees support their contentions with <em>Antar, et al. v. Mike Egan Ins. Agency, Inc., et al., </em>209 Md.App. 336, 58 A.3d 609 (2012). In <em>Antar, </em>the plaintiffs owned a Baltimore City building, which was destroyed by a fire. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 58 A.3d 609. The plaintiffs filed a claim -with the defendants-insurance companies, which was denied because an inspection indicated that the plaintiffs failed to use smoke detectors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">On February 4, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an action in a Pennsylvania circuit court for breach of contract and bad faith. <em>Id. </em>at 339, 58 A.3d 609. One of the defendants moved for a dismissal, which the court granted with leave to refile the complaint in a Maryland court. <em>Id. </em>Instead, however, on June 15, 2010, the plaintiffs appealed their case to Pennsylvania\u2019s intermediate appellate court, which affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>On May 18, 2011, the plaintiffs finally filed a complaint in a Maryland circuit court, averring that the defendants breached their contract and were negligent. <em>Id. </em>The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the court granted, holding that the claim was time-barred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiffs maintained that the circuit court erred because \u201cthe running of the limitations period in Maryland should have been tolled for the entire length of time that the suit was pending in Pennsylvania.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340, 58 A.3d 609. Our Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">[T]he [plaintiffs] did not need the benefit of [Md.] Rule 2-101(b)\u2019s <footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark> 30 day grace period, because when the Philadelphia County Court dismissed the case on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens </em>on July 24, 2008, they still had two years and seven months within which to refile the case timely in Baltimore. Even figuring from the affirmance of the dismissal by the Pennsylvania intermediate appellate court on June 15, 2010, they still had eight months within which to accomplish a timely refiling of the case in Baltimore (or four months and eight days figuring from September 27, 2010). Under any of those languid and latitudinarian deadlines, they utterly failed to exhibit a shred of diligence.

As a matter of law, there would be no other avenue of relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>available. And even if, purely <em>arguendo, </em>other forms of relief had been available, the [plaintiffs], because of their utter lack of diligence, would have failed to qualify for such relief, as a matter or fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 355-56, 58 A.3d 609.

See <em>Kumar, </em>426 Md. at 210, 43 A.3d 1029 (The Court of Appeals determined that a mandatory arbitration proceeding did not suspend the statute of limitations because the plaintiff should have initiated arbitration before limitations expired.); <em>Walko Corp. v.

Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>909 F.Supp.2d 116, 122 (D.R.I.2012). We acknowledge that <em>Christensen </em>and <em>Antar </em>concern class action judicial tolling and cross-jurisdictional tolling respectively. However, we have not found any Maryland cases that have analyzed these topics together, as the circuit court noted, <em>\u201cChristensen </em>did not analyze [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1367 nor did it involve a class action filed <em>in federal </em>court and a subsequent individual claim filed in <em>state </em>court.\u201d While this issue is one of first impression in Maryland, <em>see Christensen, </em>394 Md. at 255, n. 9, 905 A.2d 340 (\u201cWe express no opinion as to whether we would recognize the doctrine of cross-jurisdictional class action tolling....\u201d), \u201c[t]he supreme courts of states that recognize class action tolling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>have split on the issue of whether to adopt cross-jurisdictional tolling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Specifically, our sister states\u2019 cases only involve class actions. To determine the difference between these types of lawsuits, we examine them on a federal level.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">Unlike [the Federal] Rule [of Civil Procedure] 23 [ (\u201cRule 23\u201d) ] class actions, plaintiffs must \u201copt in\u201d to a [Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d) ] collective action.... There is a fundamental, irreconcilable difference between the class action described by Rule 23 and that provided by FLSA \u00a7 16(b). In a Rule 23 proceeding a class is described; if the action is maintainable as a class action, each person within the description is considered to be a class member and, as such, is bound by judgment, whether favorable or unfavorable, unless he [or she] has \u201copted out\u201d of the suit. Under \u00a7 16(b) of FLSA, on the other hand, no person can become a party plaintiff and no person will be bound by or may benefit from judgment unless he [or she] affirmatively \u201copted in\u201d the class; that is, given his [or her] written consent----This difference means that every plaintiff who opts in to a collective action has party status, whereas unnamed class members in Rule 23 class actions do not. Consequently, although the original plaintiffs in a collective action may pursue the suit on a representative basis, each FLSA claimant has the right to be present in court to advance his or her own claim. Conversely, only those plaintiffs who have opted in are bound by the results of the litigation. [ (citation omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-7\"><em>McKnight v. D.

As a result of countless actions against the defendants, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah transferred the case to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (\u201cCalifornia U.S. District Court\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 542, 94 S.Ct. 756. Thereafter, the defendants filed a motion, alleging that Utah did not satisfy class action requirements, and the court agreed. <em>Id. </em>Several days after the court issued its order, additional parties moved to intervene as plaintiffs. <em>Id. </em>at 543-44, 94 S.Ct. 756. The California U.S. District Court denied the parties\u2019 motion, determining that the statute of limitations had expired. <em>Id. </em>at 544, 94 S.Ct. 756. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed and denied in part. <em>Id. </em>at 544-45, 94 S.Ct. 756. The U.S. Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>to provide the federal courts with a harmonious solution in reviewing these specific type of cases. <em>Id. </em>at 545, 94 S.Ct. 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The U.S. Supreme Court examined the differences amongst the courts, as well as the purpose of the statute of limitations, which was advancing justice, ensuring equality, and judicial efficiency. <em>Id. </em>at 554, 94 S.Ct. 756. In considering these factors, and attempting to capture the spirit of federal class action procedures, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that, \u201cthe commencement of a class action suspended] the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Approximately a decade later, the U.S. Supreme Court broadened <em>American Pipe, </em>and determined that when an original class action certification was denied, at that moment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the statute of limitations was tolled for those class members who desire[d] to file their individual suits in federal court. <em>Crown, Cork &amp; Seal Co., v.

Although <em>American Pipe </em>and <em>Crown, Cork </em>are the foundational analysis of cross-jurisdictional class action tolling, they only involve tolling of one jurisdiction\u2019s statute of limitations, as opposed to involving two different jurisdictions, such as the federal and state level.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">In <em>One Star v. Sisters of St. Francis, Denver, Colorado, </em>752 N.W.2d 668, 672 (S.D.2008), the plaintiffs-siblings alleged that they were sexually abused by their secondary school\u2019s clergymen between 1960 to 1971. In 1995, the plaintiff-sister (\u201csister\u201d) discussed her account with another sexually abused victim, and the plaintiff-brother (\u201cbrother\u201d) drafted a letter regarding the alleged sexual abuse to a newspaper in May 2001. <em>Id. </em>at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">In April 2003, the brother was a member of a class action against the United States, which was filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. <em>Id. </em>at 673. The claim \u201cwas filed on behalf of Native American children who were allegedly abused at Roman Catholic boarding schools.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In June 2004, the plaintiffs filed a complaint against the defendants, who were the secondary school and related entities. In November 2004, the class action was dismissed for procedural defects. <em>Id. </em>Following discovery, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that the plaintiffs\u2019 action was barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court denied the motion, and the defendants appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 673-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs averred that their claims did not accrue until 2002 because during that time, they could appreciate the effect that the sexual abuse had on their lifestyles, and thus, the statute of limitations did not expire. <em>Id. </em>at 674. Moreover, the plaintiffs maintained that the class action tolled the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The South Dakota Supreme Court examined what constituted \u201caccrual,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 675, and determined that the sister and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>brother possessed notice of the effect by 1995 and 2001, respectively. <em>Id. </em>at 677-78. Consequently, because they filed their action in November 2004, their claims were barred. <em>Id. </em>at 680. Furthermore, the South Dakota Supreme Court indicated that class action tolling (1) offered notice to the defendants of a prospective action and (2) advanced judicial efficiency. <em>Id. </em>First, the defendants were not named parties in the class action, so there was no notice of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, \u201c[the] [pjlaintiffs [ ] failed to cite any authority supporting class action tolling in cases involving different defendants, different claims, in different jurisdictions[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681. As a result, the South Dakota Supreme Court did not apply cross-jurisdictional tolling, and reversed the circuit court\u2019s ruling regarding the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In <em>Maestas v. Sofamor Danek Group, Inc., </em>33 S.W.3d 805, 807 (Tenn.2000), the plaintiffs-patients alleged that the defendants\u2019-manufacturers\u2019 medical screws caused them to sustain additional injury to their backs after they were hospitalized. A few years later, parties, including the plaintiffs, initiated a class action against the defendants in the <em>U.S. </em>District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (\u201cPennsylvania U.S. District Court\u201d). <em>Id. </em>The Pennsylvania U.S. District Court denied the class action certification. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed individual lawsuits against the defendants in a Tennessee circuit court. <em>Id. </em>Following discovery, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, alleging that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court granted the defendants\u2019 motion, and the Tennessee intermediate court affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The Tennessee Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari, </em>and determined whether \u201ccross-jurisdictional tolling would involve the tolling of the applicable Tennessee statute of limitations during the period in which the plaintiffs sought class certification as part of the unsuccessful class[ ]action filed in the [Pennsylvania U.S. District Court].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Tennessee Supreme Court denoted that adopting the cross-jurisdictional class action doctrine would assist the federal courts in review<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ing class actions, but that its courts lacked interest in advancing \u201cefficiency and economy of the class action procedures of another jurisdiction^]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 808. Furthermore, the doctrine would create \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d because complainants would choose Tennessee as their \u201chub\u201d to file their claims \u201cbecause [its] cross-jurisdictional tolling doctrine would have effectively created an overly generous statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To avoid \u201cprotective filings,\u201d in which \u201cthe plaintiffs [would] wish to preserve their right to file suit in Tennessee while they [sought] class certification elsewhere[,]\u201d the Tennessee Supreme Court indicated that staying the proceedings would resolve this potential issue. <em>Id. </em>at 808-09. Lastly, if Tennessee applied the doctrine, it would grant the federal courts authorization to determine whether Tennessee\u2019s statute of limitations began to run, which was in strict contradiction to the Tennessee legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Id. </em>at 809. Accordingly, the Tennessee Supreme Court did not adopt the cross-jurisdictional class action tolling doctrine, and affirmed the grant of the summary judgment motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">In <em>Portwood et al. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>183 Ill.2d 459, 233 Ill.Dec. 828, 701 N.E.2d 1102 (1998), the plaintiffs-consumers filed a class action against the defendant-car manufacturer in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging that the defendant manufactured defective transmissions that caused them to sustain property damage. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied the class action certification, and the plaintiffs thereafter filed an action in an Illinois circuit court. <em>Id. </em>233 Ill.Dec. 828, 701 N.E.2d at 1102-03. Following discovery, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, averring that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>233 Ill.Dec. 828, 701 N.E.2d at 1103. The Illinois circuit court granted the defendant\u2019s motion, and the Illinois appellate court affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">On appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court stated that, \u201c[u]nless all states simultaneously adopt[ed] the rule of cross-jurisdictional class action tolling, any state which independently [did] so [would] invite into its courts a disproportionate share of suits which the federal courts have refused to certify as class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>actions after the statute of limitations ha[ve] run.\u201d <em>Id. </em>233 Ill.Dec. 828, 701 N.E.2d at 1104. Moreover, the Court indicated that \u201c[s]tate courts should not be required to entertain stale claims simply because the controlling statute of limitations expired while a federal court considered whether to certify a class action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Illinois Supreme Court did not recognize cross-jurisdictional class action tolling, <em>id., </em>and affirmed the circuit court\u2019s ruling in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>233 Ill.Dec. 828, 701 N.E.2d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">We also examine a federal case that has examined Maryland\u2019s doctrine regarding cross-jurisdictional class action tolling. In <em>Thelen v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>111 F.Supp.2d 688, 690 (D.Md.2000), the plaintiffs-policy owners filed a class action against the defendant-insurance company, alleging that the defendant employed fraudulent and deceptive provisions in its insurance policies. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, averring that the statute of limitations had expired. <em>Id. </em>at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs maintained that the pendency of two respective class actions in Mississippi and New York, <em>id. </em>at 694, n. 5, which occurred concurrently with their action, tolled the running of the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>at 694. The Maryland U.S. District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">In Maryland, [ ] there is no case directly addressing the issue, but what precedents there are, augur [sic] against its adoption. <em>See, e.g., Hecht v. Resolution Tmst Corp., </em>333 Md. 324 [333, 635 A.2d 394] (1994).<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> Indeed, the existence of [Md.] Rule 2-101(b), which provide[d] a limited savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>window if an identical action [was] dismissed by another court, clearly indicate[d] the absence, under Maryland law, of the broad, cross-jurisdictional class action equitable tolling advocated by [the] plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 694-95. Accordingly, the Court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 695. <em>But see In re Linerboard Antitrust Litigation, </em>223 F.R.D. 335, 353 (E.D.Pa.2004) (The Pennsylvania U.S. District Court determined that \u201cthe Maryland Court of Appeals would adopt cross-jurisdictional class action tolling in antitrust class actions filed in federal court\u201d because \u201cthe Maryland General Assembly has instructed courts interpreting the [Maryland Antitrust Act] to \u2018 \u201cbe guided by the interpretation given by the federal courts to the various federal [antitrust] statutes\u201d \u2019 \u201d and because the Maryland Court of Appeals has summoned its courts to examine other jurisdictions.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Although <em>Wade v. Danek Med., Inc., </em>182 F.3d 281 (4th Cir.1999) does not involve Maryland law, we nevertheless analyze it because the Maryland U.S. District Court discussed it in <em>Thelen. Wade\u2019s </em>facts are similar to <em>Maestas, </em>33 S.W.3d at 807 because both involved the same class action. In 1985, the injured plaintiff underwent back surgery, and the defendant\u2019s medical screws caused her to sustain additional pain and contract a disease. <em>Wade, </em>182 F.3d at 284. A class action was filed in the Pennsylvania U.S. District Court in 1993 against the defendants\u2014manufacturers, and although the plaintiffs were not named parties, they were \u201cputative\u201d parties. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, in 1995, the Pennsylvania U.S. District Court denied the class action certification, and the plaintiffs filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (\u201cVirginia U.S. District Court\u201d). <em>Id. </em>The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, averring that the statute of limitations had expired, and the Court granted the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">On appeal, the Fourth Circuit determined \u201cwhether a state court would engage in equitable tolling during the pendency of a class action in another court\u2014in this case, a federal court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>another jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287. The Fourth Circuit examined <em>Portwood, </em>and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">First, and most importantly, the Commonwealth of Virginia simply has no interest, except perhaps out of comity, in furthering the efficiency and economy of the class action procedures of another jurisdiction, whether those of the federal courts or those of another state. Second, if Virginia were to adopt a cross-jurisdictional tolling rule, Virginia would be faced with a flood of subsequent filings once a class action in another forum is dismissed.... Third, if Virginia were to allow cross-jurisdictional tolling, it would render the Virginia limitations period effectively dependent on the resolution of claims in other jurisdictions, with the length of the limitations period varying depending on the efficiency (or inefficiency) of courts in those jurisdictions [ (additional citations omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 287-88. Accordingly, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the Virginia Supreme Court would not recognize cross-jurisdictional equitable tolling, and affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">There are several other federal court decisions that decline to adopt the doctrine before the state\u2019s highest court has had the opportunity to consider the issue. <em>See Patterson, </em>909 F.Supp.2d at 123 (\u201cWithout a \u201cwell-plotted\u201d path showing an \u201cavenue of relief\u2019 that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would take on cross[-]jurisdictional class[ ]action tolling, and with no apparent consensus among the few states that have addressed the question, this Court declines [the] [plaintiffs\u2019 invitation and refuses to embark into an \u201cunexplored frontier[.]\u201d); <em>Casey v.

In <em>Dow Chem. Corp. v. Blanco, </em>67 A.3d 392 (Del.2013), the plaintiff-employee joined a class action, filed in a U.S. District Court in the District of Texas (\u201cTexas U.S. District Court\u201d) against the defendant-employer when he inhaled toxins at the workplace. The Texas U.S. District Court denied the class certification, and the plaintiff filed an individual suit in a Delaware circuit court. <em>Id. </em>The defendant filed a motion to dismiss, averring that the plaintiffs action was barred by the statute of limitations. <em>Id. </em>The court ruled for the plaintiff, determining that \u201cDelaware law recognize[d] the doctrine of cross-jurisdictional class action tolling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">On appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court, it stated: Reading <em>American Pipe </em>too narrowly would defeat an important purpose of a class action, which [was] to promote judicial economy.

Cross-jurisdictional tolling, also discourage[d] duplicative litigation of cases within the jurisdiction of our courts. If members of a putative class [could] not rely on the class action tolling exception to toll the statute of limitations, they [would] be forced to file \u201cplaceholder\u201d lawsuits to preserve their claims. This would result in wasteful and duplicative litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 395. Accordingly, the Court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">In <em>Stevens v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>358 Mont. 474, 247 P.3d 244, 248 (2010), the physician prescribed the plaintiff-patient a medication regimen to combat a cancerous disease. Thereafter, the plaintiff sustained chronic pain, and attributed the defendant\u2019s-manufacturer\u2019s medication as the cause. <em>Id. </em>at 248-49. During this time, three class actions were filed in a U.S. District Court for the District of Tennessee (\u201cTennessee U.S. District Court\u201d), specifically <em>Becker, et al. v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>alleging that the defendant failed to warn its consumers of the risks of its products. <em>Id. </em>at 249. However, the Tennessee U.S. District Court denied class certification. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">A few months before the Tennessee U.S. District Court denied certification, the plaintiff filed an action against the defendant in a Montana circuit court. <em>Id. </em>The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, averring that the statute of limitations had expired. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court denied the motion, and the jury ruled in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff alleged that \u201cbecause the <em>Becker </em>class action contained a request for worldwide class certification, and contained a claim for failure to warn against the dangers of Zometa ..., the statute of limitations was tolled as to [her], along with all other potential class members, under the class action tolling rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250 (internal quotations omitted). The defendant maintained that because the class action occurred in Tennessee, and not Montana, the Montana Supreme Court should have ignored the cross-jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>class action tolling doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 252. The Court disagreed, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">But as we have observed above, <em>all </em>plaintiffs, regardless of residency, are constitutionally guaranteed the right to file suit in Montana. We conclude that the best judge of these competing arguments will be experience.... Thus, although avoiding the possibility of a rush of out-of-state plaintiffs filing in our court system is concededly a valid policy objective, we consider this objective less compelling than competing considerations. We suspect that a greater burden on the court system will be imposed by <em>not </em>adopting the rule, as plaintiffs would be required to file protective individual suits in Montana courts to avoid limitations defenses, while otherwise relying on a pending class action suit filed elsewhere. This directly conflicts with the rationale underlying the class action tolling rule: to promote judicial economy by encouraging individual plaintiffs to defer to class action suits to protect their claims. We see no reason why jurisdictional boundaries should operate as a bar to the application of this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 256. Accordingly, the Montana Supreme Court determined that the plaintiffs complaint was filed in a timely fashion. <em>Id. </em>at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Akin to <em>Wade </em>and <em>Maestas, </em>the plaintiffs in <em>Vaccariello v. Smith &amp; Nephew Richards, Inc., </em>94 Ohio St.3d 380, 763 N.E.2d 160, 161-62 (2002), were also involved in the same class action against the defendant-manufacturer regarding excessive back pain as a result of the defendant\u2019s medical screws. The defendant moved for summary judgment, avowing that the plaintiffs complaint was barred by the statute of limitations, <em>id. </em>at 162, but the Ohio circuit court disagreed. <em>Id. </em>It surmised that the class actions filed in the U.S. Pennsylvania District Court tolled the statute, and thereby denied the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 161-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">On appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">We conclude that it is more important to ensure efficiency and economy of litigation than to rigidly adhere to [its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>previous case].... We hold that the filing of a class action, whether in Ohio or the federal court system, tolls the statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 163. Accordingly, the Court determined that the plaintiffs complaint was timely filed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">As previously indicated, jurisdictions are split regarding this issue, but we agree with the majority. Recognizing a tolling exception would assist in advancing the effectiveness of suits in other jurisdictions. However, this would deplete our judicial resources, and render our state the focal point for complainants whose class certifications were denied. Moreover, if we recognized an exception, our Courts would be at the mercy of other jurisdictions, waiting on them to rule on the cases. Therefore, we liken our holding to <em>Maestas, Portwood, </em>and <em>Wade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">In the case at bar, we first reiterate the <em>Phillip Moms II </em>elements regarding when a class action tolling exception applies: (1) whether the plaintiff was a party to the prior action; (2) whether the action concerns the same facts, claims, defendants, and witnesses as the prior action; (3) whether the defendant was placed on notice of another claim being filed; (4) whether persuasive authority and policy exist that support use of the tolling exception; and (5) whether recognition of the exception harmonizes with the purpose of statutes of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">It is logical to conclude that in the instant case, appellant was a member of <em>Syrja\u2019s </em>putative class because she filed a written consent to join the <em>Syrja </em>case, and became a named party. However, although appellant\u2019s action in the circuit court may have concerned the same defendants, witnesses, and evidence, it did not concern the same claim. According to <em>Syrja, </em>756 F.Supp.2d at 683, Mr. Syrja \u201cfiled a [m]otion for [c]onditional [c]lass [c]ertification [ ], in which, pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216(b), he ask[ed] the Court to conditionally certify a class of current and former Westat employees\u201d relating to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Fair Labor Standards Act claim only. Because appellant\u2019s complaint was predicated on an alleged violation of Maryland\u2019s Wage and Hour Law and Wage Payment and Collection Law, the second <em>Phillip Morris II </em>element was not met. Therefore, appellees were not placed on notice of a claim based on either of appellant\u2019s arguments, considering appellant only opted-in the Fair Labor Standards Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The two remaining questions are whether persuasive authority and policy considerations exist that support use of the tolling exception and whether recognition of the exception parallels with the General Assembly\u2019s statutes of limitation. As we formerly stated, appellant contends that her claim is timely pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d) and the class action tolling doctrine. To answer the remaining questions, we discuss the purpose of statutes of limitation, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">Statutes of limitation find their justification in necessity and convenience rather than in logic. They represent expedients, rather than principles. They are practical and pragmatic devices to spare the courts from litigation of stale claims, and the citizen from being put to his defense after memories have faded, witnesses have died or disappeared, and evidence has been lost [].... (citation omitted). They are by definition arbitrary, and their operation does not discriminate between the just and the unjust claim, or the voidable and unavoidable delay. They have come into the law not through the judicial process but through legislation. They represent a public policy about the privilege to litigate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AY\"><em>Walko, </em>281 Md. at 210, 378 A.2d 1100 (quoting <em>Chase Sec. Corp. v. Donaldson, </em>325 U.S. 304, 314, 65 S.Ct. 1137, 89 L.Ed. 1628 (1945)) (additional citations omitted) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In analyzing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d), we discuss the editor\u2019s note, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">Subdivision (d) of \u00a7 1367 recognizes the serious statute of limitations problems a claim may face after it has been \u201cdeclined\u201d in a federal action. It may now be too late under the state statute of limitations to bring a state action on the claim. Subdivision (d) answers this dilemma by assuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>that the claim shall have at least a 30-day period for the state action after it is dismissed by the federal court. The dismissal moment should be taken to be the moment of dismissal in the district court. Even if an appeal is taken to a court of appeals from the district court dismissal, the party whose claim has been dismissed under \u00a7 1367 does best to commence the state action within the prescribed time measured from the district court dismissal, and not from some later appellate affirmance of it. Perhaps, after commencing the state court action in such a situation, the plaintiff can ask the state court to stay the action\u2014now timely commenced and pending\u2014while the federal appeal proceeds. This seems to be the safest course until there is a definitive federal ruling about whether the 30-day period may be measured from an appellate determination. The matter is not addressed by the statute, and anything connected with the statute of limitations must be handled conservatively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In the case at bar, appellant\u2019s position ended in May 2007. On September 15, 2009, appellant filed a written consent to join the <em>Syrja </em>case. At this juncture, appellant had eight months to file a timely claim in Montgomery County. On November 2, 2010, the Maryland U.S. District Court issued an order that denied Mr. Syrja\u2019s motion for conditional class certification because \u201cthe multifarious factual differences among the proposed class members ma[de] the case an unsuitable candidate for class certification.\u201d <em>Syrja, </em>756 F.Supp.2d at 690. Despite the obvious decision to file individual claims, on December 2, 2010, appellant and nineteen other <em>Syija </em>plaintiffs executed a defiant approach to the Court\u2019s opinion and order, and filed a new complaint together as a class. On September 2, 2011, the Maryland U.S. District Court again issued an order, which included meticulous details for clear understanding, stating, \u201c(b) the claims of [pjlaintiff Judith Adedje are DISMISSED WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. The [mjotion is DENIED insofar as the Court declines to address limitations issues at this time; ... 3. Plaintiff Adedje shall have 20 DAYS to file an [ajmended [cjomplaint....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Although the Court afforded appellant the opportunity to continue with her action at the federal level, for reasons not apparent to us, she elected to file a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on September 30, 2011. As we previously denoted, the editor\u2019s note of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d) asserts that time should accrue at a federal district court\u2019s dismissal. Relating to the instant case, the Maryland U.S. District Court \u201cdismissed\u201d the action on November 2, 2010. Immediately after this, appellant could have filed a complaint in Montgomery County, and would have received a thirty day period pursuant to both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d) and Md. Rule 2-101(b), as the filing deadline, based on three years from her Westat employment\u2019s end date, would have been tolled. However, as indicated previously, appellant elected not to avail herself of the course of action set forth in the Court\u2019s order, and was neither persuaded nor deceived by appellees for equitable tolling to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Additionally, appellant\u2019s claims were not the same as the claim she opted-into, and therefore, appellees were not placed on notice. Furthermore, there were no persuasive authority or policy considerations that existed, as recognition of an equitable tolling and cross-jurisdictional class action tolling exception neither harmonized with the purpose of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d) nor Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-101. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s claim for overtime wages under Maryland\u2019s Wage Payment and Collection Law was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY ARE AFFIRMED.
