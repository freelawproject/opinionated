(\u201cBank of America\u201d) and the Attorney General of Maryland, Douglas Gansler (\u201cAttorney General\u201d), in his official capacity, alleging conversion and/or trespass to chattel, breach of contract, and a violation of the Expedited Funds Availability Act. Appellants further requested a declaratory judgment that appellees violated Md. Code (1974, 2013 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 ll-603(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [hereinafter Cts. &amp; Jud.

Did the trial court commit a legal error by finding that the seized accounts were \u201cavailable for withdrawal\u201d under the Expedited Funds Availability Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">For the reasons that follow, we answer all of the above-mentioned questions in the negative. We affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">On November 12, 2009, Citi Financial, Inc. (\u201cCiti Financial\u201d) obtained a judgment against Dorothy in the District Court of Maryland for Prince George\u2019s County (\u201cDistrict Court\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Citi Financial filed a request for a writ of garnishment, seeking garnishment of Dorothy\u2019s Bank of America accounts. On July 26, 2010, the District Court issued service of a writ of garnishment on Bank of America, which directed it \u201cto seize and hold all of Dorothy\u2019s property that was in the bank\u2019s possession.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On August 20, 2010, Bank of America filed a plea, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">1. Garnishee holds property in a checking account no. XXXXXXXX6220, savings account no. XXXXXXXX9379, savings account no. XXXXXXXX9382 and checking account no.

Pursuant to Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art., \u00a7 11-603, Garnishee is holding in said accounts the amounts of $241.87, $15.17, $10.01, and $900.00, respectively, pending further order of the [cjourt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">According to the Bank of America Deposit Agreement and Disclosures (\u201cDeposit Agreement\u201d), signature cards, and bank statements, Dorothy and Michael jointly owned three of the above-mentioned bank accounts, and in 2000 or 2001, pursuant to a power of attorney, Dorothy and Michael were authorized to use and withdraw funds from the remaining account, which belonged to Lavelle.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Thereafter, Dorothy filed a motion for release of garnished funds, prompting Citi Financial, Bank of America, and Dorothy to enter into an agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result, the District Court issued an order on September 14, 2010, which granted Dorothy\u2019s motion, stating (strike-outs omitted) (signatures omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-8\">Upon review and consideration of the Judgment Debtor\u2019s Motion for Release of all Garnished Funds, other than wages, any opposition thereto, and for good cause demonstrated, it is this 14[th] day of Sept.,_, 2010</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">ORDERED, that Judgment Debtor\u2019s Motion for Release of Garnished Funds other than wages be, and the same hereby is, GRANTED; by agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">ORDERED, that the garnishment directed to the Garnishee be, and the same hereby is, QUASHED; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-11\">ORDERED, that any monies being held by the Garnishee other than wages pursuant to the Garnishment in the name of the Judgment Debtor be released forthwith to the Judgment Debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>On July 26, 2011, appellants filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against appellees,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> alleging conversion and/or trespass to chattel, breach of contract, and a violation of the Expedited Funds Availability Act. Appellants contended that Bank of America did not release the funds, despite notification that the garnishment neither applied to the joint marital accounts nor Lavelle\u2019s account. On September 9, 2011, Bank of America filed its motion to dismiss. On September 26, 2011, appellants filed their opposition to Bank of America\u2019s motion, to which Bank of America filed a reply on October 14, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">On December 6, 2011, appellants filed an amended complaint, adding the Attorney General to the action. Appellants further requested a declaratory judgment that appellees violated Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art. \u00a7 ll-603(c), the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and Article 3, Section 43 of the Maryland Constitution. On December 27, 2011, Bank of America filed its motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On January 4, 2012, the Attorney General filed his motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, motion for summary judgment. On January 17 and January 23, 2012, appellants filed their respective oppositions to Bank of America\u2019s and the Attorney General\u2019s motions. On January 31, 2012, Bank of America filed a reply in support of its motion to dismiss and a response to the Attorney General\u2019s motion. Following a motions hearing, the court treated Bank of America\u2019s and the Attorney General\u2019s motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment. On May 24, 2012, the court issued a memorandum opinion, final declaratory judgment, and order, granting the motions for summary judgment and holding that Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art. \u00a7 ll-603(c) did not violate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, or Article 3, Section 43 of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The question of whether summary judgment under Maryland Rule 2-501 was properly granted is one of law, which we review <em>de novo </em>in order to determine whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>David A. Bramble, Inc. v. Thomas, </em>396 Md. 443, 453, 914 A.2d 136 (2007) (citing <em>Walk v. Hartford Cas., </em>382 Md. 1, 14, 852 A.2d 98 (2004); <em>Todd v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>373 Md. 149, 154, 816 A.2d 930 (2003); <em>Sadler v. Dimensions Healthcare Corp., </em>378 Md. 509, 533, 836 A.2d 655 (2003); <em>Southland Corp. v. Griffith, </em>332 Md. 704, 712, 633 A.2d 84 (1993)). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and ... the party [in whose favor judgment is entered] is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501(1). Upon any given statement of facts, or upon clear facts, the legal relation that existed between the parties must be decided by the court. <em>Whitehead v. Safway Steel Prods., Inc., </em>304 Md. 67, 73-74, 497 A.2d 803 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In reviewing the grant of summary judgment, \u201c \u2018we independently review the record to determine whether the parties properly generated a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Charles County Comm\u2019rs v. Johnson, </em>393 Md. 248, 263, 900 A.2d 753 (2006) (quoting <em>Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 203, 892 A.2d 520 (2006)). Our examination is limited to the same record and legal reasoning that the trial court analyzed to grant the motion for summary judgment. <em>D'Aoust v. Diamond, </em>424 Md. 549, 575, 36 A.3d 941 (2012) (citing <em>Messing v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>373 Md. 672, 684, 821 A.2d 22 (2003); <em>Anderson v. Council of Unit Owners of the Gables on Tuckerman, Condo., </em>404 Md. 560, 571, 948 A.2d 11 (2008)) (parenthetical phrase omitted); <em>see also River Walk Apartments, LLC v. Twigg, </em>396 Md. 527, 541-42, 914 A.2d 770 (2007) (quoting <em>Standard Fire Ins. Co. v. Berrett, </em>395 Md. 439, 451, 910 A.2d 1072 (2006)). \u201cSo long as the record reveals no genuine dispute of any material fact necessary to resolve the controversy as a matter of law, and it is shown that the movant is entitled to judgment, the entry of summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ment is proper.\u201d <em>Appiah v. Hall, </em>416 Md. 533, 547, 7 A.3d 536 (2010) (internal quotation omitted) <em>(O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 111, 854 A.2d 1191 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">I. Whether The Trial Court Provided Appellants A Reasonable Opportunity To Introduce Materials Pertinent To Whether Lavelle\u2019s Account Was A Joint Account.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Appellants allege that Bank of America first argued during the motions hearing that Lavelle\u2019s account was jointly owned. As a result, appellants maintain that the trial court did not provide them with a reasonable opportunity to submit material to counter Bank of America\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In <em>Worsham v. Ehrlich, et al., </em>181 Md.App. 711, 716, 957 A.2d 161 (2008), the defendants instigated pre-recorded telephone communications regarding political candidates. As a result, in November 2006, the plaintiff filed an action against three defendants, alleging violations of consumer protection laws that shielded consumers against unwanted telephone solicitations that encompassed commercial content. <em>Id. </em>at 715, 957 A.2d 161. In January 2007, the plaintiff submitted \u201ccall trace\u201d phone records and an affidavit when he added two defendants to the action and filed a motion for partial summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 716, 957 A.2d 161. Thereafter, a hearing was held because three defendants filed their respective motions to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 716-17, 957 A.2d 161. In May 2007, on the same day that the hearing occurred, another defendant (hereinafter \u201cfourth defendant\u201d) filed his motion to dismiss. Two weeks later, the plaintiff filed his response to the fourth defendant\u2019s motion, and in June 2007, the plaintiff requested a second hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 717, 957 A.2d 161. Several days later, the court granted the initial defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>In August 2007, the court denied the plaintiffs request for a second hearing, stating \u201can additional hearing on [the fourth defendant\u2019s] motion to dismiss ... would have been pointless as the court had already heard and considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>legal argument on [the plaintiffs] opposition to the motions to dismiss at the [initial] hearing....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 957 A.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff averred that the trial court erred because it did not grant his second request for a hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 715, 957 A.2d 161. Our Court examined Md. Rule 2-322(c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and acknowledged that the plaintiff \u201cattached extraneous material, i.e., the affidavit, to his motion for partial summary-judgment, and argued his position in support of that motion\u201d at the first hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 723, 957 A.2d 161. Hence, our Court affirmed, concluding that the plaintiff \u201chad a full and fair opportunity to present his arguments with respect to the law at the [first] motions hearing.... A second hearing would have been merely duplicative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731-32, 957 A.2d 161 (citing <em>Vinogradova v. Suntrust Bank, Inc., </em>162 Md.App. 495, 511, 875 A.2d 222 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In <em>Hrehorovich v. Harbor Hospital Center, Inc., et al., </em>93 Md.App. 772, 777-78, 614 A.2d 1021 (1992), the defendants-employers terminated the plaintiffs-employee\u2019s position as a hospital director when an advisory committee determined that the plaintiff was no longer competent in performing his duties. The plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendants, alleging several causes of action, including wrongful termination, and attached certain provisions of the hospital\u2019s bylaws and the employment manual. <em>Id. </em>at 778-79, 614 A.2d 1021. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, submitted other sections of the bylaws and manual, and maintained that neither established an employment contract. <em>Id. </em>at 779-80, 614 A.2d 1021. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion, but without a memorandum opinion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 778, 614 A.2d 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>On appeal, the plaintiff alleged that the court erred in treating the motion as one for summary judgment because the court did not provide him with sufficient notice that it would consider the defendant\u2019s supplementary materials. <em>Id. </em>at 785, 614 A.2d 1021. The plaintiff further maintained that if known, he would have contested the defendant\u2019s position with his \u201cevidence, testimony and documents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 785-86, 614 A.2d 1021 (internal quotations omitted). Our Court determined that the plaintiff was aware that the trial court could consider ancillary documents, <em>id. </em>at 786, 614 A.2d 1021, and that he failed to provide further information because he lacked such evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 788, 614 A.2d 1021. Accordingly, our Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 801, 614 A.2d 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">As stated previously in the instant case, the trial court converted Bank of America\u2019s and the Attorney General\u2019s motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment. Thus, Md. Rule 2-322(c) was triggered, and the trial court had to provide appellants with a \u201creasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by [Md.] Rule 2-501.\u201d Md. Rule 2-322(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">After appellants filed their initial complaint, Bank of America filed a motion to dismiss and a reply in support of its motion. In the reply, Bank of America explained that Lavelle\u2019s account had joint ownership because Michael and Dorothy were listed on the account. Additionally, in support of its contention, Bank of America stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">At the outset, [Bank of America] requests that the [c]ourt take judicial notice pursuant to [Md.] Rule 5-201(b)<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark> of: (1) the BOA<footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark> Deposit Agreement and Disclosures, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>is a standard agreement for 27 states, including Maryland, and the District of Columbia; (2) a statement on Lavelle O\u2019Brien\u2019s account showing the account ownership; (8) the Plea of Bank of America, N.A., Garnishee filed in the District Court ...; and (4) the Order of Court entered by the District Court.... These documents are attached to this [r]eply as [ejxhibits 1-4, respectively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">Specifically, the Deposit Agreement included a clause regarding \u201cJoint Accounts,\u201d which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">If more than one persons\u2019s name appears in the title of an account without a fiduciary, beneficiary or other designation, then the account is a joint account. All persons whose names appear on the account are co-owners of the account, regardless of whose money is deposited in the account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Bank of America further attached the signature card, which was signed when appellants and Dorothy applied for the bank account, as well as bank statements from Lavelle\u2019s account. The bank statements were attached with Bank of America\u2019s reply in support of the motion to strike the jury demand and its reply in support of the motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Moreover, in support of the Attorney General\u2019s motion to dismiss, or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment regarding joint ownership of Lavelle\u2019s account, he also attached the Bank of America Deposit Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Worsham, </em>but akin to the plaintiff in <em>Hrehorovieh, </em>appellants had notice regarding Bank of America\u2019s contention, but did not possess any documentation or materials to refute Bank of America\u2019s argument that Lavelle\u2019s account was jointly owned. We perceive that this explains why no exhibits were attached in explanation. As a result, appellants \u201cknew of the extraneous materials, had an opportunity to respond to them, and had not refuted their accuracy.\u201d <em>Hrehorovich, </em>93 Md.App. at 787, 614 A.2d 1021. Accordingly, the trial court complied with the requirements of Md. Rule 2-322(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>II. Whether The Trial Court Committed A Legal Error By Finding And Declaring That Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art. \u00a7 ll-603(c) Did Not Violate The Due Process Clause Of The U.S. Constitution Or Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration Of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">In <em>Tyler v. City of College Park, </em>415 Md. 475, 500-01, 3 A.3d 421 (2010), the Court of Appeals discussed the standard of review for determining whether statutes are unconstitutional due to a failure to afford a citizen his or her right to due process, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">In order to determine whether a given statute or ordinance satisfies the due process requirement ..., we ask rhetorically whether the legislative enactment, as an exercise of the legislature\u2019s police power, bears a real and substantial relation to the public health, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the State or municipality. <em>Westchester West No. 2 Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Montgomery County, </em>276 Md. 448, 454 [348 A.2d 856] (1975); <em>Bowie Inn, Inc. v. City of Bowie, </em>274 Md. 230, 236 [335 A.2d 679] (1975). In applying this test, courts perform a very limited function, resisting interference unless it is shown that the legislature exercised its police power arbitrarily, oppressively, or unreasonably. <em>Westchester West, </em>276 Md. at 460 [348 A.2d 856] ... (noting that \u201c[p]rice control, like any other form of regulation, is unconstitutional only if arbitrary, discriminatory, or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the legislature is free to adopt, and hence an unnecessary and unwarranted interference with individual liberty\u201d) (quoting <em>Nebbia v.

We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>noted that \u201c \u2018courts are under a special duty to respect the legislative judgment where the legislature is attempting to solve a serious problem in a manner which has not had an opportunity to prove its worth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bowie Inn, </em>274 Md. at 237 [335 A.2d 679].... As such, courts should hesitate before invalidating an ordinance where doing so would deprive the legislative body contemplating such a statute \u201c \u2018of any opportunity to discover whether the chosen method will be good, bad or indifferent in its results.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237-38 [335 A.2d 679]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In accordance with the abovementioned standard, we review Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. Art. \u00a7 ll-603(c)\u2019s legislative history and policy to determine whether the General Assembly exercised its power properly or arbitrarily, and whether the public\u2019s welfare was contemplated in enacting this statute, which relates to the garnishment of joint accounts. In <em>Maryland Nat. Bank v. Pearce, </em>329 Md. 602, 620-25, 620 A.2d 941 (1993) [hereinafter <em>\u201cPearce </em>\u201d], the Court of Appeals discussed the origin of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.

First, a garnishment against a joint bank account held by spouses is only valid if the account was in existence before the court entered a judgment regarding the garnishment. Therefore, if the creditor obtains a judgment against the debtor, and several months later, the debtor opens a joint bank account with his or her spouse, the court judgment does not \u201cattach.\u201d This differs from secured transactions regarding after-acquired property, as Md.Code (1975, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-204(a) of the Commercial Law Article provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a security agreement may create or provide for a security interest in after-acquired collateral.<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>lithe first condition is established, then the General Assembly has provided the garnishee, usually a financial institution, the discretion to reply to the writ of garnishment.

In the former, the garnishee could exercise its option to \u201cpay into the court from which the writ of garnishment ha[d] been issued.\u201d <em>See Pearce, </em>329 Md. at 624, 620 A.2d 941 (emphasis added).

This has been particularly true where an account is titled in the name of husband and wife. Some have questioned whether \u201chusband and wife\u201d accounts are considered \u201cjoint accounts\u201d for purposes of the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions.

Approximately ten years later, the creditor filed a request for a writ of garnishment regarding the debtor\u2019s bank account. <em>Id. </em>at 607, 620 A.2d 941. In response to the writ, the plaintiff-bank (\u201cbank\u201d) originally indicated that \u201cthe joint nature of th[e] [debtor\u2019s] account preclude[d] garnishment for the satisfaction of the judgment entered____\u201d <em>Id. </em>A year later, the bank filed an amended answer and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">It confesses that it holds assets of the [debtor] in an account owned by two (2) or more persons, one (1) or more of whom but fewer than all of whom, are judgment debtors. Garnishee is holding assets consisting of money market account no. 0960126100 with a balance of $8,636.45, pending further order of the [c]ourt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-9\"><em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Following a trial, the court concluded that although the bank account was jointly owned, the debtor\u2019s account could be garnished to satisfy the creditor\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 608, 620 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>A.2d 941. The court found in favor of the creditor, and against the bank for approximately $34,000. <em>Id. </em>The bank appealed to our Court, but the Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari </em>before we heard the action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">On appeal, the bank argued that the trial court erred in its findings because the debtor and his wife\u2019s account was jointly owned by the spouses in trust, and thereby, no judgments could attach to the account. <em>Id. </em>at 608-09, 620 A.2d 941. After researching the legislative history of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 ll-603(b), the Court determined that the jointly owned account was \u201cproperty held in trust,\u201d and because only one spouse was a debtor, the judgment was void. <em>Id. </em>at 626, 620 A.2d 941. Accordingly, the Court reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\"><em>Pearce </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because the <em>Pearce </em>plaintiffs possessed property that was held in trust. As previously indicated, a garnishment is only lawful against trust accounts if both holders are the debtors. If not, the General Assembly has provided an exemption, indicating that the garnishment is then invalid. In the case at bar, appellants\u2019 accounts were not opened at Bank of America to be held in trust by each other. While the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland has considered adequate notice to judgment debtors, <em>see Reigh v. Schleigh, 595 </em>F.Supp. 1535 (D.Md.1984), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>784 F.2d 1191 (4th Cir.1986) (determining whether creditors should provide judgment debtors of garnishment proceedings adequate notice regarding potential exemptions), beyond <em>Pearce, </em>we have not found any Maryland cases concerning garnishment of joint bank accounts pertaining to non-debtors. While the issue is one of first impression in Maryland, other jurisdictions have considered the issue. Hence, we analyze their statutes and case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">In <em>Savig v. First Nat. Bank of Omaha, </em>781 N.W.2d 335, 336 (Minn.2010), the Minnesota Courts were \u201crequire[d][ ] to answer certified questions of law concerning the interplay between Minnesota\u2019s garnishment statutes ... and Minnesota\u2019s Multiparty Accounts Act----\u201d In <em>Savig, </em>the trial court en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tered a judgment of approximately $8,100 in favor of the defendant, First National Bank (\u201cFirst National\u201d), and against the plaintiff-debtor and her former husband for defaulting on their credit card payments. <em>Id. </em>at 336-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The plaintiff later remarried, and thereafter, First National requested a writ of garnishment to be served on the plaintiffs bank, Midwest Bank (\u201cMidwest\u201d), which was granted. <em>Id. </em>at 337. Pursuant to Minnesota laws, Midwest answered the writ and indicated that it possessed two of the plaintiffs accounts, which she shared with her second husband (\u201chusband\u201d). <em>Id. </em>Midwest held the funds, and neither the plaintiff nor her husband \u201cclaim[ed] any exemptions, did not request a hearing, and [the husband] did not intervene to claim any interest in the funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff and her husband filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota (\u201cMinnesota District Court\u201d) against First National, alleging a violation of due process, <em>id., </em>and that Midwest unlawfully garnished the husband\u2019s funds. <em>See id. </em>at 338. First National then filed a motion for summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>Because this was a case of first impression, the Minnesota District Court stayed the action until the Minnesota Supreme Court resolved three specific questions relating to the garnishment statutes and joint accounts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cdue process\u201d argument, the Minnesota Supreme Court considered the issue in an effort to guide the Minnesota District Court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">The [plaintiffs] cite no authority for the proposition that post-judgment garnishment proceedings that allow a garnishee to initially retain funds belonging to a non-debtor joint account holder violate the non-debtor\u2019s due process rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">... [Although [the husband] did not receive a garnishment summons with his name on it, his affidavit makes clear that he was well aware of the garnishment proceeding because of the notice that was sent to [his wife]. [The husband\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>actual notice of the garnishment proceeding is further evidenced by the fact that after Midwest Bank initially retained the funds in the joint account on January 2, 2009, to complain to the law firm that they had seized his funds in the joint account. In spite of the formal notice to [the wife] and [the husband\u2019s] actual notice, [the plaintiffs] did not object to the garnishment in the manner provided in the garnishment statutes; they did not notify Midwest Bank or First National that they had objections ... nor did they request a hearing ... nor did [the husband] seek to intervene .... Instead, approximately 18 days after Midwest Bank had retained the funds in the account on January 2, 2009, the [plaintiffs] filed a complaint on January 20, 2009, in federal district court against First National and [its collective agency].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 348, n. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">After considering the principal questions, the Minnesota Supreme Court concluded that \u201ca judgment creditor may serve a garnishment summons on a garnishee, attaching funds in a joint account to satisfy the debt of an account holder, even though not all of the account holders [were] judgment debtors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341. The Court further stated that \u201caccount holders [ ] [bore] the burden of establishing net contributions to the [joint] account during the garnishment proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Lastly, the Court determined that \u201ca judgment debtor [was] initially, but rebuttably, presumed to own all of the funds in a joint account, and if the presumption [was] not rebutted, all of the funds in a joint account [were] subject to garnishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348 (footnote omitted). Predicated on these determinations, the Minnesota District Court determined that there was no violation of due process, and granted First National\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In <em>Ingram v. Hocking Valley Bank et al., </em>125 Ohio App.3d 210, 708 N.E.2d 232, 233 (1997), the Ohio Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>determined whether \u201c[t]he trial court erred in holding that the bank was not responsible to notify [the plaintiff] of [a] garnishment.\u201d In <em>Ingram, </em>the defendant-hospital obtained a judgment against the plaintiffs wife (\u201cwife\u201d), and requested a writ to turnover funds. <em>Id. </em>at 234. The wife\u2019s bank, Hocking Valley Bank (\u201cHocking Valley\u201d), indicated that the wife owned two accounts that she shared with the plaintiff-husband. <em>Id. </em>at 233. Pursuant to the writ, Hocking Valley froze the accounts. <em>See id. </em>at 234. The plaintiff filed an action, averring that Hocking Valley should have notified him concerning the garnishment. <em>Id. </em>at 241. Thereafter, Hocking Valley filed a motion for summary judgment, maintaining that \u201cbecause [the plaintiff] and his wife signed consumer account agreements which authorized either party to withdraw money from the joint accounts, both [the plaintiff] and his wife had a present possessory interest in the entire accounts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235. The trial court granted Hocking Valley\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">On appeal, the Ohio Court of Appeals analyzed its statute, which provided that, \u201cnotice must be given to the judgment debtor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241. The Court noted that the statute did not indicate that a bank must or may provide the non-debtor notification of the garnishment. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the Court stated that the plaintiff did not support his contentions with Ohio case law. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court determined that the trial court did not err in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In <em>Fleet Bank Connecticut, N.A. v. Carillo, </em>240 Conn. 343, 691 A.2d 1068, 1069 (1997), a trial court issued a monetary judgment for approximately $58,000 against the defendant\u2019s husband (\u201chusband\u201d). The company assigned the judgment to the plaintiff, who requested that the husband\u2019s bank, Collins-ville Savings Bank (\u201cCollinsville Savings\u201d), release the husband\u2019s monetary property. <em>Id. </em>However, because the husband had a joint bank account with the defendant-wife, Collinsville Savings did not comply. <em>Id. </em>When the plaintiff filed a motion for a turnover order, the defendant contested the motion, averring that she was a non-debtor and that \u201cher co-ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>of the account shielded [the] proceeds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Despite the defendant\u2019s arguments, the trial court granted the plaintiffs motion because the co-ownership \u201cgave the plaintiff, as his creditor, a coextensive right to execute against the account funds in their entirety.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">On appeal, the defendant maintained that akin to a joint tenancy in real property, because a garnishment attached to her joint account, it then reduced to a \u201ctenancy in common\u201d account. <em>Id. </em>at 1070.

Superior Court In and For Maricopa County, </em>144 Ariz. 297, 697 P.2d 690, 691 (1985), the plaintiff-company filed an action against the defendant-trial court when it denied its motion for judgment. The plaintiff obtained a judgment against the debtor-wife (\u201cdebtor\u201d) for approximately $340.00. <em>Id. </em>at 692. The plaintiff requested a writ of garnishment to be issued to the debtor\u2019s bank, Valley National Bank (\u201cValley National\u201d). <em>Id. </em>Valley National indicated that the debtor owned an account that she shared with her husband (\u201chusband\u201d). <em>Id. </em>To \u201cjoin all persons who appeared] to have an interest in the bank account ...,\u201d the plaintiff attempted to deliver notification to the husband. <em>Id. </em>However, it could not, so it provided service by publication. <em>Id. </em>The trial court determined that \u201c \u2018service by publication [was] insufficient to give [the husband] notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694.

Modderman, </em>37 Mich.App. 639, 195 N.W.2d 342, 342-43 (1972), the plaintiff, American National Bank &amp; Trust Company (\u201cAmerican National\u201d), filed a complaint regarding a promissory note against the defendant-husband. The plaintiff requested the trial court to issue a writ of garnishment to the defendant\u2019s bank, First National Bank and Trust Company (\u201cFirst National\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 343. Thereafter, the defendant\u2019s wife (\u201cwife\u201d) averred that the First National accounts were jointly owned, and thereby, they were exempt from garnishment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The trial court held a hearing, and found that although the wife testified regarding her major contributions to the accounts, the defendant only \u201casserted ownership of the accounts in controversy when it was to his advantage to do so[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344. Hence, the court ordered that the accounts be garnished. <em>Id. </em>at 343. On appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals stated that the trial court properly used its discretion in determining whether the defendant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s testimonies were credible. Accordingly, the Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We also examine federal cases that have ruled on a similar issue. In <em>Lind v. Midland Funding, L.L.C., </em>688 F.3d 402, 404 (8th Cir.2012), Bank of America obtained a judgment in the amount of approximately $11,500 against the plaintiff-debtor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Bank of America assigned the judgment to the defendant-corporation, who requested a writ of garnishment to be served upon First National Bank (\u201cFirst National\u201d). <em>Id. </em>First National answered the writ and indicted that the plaintiffs assets were located in two bank accounts, a savings account and a joint account that the plaintiff shared with the plaintiff-wife (\u201cwife\u201d). <em>Id. </em>First National notified the plaintiff of its responsibility pursuant to the \u201cgarnishment\u201d laws, but did not send notice to the wife. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the plaintiffs obtained legal assistance concerning the writ. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The plaintiffs filed an exemption action regarding the joint account, and all the parties proceeded to settlement. <em>Id. </em>at 404-05. Mediation was unsuccessful, so the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Minnesota District Court. <em>Id. </em>at 405. The plaintiffs alleged that the garnishment statutes violated the wife\u2019s due process rights, and were thereby unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 405. The Minnesota District Court held that the wife \u201chad received constitutionally sufficient notice and an opportunity for a hearing, and noting also that the [plaintiff and his wife] failed to allege any state action, as required by their due process claims.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">On appeal, the Eighth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">The attachment in this case occurred after the defendant ] had already secured a judgment on [the plaintiffs] debt. Courts have noted that, when balancing the due process interests of a creditor and a debtor, the creditor\u2019s interest should be accorded more weight in a postjudgment context than it should be accorded in a prejudgment attachment. <em>See Reigh v. Schleigh, </em>784 F.2d 1191, 1198 (4th Cir.1986) (noting that \u201cit is important to emphasize\u201d the difference between prejudgment and postjudgment attachment, and that in the case of prejudgment attachment, \u201ca party would be expected to enjoy greater rights than one who has already been adjudged judicially liable\u201d) (additional citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 407. The Eighth Circuit determined that although the defendant only sent notice to the plaintiff, the wife still had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u201cactual notice,\u201d as evidenced that she sought legal advice along with her husband. <em>Id. </em>at 409. Additionally, the wife had \u201can opportunity for a postdeprivation hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Eighth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the Minnesota garnishment laws did not violate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In the case at bar, appellants aver that \u201cby directing financial institutions to seize jointly owned accounts before giving the non-debtor owners notice and an opportunity for [a] hearing,\u201d their due process was violated. Appellants support their contentions with <em>Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972). In <em>Fuentes, </em>deputy sheriffs seized the plaintiffs\u2019 properties, including kitchen appliances, electronics, furniture, clothing, and children\u2019s toys, before the plaintiffs \u201chad even received a summons to answer [the] complaint[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70-72, 92 S.Ct. 1983. The U.S. Supreme Court examined Florida\u2019s and Pennsylvania\u2019s prejudgment replevin provisions regarding the lack of due process. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 92 S.Ct. 1983.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">Both statutes provide[d] for the issuance of writs ordering state agents to seize a person\u2019s possessions, simply upon the ex parte application of any other person who claim[ed] a right to them and post[ed] a security bond. Neither statute provide[d] for notice to be given to the possessor of the property, and neither statute [gave] the possessor an opportunity to challenge the seizure at any kind of prior hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\"><em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the statutes were unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 92 S.Ct. 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Appellants\u2019 support is misplaced because <em>Fuentes </em>differs from the instant case. <em>Fuentes </em>involves (1) prejudgment deprivation, (2) tangible personal property, and (3) state agents. The case at bar concerns postjudgment deprivation of intangible personal property. Citi Financial obtained a judgment against Dorothy in the District Court. Thereafter, Citi Financial filed a request for a writ of garnishment, seeking garnishment of Dorothy\u2019s Bank of America accounts, and the District Court issued service on Bank of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Appellants acknowledge that to establish a violation of the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution, \u201cthe person initiating the seizure [must be] a government official.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 92 S.Ct. 1983. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals has traditionally held that (\u201c[i]t is a basic tenet, expressed in Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, that a plaintiff injured by unconstitutional state action should have a remedy to redress the wrong.\u201d[ ]). <em>Jackson v. Dackman Co., </em>422 Md. 357, 377, 30 A.3d 854 (2011) (internal quotations omitted) (additional citations omitted) (emphasis added). <em>See also Jackson v. Dackman Co., </em>181 Md.App. 546, 566, 956 A.2d 861 (2008), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>422 Md. 357, 30 A.3d 854 (2011) (\u201cThe \u2018law of the land\u2019 in Article 19 is the same due process of law required by the [Fourteenth [A]mendment.\u201d) (additional citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Appellants had the burden of proving that Bank of America was a state actor by demonstrating that its conduct was \u201cfairly attributable\u201d to the state. <em>See Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). Appellants argue that Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. \u00a7 ll-603(c) required Bank of America to hold the garnished funds, and because it complied, its actions were clearly chargeable to the state and constituted state action. If we agree with appellants\u2019 contentions, then any person or institution that abides by a statute or ordinance are automatically \u201cstate actors.\u201d We believe that this train of thought is detrimental to our justice system, as persons and institutions may become reluctant to act in accordance with the law. Unlike in <em>Fuentes, </em>which involved sheriffs, Bank of America was not a state actor because it did not act on behalf of the state. Furthermore, because Bank of America was complying with judicial process, there was no wrongdoing on its part that would create a remedy for an injury to appellants\u2019 property pursuant to Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">When appellants applied and were accepted for an account, Bank of America provided them with a Deposit Agreement, which provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Legal Process\u2014Subpoena and Levy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\">\u201cLegal process\u201d includes a writ of attachment, execution, garnishment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">We may accept and comply with legal process: served in person, by mail, by facsimile transmission, or by other means; or served at locations other than the location where the account, property or records are held.

We do not send a notice if we believe the law prohibits us from doing so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">We may hold and turn over funds or other property to the court or creditor as directed by the legal process, subject to our right of setoff and any security interest we have in the funds or other property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">If the legal process requests information about one or more, but not all, account owners or signers, we may release information about all co-owners or signers on the account, even though some of the other co-owners or signers are not covered by the legal process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">We have no liability to you if we accept and comply with legal process as provided in this section or by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Although Bank of America may not have provided post-judgment deprivation notification by the means of personal service or service by publication, appellants did have actual notice of the procedure and logistics regarding Bank of America\u2019s compliance with a writ of garnishment by the means of the Deposit Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">We surmise that the General Assembly examined and balanced a citizen\u2019s due process rights with a creditor\u2019s interest. This is evidenced in the change in language of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 ll-603(c). Instead of providing the financial institutions with the option of removing and/or transferring the debtor\u2019s monetary property to the court, the General Assem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>bly decided to maintain the assets in the account until the court entered an order, or there was finality concerning the garnishment proceeding. This change assisted in ensuring that a \u201chold\u201d \u00f3r \u201cfreeze\u201d of an account was not a complete deprivation, but a minor inconvenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Furthermore, as stated by the Eighth Circuit, \u201cpostponing notice and hearing until attachment has occurred[,] generally serves a creditor\u2019s interest in preventing the waste or concealment of a debtor\u2019s assets.\u201d <em>Lind, </em>688 F.3d at 407-08 (citing <em>Mitchell v. W.T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 608-09, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974); <em>Brown v. Liberty Loan Corp. of Duval, </em>539 F.2d 1355, 1367 (1976)). We agree with the Eighth Circuit, as we perceive that once spouses, family members, and/or significant others are pre-notified of the possibility of an attachment, they would remove not only their monetary property, but possibly the debtor\u2019s assets as well. This type of conveyance, in an attempt to defraud the debtor\u2019s creditors, is not uncommon as it occurs quite often in family law cases, specifically those involving alimony and child support issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The General Assembly did not exercise its police power arbitrarily, but presented a thoughtful enactment of the garnishment statute. As a result, the writ of garnishment was valid and Bank of America properly complied. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not commit a legal error by finding and declaring that Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 11\u2014603(c) did not violate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution or Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">III. Whether The Trial Court Committed A Legal Error By Finding And Declaring That Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Art. \u00a7 ll-603(c) Did Not Violate Article 3, Section 43 Of The Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Appellants maintain that Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 11-603(c) violates Article 3, Section 43 of the Maryland Constitution, which reads, \u201c[t]he property of the wife shall be protected from the debts of her husband\u201d because it permits the seizure of bank accounts that are held in a tenancy by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>entirety. This type of concurrent ownership interest is described as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">The common-law incidents of estates by the entireties are that the tenants can only be and must be husband and wife; that each spouse is seized of the entire property (which can be real or personal); that each spouse is entitled to the income derived from the property and cannot encumber or dispose of it without the other spouse\u2019s consent; and, upon the death of one spouse, the other takes the whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVQN\"><em>Cruickshank-Wallace v. County Banking and Trust Co., </em>165 Md.App. 300, 311, 885 A.2d 403 (2005) (citing <em>Arbesman v. Winer, </em>298 Md. 282, 288-90, 468 A.2d 633 (1983); <em>State v. Friedman, </em>283 Md. 701, 705-06, 393 A.2d 1356 (1978)). Thereby, a creditor cannot offer a claim on property subject to a tenancy by the entirety. <em>Id. </em>at 312, 885 A.2d 403 (additional citations omitted). A tenancy by the entirety and a joint tenancy are generally the same, except the joint tenancy does not require marriage. <em>Id. </em>Both tenancies enjoy a \u201cright of survivorship,\u201d which means that when a co-owner dies, the remainder interest passes to the surviving owners. <em>Cooper v. Bikle, </em>334 Md. 608, 621-22, 640 A.2d 1120 (1994) (citing Roger A. Cunningham et al., <em>The Law of Property </em>\u00a7 5.3, at 202 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In <em>Diamond v. Diamond, </em>298 Md. 24, 32, 467 A.2d 510 (1983), the Court of Appeals determined whether the plaintiffs, a husband and wife, intended to establish a tenancy by the entirety regarding a settlement check. In <em>Diamond, </em>the trial court entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against a trucking business for approximately $30,000. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27, 467 A.2d 510. As a result, the business\u2019s insurance company issued a settlement check. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 467 A.2d 510. During the interim, and in a separate action, the husband\u2019s former wife obtained a judgment against the husband for approximately $29,000. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 467 A.2d 510. The trial court held a hearing because the husband\u2019s assets were insufficient in paying the former wife\u2019s judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 467 A.2d 510. During a hearing, the plaintiffs alleged that the settlement check constituted property held in tenancy by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>entireties, but the trial court disagreed, and ordered that the unpaid balance be subtracted from the settlement check. <em>Id. </em>Our Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment, and the Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The plaintiffs averred that because the settlement check concerned their lawsuit against the trucking company for personal injuries and loss of consortium, then it received protection pursuant to the rule regarding tenancy by the entireties. <em>Id. </em>at 28, 467 A.2d 510. Predicated on a similar case, the Court determined that the plaintiffs lacked the intent to create a tenancy by the entirety, and affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 32, 467 A.2d 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In <em>Baker v. Baker, </em>123 Md. 32, 36-37, 90 A. 776 (1914), the plaintiffs-children filed a complaint against the defendant-mother to enjoin her from using bank account funds to assist their sister in purchasing ten acres of land. Several years prior, the plaintiffs\u2019 father (\u201cfather\u201d), who was the defendant\u2019s husband, deposited money into a savings account. <em>Id. </em>at 34, 90 A. 776. \u201c[H]e wanted it deposited so that if he should die before his wife[,] the money would be hers, and that if she should die first[,] it would belong to him, and the deposit was entered in the books of the bank, and the deposit book given him, to the credit of Mr. and Mrs. George Baker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). A few years later, the father withdrew the money, then redeposited it. <em>Id. </em>This time, he amended the book entries, denoting a division of the funds amongst his children, grandchildren, and kinship, stating \u201cMr. and Mrs. George Baker, payable at our death to above children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34-35, 90 A. 776. After the father died, the defendant attempted to assist one of her children in purchasing land, but the plaintiffs filed a complaint to enjoin her. <em>Id. </em>at 36-37, 90 A. 776. The trial court ruled that upon the father\u2019s death, the defendant had sole ownership in the account because the father\u2019s redeposit was invalid because the defendant had no knowledge of the amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 37-38, 90 A. 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>On appeal, the Court of Appeals determined that despite the lack of \u201ctenancy by the entireties\u201d or \u201cright of survivorship\u201d language, the initial deposit still created a tenancy by the entirety. <em>Id. </em>at 40, 90 A. 776. However, upon the defendant\u2019s death, the Court noted that although \u201cthe words \u201cin trust\u201d were not employed, [] the intention to create a trust [was] clearly shown by the evidence in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 90 A. 776. Ultimately, the Court affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 43, 90 A. 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We do acknowledge that in <em>Diamond, </em>298 Md. at 32, 467 A.2d 510, the Court of Appeals did indicate that courts could presume that the intent to create a tenancy by the entirety may have existed by establishing a bank account. Traditionally, specific language has been utilized in the deposit agreements and/or the signature cards for this to occur. <em>See Leeds Fed. Sav. and Loan Ass\u2019n v. Metcalf, </em>332 Md. 107, 111, 630 A.2d 245 (1993) (stating, \u201capplication is hereby made for a savings deposit account in the LEEDS FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION, BALTIMORE, MD. in the names of the persons whose signatures ... shown on this card, as joint tenants, with the right of survivorship ....\u201d) (capitalization in original) (emphasis added); <em>Hartlove v.

Suburban Trust Co., </em>247 Md. 461, 463-64, 231 A.2d 678 (1967) (The signature cards and agreement indicated that \u201call sums not on deposit or hereafter deposited by either ... with said bank ... shall be owned by them jointly and severally with the right of survivorship ....\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>In the case at bar, the Deposit Agreement stated that, \u201c[a]ll joint accounts are presumed to be joint accounts with the right of survivorship ....\u201d (emphasis added). No language in the \u201caccount ownership\u201d section of the Deposit Agreement mentioned tenancy by the entireties or \u201chusband and wife.\u201d As indicated by <em>Baker, </em>a court could presume that a tenancy by the entirety was created. <em>See Kolker v. Gorn, </em>193 Md. 391, 396-97, 67 A.2d 258 (1949) (stating, \u201c[tjhere can be no doubt that in Maryland, a conveyance to husband and wife, without restrictive or qualifying words, creates a tenancy by the entirely]\u201d) (additional citation omitted). However, we agree with the Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Fleet Bank, </em>691 A.2d at 1073, indicating that courts must tread lightly when applying the laws of property to the rules of joint accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">As of June 19, 2010, Bank of America used its standard Deposit Agreement in twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia. If Maryland courts were to presume that the Deposit Agreement\u2019s language created a tenancy by the entirety, the General Assembly\u2019s goal when it enacted Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 ll-603(c) would be totally undermined. As previously denoted, in 1991, when the General Assembly was amending the statute, financial institutions pondered whether accounts that spouses shared were protected pursuant to any \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision. SENATE JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS COMMITTEE, FLOOR REPORT, SB 469, 1991 General Assembly (1991 Md.). Additionally, the financial institutions were concerned about any protection because they, at the time of garnishment, might not have knowledge of whether the account holders were husband and wife. <em>Id. </em>As a result, perceiving countless issues regarding enacting a safe harbor provision, the General Assembly decided to permit the financial institutions to maintain the assets in the bank account as opposed to placing them into the court. S.B. 469, 401st Gen. Assem., Reg. Sess. (Md.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Accordingly, we determine that the General Assembly provided a thoughtful solution to the institutions\u2019 concerns, and we refrain from interfering to conclude that Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u00a7 ll-603(e) violates Article 3, Section 43 of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">IV.

Proc. Art. \u00a7 11\u2014603(c), stating that they concurred with the trial court that the Expedited Funds Availability Act \u201cpermits a bank to hold a customer\u2019s funds if they are being held to satisfy that customer\u2019s obligations,\u201d however, the court erred because Lavelle\u2019s account was not jointly owned and Dorothy and Michael\u2019s accounts were marital property. As we previously indicated, Bank of America properly complied with the law in holding appellants\u2019 accounts were jointly owned and was not protected by a \u201cmarital property\u201d exception. Furthermore, as the trial court indicated, \u201c[a] bank does not violate its obligations under [12 U.S.C. \u00a7 4002] by holding funds to satisfy a garnishment, tax levy, or court order restricting disbursements from the account....\u201d 12 C.F.R. Part 229, Appendix E (commentary on \u00a7 229.2(d)). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding and declaring that Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.
