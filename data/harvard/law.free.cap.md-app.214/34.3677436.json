I can assure them that it is much more serious than that.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This defamation case comes not from the professional ranks, but from the Rockville Football League (the \u201cLeague\u201d), which suspended coach (now appellant) Scott Shirley after a parent complained to the League\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) about his conduct toward an official during a youth football game. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Shirley appealed his suspension to the Board, as the League\u2019s written rules allowed, and lost. He then filed suit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, alleging, among other things, that League President Eric Heckman (and thus the League as well) defamed him when Mr. Heckman sent notice of Mr. Shirley\u2019s suspension to the Board and a small group of relevant League-affiliated people and when Mr. Heckman recounted the allegations underlying the suspension during the appeal hearing. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Mr. Heckman and the League. After review, the ruling on the field stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Mr. Shirley began as a coach in the League in 2000 and continued for nearly ten seasons, albeit with some volatility and controversy along the way. During the 2009 season, he coached the Pony League Wolverines to the brink of the League\u2019s \u201cSuper Bowl.\u201d But after the Wolverines\u2019 playoff game on November 15, 2009, Maura Fitzgerald, a parent and a member of the Board, lodged a complaint with the Board about an altercation she claimed she witnessed between Mr. Shirley and a volunteer play monitor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ms. Fitzgerald, who was standing several feet back from the Wolverine sideline, said that she saw and heard Mr. Shirley and a fellow coach verbally abuse the play monitor in close proximity to the children during the third quarter of that game. According to Ms. Fitzgerald, one of the coaches threw a clipboard at the ground and Mr. Shirley used a curse word.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>At its next regular weekly meeting, held on November 18, 2009, the Board addressed Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s complaint. Ms. Fitzgerald attended and described what she saw at the game, and League Commissioner Craig Brodsky, who also witnessed the incident, commented on what he saw and heard as well. Mr. Heckman also recounted a series of prior reports of Mr. Shirley\u2019s misbehavior during his League coaching career. Mr. Shirley was not invited or, at that point, informed that the complaint was on the Board\u2019s agenda. After hearing the evidence and discussing the matter, the Board voted to suspend Mr. Shirley from coaching indefinitely.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">That evening, Mr. Shirley was notified of his suspension via e-mail (the \u201cNotification\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Notification informed Mr. Shirley that after the playoff game, <em>\u201c[i 'll was reported </em>that [he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>was] verbally abusive, used foul language and acted aggressively towards a volunteer play monitor\u201d (emphasis added), and that he was being suspended from \u201cparticipation in any games or practices in any manner whatsoever.\u201d The Notification also advised him of his right under the League\u2019s rules to appeal the suspension within seventy-two hours, which he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Because the Wolverines were scheduled to play in the League\u2019s \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d the following weekend, the Board granted Mr. Shirley an expedited appeal hearing on the evening of Friday, November 20 (the \u201cSuspension Hearing\u201d). As League rules provide, the hearing was open; only Board members were invited, but a few parents and coaches attended as well (all attendees were affiliated one way or another with the League). At the Suspension Hearing, Mr. Heckman again described Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s allegations. Mr. Shirley was allotted fifteen minutes to respond. He called two witnesses, Coaches Rick Silver and Brandt Mensch, and read a statement from Coach James Wilson, all of whom testified that Mr. Shirley did not engage in inappropriate conduct during the playoff game. Mr. Heckman then related a series of incidents involving Mr. Shirley that were reported to him by other Board members or spectators between 2002 and 2009, including: a co-coach disassociating himself from a team he coached with Mr. Shirley; an ongoing dispute with a parent involving repeated phone calls by both parties and a call from Mr. Shirley to the parent\u2019s employer requesting that the parent be terminated for using company resources for personal business; an on-field verbal fight with a cheerleading coach; a verbal assault on a high school-aged referee during a flag football game; ejection from a pee-wee football game for foul language; repeated missed games and practices; and multiple instances of verbal abuse in the view of children. Mr. Shirley was given five additional minutes to respond and did so. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board upheld the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Mr. Shirley then filed suit against Mr. Heckman and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>League (collectively, the appellees).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He initially asserted counts of misrepresentation, violation of due process, breach of contract, and defamation against the appellees and the City of Rockville. On April 12, 2011, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the City and dismissed the case against the appellees for insufficient service. Mr. Shirley filed an amended complaint asserting the same four counts, this time only against the appellees. In October 2011, the circuit court dismissed Mr. Shirley\u2019s claims for misrepresentation, violation of due process, and breach of contract, leaving only the defamation claim. The defamation claim focused on two publications\u2014Mr. Heckman\u2019s statements in the Notification and Mr. Heckman\u2019s statements at the Suspension Hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The appellees moved for summary judgment on Mr. Shirley\u2019s remaining defamation claim. After a hearing, the circuit court found no genuine disputes of material fact and that the appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law <em>\u201cby virtue of asserting the privilege of common interest or qualified privilege.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The circuit court found that the common interest privilege raised a question of law, that the privilege applied, and that Mr. Shirley failed to demonstrate that Mr. Heckman or the League had abused the privilege. The court relied on <em>Piscatelli v. Smith, </em>424 Md. 294, 35 A.3d 1140 (2012), and specifically its holding that an abuse of privilege required a showing of malice and defining malice as \u201ca person\u2019s actual knowledge that his or her statement is false, coupled with his or her intent to deceive another by means of that statement.\u201d And in granting the motion, the court concluded that it had \u201cnot heard any argument or any evidence anticipated to be presented at trial or that has been discovered to this point to indicate at all that there was any intent to deceive another by means of the statement,\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201c[tjhere is simply nothing that [Mr. Shirley] has argued ... that in any way indicates that there was actual knowledge that any of these statements were false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Mr. Shirley filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment that the circuit court denied. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Although Mr. Shirley raises two issues in his brief,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the appeal as postured really only raises one: whether the circuit court erred in deciding on summary judgment that Mr. Heck-man and the League did not abuse the conditional common interest privilege. Mr. Shirley\u2019s brief doesn\u2019t appear to challenge the appellees\u2019 contention (or the circuit court\u2019s holding) that the statements at issue are protected by the common interest privilege, and his counsel conceded the point at oral argument. With the privilege in place, we need not, and do not, address whether the statements were defamatory\u2014we assume for present purposes that they were. <em>Piscatelli, </em>424 Md. at 306-07, 35 A.3d 1140. In reviewing the circuit court\u2019s finding that the appellees did not abuse the privilege, we review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and construe all reasonable factual inferences in favor of Mr. Shirley. <em>Id. </em>at 305, 35 A.3d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">There are absolute privileges to defamation, but the common interest privilege is not one of them. The common interest privilege is one of the four qualified or conditional privileges to defamation<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that \u201cis conditioned upon the absence of malice and is forfeited if it is abused.\u201d <em>Piscatelli, </em>424 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Md. at 307, 35 A.3d 1140 (citations and quotation marks omitted). As we analyze whether the League or Mr. Heck-man abused the privilege, we start with the purpose of the privilege and the scope of the communications it is designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The common interest privilege shields a speaker against liability for defamation arising from statements \u201cpublish[ed] to someone who shares a common interest or, relatedly, published] in defense of oneself or in the interest of others.\u201d Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 413, at 1158 (2000). The privilege recognizes the broader public value in \u201cpromoting] free exchange of relevant information among those engaged in a common enterprise or activity and to permit them to make appropriate internal communications and share consultations without fear of suit.\u201d <em>Gohari v. Darvish, </em>363 Md. 42, 58, 767 A.2d 321 (2001) (quoting Dobbs, \u00a7 414, at 1160-61). A common interest may be \u201cfound among members of identifiable groups in which members share similar goals or values or cooperate in a single endeavor,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting Dobbs, \u00a7 414, at 1160-61), and when \u201cthe circumstances are such as to lead any one of several persons having a common interest in a particular subject matter correctly or reasonably to believe that facts exist which another sharing such common interest is entitled to know,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 57, 767 A.2d 321 (quoting <em>Hanrahan v. Kelly, </em>269 Md. 21, 28, 305 A.2d 151 (1973)). There is no rigid definition of \u201ccommon interest,\u201d but the principle that emerges from the cases in which the privilege has applied\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>that it covers speakers and recipients within a readily definable business or organizational relationship<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\u2014easily en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>compasses the common interest that Messrs. Shirley and Heckman, the members of the Board, and League participants share in the League and its orderly (written) and hearing processes, even if Mr. Shirley had not conceded the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Once the privilege is found or conceded to apply, the burden shifts to Mr. Shirley to prove that the appellees breached the condition to (or, interchangeably, abused) the conditional privilege. <em>See Piscatelli, </em>424 Md. at 307, 35 A.3d 1140. Mr. Shirley can meet this burden by \u201cdemonstrating that \u2018the publication is made for a purpose other than to further the social interest entitled to protection ... or [by proving] malice on the part of the publisher.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gohari, </em>363 Md. at 64, 767 A.2d 321 (quoting <em>McDermott v. Hughley, </em>317 Md. 12, 29, 561 A.2d 1038 (1989)). Abuse of a conditional privilege is usually a question for the fact-finder, <em>id., </em>but a court can decide the question as a matter of law if the plaintiff fails to allege or prove facts that would support a finding of abuse. <em>See Piscatelli, </em>424 Md. at 308, 35 A.3d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Mr. Shirley argues that the appellees defamed him through two sets of statements, both published by Mr. Heckman, that described allegations of (mis)behavior by Mr. Shirley, and that he proffered evidence from which a jury could find that the appellees abused the privilege. In the first publication, the Notification, Mr. Heckman explained the basis for the League\u2019s decision to suspend Mr. Shirley in an email he sent to Mr. Shirley, the Board, the League Commissioner, and Mr. Wilson. The second publication occurred during the Suspension Hearing, when Mr. Heckman \u201cmade a verbal presentation to those assembled, listing a litany of \u2018bad acts\u2019 by [Mr.] Shirley as justification for the suspension.\u201d The appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>respond that the Board members and coaches who received the Notification, and the Board members, coaches, and parents in attendance at the Suspension Hearing (all of whom were affiliated with the League) fell within an \u201cidentifiable group\u201d bound together by a common interest, ie., the orderly and just operation of the League according to its written rules. The circuit court found that Mr. Shirley failed as a matter of law to proffer facts sufficient to support a finding of abuse in either of the recognized forms. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">A. Mr. Shirley Failed To Produce Evidence That Could Support A Finding That Mr. Heckman Acted With Malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We take the second prong first. Malice, as defined by the Court of Appeals, requires proof of \u201ca person\u2019s actual knowledge that his [or her] statement is false, coupled with his [or her] intent to deceive another by means of that statement.\u201d <em>Piscatelli, </em>424 Md. at 307-08, 35 A.3d 1140 (brackets in original) (quoting <em>Ellerin v. Fairfax Sav. F.S.B., </em>337 Md. 216, 240, 652 A.2d 1117 (1995)). Mr. Shirley asks us to look instead to whether the record contained evidence that Mr. Heckman made the statements with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for their truth. Although the analytical trail is a little winding and not well-marked, we hold that the circuit court followed the right path.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">No case says so in so many words, but a careful reading of three opinions from the Court of Appeals reveals a collective holding that the <em>Ellerin </em>definition of malice determines whether a speaker has abused <em>any </em>of the conditional privileges to defamation. The first milestone is <em>Marchesi v. Franchino, </em>283 Md. 131, 387 A.2d 1129 (1978), a common interest privilege case, in which the Court of Appeals held that the same standard of malice defines eligibility for punitive damages <em>and </em>whether conditional privileges have been abused in defamation cases. <em>Id. </em>at 138-39, 387 A.2d 1129. <em>Marchesi </em>applied the then-governing definition of malice, which required a plaintiff to prove that the speaker acted with \u201cknowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 387 A.2d 1129. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>that definition of malice was superseded ten years later, in <em>Le Marc\u2019s Management Corp. v. Valentin, </em>349 Md. 645, 651-54, 709 A.2d 1222 (1998), when the Court adopted the <em>Ellerin </em>definition of malice as the standard for punitive damages for defamation. The final step is <em>Piscatelli, </em>which cited and followed the <em>Ellerin </em>malice definition in analyzing abuse of the fair reporting and fair comment privileges. <em>Piscatelli, </em>424 Md. at 307-08, 35 A.3d 1140. So although we recognize that the privileges analyzed in <em>Piscatelli </em>are imbued with free press implications that the common interest privilege is not, <em>see id. </em>at 309-17 &amp; nn. 3-5, 35 A.3d 1140 the combination of these precedents directs us to apply the <em>Ellerin </em>malice standard here to determine whether the appellees abused the common interest privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The statements at issue here fall well short of demonstrating even a potential for malice under the <em>Ellerin </em>standard. In both instances, Mr. Heckman simply reported allegations that others lodged with the Board and the evidence on which the Board relied in deciding to suspend Mr. Shirley and to uphold the suspension. In the Notification, Mr. Heckman told Mr. Shirley (and the indisputably League-affiliated recipients) that <em>\u201c[i]t was reported </em>that you were verbally abusive, used foul language and acted aggressively towards a volunteer play monitor,\u201d and that the behavior was confirmed by Mr. Brodsky\u2014he made no accusations of his own, or on behalf of the Board, and offered no views on the truth of the allegations. Mr. Shirley does not (and cannot) dispute that Ms. Fitzgerald submitted her complaint to the Board, nor does he contend that Mr. Heckman misstated, embellished, or otherwise misreported her account. In his capacity as Board President, Mr. Heckman published the Notification to a limited and relevant group of people sharing a common interest in the League and its processes, for the purpose of providing notice of the suspension to Mr. Shirley in the manner the League\u2019s rules required. The minutes of the Board\u2019s initial meeting and the depositions of Ms. Fitzgerald and Mr. Heckman confirmed the fact and substance of Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s complaint and that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>allegations were <em>reported </em>to the Board as the Notification described, and Mr. Shirley offers no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Mr. Shirley contends that \u201cthe court disregarded evidence that [Mr.] Brodsky asserted that he did not confirm the behavior described in the email.\u201d But Mr. Brodsky sent his email <em>after </em>Mr. Heckman sent the Notification, so it could not have affected anyone\u2019s views of the merits. Moreover, his argument misses the point: the Notification served a specific purpose under the rules of the League, <em>i.e., </em>to notify Mr. Shirley of the suspension and its bases and to advise him of his right to appeal. Mr. Shirley proffered no evidence that Mr. Heckman (mis)used the League\u2019s notice rules to publish statements he knew to be false with the intent to deceive others\u2014the record reveals only that the Notification disclosed the League\u2019s initial decision to suspend Mr. Shirley and the allegations on which that decision was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Mr. Shirley\u2019s allegations of malice arising from the Suspension Hearing suffer the same fate, for two reasons. Mr. Shirley produced no evidence from which a jury could find that Mr. Heckman <em>knew </em>that the reports of Mr. Shirley\u2019s behavior were false or that his statements during the course of the Hearing were intended to deceive. At most, the record reveals competing evidence and differing points of view about Mr. Shirley\u2019s behavior. Mr. Shirley produced two e-mails Mr. Heckman received in May 2007, in response to a League decision to censure Mr. Shirley, that disputed two then-Board members\u2019 first-hand reports of Mr. Shirley\u2019s behavior at a May 2007 flag football game.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Mr. Shirley also called two witnesses at the Suspension Hearing who presented first-hand accounts of the playoff game incident that disputed Ms. Fitzgerald\u2019s account. But these conflicting reports simply demonstrate disputes of fact about what happened, and the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>of the hearing\u2014-just like the purpose of the hearing in the circuit court and the oral argument before us on appeal\u2014was to air out those factual disputes and arguments so that the Board could make a decision. The record reveals that the Board undertook considerable due diligence in gathering information for the hearing,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and reveals no evidence that Mr. Heckman or anyone else published accusations during the hearing that they knew to be false.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">B. Mr. Shirley Failed To Produce Evidence From Which A Reasonable Jury Could Find That Mr. Heckman\u2019s Statements Were Made For A Purpose Outside The Common Interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Mr. Shirley also could have proven abuse of the common interest privilege by establishing that Mr. Heckman\u2019s publications were \u201cmade for a purpose other than to further the social interest entitled to protection.\u201d <em>Gohari, </em>363 Md. at 64, 767 A.2d 321. But we find independently dispositive the fact that Mr. Heckman was acting in his capacity as League president when he sent the Notification and when he presided over the Hearing, which had been convened pursuant to the League\u2019s rules to consider Mr. Shirley\u2019s suspension, and that all allegedly defamatory statements published in the Notifica^ tion and during the Suspension Hearing were published in that role. Put another way, Mr. Heckman was entitled to summary judgment because he published the offending statements while he was acting quintessentially <em>within </em>the common interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Again, the purpose of the common interest privilege is to promote and protect the free exchange of information, and to allow those sharing the common interest to speak freely and defend themselves. The privilege contemplates that discourse \u2022within the common interest could, and perhaps should, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>more frank, blunt or hurtful than the law would tolerate outside of that sphere. The League\u2019s rules define the space for that discourse, and specifically created the requirement that the League, through Mr. Heckman, send the Notification and convene the Suspension Hearing. These mechanisms provided Mr. Shirley with notice of the League\u2019s action and an opportunity to appeal, and they <em>required </em>Mr. Heckman to make both publications: the rules state specifically that \u201c[a]ll coaches shall be entitled to notice, public hearing, and other due process protection with respect to any disciplinary action by the [League\u2019s] Board of Directors,\u201d and, at the public hearing, that \u201cthe [League\u2019s] Board of Directors ... shall disclose to the coach ... the nature of the complaints forming the basis for the action.\u201d Obviously, Mr. Shirley did not consent to be defamed simply by invoking his right to appeal the League\u2019s decision and participating in the Suspension Hearing. But the subject matter of the proceeding he requested necessarily required that Mr. Heckman have appropriate latitude in speaking about Mr. Shirley\u2019s alleged behaviors, current and past, to the extent that they bore on the discipline question before the Board. <em>See Gohari, </em>363 Md. at 60, 767 A.2d 321 (\u201cThe fact that the recipient has made the request is an indication that he, at least, regards the matter in respect to which information is desired as sufficiently important to justify the publication of any defamatory matter that may be involved in response to the request.\u201d (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 595, at 273-74 (1977))); <em>Happy 40, Inc. v. Miller, </em>63 Md.App. 24, 35-36, 491 A.2d 1210 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We hold that so long as they are not speaking or acting with malice, the League and individuals within its sphere of common interest are immune as a matter of law from liability for defamation arising from statements published in connection with the League\u2019s disciplinary process, <em>see Gohari, </em>363 Md. at 63-64, 767 A.2d 321, and that the circuit court correctly granted summary judgment to the appellees. A candid and transparent process for communicating and deciding disciplinary matters promotes the League\u2019s broader purposes, and a meaningful threat of potential liability for defamation could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>discourage players, parents or Board members from raising, pursuing and trying to solve disputes or behavior problems within the League. This interest in free expression flows both ways: just as the League had an interest in ensuring that Mr. Heckman could speak freely while he presided over the Hearing, it had an equally important interest in ensuring that Mr. Shirley could speak freely in his own defense. So like Mr. Heckman, Mr. Shirley would also be protected from liability (subject, of course, to the same malice limitation) for statements he might make at the Suspension Hearing about the conduct, good faith or <em>bonafides </em>of witnesses, Board members or others falling within the zone of common interest. This does not mean, of course, that anyone affiliated with the League can freely defame anyone else on matters relating to the League\u2014the League\u2019s rules define the fora for, subjects of and people entitled to participate in the protected expression,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the protection does not apply outside of those bounds, nor to statements that fail the malice test.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Because Mr. Shirley failed to proffer evidence that could support a finding that the appellees abused the common interest privilege, either by establishing malice or that Mr. Heckman\u2019s statements strayed outside the common interest, the circuit court correctly granted summary judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.
