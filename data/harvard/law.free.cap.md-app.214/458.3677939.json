In that agreement, she waived any interest she had in certain enumerated items of property owned by Mr. Stewart. Twenty-one years later, Mr. Stewart filed a divorce action in the Circuit Court for Charles County, requesting, among other things, the enforcement of the prenuptial contract. In response, Ms. Stewart filed an answer questioning the validity of that agreement together with a counter complaint for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">A hearing was ultimately held to address the question whether the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement was valid and enforceable. When the Charles County circuit court held that it was both, the Stewarts entered into a property settlement and separation agreement that incorporated the terms of the prenuptial. But that did not resolve all of the matters in dispute between the parties as, in the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, Ms. Stewart had reserved the right to appeal the circuit court\u2019s validation of the prenuptial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>After the circuit court granted Mr. Stewart a divorce, Ms. Stewart predictably noted this appeal, challenging the lower court\u2019s decision to uphold the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement. That agreement, she alleges, was neither valid nor enforceable, because of Mr. Stewart\u2019s failure to fully and frankly disclose all of his property interests and assets and because he presented the agreement to her so close in time to their impending marriage that she had no opportunity to consult with counsel before signing it. She further contends that it was unconscionable, because it was \u201cclearly one-sided\u201d and because she signed it \u201cwithout valuable consideration or understanding of what rights she was waiving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">We find no merit to any of Ms. Stewart\u2019s claims. The prenuptial agreement was valid and enforceable, and, furthermore, it was not, from either a procedural or substantive perspective, unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Ms. Stewart was a single, twenty-six-year-old woman when, in 1986, she met and engaged in an affair with Mr. Stewart, a married, twenty-four-year-old father of three. At that time, she worked at a daycare center for minimum wage, while, in stark economic contrast, Mr. Stewart owned a successful construction business. What began as an affair ultimately developed into a relationship, and the parties began to live together.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Planning to marry, once Mr. Stewart obtained a divorce from his current wife, the parties selected a wedding date of October 22, 1988. Because, at that time, he had approximately $2 million in assets and his pending bride had practically none, Mr. Stewart informed the future \u201cMrs. Stewart,\u201d that he would not marry her unless she agreed to sign a prenuptial agreement, waiving any and all interest in his assets. His attorney thereafter drafted such an agreement, and Mr. Stewart presented it to Ms. Stewart for her consideration and signature before the wedding.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>As to the date on which that occurred, the parties do not agree. At the hearing below, Mr. Stewart claimed that he first gave Ms. Stewart a copy of the prenuptial agreement in \u201cthe last part of September 1988,\u201d while Ms. Stewart maintained that she did not receive it until the day she signed it. But the parties do agree that Ms. Stewart did sign the prenuptial agreement four days before their wedding date and that Mr. Stewart signed it, either the same day or the next. At the time Ms. Stewart signed the agreement, she was not represented by counsel and would later claim that she had no opportunity to consult with counsel, as she was presented with the prenuptial just four days before the parties\u2019 wedding. But there is no indication in the record as to whether her impending wedding or any event or circumstance would have impeded an effort to consult with counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The prenuptial agreement began with a preambular statement declaring: \u201cWHEREAS, both parties have been afforded the opportunity to retain, advise, and consult with independent counsel of their own choice[.]\u201d It then went on to avow that each party \u201chereby waives, releases, and relinquishes all right, title, estate, and interest\u201d in any \u201cproperty owned by [the other] at the time of the marriage ... and in [the other\u2019s] estate upon ... death.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agreement thereafter listed the following items of property owned by Mr. Stewart or his company, Waldorf Concrete, Inc., that is: Waldorf Concrete itself; fifty acres of real property located near Maryland Route 231 and subject to a $190,000 deed of trust; four condominium units in Waldorf Business Square; a lot in West Virginia; and \u201c[s]tock ownership and interest\u201d in Brandywine Building Supply, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The agreement omitted, however, any mention of Mr. Stewart\u2019s individual retirement account (\u201cIRA\u201d), which was then worth, according to him, \u201caround $60,000\u201d or three percent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>his $2 million worth of premarital assets. It also failed to mention any property owned by Ms. Stewart, though that omission was, to be sure, inconsequential, as, at the time Ms. Stewart signed the prenuptial agreement, the only property that she owned was a used Ford Maverick, which was worth, as she put it, \u201cmaybe\u201d $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The agreement reserved for each party \u201cthe right to transfer or convey to the other any property or interest therein which may be lawfully conveyed or transferred during his or her lifetime or by Will\u201d and further provided that \u201cneither party intended] by this Agreement to limit or restrict in any way the right and power ... to receive any such transfer or conveyance from the other,\u201d but added that \u201cno representations or promises of any kind whatsoever have been made\u201d by either party as to \u201cany such transfer or conveyance.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Y\">Paragraph 5 of the agreement then declared that each party covenants and represents to the other that he or she has disclosed to the other the nature and extent of his or her various property, interest and sources of income, as disclosed herein, fully and fairly reflect the said property, interests and sources of income of each party, respectively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASH\">Paragraph 6 added that Ms. Stewart</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A18\">declares that she fully understands the terms and provisions of the Agreement, that she has been fully informed of her legal rights and liabilities, that she believes that the provisions of this Agreement are fair, just and reasonable and that she signs this Agreement freely and voluntarily, acting under the advice of independent legal counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">A substantively identical provision, paragraph 7, applied to Mr. Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">After the parties were married, Ms. Stewart left her daycare job and, less than seven months later, gave birth to the first of the parties\u2019 three children. To provide a residence for his new family, Mr. Stewart subdivided the fifty-acre parcel near Maryland Route 231 and built, on a nine-acre plot, a large house with a \u201cbig pool.\u201d He then titled the home in both his name and Ms. Stewart\u2019s, as tenants by the entireties. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>pay off the mortgage on the parties\u2019 home, he later sold a number of the assets he had listed in the prenuptial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In addition to their marital home, the Stewarts acquired, during their marriage, two other properties, one near their home and the other in upstate New York. Both Stewarts were listed on the titles of the two properties, as tenants by the entireties. By the date of the hearing below, the Maryland property was worth a \u201cminimum\u201d of $800,000, while the New York property was worth a \u201cminimum\u201d of $625,000. Neither property was encumbered by a mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">When he was in his mid-forties, Mr. Stewart \u201cclosed up\u201d his company, Waldorf Concrete, Inc., and retired. But his marriage did not survive his retirement. Amid cross-accusations of adultery, Mr. Stewart filed a complaint for divorce in the Charles County circuit court, which, among other things, sought enforcement of the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement. In response, Ms. Stewart filed an answer challenging the validity of the prenuptial agreement as well as a counterclaim for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">After a hearing was held on the question of whether the prenuptial agreement was valid and enforceable, the court found that it was both. In so ruling, it said that, even assuming the truth of Ms. Stewart\u2019s \u201cdescription of the history and circumstances\u201d under which she signed the prenuptial agreement, her \u201cmind set was that the substance of the agreement ... didn\u2019t matter an awful lot to her because her position was she loved him, she was gonna marry him regardless.\u201d That is why, or so the court seemed to suggest, that although by her own account, she had \u201cthree or four days\u201d to seek counsel, she, in the court\u2019s words, \u201celected not to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">That is not to say that she was unaware of the content of the prenuptial agreement. On the contrary, according to the circuit court, \u201cshe read through the thing and she knew what it said, she was familiar with some of ... the major assets that the document lists,\u201d including the property on Route 231 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the concrete business. Moreover, the document itself notified her that \u201cMr. Stewart and/or his company\u201d owned the condominium units which housed the concrete business. And then, upon finding that there was no evidence of duress, coercion, or undue influence, the circuit court declared the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement to be valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Following that ruling, the parties entered into a property settlement and separation agreement, which was incorporated, but not merged, into an ensuing judgment of absolute divorce. That, in turn, was followed by a consent order addressing custody and child support matters. But, of particular significance, as it is the foundation of this appeal, the property settlement and separation agreement expressly reserved to Ms. Stewart the right to appeal the circuit court\u2019s earlier ruling upholding the validity of the prenuptial agreement, and, once judgment was entered, she did precisely that in noting this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Ms. Stewart contends that the circuit court erred in upholding the validity and enforceability of the prenuptial agreement because Mr. Stewart, she alleges, did not fully, frankly, and truthfully disclose the value of his property. Specifically, the agreement did not mention, she points out, Mr. Stewart\u2019s ownership of an IRA. Nor did it, she complains, indicate monetary values for the assets listed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Because she did not have actual knowledge of the value of Mr. Stewart\u2019s assets, Ms. Stewart claims, relying on <em>Ortel v. Gettig, </em>207 Md. 594, 116 A.2d 145 (1955), that the agreement was invalid. In <em>Ortel, </em>the Court of Appeals declined to uphold a prenuptial agreement because there was inadequate disclosure of the value of the husband\u2019s assets. It reasoned that the wife\u2019s \u201cknowledge of the fact that the husband had an electrical business\u201d and owned various real properties (but not their \u201cactual value\u201d) was so \u201cindefinite\u201d that she could not be deemed to have \u201cactual knowledge of his worth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>116 A.2d 145. Ms. Stewart suggests that we should reach the same conclusion for the same reasons here. Maintaining that she too had, at best, \u201cindefinite knowledge\u201d of Mr. Stewart\u2019s worth, which fell \u201cfar short\u201d of actual knowledge, Ms. Stewart claims that her prenuptial agreement, like the one in <em>Ortel, </em>was invalid for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">To bolster her claim, Ms. Stewart adds that paragraph 3B of her prenuptial agreement stated that Mr. Stewart had an interest in Waldorf Concrete, Inc., but declined to address the value of that interest, stating, without further elaboration, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">B. Waldorf Concrete, Inc., a corporation organized according to the laws of the State of Maryland. The property herein described and described within the provision of paragraph one [whereby Barbara purportedly waived any interest in James\u2019s property] shall include any appreciated value of the property described and shall further include any appreciated value which may be attributable to the reduction of any encumbrances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Ms. Stewart insists that, without an accountant\u2019s statement, she \u201chad no way to calculate\u201d the present value of Waldorf Concrete, at the time she signed the agreement, nor did she have any means to perform a future earnings analysis. As a result, she neither knew nor had any way of knowing the value of Mr. Stewart\u2019s interest in Waldorf Concrete. Ms. Stewart further contends that the prenuptial agreement at issue was invalid for lack of consideration, specifically asserting that there was \u201cno consideration ... other than marriage,\u201d which, according to her, \u201cis not to be deemed valuable consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Because a prenuptial agreement is a contract, we review it \u201cunder the objective law of contract interpretation.\u201d <em>Cannon v. Cannon, </em>384 Md. 537, 553, 865 A.2d 563 (2005). We do so, mindful that, unlike the normal run of contracts, prenuptial agreements invariably involve a confidential relationship that is \u201cpresumed to exist as a matter of law\u201d between the parties entering into that kind of an agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 865 A.2d 563. To establish the validity of such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>contract, the agreement\u2019s proponent must show that there was no \u201coverreaching,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 568, 865 A.2d 563, that is, that \u201cin the atmosphere and environment of the confidential relationship,\u201d there was neither \u201cunfairness\u201d nor \u201cinequity\u201d in \u201cthe result of the agreement or in its procurement.\u201d <em>Hartz v. Hartz, </em>248 Md. 47, 57, 234 A.2d 865 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">That may be achieved in several ways. One of which is to show that the agreement \u201cdocuments a full, frank, and truthful disclosure,\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>384 Md. at 573, 865 A.2d 563, of the \u201cworth of the property, real and personal, as to which there is a waiver of rights in whole or in part, so that he or she who waives can know what it is he or she is waiving.\u201d <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. at 56-57, 234 A.2d 865. Indeed, if this standard is met, the agreement may well be rendered resistant to attack. <em>Id. </em>In the absence of such a disclosure, \u201cadequate knowledge\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of what that disclosure would have revealed \u201cmay serve as a substitute\u201d for such disclosure and thereby confirm that there was no overreaching. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 234 A.2d 865; <em>accord Cannon, </em>384 Md. at 574, 865 A.2d 563. \u201cProof of knowledge, unlike full, frank, and truthful disclosure, does not require that the enforcing party demonstrate that the attacking party had knowledge of the discrete value of each asset. Instead, knowledge means that the attacking party must be shown to have adequate knowledge\u2014-knowledge of the existence of the assets subject to the waiver and knowledge of what those assets are worth in sum so that the attacking party may be found to know what it is he or she is waiving.\u201d <em>Cannon, </em>384 Md. at 573-74 n. 21, 865 A.2d 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">As the Court of Appeals has explained, the \u201cpurpose behind a requirement of disclosure or knowledge is \u2018so that he or she who waives can know what it is he or she is waiving.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 865 A.2d 563 (quoting <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. at 56-57, 234 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>A.2d 865). If either disclosure or knowledge \u201cis proven by the enforcing party and insufficiently rebutted by the attacking party, there can be no overreaching.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">If, however, there is neither full, frank, and truthful disclosure by the party seeking to enforce the agreement, nor \u201cactual knowledge\u201d by the party attacking the agreement, and if \u201cthe allowance made to the one who waives is unfairly disproportionate to the worth of the property involved at the time the agreement is made,\u201d then the validity of the agreement \u201cmust be tested by other standards.\u201d <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. at 57-58, 234 A.2d 865. Since the \u201creal test\u201d in determining the validity of a prenuptial agreement is whether there was \u201coverreaching,\u201d the Court of Appeals has set forth a two-pronged test, derived from the definition of \u201coverreaching\u201d itself, a test which requires the court to ask, first, \u201cwas the benefit to [the party attacking the agreement] commensurate with that which she relinquished so that the agreement was fair and equitable under the circumstances,\u201d and, second, \u201cdid the subsequent would-be repudiator of the contract enter into the agreement freely and understanding^.\u201d <em>Id. Accord Cannon, </em>384 Md. at 568-69, 865 A.2d 563. As the first prong of this \u201coverreaching\u201d test addresses the substantive fairness of the prenuptial agreement, while the second prong addresses the manner in which the repudiating party\u2019s assent to that agreement was obtained, we shall refer to the first of the two prongs as the \u201csubstantive prong\u201d and the second as the \u201cprocedural prong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Although the agreement in question does not reach the heights of a full, frank, and truthful disclosure of all of Mr. Stewart\u2019s assets, failing, as it does, to specify the value of each asset or their collective worth, it does, -with one minor exception (an exception amounting to only three percent of his total assets), set forth all of Mr. Stewart\u2019s assets. And, given the number and nature of those assets (which, we stress, were not just numbered bank and investment accounts), it would have surely alerted Ms. Stewart that, by executing the agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>she would be waiving any claim she might have to assets worth thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Nor can Ms. Stewart rely on any claim that she did not review the agreement, as the court found that \u201cshe read through\u201d the prenuptial agreement; that she \u201cknew what it said\u201d; and, lastly, that she \u201cwas familiar with\u201d the \u201cmajor assets that the document list[ed].\u201d Indeed, the court observed that Ms. Stewart had admitted that she was \u201caware of the farm on 231,\u201d a fifty-acre enterprise, and of Mr. Stewart\u2019s \u201cconcrete business,\u201d two of Mr. Stewart\u2019s most valuable assets, a not unreasonable conclusion given that the parties had lived together for a year before their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In sum, although Ms. Stewart did not receive notice of the specific value of each asset or of their collective worth, she did unquestionably receive what amounted to, for all intents and purposes, just shy of a complete list of those assets via the agreement and knew of the existence, nature, and potential worth of the most valuable of Mr. Stewart\u2019s assets before she ever signed the prenuptial. And finally, we note that there is no indication, that, had she requested additional information as to the value of the assets, such information would not have been forthcoming. In short, the agreement plus Ms. Stewart\u2019s actual knowledge of Mr. Stewart\u2019s principal assets put her on notice that she was, in fact, about to execute a waiver of any claims she might have to substantial assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, we shall, for the moment, assume that she did not receive anything that came close to full disclosure of Mr. Stewart\u2019s assets or have adequate knowledge of their existence or value and turn to the two-pronged \u201coverreaching\u201d test, that is whether, even if there was neither full, frank, and truthful disclosure of the parties\u2019 assets nor a substitute for such disclosure, the prenuptial agreement is still valid and enforceable because the benefit to the party attacking it was \u201ccommensurate with that which she relinquished so that the agreement was fair and equitable under the circumstances\u201d and because \u201cthe subsequent would-be repudiator of the contract\u201d entered into the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201cfreely and understanding^.\u201d <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. at 58, 234 A.2d 865. <em>Accord Cannon, </em>384 Md. at 568-69, 865 A.2d 563. Given what Ms. Stewart knew of Mr. Stewart\u2019s assets, before presentation of the agreement at issue, what she knew of the purpose and contents of the agreement, and the circumstances surrounding its execution, we find, under those \u201cother standards,\u201d <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. at 58, 234 A.2d 865, that there was sufficient evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that both the substantive and procedural prongs of the \u201coverreaching\u201d test were satisfied and that the agreement was, therefore, valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\n<em>\u201cOvemaching\u201d Test\u2014Substantive Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We begin with the substantive prong of the \u201coverreaching\u201d test, that is, whether the benefit to the waiving party is \u201ccommensurate with that which she relinquished so that the agreement was fair and equitable under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. at 58, 234 A.2d 865. In that regard, we note that the agreement did not require Ms. Stewart to waive alimony or her right to a monetary award, to which she might be entitled under Family Law Article \u00a7 8-205. At the time the parties entered into the agreement, these potentially valuable rights were retained by Ms. Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Furthermore, Ms. Stewart\u2019s complaint that there was \u201cno consideration ... other than marriage\u201d to support the prenuptial agreement at issue is without merit. Though \u201cconsummation of the marriage is itself sufficient consideration\u201d to support a prenuptial agreement, <em>Cannon, </em>384 Md. at 553, 865 A.2d 563, the marriage also conferred upon Ms. Stewart potential economic benefits of a substantial nature, assets she did not waive under the prenuptial agreement, namely, the right to receive alimony and a monetary award upon the dissolution of that marriage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>In sum, there was a sufficient factual basis for the circuit court\u2019s holding that, in the words of <em>Hartz, </em>the agreement was \u201cfair and equitable under the circumstances.\u201d 248 Md. at 58, 234 A.2d 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\n<em>\u201cOverreaching\" Test\u2014Procedural Prong</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We turn next to the procedural prong of the \u201coverreaching\u201d test: whether \u201cthe subsequent would-be repudiator of the contract\u201d entered into the agreement \u201cfreely and understandingly.\u201d <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. at 58, 234 A.2d 865. To answer this question, we begin with a brief summary of the circumstances surrounding the formation of the agreement at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">When Ms. Stewart and Mr. Stewart met, two years before they married, she was a single, twenty-six-year-old high school dropout, who was working for minimum wage at a daycare center and whose principal asset was a car worth approximately $500; while he was a married, twenty-four-year-old high school graduate, with three children, who earned \u201caround $100,000 a year\u201d and had acquired a net worth of some $2.5 million through his construction business and related investments.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">They began an extramarital affair which ultimately led to Mr. Stewart\u2019s divorce from his first wife. While that divorce was pending, the parties lived together for \u201ca little more than a year.\u201d When Mr. Stewart\u2019s divorce was at hand, he and Ms. Stewart made plans for their wedding. At that time, notwithstanding the demands of the recent settlement he had reached with his former wife, Mr. Stewart\u2019s net worth was approximately $2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Given that his marriage to Ms. Stewart might prove to be no more successful than his first, Mr. Stewart insisted upon a prenuptial agreement as a precondition to marrying Ms. Stewart.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After Mr. Stewart\u2019s attorney drafted the agreement at issue, Mr. Stewart presented it to Ms. Stewart and asked her to sign it. According to Ms. Stewart, that presentation took place four days before the wedding, and Ms. Stewart felt, in her words, \u201ca lot of pressure\u201d to sign it. She said that, when she was given the agreement, Mr. Stewart told her to \u201csign it\u201d or else \u201che wasn\u2019t gonna marry [her].\u201d She complied with that condition because, as she put it: \u201cI felt, you know, I love him, I cared about him, so I signed it.\u201d That admission led the court to later conclude: \u201cthe substance of the agreement ... didn\u2019t matter an awful lot to her because her position was she loved him, she was gonna marry him regardless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Ms. Stewart testified that, at the time she signed the agreement, she was not represented by counsel, that she did not \u201creally\u201d read the agreement, and that she did not know what she was signing, though she admitted that she \u201cbriefly looked in\u201d the agreement and, from that brief review, learned that Mr. Stewart owned the assets listed therein. She conceded, moreover, that, when she and Mr. Stewart met, she knew that he was \u201cin business,\u201d that he \u201cowned Waldorf Concrete,\u201d and that she was \u201caware of the assets, as far as the farm and stuff like that.\u201d In any event, she maintained that she signed the prenuptial agreement, fifteen minutes after it was presented to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The circuit court found that, regardless of when Ms. Stewart signed the agreement, she had \u201cthree or four days\u201d during which she could have sought counsel and that \u201cshe elected not to\u201d do so. In fact, it appears that she willingly declined to seek any professional advice. Finally, there is no suggestion by her that she was discouraged from seeking such advice. Consequently, the circuit court did not err in concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Ms. Stewart \u201celected not to\u201d seek professional advice. Md. Rule 8-131 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">In <em>Cannon v. Cannon, supra, </em>384 Md. 537, 865 A.2d 563, as here, the party attacking the prenuptial agreement \u201cdid not avail herself of the opportunity to seek legal counsel\u201d despite having had \u201cat least several days\u201d to examine the agreement in question. <em>Id. </em>at 578, 865 A.2d 563. In that case, the Court of Appeals declared that it was \u201cloathe to craft a brightline rule where both sides are compelled to seek counsel prior to entering into an antenuptial agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was \u201cenough\u201d to tip the scales \u201cin favor of the validity of the agreement,\u201d said the Court, that the attacking party \u201chad the opportunity to seek counsel\u201d and \u201cwas not discouraged\u201d from doing so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Observing that Ms. Stewart had admitted that \u201cshe loved [Mr. Stewart]\u201d and \u201cwas gonna marry him regardless,\u201d the circuit court found that \u201cshe chose to sign\u201d the prenuptial agreement, or, in other words, that she entered into the agreement \u201cfreely.\u201d <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. at 58, 234 A.2d 865. Given the circuit court\u2019s finding that she would have signed the agreement regardless of the circumstances attending its formation, a finding that was not clearly erroneous, Ms. Stewart can hardly claim here that she was prejudiced by the allegedly brief period of time she was given to consider the agreement. <em>See </em>Brett R. Turner &amp; Laura W. Morgan, <em>Attacking and Defending Marital Agreements, </em>\u00a7 10.02, at 394 (2d ed.2012) (noting that \u201cif the shortness of time did not affect the attacking party\u2019s willingness to sign,\u201d prenuptial agreement \u201cmay still be enforceable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">As to whether Ms. Stewart also entered into the agreement \u201cunderstandingly,\u201d <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. at 58, 234 A.2d 865, the circuit court found: that \u201cshe read through the thing\u201d; that she \u201cknew what it said\u201d; that she \u201cwas familiar with\u201d the \u201cmajor assets that the document lists\u201d; that she admitted being \u201caware of the farm on 231\u201d; and that she was \u201caware of the concrete business\u201d and where it was located. As to her claim that she did not know who owned the condominium units <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>in Waldorf Business Square, the court found that Ms. Stewart \u201cread that in [the] document\u201d itself. In other words, the court found, in effect, that Ms. Stewart entered into the agreement \u201cunderstandingly,\u201d regardless of her protestations to the contrary. Hartz, 248 Md. at 58, 234 A.2d 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Moreover, since application of the two-pronged \u201coverreaching\u201d test presupposes \u201cinadequate disclosure,\u201d <em>see Cannon, </em>384 Md. at 560, 865 A.2d 563, it follows that where, as here, there was disclosure of Mr. Stewart\u2019s specific assets but inadequate disclosure of their value, the agreement may nonetheless be valid and enforceable. In the instant case, there was substantial disclosure, by Mr. Stewart, as well as substantial knowledge, by Ms. Stewart, of the assets which Mr. Stewart owned, at the time the parties entered into the prenuptial agreement. Indeed, there was more than sufficient evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Stewart knew of essentially all of the assets and that those assets were valuable. Although there was no finding, by the court, that she actually knew that those assets were worth $2 million at the time the agreement was entered (despite Mr. Stewart\u2019s assurances that she did), there was more than enough evidence that Ms. Stewart had actual knowledge of at least the number, nature, and potential value of Mr. Stewart\u2019s premarital assets. In any event, given the court\u2019s finding that Ms. Stewart would have signed the prenuptial agreement regardless of the circumstances attending its formation, she may not now claim that she was prejudiced by any purported lack of information. <em>Hartz, 248 </em>Md. at 58, 234 A.2d 865 (noting that if attacking party is not prejudiced by lack of information, he or she may not repudiate prenuptial agreement on that basis).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We also note that Ms. Stewart never claims that she did not know either the nature and purpose of the agreement or what rights she was surrendering. Indeed, as she admitted at the hearing below, she read, at the top of the first page of the agreement, that it was, indeed, a prenuptial agreement, and she further testified that Mr. Stewart had told her the purpose of that agreement\u2014that \u201che wanted to protect himself.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>We therefore conclude that the circuit court\u2019s finding that Ms. Stewart was not \u201choodwinked or misled or threatened or pressured\u201d was not clearly erroneous and that the procedural prong of <em>Hartz, </em>that the party challenging the agreement entered into it \u201cfreely and understanding^,\u201d was satisfied. <em>Cannon, </em>384 Md. at 568-69, 865 A.2d 563 (citing <em>Hartz, </em>248 Md. at 58, 234 A.2d 865).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">As both the substantive and procedural prongs of Hartz\u2019s \u201coverreaching\u201d test have been met, we conclude that there was no overreaching by Mr. Stewart in procuring Ms. Stewart\u2019s assent to the prenuptial agreement and that it was therefore valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Ms. Stewart contends that the agreement in question was unconscionable, because it was \u201cclearly one-sided\u201d and was \u201cdisproportionate to the advantage of\u2019 Mr. Stewart, and because she signed it \u201cwithout valuable consideration or understanding of what rights she was waiving.\u201d This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">An \u201cunconscionable bargain or contract has been defined as one characterized by \u2018extreme unfairness,\u2019 which is made evident by \u2018(1) one party\u2019s lack of meaningful choice, and (2) contractual terms that unreasonably favor the other party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walther v. Sovereign Bank, </em>386 Md. 412, 426, 872 A.2d 735 (2005) (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1560 (8th ed.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The first of these two \u201ccomponents,\u201d <em>see Doyle v. Finance America, LLC, </em>173 Md.App. 370, 383, 918 A.2d 1266 (2007), known as \u201cprocedural unconscionability,\u201d concerns the \u201cprocess of making a contract\u201d and includes such devices as the use of \u201cfine print and convoluted or unclear language,\u201d as well as \u201cdeficiencies in the contract formation process, such as deception or a refusal to bargain over contract terms.\u201d <em>Walther, </em>386 Md. at 426-27, 872 A.2d 735 (citations and quotations omitted). The second component, \u201csubstantive unconscionability,\u201d refers to contractual terms that are \u201cunreasonably\u201d or \u201cgrossly\u201d favorable to the more powerful party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>and includes terms \u201cthat attempt to alter in an impermissible manner fundamental duties otherwise imposed by the law,\u201d provisions \u201cthat seek to negate the reasonable expectations of the nondrafting party,\u201d and terms \u201cunreasonably and unexpectedly harsh ... having nothing to do with ... central aspects of the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u201cThe prevailing view is that both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be present in order for a court to invalidate a contractual term as unconscionable.\u201d <em>Freedman v. Comcast Corp., </em>190 Md.App. 179, 207-08, 988 A.2d 68 (2010). The burden of establishing the presence of both is on the party challenging the prenuptial agreement. <em>Cannon, </em>384 Md. at 554, 865 A.2d 563. Moreover, unconscionability of a prenuptial agreement is determined as of \u201cthe time the contract was entered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Furthermore, according to a noteworthy authority, it \u201crequires a greater showing of inappropriateness\u201d to prove that a prenuptial agreement is unconscionable than it does to show that it is invalid under the \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d test, which it deems to be the same as Maryland\u2019s \u201coverreaching\u201d test. <em>See </em>Alexander Lindey <em>&amp; </em>Louis I. Parley, <em>Lindey and Parley on Separation Agreements and Antenuptial Contracts, </em>\u00a7 110.66[1] at 110-57 &amp; n. 3; <em>id. </em>\u00a7 110.66[2] at 110-59 (2d ed. 1999 &amp; 2012 Supp.). <em>Accord </em>Barbara Ann Atwood, <em>Ten Years Later: Lingering Concerns About the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, </em>19 J.

Having just determined that there was no overreaching by Mr. Stewart, we may conclude, on that ground alone, that the parties\u2019 prenuptial agreement was not unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Moreover, there was no basis upon which the circuit court could have found, in the instant case, either procedural or substantive unconscionability, based upon what Ms. Stewart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>has alleged. As for procedural unconscionability, Ms. Stewart claims only that Mr. Stewart told her that he would not marry her unless she signed the prenuptial agreement and that she \u201creally didn\u2019t know\u201d what she was signing. Notably absent from her brief is any allegation of \u201cfine print,\u201d \u201cconvoluted or unclear language,\u201d \u201cdeception,\u201d or \u201ca refusal to bargain over contract terms.\u201d <em>Walther, </em>386 Md. at 426-27, 872 A.2d 735. And for good reason, as the agreement does not, on its face, suffer from either of the first two defects, and, as for the latter two, Ms. Stewart has never alleged that Mr. Stewart deceived her into signing the prenuptial, and she concedes<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that she never attempted to bargain over its terms, though she had, according to her own testimony, four days to do so. Consequently, there was no procedural unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">As for substantive unconscionability, we note the prenuptial agreement was only applicable to property and did not preclude Ms. Stewart from receiving either alimony or a monetary award upon divorce.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, her waiver of her interest in certain enumerated properties,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> owned by Mr. Stewart, hardly amounts to substantive unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We find further support for this conclusion in <em>Martin v. Farber, </em>68 Md.App. 137, 510 A.2d 608 (1986), the leading Maryland authority applying the doctrine of unconscionability to the subject of prenuptial agreements. In that case, we considered whether an \u201cotherwise valid\u201d prenuptial agreement could be set aside on the ground that its enforcement would be unconscionable, and we concluded that it could not. <em>Id. </em>at 143-45, 510 A.2d 608. The husband, Morris W. Farber, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>although \u201csteadily employed as an electrician, had no accumulated wealth at the time of his marriage to Mrs. Farber.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 510 A.2d 608. The wife, the former Nettie Sue Goldberg (and soon-to-be Mrs. Farber), had previously been married to a Dr. Chester Goldberg and had inherited substantial assets upon his death. <em>Id. </em>To retain ownership and control over those assets, no matter what the future held, the future Mrs. Farber asked her intended to sign a prenuptial agreement, three days before their marriage, which provided, \u201cin essence, that Mrs. Farber would retain sole control of the property she acquired either prior to or during the marriage\u201d and that \u201cMr. Farber relinquished all rights in the property and estate of Mrs. Farber.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">During their ensuing forty-four year marriage, Mr. Farber remained steadily employed until his retirement, in 1967, and, during that employment, regularly \u201cturned his paychecks over to his wife,\u201d as she \u201cmanaged the couple\u2019s household and financial affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mrs. Farber, for her part, gave Mr. Farber \u201crepeated assurances\u201d that she \u201cwould take care of him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 510 A.2d 608. Unfortunately, according to the court, she \u201cabused\u201d the couple\u2019s confidential relationship<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by using Mr. Farber\u2019s \u201cearnings to acquire assets which she titled or placed solely in her own name.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In 1983, Mrs. Farber died intestate. By the time of her death, \u201cshe had accumulated in her own name assets valued at approximately $275,000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 510 A.2d 608. Mr. Farber was thereafter appointed, by the orphans\u2019 court, as the personal representative of Mrs. Farber\u2019s estate. Unhappy with that appointment, Mrs. Farber\u2019s grandchildren filed a petition seeking his removal from that position on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>that, under the prenuptial agreement, he had \u201crenounced any claim to Mrs. Farber\u2019s estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Farber responded to that petition by filing a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court, in which he contended that the prenuptial agreement was invalid and that he was entitled to a spousal share of Mrs. Farber\u2019s estate, under Estates and Trusts Article, \u00a7 3-102.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">At the conclusion of a bench trial, the circuit court observed that, although Mr. Farber had \u201creleased any claim that he might have [had]\u201d to his deceased wife\u2019s estate, \u201cafter some forty-four years of a seemingly happy marriage, in which [Mr. Farber] [had] turned everything he earned over to [Mrs. Farber] without question, and also upon her assurances that she would take care of [him], it would not only be unjust, but unconscionable for the court to enforce\u201d the agreement. 68 Md.App. at 140, 510 A.2d 608. It therefore imposed a constructive trust upon Mrs. Farber\u2019s estate, \u201cfor the benefit of Mr. Farber during his life; the remainder to be distributed equally to Mrs. Farber\u2019s heirs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Affirming in part and reversing in part that decision, this Court held that the circuit court had \u201cerred in ruling that the agreement was unconscionable\u201d because it had \u201cpalpably relied on circumstances arising after the execution of the agreement\u201d and not \u201cas of the time [the agreement] was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 510 A.2d 608. We noted that \u201c[n]othing in the Farbers\u2019 antenuptial agreement or in the circumstances surrounding its execution render[ed] it unconscionable or otherwise legally objectionable\u201d and that, \u201c[n]o matter how disturbing\u201d Mrs. Farber\u2019s behavior during the marriage was, it did not afford \u201can adequate basis\u201d for ruling that the agreement at issue was unconscionable. <em>Id. </em>at 144-45, 510 A.2d 608. We did, however, uphold the imposition of a constructive trust upon Mrs. Farber\u2019s estate, though we limited it \u201cto the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Mr. Farber [was] able to trace his funds into his late wife\u2019s estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 510 A.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">As in <em>Farber, </em>the prenuptial agreement, in the instant case, was executed just a few days before the marriage. In both cases, the agreement provided that the party seeking to enforce the agreement \u201cwould retain sole control of the property\u201d he or she acquired \u201ceither prior to or during the marriage\u201d and that the non-enforcing party \u201crelinquished all rights in the property and estate of\u2019 the party seeking enforcement. <em>Id. </em>at 139, 510 A.2d 608. Moreover, in both cases, the party seeking enforcement entered into the marriage with substantial assets, while the party opposed to that enforcement did not. <em>Id. </em>In light of <em>Farber, </em>we conclude that the terms of the prenuptial agreement before us were neither unconscionable nor \u201cotherwise legally objectionable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 510 A.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CHARLES COUNTY AFFIRMED.

We use the term \u201cprenuptial agreement\u201d instead of its synonym, \"antenuptial agreement,\u201d throughout this opinion, as the former is \"far more common\u201d in American English today.

The Court of Appeals has used the terms \u201cadequate knowledge\u201d and \"actual knowledge\u201d interchangeably, in discussing substitutes for full, frank, and truthful disclosure in the context of prenuptial agreements. <em>See Cannon v. Cannon, </em>384 Md. 537, 568, 865 A.2d 563 (2005); <em>Hartz v. Hartz, </em>248 Md. 47, 57-58, 234 A.2d 865 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\">. That the rights Ms. Stewart retained under the prenuptial agreement ultimately proved to have considerable value was later confirmed when the parties entered into the property settlement and separation agreement. That settlement agreement provided, among other things, that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>in exchange for Ms. Stewart\u2019s \"waiver of a demand for alimony, maintenance, or support,\u201d Mr. Stewart was required to pay her $175,000; and, in exchange for Ms. Stewart\u2019s release of claims against Mr. Stewart for the marital property that was not subject to the prenuptial agreement, he was required to pay her $387,500, tax free. Thus, in fact, Ms. Stewart ultimately received $562,500 which was directly attributable to the rights she retained under the prenuptial agreement. Indeed, Ms. Stewart leaves the marriage having received assets worth at least $1.2 million, after accounting for the division of marital property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\">. There was also evidence that Mr. Stewart was motivated, in part, by a desire to protect the interests of his three children from his previous marriage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">. At the hearing below, Ms. Stewart simply stated that there were no negotiations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\">. Of course, by limiting the scope of what might otherwise be or become marital property, the prenuptial agreement tended to limit the amount of a future monetary award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\">.

Admittedly, the confidential relationship analyzed in <em>Martin v. Farber, 68 </em>Md.App. 137, 146, 510 A.2d 608 (1986), which arose during the marriage, is distinct from the confidential relationship we are considering here, which is presumed to exist, as a matter of law, between the parties who, not yet married, enter into a prenuptial agreement. In contrast, a confidential relationship arising during a marriage is not presumed to exist as a matter of law, but rather, is a question of fact. <em>See Cannon v.
