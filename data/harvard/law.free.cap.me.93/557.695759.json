Where the plaintiff suffered an injury on Sunday through the defendant\u2019s negligently letting him an unsafe carriage, <em>held; </em>that the defendant may have assumpsit for breach of an implied warranty to furnish a suitable carriage, or case for negligence in not doing so.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-7\">' On Exceptions by Plaintiee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-8\">II. The first ease was an action of assumpsit, tbe declaration containing counts for money bad and received, account annexed, and an omnibus count, to recover seventy-five dollars paid by the plaintiff to the defendant for a horse on Sunday.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-9\">The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show the purchase and a warranty that the horse was sound and safe for plaintiff\u2019s wife and son to drive; that he relied on the warranty; that the horse proved to be unsound and unsafe; and that after two weeks he returned the horse to the defendant who refused to refund the money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-10\">The presiding justice ruled that an action for a breach of the contract of warranty, it being a Sunday contract, could not be maintained, and ordei\u2019ed a nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b558-11\">The plaintiff was allowed exceptions to the ruling and order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b558-12\"><em>J.

Clary, 77 Maine, 482, 485; <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Woodside, </em>79 Maine, 156; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Kingsley, </em>84 Maine, 111; <em>Wheelden </em>v. <em>Lyford, </em>84 Maine, 114.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-14\">See <em>also: </em>\u2014 Batsford v. <em>Every, </em>44 Barb.

S., the law would lend its aid, neither in enforcing nor in rescinding a contract made on the Lord\u2019s day. This statute enables one party to such a contract to enforce his remedy and oblige the other party to fulfil his promise. This is where one party has not performed his part of the contract. Both parties did fulfil their promise and the contract was fully completed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-8\">The law will not lend its aid to rescind a contract made on the Lord\u2019s day. The law stands as it did before the passage of c. 82, \u00a7 116, R. S.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-9\">In <em>Plaisted, </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>63 Maine, 576, the court held that an action of assumpsit to recover back the price paid for the horse on account of a deceit practiced in the sale, would not lie, because based upon a contract tainted with illegality (Sunday trade). The law as laid down in <em>Plaisted </em>v. <em>Palmer </em>exists today, and was not changed by the section of the statute referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-10\">I. As appears by the bill of exceptions, the second case was an action of the case brought to recover damages on an implied warranty by a livery stable keeper that the carriage was safe and suitable in kind, for the purpose for which it was let, to wit: \u2014 to ride about town. There was evidence introduced by the plaintiff tending to prove that the purpose of the ride was to take the air. There was also evidence in the case tending to prove that the hind seat of the carriage, for want of sufficient fastening, tipped over and allowed the plaintiff to fall out backwards, in consequence of which she received injuries. The hiring of the carriage was on Sunday, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the accident occurred on Sunday afternoon before sunset. After the evidence for the plaintiff was all taken out, the defendant moved a nonsuit, on the ground that the contract of hiring was an illegal contract and fell within the provisions of R. S., c. 124, \u00a7 20, and was void. The presiding justice upon the foregoing evidence ordered a nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-5\">The declaration was a part of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-6\">(Declaration.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-7\">\u201cIn a plea of the case: \u2014 for that on the 14th day of August, A. D. 1898, at Skowhegan aforesaid, the defendants owned, controlled and managed a livery stable, and were engaged in letting teams to the public for hire; that on the said 14th day of August, 1898, at said Skowhegan, the said plaintiff procured one Charles H. Folsom to hire of said defendants, a team for her use, for the purpose of riding. The said team consisted of a horse and a two-seated wagon; and the plaintiff avers that it was the duty of the said defendants to furnish for her use a safe, suitable and sufficient wagon, but that the defendants, wholly unmindful of their duty, carelessly and negligently, without due care and without notifying her or the said Charles H. Folsom, furnished for her use, an unsafe, insufficient and unsuitable wagon, that the back seat of said wagon was dangerous and defective, and unsecurely and improperly fastened to the body of the wagon; all of which was known to said defendants but unknown to the plaintiff; that while in the exercise of due care the plaintiff was riding upon the public streets of said Skowhegan, to wit, up the hill on Summer street, the horse traveling at a walk, when the back seat of said wagon tipped over by reason of its insecure, unsafe and dangerous fastening, and the plaintiff was thrown violently upon the ground, etc. ...\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-8\">Plea, general issue, not guilty.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-9\"><em>Forrest </em>Goodwin, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-10\">Counsel cited: Stat. 1895,c. 129. The declaration is in tort, the plea is in tort and the evidence tended to prove the tort, and therefore we claim that the plaintiff should not have been- non-suited. If it is contended that the plaintiff is bound by the recital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>in the exceptions, we say no. If the declaration, plea and evidence show that the case could have been maintained, then we should not have been thrown out of court. The decision of the presiding justice was not made upon the recital as it appears in the exceptions, but upon the evidence and pleadings.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-5\"><em>E. N. </em>Merrill, for defendants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-6\">The only question in the case is: was the hiring of the team on Sunday an illegal contract and therefore void?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-7\">The contract between the parties was one of bailment and it was under such a contract that the plaintiff was in possession of the team. It was by virtue of that contract alone that the liability of the defendants, if any, arose; and if in consequence of the negligence of the defendants the plaintiff received an injury, under ordinary circumstances they would be liable. But that is not this case. The hiring by the plaintiff was illegal and the contract void. Both parties were engaged in an illegal and void contract. Such being the case the plaintiff cannot recover. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Latner, </em>60 Maine, 528; <em>Bank </em>v. Kingsley, 84 Maine, 111; <em>Wheelden </em>v. <em>Lyford, </em>84 Maine, 114; <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Crloster, </em>46 Maine, 520.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b561-8\">Sitting: Peters, C.

The plaintiff tendered a return of the horse for breach of warranty of soundness, which was refused, and sues for the price paid for it. The sale was on Sunday. The plaintiff was nonsuit and has exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">The second is an action on the case to recover damages sustained for negligently letting a carriage that was unsafe and unsuitable for the uses for which it had been hired. The hiring was on Sunday, and the damage suffered was on Sunday. The plaintiff was nonsuit and has exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>To both cases \u00a7 20, of c. 124, of R. S., is interposed as a defense. In reply \u00a7 116, of' c. 82, of R. S., is invoked in the first case, and the act of 1895, c. 129, in the second case. The former statute, inherited from Massachusetts, was upon the erection of pur state enacted in 1821, c. 9, \u00a7 2. Among other things it prohibits business, except works of charity or necessity, upon the Lord\u2019s Day. By a long line of decisions this court has held that, by reason of that statute, a contract made on Sunday is void between the parties, and that the consideration therefor cannot be recovered back, and that a tort arising from such contract will not support an action for damages. <em>Towle </em>v. Larrabee, 26 Maine, 464; <em>Hilton </em>v. Houghton, 35 Maine, 143; <em>Morton </em>v. Gloster, 46 Maine, 520; <em>Bank of Cumberland </em>v. <em>Mayberry, </em>48 Maine, 198; <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Linn, </em>50 Maine, 83; <em>Tillock </em>v. Webb, 56 Maine, 100; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Latner, </em>60 Maine, 528; <em>Plaisted </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>63 Maine, 576; <em>Meader </em>v. <em>White, </em>66 Maine, 90; <em>Mace </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>71 Maine, 238; <em>First Natl. Bank of Bar Harbor </em>v. <em>Kingsley, </em>84 Maine, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">This act of 1821 was found, in practice, to work a fraud, by allowing one party to a Sunday contract to retain his fruit of the transaction and to give the other party none, so the legislature, in 1880, (R. S., c. 82, \u00a7 116,) enacted that he who receives a valuable consideration for a contract made on Sunday shall not defend against it on that ground until he restores the consideration. That is, if he will repudiate the contract he must first restore his gains from it. A wholesome doctrine, that will not allow a desecration of the Lord\u2019s Day to become a cheat.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In the first case at bar, the defendant sold a diseased horse for sound, took the purchase money as the price of a sound horse and tries to keep it because he cheated on Sunday, or warranted the horse sound on Sunday, both of which he might do under the statute of 1821 and not be accountable therefor. The plaintiff tendered a return of the horse, which was refused. The tender operated to rescind the contract. It restored the parties to the same condition they were in before the sale, and the purchase money became the plaintiff\u2019s. The defendant cannot resist its return because of the old Sunday law. The same result would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>have followed had the plaintiff sued upon the contract for a breach of warranty. The defendant could not then have defended until he had returned the consideration that he had received for making the warranty. Such return would have precluded a recovery, for the damages might have been more than the price paid, had not the contract been void, for the plaintiff would have been entitled to the benefit of his bargain, that is, the horse, if sound, might have been worth more than the purchase price above what he was worth in the condition sold, unsound. A return of the horse, followed by a suit for the price paid, amounts to substantially the same thing as a suit for breach of the warranty. In either case the statute of 1880 bars the defense of Sunday contract until the price paid shall have been returned. <em>Wentworth </em>v. Woodside, 79 Maine, 156; <em>Berry </em>v. Clary, 77 Maine, 482; <em>Bank </em>v. Kingsley, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In the second case at bar, the plaintiff procured another to hire for her, on Sunday, a horse and carriage for driving. The carriage let was unsafe, whereby the plaintiff was injured. She sues for damages received from the defective carriage while driving on Sunday. The act of 1821, as before seen, would bar recovery, <em>Wheelden </em>v. Lyford, 84 Maine, 114; but the legislature enacted in 1895, c. 129, that the act of 1821, R. S., c. 124, \u00a7 20, shall not bar \u201cany action for a tort or injury suffered on Sunday.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s injury was suffered on Sunday by defendants\u2019 tort, that is, their negligence in letting an unsafe carriage. It matters not whether the plaintiff\u2019s action be assumpsit for breach of an implied warranty to furnish a suitable carriage, or case for negligence in not so doing. In either case, the action would be for an \u201cinjury suffered\u201d on Sunday, and this the act of 1895 expressly excepts from the operation of the statute of 1821.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\n<em>.Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\n<em>Both actions to stand for trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
