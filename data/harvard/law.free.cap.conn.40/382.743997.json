Avery to 1ns son Albert L. Avery, dated January 7th, 1817, and by a conveyance from John J. Avery to his son Erastus Avery, by deed dated March 13th, 1847. John J. Avery was, prior to 1847, the owner in fee of a large tract of land, lying contiguous to the waters of Fisher\u2019s Island Sound, in the town of Groton, and by the former deed conveyed to his son Albert what was known as the south farm, and by the latter deed he conveyed to his son Erastus the north farm. The plaintiffs derive their title from Erastus Avery and those claiming title under him. The defendant derives his title from Albert L. Avery, by deed dated April 27, 1864.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">The deed from John J. Avery to Albert L.

Avery, said privileges consisting in the right to all the rock-weed on the shore from Latham\u2019s Chair, on eastern point, easterly to a sharp rock at the east end of Elihu\u2019s Beach, being at the west end of a clump of rocks, together with the drift manure on the west part of said beach, three-fourths of the length thereof, and likewise all the rock-weed and drift manure from the shore commencing on the east side of the Jonathan Latham lot to the land of John Baker, together with the right of way to and from said shores to collect and to remove said manure in a proper manner on the regular cart ways or such as may hereafter be opened, except the cart way from the Jupiter field bars now running across the lot reserved to me to the south of John Baker\u2019s land, which way is to be turned so as to run from said bar-way to the south and west of said reserved lot where the ground is best adapted for a cart way.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOI\">The deed of Albert L. Avery to the defendant, under which the latter claimed, conveyed to him a part of the land embraced in the deed of John J. Avery to the former, the land thus conveyed bounding upon the sea shore from a certain mark placed on the beach to the end of Jupiter Point; and contained the following clause with regard to the seaweed privilege of the former deed \u2014 \u201cexcepting and reserving all the sea-manure privilege on the shore of the land hereby conveyed ; said manure-privilege having been heretofore sold and conveyed to other parties, the holders of which privilege, their heirs and assigns, are to have the right of way to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>shores for the purpose of removing such manure in accordance with the previous grants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-5\">On the trial the plaintiffs claimed, and offered evidence to prove, that they were owners and cultivators of a part of the Avery north farm, and-that the sea-weed taken by the defendant was taken at two different times and from two different places, and oast of the mow lots on Jupiter Point, once from the upland at a short distance above high-water mark, where the plaintiffs had piled it the fall before, and once from the shore where it had been cast by the action of the waves, near to but below high-water mark. They also claimed, and offered evidence to show, that John J. Avery, in the year 1847, and for a long time prior to that date, had been in the exclusive ownership and possession of the tract of land known as his north and south farm, including the lands of Jupiter Point, down to high-water mark, with all the privileges and appurtenances of a riparian proprietor; and that, down to that date, he had been in the habit of gathering sea-weed which came upon Jupiter Point, east of the mow lots, and of piling the same upon the land above liigh-water mark, letting the same remain there for a time, and then taking it away as convenience might require, to spread upon the farm, and also of gathering sea-weed as it was cast upon the shore, and carting it immediately away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-6\">The counsel for the plaintiffs requested the court to charge the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-7\">\u201c That John J. Avery might in his deed to Albert L. Avery make any reservation to himself or other parties which lie saw fit to do; such reservation being made in terms sufficiently definite to clearly indicate the rights reserved; and that if the jury should find from the evidence that the plaintiffs were cultivators of any portion of the north farm at the time of the alleged trespass, they were entitled to the benefit of the privileges reserved in the deed to Albert L. Avery, (those priviliges being conveyed to Erastus Avery, under whom they claim,) unless there is some provision in some of the deeds clearly excluding them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-8\">\u201c That if the jury should find that the plaintiffs and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>grantors have been in the exercise of the rights claimed under their deeds from 1847, the date of the deed to Albert L. Avery, to the time of the trespass complained of, then, if there be any ambiguity in the terms of the grant from John J. Avery to Albert L. Avery, the contemporaneous construction thus given to the deed by the parties claiming title under it, without objection or question, on the part of the grantor or of Albert L. Avery, for that length of time, or even for fifteen years subsequent to the date of the deed, would be binding on the parties, and render perfect that title in accordance with such user, and free it from further question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">\u201c That the right to sea-weed cast upon the shore is originally in the riparian proprietor, like the right of wharfage, and of fishery by the drawing of nets upon the shore, and not in the public; and although title to sea-weed while growing is in no one, yet that when cast upon the shore it becomes immediately the property of the riparian proprietor, and his title thereto is complete, and he in the constructive possession thereof. That if any parties claim title to sea-weed, as against the owner or riparian proprietor, the burden of proof is on them and they must show their right, and that this can only be shown by deed or prescription; that a right by prescription is a personal right, and that one individual cannot gain such right by prescription for another or for the public. That a right in the public to gather sea-weed from a beach, cannot be created or established by individual acts of trespass. And that when title to land upon a shore is once in an individual, it takes with it the rights of wharfage, fishing and of sea-weed, and an act of the legislature is necessary to render it public property and appropriate it to public use.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">The court charged the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-7\">\u201c That John J. Avery, being the owner of the lands, might in his deed thereof make any reservation, to himself or other parties not strangers, which he saw fit to do, of any right or interest which he had in the lands ; such reservation being made in terms sufficiently definite to clearly indicate the rights reserved. Whatever right or title John J. Avery had, \u2022as proprietor of land adjoining the sea shore, to sea-weed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>cast upon tlie shore, he by the reservation in his deed to Albert L. Avery, and by his deed to Erastus Avery, conveyed the same to Erastus Avery, and Erastus Avery could convey the same to the plaintiffs, they being cultivators of the nortl farm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">\u201cIf there was an ambiguity in the terms of the grant from John J. Avery to Erastus Avery, evidence of occupation and user might be resorted to as contemporaneous construction to show the subject matter of the grant and what right or estate was intended to be conveyed; but in the present case there is no such ambiguity; the right reserved and conveyed by the deeds was the right to gather and pile sea-weed upon the shore. The term shore, as applied to the sea or an arm of it, has in law a particular meaning, and means that space of ground between ordinary high and low water mark. The title to the soil of proprietors of land bordering upon the sea or upon navigable rivers extends to high-water mark, and their title to the soil ends where the shore begins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">\u201c The title to the soil upon the <em>shore, </em>(that is, between ordinary high and low water mark,) is in the state, in trust for the public, and the public may go upon the shore, dig shell-fish, draw seines, or gather sea-weed, without license or accountability to the owner of the adjoining upland. But sea-weed thrown up by the weaves, if found at or above high-water mark on the lands of the adjoining proprietor, belongs to such adjoining proprietor; but if cast and left upon the <em>shore </em>it belongs to the public, and may be lawfully appropriated by the first occupant who gathers and removes it within twenty-four hours.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-7\">\u201c The plaintiffs claim to recover for two acts of trespass, one for throwing off from the defendant\u2019s upland upon the shore, a small heap of sea-weed or sea-manure about the 1st of July, 1870, which had been gathered and laid there in September, 1869. As the plaintiffs are limited by their deeds to piling sea-weed upon the shore, they had no right, <em>by virtue of their deeds or the reservations therein, </em>to pile it upon the upland, and if the same became and was a nuisance to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>defendant, destroying his grass, as he claims, he had a right to remove the same and cast it upon the shore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">\u201cAs to the other charge, if the sea-weed was gathered on the shore, that is between ordinary high and low water mark, the defendant, as one of the public, had the right to take it:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiffs moved for a new trial for error in the charge of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-7\"><em>Lippitt </em>and <em>Halsey, </em>in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-8\">We contend that the charge is erroneous in three particulars <em>: </em>\u2014 First: In the construction given to the reservation. Second: In excluding the evidence of occupation and user. Third: In ruling that the sea-weed cast by the sea upon the shore was the property of the first occupant who removes it in twenty-four hours.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-9\">1. The reservation should be construed in the same way as a grant by the owner of the soil of a similar right or privilege. <em>French </em>v. <em>Carhart, </em>1 Comst., 96. The same rule prevails in the construction of other instruments. Thus, an exception in a policy of insurance is to be construed in the same manner- as a policy insuring against the excepted risk. <em>Ionides </em>v. <em>Universal Marine Ins. Co., </em>14 Com. Bench, N. S., 259. In the construction of deeds and other instruments the intention of the parties is to govern, and when the language used is susceptible of more than one interpretation courts will look at the surrounding circumstances existing when the contract is entered into, such as the situation of the parties and of the subject matter. <em>French </em>v. <em>Carhart, </em>1 Comst., 102; <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>22 Conn., 98. Taking into view the situation of the parties, the subject matter, and the purpose of the reservation, it is obvious that the parties did not intend to limit the reservation to the \u201c shore\u201d technically.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-10\">2. The undisturbed use of the right on the one side, and the acquiescence on the other, are admissible, and justly entitled to weight in the construction of the reservation. <em>French </em>v. <em>Carhart, </em>1 Comst., 102, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-11\">3. Sea-weed, when cast upon a shore where the adjacent upland is private property, belongs to the riparian proprietor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>It becomes and is to be treated in law as part and parcel of the soil. This was judicially declared by the Supreme Court of New York in <em>Emans </em>v. Turnbull, 2 Johns., 313. In <em>Chapman </em>v. Kimball, 9 Conn., 42, Daggett, J., says the opinion in that case is \u201cvery able\u201d and \u201centitled to much respect.\u201d In <em>Phillips </em>v. Rhodes, 7 Met., 323, Hubbard, J., says: \u201c The seaweed which is thrown up belongs to the owner of the beach ; \u201d citing <em>Emans </em>v. <em>Turnbull </em>for authority. Bigelow, C. J., in <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>2 Allen, 549, says: \u201cBy a liberal construction of the <em>jus alluvionis, </em>it is held that sea-wetd, kelp, and other marine plants, when detached from the bottom of the sea and thrown on the shore or beach, become vested in the owner of the soil; \u201d citing, among other cases, <em>Emans </em>v. <em>Turnbull. </em>Bellows, J., in <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>43 N. Hamp., 620, says: \u201c In <em>Emans </em>v. <em>Turnbull </em>it was held that sea-weed cast upon the shore was such a marine increase as belonged to the riparian owner, and lie might justify a resistance to its removal.\u201d In <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>48 Maine, 100, it was held that the right to take sea-weed from the shore is not an easement, but is a right to take a profit in the soil. <em>Emans </em>v. <em>Turnbull </em>is cited in that case with approval. In <em>Church </em>v. <em>Meeker, </em>34 Conn., 433, Butler, O. J., cites the case of <em>Emans </em>v. Turnbull, and adverting to the fact that the decision had been approved in Massachusetts and elsewhere, and there being none the other way, says: \u201c We are disposed to follow it also, for the sake of uniformity and certainty in respect to a matter of growing importance.\u201d It is true the case did not call for a decision of the question, for the plain, tiff was not a riparian proprietor, but as the Chief Justice spoke for the whole court, it is presumed that the opinion upon the point expressed the views of the court. Angell in his valuable work on Tide Waters, page 259, lays down the same rule, and cites <em>Emans </em>v. <em>Turnbull </em>with approval. The authorities are all on one side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\">4. While by the common law, which prevails in this state the riparian proprietor upon an arm of the sea owns only to liigh-water mark, and all below that is in the public for purposes of navigation and commerce, yet he has certain ina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>portant rights in the shore as incident to his riparian ownership. He has the exclusive right to wharf out in front of his land. <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>7 Conn., 186; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>9 id., 42; <em>Simons </em>v. <em>French, </em>25 id., 346. Ejectment will lie for an entry upon it and ouster of the riparian owner. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>15 Conn., 137. So he may maintain trespass <em>quare clausum fregit </em>for an entry upon the shore, unconnected with the right of navigation or fishing, and removing therefrom manure mixed with the soil. <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>43 N. Hamp., 609. He has the right to the water as appurtenant to the upland, and he cannot be cut off from it against his consent by any extraneous addition to his upland. Angell on Tide Waters, 71, and cases cited. In <em>Blundell </em>v. <em>Catterall, </em>5 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Ald., 298, it was held that trespass lay for occupying the shore with machines for bath, ing. In <em>Bagott </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>2 Bos. <em>&amp; </em>Pul., 472, an action of trespass for entry upon the shore adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s land, and carrying away therefrom shell-fisli and shells which had been thrown up and left there by the tide, and justification pleaded of common right to take them, the court held the plea good as to the fish, but paused as to the shells, and allowed the defendant to amend his plea by striking out his claim in regard to the shells, which offer was accepted; leaving that part of the trespass unjustified. Best, Sergeant, in his argument says: \u201c It is well known that in many parts of England much of the various matter which is deposited upon the shore by the sea belongs to the owners of the adjacent soil, and is disposed of by them to very great advantage.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-5\">5. The court erred in supposing this to be a \u201c public beach.\u201d A public beach is one adjoining a public highway or ground. <em>Church </em>v. <em>Meeker, </em>34 Conn., 433.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\">6. The defendant is estopped from disputing the plaintiff\u2019s right to the sea-weed cast upon the shore. He holds his title expressly subject to the reservation of the sea-manure privilege of the shore. Whatever rights John J. Avery had as riparian owner he reserved. If his rights were only such as are common to the public, they would be more valuable to him than to others, as he alone had access to the shore, except by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>water. If the defendant may now take the weed, the only right under the reservation will be a right of way to the shore to get such weed as the defendant may see fit to leave, and, as he is nearest to the shore, the right will be valueless. By accepting the deed he assented to the reservation, and became bound to observe it. <em>Randall </em>v. Latham, 86 Conn., 48.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-5\"><em>Brandegee </em>and Waller, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-6\">1. The rule is well settled, that parol testimony is never allowed to contradict, alter or explain a written contract, unless in case of a latent ambiguity. There was no such ambiguity in the deed of John J. Avery, reserving to himself the sea-manure privilege of the shore.\u201d Where the language of an instrument has received a settled legal construction, parol evidence is not admissible to contradict that construction. 1 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 277. The word \u201c shore \u201d has received a settled legal construction. It is that space of ground which is between high and low water mark. Hale, De Jure Maris, chap. 6; 2 Hilliard R. Prop., 351; 3 Kent Com., 427; 2 Washb. R. Prop., 634; <em>East Haven </em>v. Hemingway, 7 Conn., 186; <em>Church </em>v. <em>Meeker, </em>34 id., 424; <em>Storer </em>v. Freeman, 6 Mass., 435; <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>13 Pick., 264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-8\">2. The title to sea-weed, cast upon the shore, that is,between ordinary high and low-water mark, has never been decided in Connecticut. It was involved in the decision of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>9 Conn., 38, and again in that of <em>Church </em>v. <em>Meeker, </em>34 id., 433. But an examination of these cases will clearly show that the court in each case deliberately abstained from passing upon this-question; restricting the opinion in the former case with the greatest care to sea-weed below low-water mark, and in the latter to sea-weed above high-water mark. The question at bar is then an open one. It is to be settled upon principle, in view of the analogies of the common law, and with special reference to the uniform current of Connecticut decisions, as to the respective rights of the public and riparian proprietors, in other respects, on the shores of the sea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-9\">3. Sea-weed in a state of nature, fast or floating, is tho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>property ol no one. It lias never been subjected to the law o\u00ed \u201c prime occupancy,\u201d which is the ultimate foundation of all title. It has grown upon no man\u2019s land. It has received no man\u2019s culture. It has been reduced to no man\u2019s possession. Like wreck; or treasure trove, or animals <em>feres natures, </em>its title vests in the first occupant. 2 Bla. Com., <em>401; Haslem </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>37 Conn., 500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-5\">4. The plaintiffs\u2019 claim to occupancy in this case rests solely upon their ownership of the adjoining upland. The case finds that the sea-weed was neither upon their land, nor in their actual possession. Their claim is therefore based upon a constructive occupancy of the weed, arising out of a constructive possession of the land upon which the weed was cast.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-6\">5. This brings us to a consideration of what rights a riparian proprietor has in'the shore adjacent to his upland, according to the principles of Connecticut law and the Connecticut authorities. And we maintain, contrary to the policy which has been adopted in other states, and noticeably in Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire, from which the other side draw their authorities, that the uniform doctrine of this court has been, \u201c that the title to soil of a riparian proprietor extends only to high-water mark, and that the right of the public begins where the right of the proprietor ends.\u201d <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>7 Conn., 202; <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Sage, </em>8 id., 227; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>9 id., 40; <em>Church </em>v. <em>Meeker, </em>34 id., 425. The only right incident to the ownership of the upland, over the shore, and below the line where his title ceases, is the right of reclamation and wharfage. This right, privilege, or easement, originally a <em>Purpresture, </em>or encroachment upon the royal prerogative, tolerated at first for the benefit of commerce and for the encouragement of navigation, has now come to be regarded as attached to the ownership of the upland. It is protected by the courts, and, when exercised, ripens into a title, which is treated as real estate. <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>7 Conn., 202; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>9 id., 41; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>15 id., 138; <em>Frink </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>20 id., 117; <em>Simons </em>v. <em>French, </em>25 id., 352. But this right, founded upon the interests of navigation, ceases with the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>sons upon which alone it was justified, and has never been extended to the needs of agriculture. It is an encroachment or nuisance, in derogation of public rights, tolerated only because superior public interests were promoted by it. Nor was title to or interest in the soil of the shore ever passed by this doctrine, until the right was exercised by actual reclamation. Until then, all rights of the public were superior, that is, of passage, of fishery, of navigation, of bathing, of taking shell fish, &amp;c. The right of fishery below high-water mark is conceded to be in the public. So the right to dig up the soil for shell fish has been in this state decided to be \u201c <em>publici juris.\u201d Peck </em>v. Lockwood, 5 Day, 22. Why not, upon the same principle, the right to collect sea-weed which has not mixed with the soil, and is a waif until reduced to possession ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-6\">6. The cases relied on by the plaintiffs will each upon examination be found to affirm the doctrine \u201c that sea-weed cast upon soil belonging to a riparian proprietor vests in such proprietor because of the ownership of the soil. In <em>Church </em>v. <em>Meeker, </em>34 Conn., 428, the reasoning of Butler, C. J., proceeds upon that assumption. In <em>Emans </em>v. Turnbull, 2 Johns., 314, the case shows that the title to the soil upon which weed was cast was in the defendant. In <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>7 Met., 322, the fee was in the plaintiff, by the ordinance of 1641, by which the state of Massachusetts adopted the policy of extending the fee of all riparian proprietors one hundred feet from high-water mark. In <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>48 Maine, 98, the only question decided was that the right to take sea-weed was not an easement, but a <em>profit a prendre. </em>In <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>43 N. Hamp., 621, the court find the law of Massachusetts, (ordinance of 1641,) applicable to New Hampshire, and consequently that the fee of the <em>locus in quo </em>was in the plaintiff. In the two English cases, <em>Bagott </em>v. <em>Orr, </em>2 Bos. &amp; Pul., 472, and <em>Blundell </em>v. <em>Catterall, </em>5 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Ald., 258, it is specially found in the statement that the fee of the <em>locus in quo </em>was in the lord of the manor, by grant from the king. No case can be found where, the fee of the soil being in the public, title to abandoned property cast upon such soil vests in the adjacent riparian proprietor. And it is believed that no good reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>can be given why title to personal property, which upon all the principles of the common law vests in the public, should be vested in an individual, solely because he has been permitted successfully to encroach upon other public rights, and to defend against an indictment on the ground that he has not created a nuisance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-6\">7. As there is no principle of law, so there is no consideration of equity, that sustains the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The riparian owner already has, by the rule adopted in <em>Church </em>v. Meeker, the exclusive title to all the marine manure cast at or above ordinary high-water mark. This embraces nearly the whole product of the sea, because it is usually cast up in storms or violent winds, which carry and deposit it'above the ordinary range of the tide. He has also, by the advantage of his position, the opportunity to throw the sea-weed, immediately upon its deposit, above the shore line, and thus appropriate it by occupation. To hold that title to all weed, both upon shore and upland, absolutely vests in him, is to give him the monopoly of this valuable marine increment, and to reduce the vaunted rights of the public upon the shores of the \u201c great highway of the world\u201d to a sham and a myth.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b394-7\">Seymour, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_6\">The first count of the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration is in trespass for the taking and converting to his own use by the defendant of large quantities of sea-weed alleged to be the proper goods and estate of the plaintiffs. This seaweed was cast upon the shore adjoining the defendant\u2019s land, and was there, below higli-water mark, taken by the defendant and converted to 1ns own use. The Court of Common Pleas, against the request of the plaintiffs, instructed the jury, in substance, that sea-weed cast and left upon the shore, (that is, between ordinary high and low-water mark,) <em>primd facie </em>belongs to the public and may lawfully be appropriated by the first occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">To' this charge the plaintiffs object, and the principal question in the case arises upon this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">A different question arises under the second count, which will be considered in its proper place.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>It is conceded that by the settled law of Connecticut the title of a riparian proprietor terminates at ordinary high-water mark. It is also conceded that though his title in fee thus terminates, yet he has certain privileges in the adjoining-waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Among the most important of these privileges are \u2014 (1.) That of access to the deep sea. (2.) The right to extend his lands into the water by means of wharves, subject to the qualification that he thereby does no injury to the free navigation of the water by the public. (8.) The right by accretion to whatever lands by natural or artificial means are reclaimed from the sea, subject however to certain qualifications not necessary here to be mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The plaintiffs claim that among the privileges of the riparian proprietor is also that of the exclusive right to the seaweed which is cast upon the shore and left there by the recoding tide.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In respect to the weed cast by extraordinary floods upon the land of the proprietor and there left above ordinary high-water mark, the law of this state is settled, in conformity with what wc understand to he the common law of England. The owner of the soil has it <em>ratione soli. </em>No other person can then take it without a trespass upon the owner\u2019s land, and as owner of the land he is deemed to he constructively the first occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">But below high-water mark the soil does not belong to the owner of the upland. The sea-weed in dispute was not taken from the plaintiffs\u2019 land, and their title, if they have a title, is not <em>ratione soli. </em>No trespass on the plaintiffs\u2019 land was committed by the defendant in taking the weed, for the taking of which recovery is sought in this count<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Upon what ground then can the plaintiffs sustain the title which they claim to the weed ? While it was floating on the tide it was <em>publici juris. </em>Why, when it is left on the shore by the receding tide, should it become their property ?</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In Massachusetts and Maine, by virtue of the Colonial Ordinance of 1641, the individual title of proprietors adjoining navigable water extends to low-water mark. Sea-weed left by the receding tides being then on private property, the owner of the soil has title <em>ratione soli, </em>not only to sea-weed but to other articles cast upon and left on the shore. Thus in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>13 Pick., 255, a stick of timber was thrown up and had lodged on the shore within the old colony of Plymouth. The question is largely discussed by Shaw, Ch. J., whether the ordinance of 1641 extends to the colony of Plymouth. That being settled, the learned judge proceeds to say: \u201c Considering it as thus established that the place upon which this timber was thrown and had lodged was the soil and freehold of the plaintiff, the defendants cannot justify their entry for the purpose of taking away or marking the timber. We are of opinion that such entry was a trespass, and that, as between the plaintiff and defendant, the plaintiff had in virtue of his title to the soil the preferable riglit of possession, and that the plaintiff has a right to recover the agreed value of the timber.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The cases therefore in Massachusetts and Maine which decide that sea-weed left on the shore belongs to the riparian proprietor have no application here. In New Hampshire the Massachusetts ordinance is adopted as law.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In New York the common law rule is adopted, as with us, in relation to the boundary line between the public and the riparian proprietor, and it is claimed that in <em>Emans </em>v. <em>Turnbull, </em>2 Johns. R., 313, the question before us is decided in conformity with the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The judgment in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>case is pronounced by a judge of profound learning, whose opinion upon the point now under discussion, if really given, would be entilied-to great weight; but we are inclined lo think that the sea-weed in that case was cast upon the land of the plaintiff. The main argument at the bar and on the bench relates to the title to the locus in quo. Chief Justice Kent says : \u2014 \u201c If the marine increase be by small and imperceptible degrees, it goes to the owner of the land. The sea-weed must be supposed to harm accumulated gradually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In the case avc are called on to decide the sea-Aveed could not be regarded as a marine increase of the plaintiffs\u2019 land, for it had not reached their land and Avas not attached to it nor connected with it. To be a marine increase it must form part and parcel of the land itself. Being between high and low-water mark, at each returning tide it Avould be afloat, and even in Massachusetts sea-weed Avheu afloat is <em>publiei juris, </em>although floating over soil Avliicli is private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The sea-Aveed in this suit is not treated as part of the real estate which by small and imperceptible degrees had become part of the plaintiffs\u2019 land. It is treated as personal property, and the defendant is sued for taking it as such and coi-iArerting it to his own use. In the case of <em>Emans </em>v. <em>Turnbull </em>the plaintiff\u2019s title was held good upon a liberal construction of the <em>jus alluvionis, </em>which implies that the weed had then become part and parcel of the plaintiff\u2019s land and must therefore have been aboAre or upon ordinary high-water mark. Title to personal property <em>jus alluvionis </em>would be a novelty in the law. 2 Black. Com., 262. Title by accretion is substantially the same as by alluvion. Both are modes of acquiring title to real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Title however to personal property may be acquired by what in law is called accession, but to acquire title by accession the accessory thing must be united to the principal, so as to constitute part and parcel of it. \u201c Accessio\u201d is defined by Bouvier as \u201c a manner of acquiring the property in a thing which becomes <em>united </em>with that which a person already possesses.\u201d The plaintiffs therefore seem to us to have no title by alluvion, or by accretion, or by accession, certainly none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>roblone soli, </em>and they cannot be regarded as first occupants by construction merely because of the <em>propinquity </em>of their land to the property in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The question under discussion does not seem to be fully settled in England. The soil of the sea-shore is there, as with us, <em>primd facie </em>in the public, bitt it may become private property, and frequently is so, where the adjoining lands are part of the manor. The authority of Bracton is clearly in favor, (1st,) of the common right <em>of all </em>to the <em>shores </em>of the sea as <em>part of the sea itself. </em>(2d.) In Liber 2, speaking of the right of first occupancy, he says \u201cItem, locum luibet eadem species occupationis in iis quae communia sunt, sicut in mare et <em>littore marls, in lappillis et geminis et ceteris in littore maris </em>inventis.\u201d Sea-weed must be included within the <em>et ceteris </em>of Bracton in this passage, and upon liis authority belongs to the first occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The opinion of Lord Hale in favor of the common right to take sea-weed on the shore is shown by the following passage in chapter 6 of Hale do Jure Maris. After speaking of three kinds of shore he says, \u201c This kind of shore, to wit, that which is covered by the ordinary flux of the ocean, may belong to a subject, and may be parcel of a manor, and the evidences to prove it parcel of a manor are commonly these, constant and usual fetching of gravel and sea-weed and sea-sand, between high and low-water mark, and <em>licensing others so to do.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In the case however of <em>Bagott </em>v. <em>Orr, 2 Bos. &amp; </em>Pul., 472, the court expressed doubts upon the right of the public to come upon the shore and take shells which had been thrown up and left there by the tide.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">In the case of <em>Blundell </em>v. <em>Catterall </em>there occurs a very learned and interesting discussion upon the right of the public between high and low-water mark, but the precise question now under our consideration is not made the subject of comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The case of <em>Church </em>v. <em>Meeker, </em>34 Conn. R., 421, is relied upon by both parties. We think the opinion of Judge But<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ler in that case must he construed as applicable solely to seaweed found as it there was above high-water mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In the case of <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Lockwood, </em>5 Day, 22, the plaintiff owned a portion of the shore below ordinary high-water mark, and it was held that he could not maintain trespass against the defendant, who entered the premises when the tide was out and dug for shell fish and carried the fish away. That is a strong case in favor of the common right of fishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">But the right of taking sea-weed would seem to stand on the same ground as the right of taking fish. We see no reason for making a distinction <em>between the </em>vegetable and animal products of tlio ocean. Neither in the stale of nature is the property of any one; the title to both depends upon the first occupancy. It is agreed that while afloat both are alike common; why, when the tide recedes and leaves shellfish and sea-weed on the shore, should the sea-weed belong to the riparian proprietor when confessedly the shell-fish remains common properly ?</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">We think the charge of the judge in regard to the first count was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">In respect to the second count a different question arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The plaintiffs under that count claimed to recover for the throwing off from the defendant\u2019s upland upon tlio shore a small heap of sea-weed which liad been gathered by the plaintiffs and laid there. The plaintiffs claimed the right to pile it on the upland where it was piled, and the defendant denied the right and justified the removal of the heap as a nuisance. The conveyances upon which this question depends are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Prior to January 7th, 1847, John J. Avery was the owner of a large tract of land in the town of Groton lying contiguous to the waters of Fishers\u2019 Island Sound, divided into two farms, and hounding southerly for some distance on <em>\u201c </em>salt water.\u201d On that day ho conveyed to his son, Albert L. Avery, the south part of the farm, reserving \u201c all the sea-manure privilege of the shore east of the mow lots north of Pine Island, &lt;fcc., with the privilege of piling Tip said sea-manure on the shore, and then re-carting to the north <em>farm; </em>for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the use of his son Erastus Avery, or whosoever should improve his said north farm.\u201d On the 18th of March, 1847, he conveyed to his son Erastus Avery the north farm, and also \u201cthe <em>manure privileges </em>reserved in a deed from me to Albert L. Avery; said privileges consisting in the right to all the rock-weed on the shore from Latham\u2019s Chair, on Eastern Point, easterly to a sharp rock at the East end of Elihu\u2019s Beach, being at the west end of a clump of rocks, together with the drift manure on the west part of said beach, three-fourths of the length thereof; and likewise all the rock-weed and drift-manure from the shore, commencing on the east side of the Jonathan Latham lot, to the land of .John Baker, together with the right of way to and from said shores, to collect and to remove said manure in a proper manner, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The plaintiffs claimed title under the foregoing deed to Erastus Avery. The defendant\u2019s title was under a deed dated the 27th of April, 1864, from Albert L. Avery, which convoyed to the defendant a portion of the south farm, which had been conveyed to him in 1847, bounding on the shore, \u201c excepting and reserving all the sea-manure privilege on the shore of the land hereby granted, said manure privilege having been sold and conveyed to other parties, the holders of which privilege, their heirs and assigns, are to have the right of way to the shores for the purpose of removing such manure in accordance with provisions granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The court charged the jury that, as the plaintiffs are limited by their deeds to piling sea-weed <em>\u201con the shore\u201d </em>they had no right by virtue of their deeds and reservations therein to pile it upon the <em>upland. </em>The defendant\u2019s argument is that the word \u201c shore\u201d has a definite and inflexible meaning in law, denoting the space between ordinary high and low-water mark. It is true that the word is now generally used in treatises on navigable waters in that sense, but Lord Hale says there be three kinds of shore. (Hale do Jure Maris, chap. 6.) One of these three kinds is the space between high and low-water mark. Both the other kinds embrace portions of the land above ordinary high-water mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Webster, in his Dictionary, defines shore thus: \u2014 \u201c The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>coast or land adjacent to the ocean, sea or a large lake or river.\u201d He says we use the word to express the laud near the border of the sea or of a great lake to an indefinite extent, as when we say \u201c a town stands on the shore.\u201d Bonvier defines shore as \u201cland on the side of the sea or a lake or river.\u201d He gives to the compound word \u201c sea-shore\u201d the more limited meaning of land between high and low-water mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The privilege of piling the manure above high-water mark, on the margin of the land granted, is a valuable privilege and a proper subject of reservation, for it reserves a right in the thing granted, hut the land below ordinary higli-wator mark not belonging to the grantor, tlio reservation of a right to pile sea-weed there would be the reservation of a right not in nor upon the land granted, hut wholly outside of it. The reservation ought to ho construed as reserving something which but for the reservation would have passed by the deed; but the right to pile sea-weed between high and low-water mark is a right which, as we have already seen, does not pertain to the riparian proprietor. Besides, such a right would bo of small value, if indeed of any value, for each returning tide would probably scatter the pile.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In regard to this count, wo think the construction given to the reservation was wrong, and therefore adviso a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\"> Both the judge and the counsel in discussing the abstract question of the title to sea-weed left upon the shore, speak of the adjoining upland as the land of the plaintiffs. The plaintiff's\u2019 rights as to the sea-weed were precisely what they would have been if they had been in fact the owners of the upland, since they took whatever rights in this respect were originally owned by John J. Avery as owner of the upland ; those entire rights having been reserved in his deed of the land to Albert L. Avery, and afterwards conveyed entire to Erastus Avery, from whom they came to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs therefore stood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>only upon an easement, but their rights under that easement, so far as the shore was concerned, were those of adjoining owners. It would require so much circumlocution to state their position with accuracy every time there is occasion to refer to it, that it as well to consider them, for the purposes of the discussion, as in fact owners of the upland. \u00dc.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
