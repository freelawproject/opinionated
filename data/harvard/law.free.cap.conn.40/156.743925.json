If no time should he stated the declaration would he ill on demurrer. 1 Swift Dig., 601, 603, 640, 652, 651, 702; <em>Story </em>v. <em>Barrell, </em>2 Conn., 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The allegation in the declaration \u201c that the defendants <em>heretofore </em>did seize <em>&amp;c.,\u201d </em>cannot he regarded as a sufficient allegation of the time when the trespass took place. It is in fact no allegation of any time. The word <em>heretofore </em>simply denotes time past in distinction from time present or time future. It is only one of the three great divisions into which all time is divided by grammarians, time past, time present, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>and time future. The use of the past tense by the declaration in the averment that the defendants \u201c <em>did </em>seize, take and carry away\u201d the property described, \u201c and <em>converted </em>and <em>disposed </em>of the same,\u201d denote precisely the same thing. They represent that the transactions took place in time past, and they are equally as specific as the word <em>heretofore </em>regarding the time when the defendants did the acts complained of. It must he conceded that there is as distinct a designation of time in this declaration without the word <em>heretofore </em>as with it, and the word might as well have been omitted. It follows therefore, if the allegation of time in this declaration is sufficient, that in no case whatsoever 'can the allegation he insufficient, for every declaration necessarily must allege the acts complained of as having been done in time past. We are satisfied therefore that the allegation is insufficient. 3 Chitty\u2019s Pleading, 1248, 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The plaintiff further claims that the statute which provides that \u201cno.writ or pleading shall be abated, set aside, or reversed for any kind of circumstantial errors or defects, if the person and cause can be rightly <em>understood,\u201d (Gen. </em>Statutes, tit. 1, sec. 90,) practically sets aside special demurrers. But that statute was never designed to affect demurrers. It has. been in existence nearly two hundred years, and has been preserved unaltered during this long period of time, though revision after revision of the statutes has been made and scores of. cases have been tried in the higher courts upon special demurrers, no question being made but that such pleas were proper. The following cases seenr fully to recognize the propriety of special demurrers, and virtually decide the question against the plaintiff. <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>6 Conn., 1; <em>Kilbourn </em>v. <em>The State, </em>9 Conn., 560; <em>Canfield </em>v. <em>Merrick, </em>11 Conn., 425; <em>Holly </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>14 Conn., 255; <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>18 Conn., 286; <em>Darrow </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>20 Conn., 288; <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Sturges, </em>23 Conn., 134; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>24 Conn., 522; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Knapp, 25 </em>Conn., 510; <em>Havens </em>v. <em>Hartford &amp; N. Haven R. R. Co., </em>26 Conn., 220; <em>Same </em>v. <em>Same, </em>28 Conn., 69; <em>Church v. Meeker, </em>34 Conn., 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>We therefore advise the Superior Court that there is no error in the judgment complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
