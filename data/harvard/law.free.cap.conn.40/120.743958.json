On the 18th of February, 1870, the grandchild, Louisa Hughes Austin, being then a minor under the age of twenty-one years, and having her domicil in New Haven, died intestate, never having had any husband or children or brother or sister. There survived her, her father, Willis R. Austin, her aunts, the said Mary H. Wells, Cornelia H. Dayton and Eleanor C. Hughes, her uncle, the said Edward B. Hughes, her great aunt, Grace M. Wight, and her grandmother, Louisa W. B. Hughes, the widow of the said Enos B. M. Hughes. The widow died on the 6th day of October, 1872.

Austin took a vested interest under the will, subject to be divested in the event of none of the children of the testator, or their lawful issue, being alive at the death of the testator\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-9\">1. The language of the bequest is such as, upon a well established rule, to create a vested estate. The rule as laid down by Roper (on Legacies, Vol. I., 394,) is, that where an estate is bequeathed \u201c in fractional interests in succession at periods which must arrive, (as to or in trust for <em>A. </em>for life, and after his death to <em>B,') </em>the interests of the first and subsequent takers will vest together, and notwithstanding <em>B </em>may die before <em>A, </em>his personal* representatives will he entitled to receive the legacy upon the death of A.\u201d The following cases are cited by Mr. Roper in support of ibis proposition. <em>Monkhouse </em>v. <em>Holme, </em>1 Brown C. C., 298; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Crispin, </em>id., 386; <em>Benyon </em>v. <em>Maddison, </em>2 id., 75; <em>Scurfield v. Howes, </em>3 id., 91; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Langford, </em>3 Ves., 119; <em>Wadley </em>v. North, id., 364; <em>Blamire </em>v. Geldart, 16 id., 314. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>To the same effect are- the later text writers. 1 Jarman on Wills, 758; 2 Redfield on Wills, 215. The cases cited by those authors are very numerous. The leading case from our own reports is <em>Throop </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>5 Conn., 98, which established the doctrine in this state, and has never been overruled. The provision with regard to the decease of his wife does not create a condition precedent, but is simply a direction as to the time when possession is to be taken. 2 Redfield on Wills, 235; 1 Jarman on Wills, 725.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-5\">2. The fact that there is a limitation over, by way of executory devise, does not prevent the vesting of the estate. It merely renders it subject to be divested upon the happening of the contingency. Therefore, in the case at har, the estate being vested by the terms of the devise, and being entailed, as far as possible, consistently with the statute against perpetuities, the gifts over, in certain contingencies, have no effect to prevent the vesting of the estate in Louisa H. Austin; but simply point out certain contingencies, by which she or her heirs would have been divested, had either of them happened. The English authorities are numerous and uniform on this point. <em>Shepherd </em>v. Ingram, Ambler, 448; <em>Galland </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>1 Swanst., 161; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Foreman, </em>5 Ves., 209; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Willock, </em>9 id., 233; <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Dallas, </em>14 id., 576; <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>16 id., 413; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lord Kenyon, </em>3 Madd., 410; <em>Sturgess </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>4 id., 411; <em>Leeming </em>v. <em>Sheratt, </em>2 Hare, 14; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>25 Jurist, 178; <em>Mariott </em>v. <em>Abel, </em>Law Reps., 7 Eq. Cas., 478. The American cases are of the same purport, but it will be sufficient to refer to that of <em>Dale </em>v. <em>White, </em>in our own court, 33 Conn., 294.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-6\">3. The fact that the estate is to be distributed to the children who \u201c may be living\u201d at the deceas\u00f3 of his wife, does not prevent the vesting of the estate. It vests in all the children, subject to be divested in favor of the suzwivors at the poz'iod of distribution. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lord Kenyon, </em>3 Madd., 410; <em>Sturgess </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>4 id., 311; <em>Belk </em>v. <em>Slack, </em>1 Keen, 238; <em>In re Sanders\u2019s Trusts, </em>Law Reps., 1 Eq. Cas., 683; <em>Nodine </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>7 Paige, 544; <em>Williamson v. Field, </em>2 Sandf. Ch., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>533. Even if the words making distribution to the children who may be living at the death of the testator\u2019s wife import contingency, so far as the children are concerned, so that the bequest would not vest until the time of distribution, this does not affect the gift to Louisa H. Austin, who was one of an independent class \u2014 \u201cthe issue of those who may have deceased.\u201d No words of survivorship attach to the vesting of the bequest to this class. The rule in such cases is thus stated: \u201c A gift to children of <em>A, </em>living at a given period, <em>and </em>the issue of such as shall be then dead. Here the gift to the issue is independent, and the issue of a child dying in the testator\u2019s lifetime, or dead at the date of the will, is entitled.\u201d This rule has been in some doubt, but the recent cases have settled it as above. In <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Holgate, </em>Law Reps., 1 House of Lords Cas., 175, the question was fully and elaborately discussed, the conflicting decisions criticised, and the rule established. The following cases, constituting a preponderance of authority in favor of the rule, preceded that of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Holgate. Lyon </em>v. <em>Coward, </em>15 Sim., 287; <em>Barker v. Barker, </em>5 De G. <em>&amp; </em>Sm., 753; <em>Re Wildman\u2019s. Trusts, </em>1 Johns. <em>&amp; </em>Hem., 299; <em>Penny </em>v. Clark, 1 De G., F. &amp; J., 425. And the following American cases; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>54 Maine, 233; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Hebbard, </em>1 Bradf., 256; <em>Long </em>v. <em>Labor, </em>8 Penn. S. R., 229. Since the case of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Holgate, </em>the following decision has been rendered in accordance with it: <em>In re Orton\u2019s Trust, </em>Law Reps., 3 Eq. Cas., 375. The point considered settled by this decision is, \u201c that if a legacy is given to <em>A, </em>and in case of his death to his children, and both <em>A </em>and his children die before the period of distribution, the representatives of the children take.\u201d 1 Am. Law Rev., 735.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-5\">4. There is nothing in the context of the will requiring the insertion of the words, \u201c then living,\u201d into the clause of gift to the issue. The fact that a provision was made that twotliirds should \u201c vest\u201d on the re-marriage of his wife, does not make this a contingent bequest. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Forbisher, </em>5 DeG. &amp; Sm., 191; <em>Berkeley </em>v. <em>Swinburne, </em>16 Sim., 275; <em>Fdmondson\u2019s </em>estate, Law Reps., 5 Eq. Cas., 389; <em>Thompson v. Thompson, </em>28 Barb., 436.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>5. Nor does the gift over in certain contingencies affect the vesting. This point has been fully discussed in the cases cited above. In the language of the Master of the Rolls, (5 Ves., 209),where a vested interest has been created, \u201c the court will never permit the absolute gift to be defeated, unless it be perfectly clear that the <em>very case </em>has happened in which it is declared that the interest shall not arise.\u201d The doctrine laid down in the text books is the same. It is clear that the \u201c very case\u201d upon which the interest was to be divested has not arisen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-5\">6. The vesting of estates is favored by the courts. 2 Redfield on Wills, 245; Hawkins on Wills, 237. To quote the language of Rest, O. J.: \u201c It has long been an established rule for the guidance of the court, that all estates are to bo holdon to be vested, except estates in the devise of which a condition, precedent to the vesting, is so clearly expressed that the courts cannot treat them as vested without deciding in direct opposition to the terms of the will.\u201d <em>Duffield </em>v. <em>Duffield, </em>1 Dow <em>&amp; </em>Clark, 311.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-6\"><em>J. S. Beach </em>and <em>L. H. Bristol, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-7\">The question with regard to the real estate left by the testator having been disposed of by a former decision of this court, (38 Conn., 405,) the only question for our present consideration is, whether, under the will, the grandchild Louisa took such an interest in Mr. Hughes\u2019s personal property, that it vested in her during her life, and upon her decease passed to her personal representative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-8\"><em>First. </em>This question is answered in the negative by the plain language of the testator\u2019s will, disposing of his estate upon the decease' of his wife as follows: \u201c Upon the decease of my said wife I give all my said estate <em>to such of my children as may be living at the time of her decease, and to the issue of those who may have </em>deceased.\u201d Ry these words, <em>considered by themselves alone, </em>without extrinsic aid from the other provisions of the wdll to be hereafter considered, it is clear that the testator intended to designate as the objects of his bounty those children and their representatives, <em>and those </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number><em>only, </em>who should be <em>in existence at the date of his wife\u2019s decease.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-5\">1. Admitting the preference which the law has for vested over contingent interests, and admitting also that upon an ordinary limitation, by way of remainder, to children in a class, all those who are <em>in esse </em>at the decease of the testator take vested and consequently transmissible interests, it is also elementary law that where it appears from express declaration or clear inference that the testator intended to confine his bequest to those only who answer the description at the happening of a certain contingency, such intention must be carried into effect. 1 Jarman on Wills, 816, 817; 2 Redfield on Wills, 623. In the first place, it is clear that the bequest, upon the decease of Mrs. Hughes, \u201c to such of my children as may bo living at the time of her decease,\u201d gave <em>them </em>only a contingent, and not a vested interest in the estate. <em>Wordsworth </em>v. <em>Wood, 2 </em>Beaven, 25; <em>Olney </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>21 Pick., 311; <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Luddington, </em>104 Mass., 193; <em>Hurlburt </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>16 id., 241; <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>7 Met., 363; <em>Denny </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>1 Pick., 147; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Karver, </em>Cowp., 309. The foregoing authorities making it plain that the bequest to the children is contingent upon their survivorship of their mother, it would seem to be a matter of \u201c clear inference,\u201d that the bequest to the issue, (in this case the grandchild,) is also contingent upon the same survivorship.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-6\">2. It may be claimed that the bequest to the issue of a deceased child is not contingent, but vested, because it is given to that issue without being <em>in terms </em>restricted to such issue as shall be living at Sirs. Hughes\u2019s death. To this claim there are several sufficient answers. In the first place the contingency, that is, the death of Mrs. Hughes, attaches <em>to the substance of the gift, </em>and not merely to the time of payment. By the words <em>\u201c upon </em>the death of my wife I give,\u201d the benefit in point of right is limited by the testator to those who are then in existence to answer to the description of those who are to take. If no issue of a deceased child is then in being, there is no one to fall within the category created by the words. The ease comes within the rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>when the words <em>\u201c </em>payable,\u201d or \u201c to be paid,\u201d are omitted, and a legacy is given \u201c <em>at </em>twenty-one,\u201d or, as in this case, <em>at </em>the death o\u00ed the widow, this confers only a contingent interest. <em>Cruse </em>v. Barley, 3 P. Wms., 20; <em>Smell </em>v. Dee, 2 Salk., 415; <em>Bruse </em>v. <em>Charlton, </em>13 Simons, 65, 68; <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>28 Barb., 121. In the next place, the construction contended for involves the absurdity of supposing that the testator had in his mind a preference for his remoter descendants (unknown and unborn) over his own immediate children, and that he intended by the language used to give his children only an inchoate, contingent, untransmissible interest, but did intend to give his grandchildren, in case of a parent\u2019s death, an interest that would be absolute, vested and transmissible, so that the share which, during the life-time of the mother, was only contingent, should, on the instant of her decease, become absolute and perfect in the daughter. This construction, in a not improbable contingency, might result in a grandchild\u2019s taking the whole estate, while in the same contingency an own daughter of the testator would be entitled to but one-half of it. Again, the testator\u2019s object in the use of the language under consideration cannot be questioned. <em>No one can </em>doubt that his manifest intention was to provide for those of his children who should survive his wife, with a further provision that the issue of a deceased child should be <em>substituted </em>in place of the deceased parent, so as to take that parent\u2019s share and no more. This view is sustained by the weight of English authority in similar cases. <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>McGregor, </em>2 Coll. C. C., 192; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>6 Beavan, 360; <em>In re Corrie's will, </em>32 id., 426; <em>Holgate </em>v. Jennings, 34 id., 79. It may be conceded that some of the English cases come to a different conclusion, but an examination of those authorities will show that they turned upon the construction of a particular clause, upon which no light was shed by the other provisions of the will, and that the <em>conceded intent </em>of the testator <em>is sacrificed </em>to the strict and literal import of the words-used. It is respectfully submitted that in a conflict of authority an American court will follow those decisions which, discarding technical construction, make the testator\u2019s intention the car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>dinal principle of interpretation. See remarks of the court in <em>White </em>v. Howard, 38 Conn., 355.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-5\"><em>Second. </em>It is submitted that we have . showed that the language of the bequest upon the decease of the wife, considered by itself, is sufficient to demonstrate a positive intent that the contingency of survivorship was to apply as well to the remote descendants, the issue, as to the immediate offspring, the children. An examination of the other and subsequent provisions of the will, puts it beyond the possibility of doubt that the testator intended that the issue of a deceased child should take a share in his estate, <em>only </em>in case such issue should he alive at the date of his wife\u2019s decease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-6\">1. No citation of authorities is needed to show that, in this country, the construction of a will is to be made upon the <em>entire </em>instrument, and consequently all its parts are to be considered with reference to each other. As remarked by the court in <em>Hoxie </em>v. <em>Hoxie, </em>7 Paige, 192, \u201c the testator\u2019s intention is to be ascertained from everything contained within the four corners of the instrument.\u201d \u201c The legal import of technical language is not to prevail against the manifest intention of the testator, appearing from other parts of the will.\u201d <em>Homer </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>2 Met., 194. \u201cWhatever may be the-strict grammatical construction of the words, that is not to govern if the intent of the testator unavoidably requires a different construction.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>6 Peters, 68, 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-7\">2. The intent of the testator in this case, as gathered from the subsequent provisions of the will, restricts the gift to such issue as should survive the wife. In the first place the language of the gift in question is followed by directions having in view certain contingencies which might happen during the continuance of the wife\u2019s life, and which form no essential part of the disposition of the corpus of the estate. Then follows the clause-, \u201c If none of my children, <em>or their lawful issue, </em>shall be living at the time of the decease of my said wife, I give, devise and bequeath all my said' estate to William L. Wight, and Grace, his wife.\u201d No refinement of ingenuity can reconcile this language with an intent to vest an interest in the issue irrespective of their survivorship of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>the wife. Place in juxtaposition the two clauses and the meaning is unmistakable. \u201c Upon the decease of my wife I give my estate to such of my children as shall be living at the time of her decease, and to the issue of any deceased child, but if no child and no issue of any child shall be living at her decease, then over.\u201d Language could not, it would seem, more clearly express the idea that neither child, <em>nor the issue of any child, </em>was to take unless they survived the wife. In the next place, the provision in the will that, upon the contracting of a second marriage by the wife, \u201c two-thirds of the estate shall thereupon immediately vest in my children then living, and in the issue of those who may have deceased, is of itself a conclusive indication that the testator did not intend that any interest should vest in the issue before the marriage or death of the widow. Suppose Mrs. Hughes had married again in 1869 ; if the interest of the grandchild was already vested, as contended by the plaintiff, why provide 'that it should vest <em>then </em>? There cannot be two periods of vesting. The established rule in such cases is, that a provision that devisees shall take a vested interest upon the happening of a certain event, raises a sufficient implication against their taking a <em>present </em>vested interest. <em>Glanville </em>v. <em>Glanville, </em>2 Mer., 38; <em>Comport </em>v. <em>Austen, </em>12 Simons, 218, 246; <em>Wakefield </em>v. Dyatt, 4 Jur. N. S., 1098. Further, the gift of the whole estate to the wife for her life \u201c to be used in the support of herself and my children,\u201d taken in connection with the power given to the wife \u201c to sell and dispose of any part of my said estate, absolutely and in fee simple,\u201d is fatally repugnant to the idea that any interest Under the will was to become vested until the death of the wife. And finally, the supposed intent to vest an absolute, indefeasible, transmissible interest in the grandchild, is at variance with the whole scheme of the will, and the painstaking care therein shown to restrict the enjoyment of the testator\u2019s estate to those only of his own blood so long as any such were in existence. It will be seen that the estate is first limited to his own children and their issue, then, if any of them die without issue, to the survivors, then, in case of the death of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>last survivor without issue, to his only sister, Mrs. Wight, and her husband, and the survivor of them, and, upon the death of the survivor, to their issue. That a testator should take such special precautions to give liis own blood the benefit of his estate so long, as that blood continued to exist, is clearly inconsistent with an intention to vest in a grandchild an absolute estate which might, and in the event that has happened would, upon her decease, pass out of his family to a mere stranger having no claim upon his bounty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b131-5\"><em>Third. </em>To give effect to the manifest intention of the testator, the court will if necessary transpose the words of the bequest, so as to read <em>\u201c </em>to such of my children, and to the issue of those who may have deceased, as may be living at the time of her decease. <em>Covenhoven </em>v. Shuler, 2 Paige, 122; <em>Pond </em>v. Bergh, 10 id., 140; <em>East </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>2 Vesey Sen., 32; <em>Blamire </em>v. <em>Geldart, </em>16 id., 316; <em>Mosley </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>8 East, 149; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Allcock, </em>1 B. &amp; Ald., 137; <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Mix, </em>37 Conn., 243.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b131-6\">Seymour, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">The question in this case arises upon the construction of the following clause in Mr. Hughes\u2019s will:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">\u201c Upon the decease of my said wife I give all my said estate to such of my children as may he living at the time of her decease, and to the issue of those who may have deceased, and to their heirs and assigns forever; to he equally divided between <em>them; </em>the issue of such deceased children to take per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The will is dated in 1841, at which time all Mr. Hughes\u2019s children, five in number, were living. Ho died in 1864, leaving a widow, to whom all his property was given for her life, and leaving four of his children (who ultimately survived the widow), and leaving one grandchild, Louisa Hughes Austin, the daughter and only child of his daughter Louisa, who had died prior to his death. This grandchild died February 18th, 1870, a minor and intestate, having her domicil in New Haven. The widow died in 1872.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The administrator of the grandchild, as plaintiff in this amicable suit, claims under the will one-fifth part of the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>sonal estate of Mr. Hughes. The claim is that upon the death of Mr. Hughes the grandchild took a vested interest in one-fifth- part of his-estate, subject indeed to be divested in a certain event provided for in another part 'of the will, to be more particularly noticed hereafter; which interest might also be increased in the event of the death without issue of one or more of her uncles or aunts.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The defendant on the other hand insists that the gift to the testator\u2019s children is clearly contingent\u2019upon their surviving their mother, the gift being only to such of them as may be living at her death; and that a similar contingency by reasonable construction applies to the grandchild, to wit, that in order to take under the will she must be living at- the death of .her .grandmother; and that the clause above recited in the will should be construed as it would be had. the words \u201cif then living\u201d been inserted after the word \u201c issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">It is conceded to be probable that had the testator\u2019s attention been called to the subject he would have made the gift to the grandchild dependent upon the same contingency of being alive at the termination of the life estate on which the gift to his children is made to depend, and this probability has been deemed so strong that in the earlier cases the issue under wills like this were adjudged not to take unless living at the death of the tenant for life. But clauses like that under consideration frequently occur in wills and have become the subjects of much discussion. The earlier cases have been in the English courts carefully reviewed, and it is now firmly settled in England, that under the language used in this will the grandchild takes a vested estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">It is true that in regard to the construction of wills former cases, unless <em>ad idem, </em>are of small account; but in respect to clauses of\u2019 frequent occurrence in wills it is important thf\u00bbt there should be uniformity of construction, -and we do n\u00aet feel at liberty to adopt a rule as applicable to this case different' from that which has received the sanction of the highest courts in Great Britain, unless we can see strong reasons for \u25a0such departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">It is clear upon well-settled - rules of construction that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>words of this will in thoir natural import create a vested interest in the grandchild immediately on her grandfather\u2019s death. At his death she was the issue and sole issue of one of his children who had deceased. As such, she was to take per stirpes, that is, to take the share which her mother would have taken had she lived till the death of the tenant for life, namely, one-fifth of the estate. No contingency is <em>expressed </em>in the will regarding this gift. The. object of the testator\u2019s bounty is alive at the testator\u2019s death and capable of immediately taking. There is no uncertainty as to the person, or as to the gift. The time of taking possession is indeed postponed till the grandmother\u2019s death, but the words of the gift are in the present tense, \u201cI give.\u201d The words connected with these words of gift, to wit, \u201cupon the decease of my said wife,\u201d are uniformly construed both in England and in this country to relate to the time of taking effect in possession and not to the time of taking effect in interest. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>McLauglin, </em>1 Price Exch. R., 254; <em>Throop </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>5 Conn. R., 98; <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>2 Gray R., 175; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Foreman, </em>5 Vesey, 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The whole question then resolves itself into this, whether the fact that the testator\u2019s children take only a contingent estate depending on their outliving their mother, clearly indicates that the gift to the issue of such of 1ns children as might die during the mother\u2019s life, is by implication also contingent upon the like event of their being alive at the death of the tenant for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Conflicting views and decisions have taken place in England on this subject and refined distinctions have been attempted. They are readily found in our text books, and there is no occasion to examine the. controversy in detail. The late case of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Holg</em>ate, in the House of Lords, seems to have settled the question in England. Law Reps. 1 House of Lords Cas., 175. The bequest in that case, in every essential feature which affects the matter before us, is identical with the bequests in Mr. Hughes\u2019s will. The testator bequeathed his residuary estate to his wife for life, and then to such of his nephews and nieces as should be living at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>her death, and then adds, \u201c but if any or either of them should then be dead, leaving issue, such issue shall be entitled to their father\u2019s share, but in equal proportions.\u201d A nephew died during the life of the widow, leaving a daughter who died an infant during the widow\u2019s life. The same question there arose which arises here, namely, whether this infant daughter took a vested interest in the residuary estate, and it was held that she did. Several eminent judges gave opinions at length, all concurring in the judgment. The grounds of the decision are very clearly stated by Ex-Chancellor Lord Westbury. He says: \u201c According to the plain effect and meaning of this bequest, unless that meaning be altered by the implication of additional words, the issue living at the death of a nephew or niece who may pre-decease the tenant for life, take an. immediate vested interest in that share which would have been taken by the parent if he or she had been living at the time of distribution. The interest of the issue is vested and immediate, although the amount of the share is uncertain until the death of the tenant for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We give another' extract from Lord Westbury\u2019s opinion. \u201cThe implication contended for by the respondent is not warranted by the form of the gift, which is not elliptical, nor referential, nor substitutional; nor is the implication necessary to avoid absurd or contradictory consequences. It is by no means irrational to suppose that the testator intended to make the interest of the- orphan issue vested and immediate, although he made the interest of the parent contingent on surviving the tenant for life. A judge is not justified in departing from the plain meaning of words which admit of a rational construction, for the purpose of giving effect to an assumed intention which appears to him more rational or more consistent with the rest of the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Holgate </em>the bequest to the issue of deceased nephews and nieces is indeed in a sentence distinct from that in which the gift is- made to the nephews and nieces themselves ; so far differing from the case under our considera-' tion, where the contingent gift to the testator\u2019s children and^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the gift to the issue of deceased children are in different clauses of the same sentence: So too there is a slight difference of phraseology in the two wills, the contingency \u201cif any or either of them should then be dead leaving issue,\u201d being expressed in the will before the House of Lords and not expressed in Mr. Hughes\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In the case <em>In re Orton's </em>trust, reported in Law Reps. 3 Eq. Cas., 374, the form of the gift is more closely like that in the case before us. The entire gift to children and the issue of deceased children is in one and the same sentence and the phraseology of the two wills nearly identical. In <em>Orton's trust </em>the money to be raised by the sale of property on the death of the testator\u2019s two sons was thus bequeathed : \u201c equally among such of my five daughters as shall be living at the death of the survivor of my sons, and to the children, grandchildren and issue of such of my said daughters as shall then happen to be dead, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The case was regarded by the court as clearly falling within the rule established by <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Holgate, </em>and the doctrine of that case was carried to an extent which we have no occasion here to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">These two English cases seem to settle the law in England so fully that we forbear the citation of the numerous conflicting cases which preceded them. Several American cases were cited by counsel, but none of them seem to touch the precise point on which this turns.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The counsel, for the respondent rely upon another part of the will as having an important bearing on the question under consideration. A clause occurs in Mr. Hughes\u2019s will in substance as follows : \u201c If none of my children or their lawful issue shall be living at the time of the decease of my said wife, I then give all my estate to William L. Wight^ &amp;c. The effect of this clause is such that, upon the contingency therein expressed happening, Louisa Hughes Austin and her representatives would lose their interest in the estate of Mr. Hughes. The interest vested in her, and on her death in her representatives, would be divested upon the happening of the contingency, and this we apprehend is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>whole and only effect of the clause. The clause is entirely consistent with an interest rested, but subject to be divested by the contingency provided for. It is a familiar rule that if there are clear words of gift giving a vested interest to parties, the court will not permit that absolute gift to be defeated unless it is perfectly clear that the very case has happened in which it is declared that the interest shall not arise. The rule is thus stated in <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Foreman, </em>5 Vesey, 209. The Master of the Bolls there says : \u201c There is a vested interest, and the contingency xipoii which it is to be divested has never happened. The vested interest therefore remains as if that contingency had never been annexed to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In conclusion then, it appears that the weight of authority is in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and we also yield, though with some hesitation, to the force of the reasons by which that claim is supported. We therefore advise the Superior Court that the plaintiff, as administrator of Louisa Hughes Austin, is entitled to a share of the personal estate of the deceased Enos B. M. Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
