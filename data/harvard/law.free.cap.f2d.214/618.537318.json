The complaint alleged, and the facts showed, diversity of citizenship. The case was tried to a jury. At the time of the accident, defendant\u2019s tug, Ocean King, with the Henry Kohl in tow, was maneuvering to place the bow of the Henry Kohl under the stern of the barge Red Star No. 55, so that the two vessels could be towed in tandem. The No. 55 was lying at the north end of the Long Island Lighting Company\u2019s Port Jefferson dock. The barge Cape French was berthed at the dock approximately seventy feet astern of the No. 55, so that there was not enough room at the dock to maneuver the Kohl\u2019s bow squarely under the No. 55\u2019s stern. The tug, therefore, brought the starboard (outboard) bow corner of the Henry Kohl up to the starboard (outboard) stern corner of the No. 55, and ran a line between those corners. The plaintiff assisted in this tying up. The tug then maneuvered to bring the port (inshore) corners of the two vessels together so that the plaintiff and the captain of the No. 55 could make fast a line between these corners. In attempting to tie the port inshore corners of the two vessels, plaintiff threw a line, which was heavy, to the captain of the* No. 55, but the line did not reach the latter. At this point, all three vessels were at a standstill. On a second attempt, plaintiff managed to get the line over to the No. 55. In all these maneuvers, plaintiff was acting under the orders of the Ocean King\u2019s captain. After the captain of the No. 55 had grasped this line, the Ocean King, without a signal or warning from the Kohl or the No. 55, started into motion astern. Plaintiff testified that while making the throws, he braced his left foot on or against the inside of the Henry Kohl\u2019s bow guard-rail. He also testified that, as a result of the motion, he was thrown across the Henry Kohl\u2019s bow guard-rail and his left leg was caught between the outside of this and the bumper of the No. 55. Plaintiff admitted that he knew he was required to keep his feet and legs inside the rail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b667-15\">Counsel for the parties stipulated: \u201cThat the court will direct the jury to bring a special, written verdict on the questions whether they find contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, and if so, the extent or percentage thereof. Upon receipt of such a verdict, if the jury finds for the plaintiff, the court will then determine whether the law requires that recovery be reduced by 50% because of the contributory negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>\u00f3r reduce it by the percentage found by the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b668-4\">The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $35,000, and found him guilty of contributory negligence in the amount of 15%. The trial judge reduced the verdict by 15%, to $29,750.00. Defendant appeals from the judgment entered on this verdict.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b668-5\">Abraham M. Fisch, New York City (Abraham' M.

Defendant\u2019s negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Defendant asserts the absence of proof o'f its negligence, and argues that the sole legal cause of plaintiff\u20193 injury consisted of his own action in putting his foot on or outside the bow rail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably find the following: Plaintiff, acting under the order's of the Ocean King, was attempting to complete the tying up of the Kohl and the No. 55, when the accident occurred; in throwing the line to the No. 55, plaintiff braced his left foot on or against the inside of the bow rail; all the vessels were then at a standstill; the captain of the Ocean King could not see the bow of the Kohl or the stern of the No. 55, and there was no lookout on the deck of the Ocean King to signal that the vessels had been tied together as ordered, or to give warning in case of accident; with affairs in this state, and before the tying of the port corners had been completed, the Ocean King began to move in reverse without having given any warning or signal; it had not received any signal from either the Kohl or the No. 55 that the vessels were tied together; and plaintiff\u2019s expert witness testified that a tug, during such a tying up, should not start in motion without first receiving some sort of \u201call clear\u201d signal. See The Pontin Bros., 2 Cir., 47 F.2d 595, where we held a lighter liable in negligence for starting in reverse without first receiving a signal from a deckhand that the tying up had been completed. We think the jury-could reasonably infer that the sudden motion of the tug caused plaintiff to lose his balance, with the result that his left foot went over the bow rail. Remembering that questions of credibility are for the jury,' we think that the trial judge correctly refused to direct a verdict for defendant, and that the jury could rationally conclude that defendant\u2019s negligence was the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s injury. Ondato v. Standard Oil Co., 2 Cir., 1954, 210 F.2d 233; Fodera v. Booth American Shipping Corp., 2 Cir., 159 F.2d 795, 797; Kilgust v. United States, 2 Cir., 191 F.2d 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">2. Comparative negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">Plaintiff, on this appeal, does not deny his contributory negligence. Defendant contends that this factor compels a 50% reduction of the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-17\">The admiralty rule'of evenly-divided damages in cases of injury .to property <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014although a highly desirable departure-from the \"harsh\" common-law doctrine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which denies all relief to one suing for negligence if guilty of contributory negligence-has frequently received criticism as unfair. On that ground, vir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>tually every country except ours has abandoned it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we feel obliged to apply that rule until the Supreme Court or Congress instructs us otherwise. However, we are not similarly restricted in cases of maritime tort involving personal injuries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Apportionment of damages in such cases, on a comparative fault basis and without reliance on a statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> began with the decision of Judge Addison Brown in The Max Morris.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On appeal, the specific ruling affirmed by the Supreme Court was that contributory negligence does not bar all recovery in a personal injury maritime tort suit; the Supreme Court said it left open the question of apportionment of damages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Filling this gap by following Judge Addison Brown, we and several other courts, in such personal injury maritime tort cases, have applied the rule of comparative negligence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">Defendant, however, urges that each of these rulings occurred in a situation in which a contractual or quasi-contractual relation existed between the person injured and the party held liable. Defendant argues that, since no such relation existed here, damages should have been reduced by 50%. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">True, a \u201cstatus\u201d or relation may derive from contract; and a seaman has such status in respect of his ship, based partly <em>on </em>contract and partly on a non-contractual relation. See Sperbeck v. A. L. Burbank &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 190 F.2d 449.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thanks to Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099, the courts now regard a stevedore, working on a ship, as one performing some of the traditional work of a seaman and therefore having a position of status <em>vis a vis </em>the ship or its owner.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, when Judge Brown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>decided The Max Morris in favor of a stevedore, the Sieracki doctrine had not yet been established, and Judge Brown made no reference whatever to the stevedore\u2019s status. Nor, significantly, did the courts, in any of the subsequent cases we cited above, mention that the plaintiffs had such a contractual or other status; this goes to show that such a relation has not been deemed a necessary condition of apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">In Guerrini v. United States, 2 Cir., 1948, 167 F.2d 352, plaintiff, employee of a subcontractor hired to clean a ship\u2019s boiler, sued the ship for negligently failing to provide for his safety as a result of which he suffered injury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This court (per Learned Hand, J.) decided (p. 354) that plaintiff was unlike a stevedore, and consequently could not recover for unseaworthiness under the Sieracki doctrine.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we held, 1(37 F.2d 352, pages 355-356, that plaintiff (on a proper finding of facts) could recover for negligence, as a \u201cbusiness guest,\u201d and that, as plaintiff was contributorily negligent, damages sho\u00fald be apportioned according to the percentage of fault.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As we then (1948) viewed such a plaintiff, he had neither a contractual nor a quasi-contractual relation with the ship or its owner; and, since plaintiff brought suit under the Suits-In-Admiralty Act, he could not avail himself of any statutory provision relative to comparative negligence. Thus this court has unmistakably sustained damage-apportionment in a personal-injury suit for a maritime tort resting on negligence only.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See also Portel v. United States, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 85 F.Supp. 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-15\">To be sure, were we deciding Guerrini\u2019s case today, we would hold that he had status with respect to defendant, in the light of Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 1953, 346 U.S. 406, 74 S.Ct. 202. There, in sustaining plaintiff\u2019s right to recover for unseaworthiness <em>(i. e., </em>without proof of defendant\u2019s negligence), the Supreme Court, for the first time, explicitly assimilated a repairman (like Guerrini) to a seaman under the Sieracki doctrine. The plaintiff there also claimed for the negligence of the ship\u2019s owner. The Court, sustaining that claim, held that plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence called for apportionment, but it treated the negligence claim and the apportionment as wholly independent of the Sieracki rationale.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, as we decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Guerrini\u2019s case some five years before the advent of Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, supra, our decision in Guerrini is a clear precedent, in this Circuit, for apportionment, minus any contractual or other relation between the parties, and without the aid of any statute. We adhere to that precedent so far as it deals with comparative negligence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\">. Defendant cites The Authentic, D.C., 15 F.Supp. 780, affirmed In re Tice Towing Line, 2 Cir., 89 F.2d 1020. We think that case inapposite, since the decision quite clearly rests on the trial judge\u2019s disbelief of claimant\u2019s version of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-11\">.

This appears when one considers that frequently a contract itself creates a sort of status, since it often gives birth to obligations, legally imposed by the courts, for reasons of policy, which the parties to the contract did not intend or contemplate, so that many so-caih d contractual obligations may be viewed as to some extent qnasi-contractual.\u201d See also Kulukundis Shipping Co., S/A v.

One might conceivably say that, whenever a defendant owes a legal obligation to exercise due care to a plaintiff, that obligation (\u201cimposed by law\u201d) creates a status or relation between the parties.
