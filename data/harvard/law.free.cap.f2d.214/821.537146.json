A confusion of the Gold loans with the Gould loans resulted in our failure to consider the Gould loans in the former opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">It is ordered that the sum of $1,032.95 principal and $262.08 interest allowed by the District Court on the $2,000 Gould note be disallowed and the judgment of the District Court is accordingly reduced in the sum of $1,295.03. As so modified the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
