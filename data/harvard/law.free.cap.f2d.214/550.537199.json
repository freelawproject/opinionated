Plaintiff had gone upon the premises of defendant for the purpose of buying some cantaloupes. He climbed into a box car at the invitation of defendant with this end in view and was injured when jumping out of the car to the ground. He contends that he was a business visitor or invitee on the premises and that defendant was negligent in failing to provide him a safe means of getting from the car to the ground. The trial judge found that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant and that plaintiff\u2019s injury was due to his own negligence. We find nothing in the record which would justify our interfering with these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
