See opinions of this court in Davilman v. United States, 6 Cir., 180 F.2d 284; Collier v. United States, 6 Cir., 190 F.2d 473; and United States v. Adcock, D.C.W.D.Ky., 49 F.Supp. 351, 353; United States v. Sicurella, 2 Cir., 187 F.2d 533, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-20\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction and sentence entered in the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
