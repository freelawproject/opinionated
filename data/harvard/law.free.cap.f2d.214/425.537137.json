In 1918 he was convicted of armed robbery in Michigan and was sentenced to a term of 15 to 30 years in prison. Four years later he was paroled.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-19\">Some time in 1951 (the record does not disclose the exact date) he visited Puerto Rico for a few days on business and returned to the mainland through Miami, Florida, on March 30, 1951, being admitted as a citizen. On December 5, 1951, he was arrested and charged in deportation proceedings with being in the United States in violation of immigration laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-20\">Administrative proceedings resulted in an order for appellee\u2019s deportation, and on September 10, 1953, he was taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>into custody by appellant pursuant to the order. Appellee filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the legality of his detention on several grounds, the only contention presented by this appeal being that the Act was not applicable to an alien resident of the continental United States returning thereto from Puerto Rico.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district judge held that there was no \u201centry\u201d on March 30, 1951, within the meaning of the Act and ordered the discharge of appellee. The appeal is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Section 3 of the Act of 1917 provided that persons convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude should be excluded from admission into the United States. Section 1 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201cThat the term \u2018United States\u2019 as used in the title as well as in the various sections of this Act shall be construed to mean the United States, and any waters, territory, or other place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, except the Isthmian Canal Zone; <em>but if any alien shall leave the Canal Zone or any insular possession of the United States and attempt to enter any other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, nothing contained in this Act shall be construed as permitting him to enter under any other conditions than those applicable to all aliens. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Appellant contends that under the plain wording of the quoted provisions appellee <em>left </em>Puerto Rico, an insular possession, and <em>came </em>to the mainland on March 30, 1951; that having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude prior to his entry at Miami on that date, he is clearly deportable and was legally in appellant\u2019s custody. Ap-pellee contends that the provisions of the Act under which he is held must be construed in the light of their purpose; that the words \u201cleave\u201d, \u201center\u201d, \u201centry\u201d and \u201ccome\u201d must be interpreted in conformity with the context of the Act. The question, then, is whether or not appellee left the United States and reentered it within the meaning of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">Ordinarily, statutory language should be construed in accordance with common usage, but the word \u201centry\u201d has acquired a special meaning in judicial interpretation of immigration statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *Before there can be \u201centry\u201d into the United States by a resident alien of the mainland, there must be a departure therefrom. To \u201cleave\u201d the alien must intentionally depart from the <em>United States; </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and to \u201center\u201d he must arrive from outside the United States, from a <em>foreign </em>port or place.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-15\">By specific definition in Section 1, the term \u201cUnited States\u201d as used in the Act shall be construed to mean the mainland <em>and </em>any territory or place subject to its jurisdiction (except the Canal Zone). Certainly this definition includes Puerto Rico. Therefore, we conclude that appellee never \u201cleft\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>United States and did not \u201center\u201d the United States when he arrived at Miami on March 30, 1951. The word \u201ccome\u201d in the portion of Section 19 quoted in footnote 1 can mean nothing in its context except \u201center\u201d, and cannot be said to require a broader interpretation than intended in the body of the section of which it is a part. There being no entry within the meaning of the Act, appellee was not deportable under section 19 thereof, on the ground of having been convicted \u201cprior to entry\u201d of a crime involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">This is the interpretation of the word \u25a0\u201centry\u201d announced by the Supreme Court on June 7, 1954, in Barber v. Gonzales, 347 U.S. 637, 74 S.Ct. 822, 825, affirming 207 F.2d 398. In that case a native of the Philippines who 'came to this country in 1930 (when those islands were possessions of the United States) was ordered deported \u201cunder \u00a7 19(a) of the Immigration Act of 1917 as an alien who \u2018after entry\u2019 had been sentenced more than once to imprisonment for terms of one year or more for crimes involving moral turpitude.\u201d The District Court dismissed a petition for habeas corpus, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in an opinion which interprets the word \u201centry\u201d as we do here, but which also seems to rest to some extent upon the fact that Gonzales was a <em>national </em>rather than an <em>alien. </em>On certiorari the Supreme Court concluded that there was no \u201centry\u201d, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">\u201cAt the time respondent came to the continental United States, he was <em>not arriving </em>\u2018from some <em>foreign </em>port or place.\u2019 On the contrary, he was a United States national moving from one of our insular possessions to the mainland. It was not until the 1934 Philippine Independence Act that the Philippines could be regarded as \u2018foreign\u2019 for immigration purposes. <em>Having made no \u2018entry,\u2019 </em>respondent is not deportable under \u00a7 19(a) as an alien who \u2018after entry\u2019 committed crimes involving moral turpitude.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The appellant contends that the Gonzales case is not dispositive of the question presented to us for the reason that the decisions of both the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court are predicated upon the finding that Gonzales was a <em>national </em>when he came to the mainland. There may be some basis for argument as to the premise underlying the opinion of the Court of Appeals, but we entertain no doubt that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is based upon its interpretation of the word \u201centry\u201d. There the Government argued that Gonzales was an <em>alien </em>because of the provisions of Section 8(a)(1) of the Philippine Independence Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 456. The Supreme Court preter-mitted this question, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u201cThe Government\u2019s argument is premised on the assumption that respondent made an \u2018entry\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 19(a). <em>If he did not make such an \u2018entry,\u2019 then he is not deportable </em>under that section, <em>even assuming </em>that the Government is <em>correct </em>in its broad construction of the 1934 Philippine Independence Act.\u201d 22 Law Week 4305. (Emphasis supplied.) See also footnote 4, 22 Law Week 4305.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Our appreciation of the import of the majority opinion is shared by the three Justices who dissented therefrom. Whatever may be the effect on this problem of the definition of \u201centry\u201d in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, we are confident that our interpretation of the 1917 Act is in accord with the latest Supreme Court decision and prior jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Appellant finally contends that this holding in effect judicially amends the italicized portion of Section 1 quoted above by adding thereto the proviso that it is applicable only to <em>resident </em>aliens of the Canal Zone and insular possessions. We think this argument is adequately answered in appellant\u2019s own brief, where he says: \u201cSection 1 was undoubtedly aimed at preventing undesirable aliens from utilizing insular possessions as means of easy access to the mainland * * In refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>hold this provision applicable to an alien returning to his residence on the mainland after a visit to an insular possession, we are merely interpreting it in the light of its stated purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">For the reasons assigned, the order of the lower court is</p>\n<p id=\"AnPG\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-21\">. The specific violation charged was under Section 19 of the Immigration Act of February 5, 1917, as amended, 39 Stat. 889-890 ; 54 Stat. 671-673 ; 56 Stat. 1044, the pertinent provisions of which were: \u201cThat at any time within five . years after <em>entry </em>* * * any alien who was convicted, or who admits the commission, prior to <em>entry, </em>of a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude * * * shall, upon the warrant of the Attorney General, be taken into custody and deported * * * Provided further, That the provisions of this section <em>shall also apply to the cases of aliens who come to the mainland </em>of the United States <em>from the insular possessions thereof * </em>* (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\">. Other issues were briefed and argued, but the trial judge affirmatively ruled that \u201call of the other grounds for relief * * * are not well founded\u201d; and ap-pellee did not appeal. In any event, the view we take makes unnecessary any discussion of the other issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">.
