Smith, trading as Nite-Lite Sign Company, manufactures but one product \u2014 an electric sign designed to be attached by suction \u2022cups to the tops of taxicabs. The sign \u2022consists of a lucite tube housing lettered \u201cTaxi\u201d, \u201cVacant\u201d, \u201cYellow\u201d, \u201cChecker\u201d, \u201cVeteran\u201d, or as otherwise desired. The signs are illuminated by electric bulbs in the lucite housing. They were purchased only by taxicab operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">The Revenue Act of 1941 which imposed a five per cent excise tax on automobile accessories in Section 3403(c) also imposed a 10 per cent excise tax on \u201cNeon-tube signs, electric signs, and electric advertising devices\u201d in Section 3406(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Plaintiff in 1941 registered with his local Collector of Internal Revenue as a manufacturer of a product subject to the provisions of Section 3406(a)(5) and \u2022collected from his customers the 10 per \u2022cent tax on electric advertising signs and remitted to the Collector.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">In 1942 the tax on electric advertising signs was repealed; the plaintiff was notified and he no longer collected from his customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">On May 5 1950, the Collector assessed the five per cent auto accessory excise tax on all sales made by the plaintiff from March, 1945 on the premise that its taxicab signs were taxable as an auto accessory under Section 3403(c). It may be noted parenthetically that the plaintiff had not collected such a tax from his customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">The plaintiff paid the assessment of $5,673.35 made by the Collector, filed claim for refund and then entered suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The District Court held that the plaintiff\u2019s signs were \u201cprimarily designed and specifically adapted to be attached to the roof of an automobile\u201d and were thus \u201cwithin the definition of a part or accessory.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-11\">The sum of plaintiff\u2019s contention on this appeal is that an \u201cadvertising sign or device\u201d is not included in the generic term \u201cautomobile accessory\u201d; that \u201cthat which is accessory is integrated in the thing to which it is accessory\u201d; that his electric sign is <em>accessory </em>to the taxicab operator\u2019s <em>business and not to his cab.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-12\">It is the Collector\u2019s position that Section 316.55 of Treasury Regulations 46 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which pertains to Section 3403(c) properly specifies that any article which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>designed to be attached to an automobile to add to its utility or ornamentation, or whose primary use is in connection with an automobile, is an \u201caccessory\u201d. The Regulation, says the Collector, is dis-positive of the plaintiff\u2019s contention under Universal Battery Co. v. United States, 1930, 281 U.S. 580, 50 S.Ct. 422, 74 L.Ed. 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">We are in accord with the Collector\u2019s view that a reasonable construction by Treasury Regulations of the terms or words used in an Act should not be disturbed. However, here the applicable Treasury Regulations negate his contention that an article is an accessory merely because it adds to the utility or ornamentation of an automobile or its primary use is in connection with it. That is so because the Treasury Regulations in effect during the years 1945 to 1950 (and now) specifically provided that \u201cautomobile radios\u201d and \u201cfare registers and fare boxes for use on busses and automobiles\u201d are not included within the term \u201cparts or accessories\u201d. Certainly it cannot be gainsaid that radios add to the \u201cutility\u201d of an automobile and particularly that taxi meters add to the \u201cutility\u201d of an automobile used as a taxicab.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">It is apparent from the Collector\u2019s oral argument and printed brief that he is unaware of the fact that Treasury Regulations 46 contain a provision holding taxi meters not to be accessories. For example, in citing to us the Treasury Regulations in the appendix to his brief he quoted \u201cTreasury Regulations 46 (1940 ed.)\u201d. However, the quoted Regulations were not those in effect during the taxable years here involved. On December 2, 1941, they were amended by the addition of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC3P\">\u201cHowever, such term (parts or accessories) does not include tires, inner tubes, and <em>automobile radios, </em>since these articles are expressly excluded by the statute from the tax on parts or accessories. <em>With respect to fare registers and fare boxes for use on busses and automobiles, see section 316.140.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Section 316.140(c) referred to above provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-7\">\u201c(c) Fare registers and fare boxes for use in streetcars, busses, and other vehicles are taxable as business machines under section 3406(a)(6) <em>and not as automobile accessories under section 3403(c) I.R.C., as amended.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">It may be observed that the Treasury Department has held that emblems designed to be attached to automobiles to show membership in automobile clubs, societies, etc. are not taxable as automobile parts or accessories, S.T. 409, II-l CB 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">Upon consideration of the issue we are of the opinion that plaintiff\u2019s electric signs are not accessories. The character and use of these signs on taxicabs is analogous to the character and use of taxi meters on taxicabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">For the reasons stated the judgment of the District Court in favor of the Collector will be reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to proceed in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-12\">.

Section 316.55 of Treasury Regulation 46, as amended December 2, 1943, T.D. 5099, 6 F.R. 132 (3941), in effect, during the taxable years here involved, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-15\">\u201c'Sec. 310.55. <em>Definition, of parts or accessories. </em>\u2014 The term \u2018parts or accessories\u2019 for an automobile truck or other automobile chassis or body, taxable tractor, or motorcycle, includes (a) any article the primary use of which is to improve, repair, replace or serve as a component part of such vehicle or article, (b) any article designed to be attached to or used in connection with such vehicle or article to add to its utility or ornamentation, and (c) any article the primary use of which is in connection with such vehicle or article whether or not essential to its operation or use.
