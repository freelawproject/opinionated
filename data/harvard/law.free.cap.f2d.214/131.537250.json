No useful purpose would be served by a detailed account of the facts or of the points in controversy. We state, however, that the Tax Court did not err in it's determination of the respective- partners\u2019 proportionate interests in the assets of the partnership, pre-incorporation. The stipulation so heavily relied on by Liberty does not compel a contrary result. We are of the opinion fthat the Tax Court correctly decided all the issues presented. - Accordingly, the decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
