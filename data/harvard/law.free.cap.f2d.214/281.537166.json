Appellant is in custody under an extradition order. He contends he was held an unreasonably long time on a mere detainer before the requisition from Ohio, the demanding State, was received. The record does not clearly establish this contention. In any event the contention does not appear to have been made in the District Court, Certainly it was not made during the time when appellant was \u2014 allegedly\u2014unreasonably held. We find no error affect-inS substantial rights,</p>\n<p id=\"AQ5A\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
