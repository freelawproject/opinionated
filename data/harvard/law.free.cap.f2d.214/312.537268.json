Supp. 376, denying him a writ of habeas corpus. The Warden moves to dismiss the appeal as frivolous, contending that the application shows on its face that Rupp has not exhausted his state remedies by petitioning a California state court for the issuance of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-23\">Rupp, in San Quentin, as well could have petitioned the Supreme Court of California, which was then in session in San Francisco, for his writ of habeas corpus as applying to the district court in that city. The state supreme court or any justice thereof has the power to stay his execution. Cf. In re McCracken, Crim. 5418 Supreme Court of California. We are advised by the authorities at San Quentin that the date of Rupp\u2019s execution has not been set and his attorney has ample time to seek his state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-24\"> Since it appears that Rupp has not exhausted his state remedies, the condition precedent to the district court\u2019s jurisdiction required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the later court\u2019s decision is so obviously correct that the appeal is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-25\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is ordered granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
