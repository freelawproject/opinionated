The immediate effect of the order was to prevent the building on the campus of a hospital to be maintained in connection with a School of Nursing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em> </em>\u201cThe governmental power to interfere by zoning regulations with the general rights of the land owner by restricting the character of his use, is not unlimited, and. other questions aside, such restriction cannot be imposed if it does not bear a substantial relation to the public health,, safety, morals, or general welfare.\u201d Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 188, 48 S.Ct. 447, 448, 72 L.Ed. 842. In the District Court, Judge Holtzoff found that the restriction which the rezoning order would impose on the University\u2019s right to use its land did not meet this requirement. He therefore found the order unconstitutional, and set it aside, as taking the University\u2019s property without due process of law. 1 D.C., 113 F.Supp. 389. We think he was clearly right. The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"apx-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
