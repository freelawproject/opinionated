Scott v. District of Columbia, 1953, D.C.Mun. App., 99 A.2d 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-22\"> Each case of this sort must be judged on its own merits. The decision here certainly should not be taken as a holding that a defendant can escape justice merely by hiring a lawyer who represents, in another case, a witness against that defendant. It means that under all the circumstances of this case there was a failure of representation which deprived Scott of a fair trial. There is no suggestion that there was any chicanery on the part of the accused\u2019s attorney, or scheme to thwart justice. The opinion of the Municipal Court of Appeals has our approval, and its decision will be</p>\n<p id=\"b908-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
