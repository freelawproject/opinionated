The plaintiff testified she had severe headaches after, but not before, the accident. Defendant\u2019s counsel then asked her whether she did not have headaches after a traffic accident in Minnesota in 1939. She conceded that she had a skull injury which knocked her unconscious, but she said \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t have any headaches.\u201d This colloquy followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-12\">\u201cQ. Let me refresh your recollection, Mrs. Molesworth, by asking you about the complaint that was filed in your behalf in that accident. Referring to paragraph 5 of that complaint it stated that: \u2018She received a severe and painful injury to her head as a result of which she was in a state of unconsciousness for a considerable period of time, and as a result of which she is now suffering and will in the future suffer severe and painful headaches.\u2019 A. I don\u2019t even know about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-13\">\u201cQ. Is that correct? A. I don\u2019t know. If it is on there it must be. I had backaches. I was in the hospital with back and chest injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-14\">\u201cQ. Your attorney was Mr. Pala-rine? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-15\">\u201cQ. And you discussed that accident out there with him before he filed a lawsuit for you? A. I must have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-16\">\u201cQ. Didn\u2019t you tell him what the injuries were? A. No; I let him get that from the doctor, I guess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-17\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, who was not her present counsel, permitted all this to go into the record without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">The defendant\u2019s counsel next asked the plaintiff: \u201cDoes this refresh your recollection any as to whether you suffered any headaches ?\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel said \u201cI object to that, Your Honor. * * * I think he should show her the whole file.\u201d The court overruled the objection. The plaintiff answered: \u201cI don\u2019t recall of having headaches. No; I didn\u2019t have headaches. I had backaches and chest injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-20\">The court afterwards received in evidence a certified copy of the complaint in the Minnesota suit. It did so over the objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel that \u201cThere is no testimony at all showing that she ever saw this. * * * This is just a pleading that the lawyer prepared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-21\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-22\">The defendant contends that even if the admission of the Minnesota com- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>' plaint was erroneous, which the defend- \u2022 ant denies, it was harmless because the matter concerned only damages and the jury found no liability. But the contradiction between the Minnesota complaint and the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was injurious to the plaintiff\u2019s credit as a witness, and therefore we cannot assume it did not affect the verdict. However, the harm was done when defendant\u2019s counsel read to the plaintiff, in the jury\u2019s presence, the pertinent part of the Minnesota complaint. Since this was done without objection, it raises no legal question. And since the subsequent admission of the complaint itself did not add materially to the harm, we need not consider whether in our opinion its admission was correct. \u201cNo error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence * * * is ground for *- * * disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. * * * \u201d Rule 61, Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. 28 U.S. C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
