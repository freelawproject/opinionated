Nothing presented to us indicates error in the finding that the Federation is not conducted for private gam. Moreover, that the Federation is a scientific institution is hardly disputable. As to this, however, we outline the facts which support the correctness of the Tax Court s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"avn-dedup-0\">According to its constitution and bylaws the objects of the Federation are to organize all agencies, societies, clubs and individuals interested in the restoration, conservation and scientific management of wildlife into a unified agency to secure public recognition of the needs and values of wildlife resources, to develop a comprehensive program based upon scientific study and technical research for the advancement and conservation of wildlife and, to the same end, to present te the public pertinent facts, scientific and research discoveries and information. The provisions of its certificate of incorporation state similar purposes. The members of the Federation are corporations, associations and groups throughout the country interested in the protection of wildlife, the dissemination of wildlife information, and the study of wildlife and related activities, The headquarters of the Federation is in the District of Columbia where there are 55 full time employees. The Federation\u2019s funds are raised primarily through the sale of stamps depicting flora and fauna of wildlife. Funds are also raised through the sale of its own publications, Headquarters in the District of Columbia provides a service for affiliated organizations in 45 states. There is a field service ^ a fieM director who ,travels throughout the country and organizes and strengthens affiiiations with the Fed-era^jon and provi\u00bfes conservation assistance tQ gtateg and territories_ The Fed_ eration hag an education committee which grantg felIowships to universities for conservation programs. tt has a grant_in_aid program for encouraging af-fiUateg to pregent loca] programs connect. ed with the conservation of the nation\u2019s natural resources&gt; A book Kbrary and film Ubrary are maintained at headquarters and may be used by interested memberg of the public but in fact are uged primarily by the staff. Lecturers are ma(je availa.ble by the Federation; and it publishes a publication called \u201cConservation News\u201d, with educational and scientific material, which it mails free of charge to about 5,000 persons and groups.</p>\n<p id=\"ADq\">From the foregoing it is plain, and the contrary is not seriously advanced, that the Federation is a scientific institution. See District of Columbia v. Mt. Vernon Seminary, 69 App.D.C. 251, 252, 100 F.2d 116, 117, note 3; I.T. 2546, IX-2 Cum.Bull. 122; Webster\u2019s International Dictionary, 2d ed., unabridged, p. 2238, p. 2985 \u201czoology\u201d,</p>\n<p id=\"AmeD\">The Digtrict Columbia ney. ertheless contegts the exemption on the ground that the activities of the Federa_ l0I1 within and for the benefit of the Dis--\u00bfj-jet are not a material part of its total -work and do not relieve the local government of a burden it otherwise would have. It is true the local activities of the Federation by no means predominate, The employees at headquarters here devote but a small part of their time to lo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>cal benefits. No large amount of fish and wildlife resources in the District of Columbia enlists the concern of the Federation.. Furthermore, only 831 names on a mailing list of over half a million are located here and only about 150 local residents receive the publication ^ Conservation News\u201d. While its facilities are to a degree available to and are in fact used by District residents and schools, only in the sense that its over-all activities are conducted from its headquarters can the Federation be said to be primarily local.</p>\n<p id=\"AmX\">Aecepting, therefore, as a fact that the Federation\u2019s District activities are relatively minor when measured in terms of purely local benefits, we must reject the District\u2019s legal conclusion that this forecloses the exemption. While of course the statute granting the exemption is due to a Congressional purpose to aid the public, this does not require a scientific institution to show that it performs a service of substantial character which otherwise the District government, or any other, would actually assume. Since the Federation is incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia, is not conducted for private gain, and is truly a scientific institution, it qualifies for the exemption under the statute. District of Columbia v. Catholic Education Press, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 126, 127, 199 F.2d 176, 177, certiorari denied, 344 U.S. 896, 73 S.Ct. 276, 97 L.Ed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The contrary view we think is due to a misunderstanding of the postulate that an exemption is a <em>quid pro quo for </em>public service. Colorable support for the misunderstanding is found in previous opinions of this court, but we think the District reads too much into their language, In support of its position the District refers to the following cases: Hazen v. Na-sonal Rifle Ass\u2019n of America, 69 App. D.C. 339, 101 F.2d 432; District of Columbia v. Mt. Vernon Seminary, 69 App. D.C. 251, 100 F.2d 116; Government Services v. District of Columbia, 88 U.S. App.D.C. 360, 189 F.2d 662, certiorari denied, 342 U.S. 828, 72 S.Ct. 51, 96 L. Ed. 626; Washington Chapter, Etc. v. District of Columbia, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 139, 203 F.2d 68.</p>\n<p id=\"AzR\">In Hazen y&lt; National Ri\u00f1e Ass\u2019n 0f America exemption was sought on the grouncj) am0ng others, that the property was uge(j for educational purposes. The C0l]r\u00bf founcj the educational phase of the Association\u2019s activities incidental and colla.tera.1 to its social, recreative, promotional and propaganda services, these constituting its major reasons for ex-.ej*\u25a0 ncp True the court said \u201cthe neoes-sity for g0Ver\u00f1mental subsidy or immunity which is implicit in tax exemption\u2014 upon the theory that the government is relieved of its burdens \u2014 fails in the present case.\u201d We think this statement of the theory of tax exemption is not to be read as necessitating a showing that government is in fact relieved in a particular case of something which it would then do, or do at any particular time. This is not to say, however, that in determining whether the institution is scientific, when exemption is claimed on that ground, the court does not examine its objects and activities in light of the purpose of the legislature to aid and encourage by tax exemption enterprises performing a public or quasi-public service,</p>\n<p id=\"AgP\">In <em>District of </em>Columbia v. Mt. Vernon Seminary, the Seminary was found to be an e(jucational institution not conducted for prjvate gain. The exemption was up^eld notwithstanding the educational advantages of the Seminary were for the benefit of many non-residents and only for students whose social and financial standing were acceptable. The court emphasized the fundamental importance of a policy which tends to draw to the nation\u2019s capital students from localities throughout the county. It is true the court indicated that the school \u201cperforms a function which must otherwise be performed by the government and, consequently, comes within the reason for the subsidy which is implicit in a tax exemption\u201d. Again, however, this statement cannot be read, in the context of the opinion, as holding that it is neeessary to prove a definitely ascertainable <em>quid pro quo, </em>much less one primarily to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>particular government which grants the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"Ars\">In Government Services v. District of Columbia an exemption was sought on the premise that the organization was exclusively charitable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finding the premise erroneous the court denied the claim, The opinion seeks no support from a <em>quid pro quo </em>theory.</p>\n<p id=\"A2J\">t . _. In Washington Chapter, Etc. v. Dis- ,, \u2019 . . . trict of Columbia, the remaining case in ... this jurisdiction relied upon, the decision , . , . ,. \u2019 , , denied a real estate exemption sought un- , <em>n i </em>ml der \u00a7 47 \u2014 801a, D.C.Code (1951). The , \u201e ,, ' , court discussed rather fully and indicated approval of a <em>qmd pro quo </em>theory; but the opinion shows that the theory supports the exemption of property used for an educational purpose because that is a quasi-public purpose \u2014 a <em>quid pro </em>,, \u201e ,, ... ' , , <em>quo. </em>It relieves the public of burdens .... ,. ,, and obligations which might reasonably be assumed by the state , or, as the opinion also states, renders a service which ,. ... . \u2019 . . . the public otherwise either would have , , , ,, . , , to assume or at least reasonably might assume \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A33\">This is the view reflected in the last previous case on the subject decided by this court, District of Columbia v. Catho-He Education Press, supra. The opinion. omits all reference to the <em>quid pro </em>quo; ,, ., ,, theory, notwithstanding it was urged though not m the detail or with the shme. . . , , precision as now. The court proceeds oil the assumption that the scientific char- . . <em>. ... </em>.. . , acter of the institution, accompanied, ^ the other statutory requisiteS) calls ^ exem tion into effect. We reaffirm ^ ition_ We add that the work of ^ Federatioll) which has been describ. ed not Qnl laces it Hterall in the ca<em>t</em>egory of scientific institutions but is of a public character. Not only is there the abgence of private gain but there is tbe nce Qf bHc bene\u00f1t through the preservation and development of natural resources of wildlife within the nation.</p>\n<p id=\"AnX\">Another way of stating the matter is that an exemption of course may not create inequality in taxation between persons or institutions of a private character by giving the property of one, and not the other, its benefit. But it may aid and encourage a public or quasi-pub-lie service through designated types of organizations, such as library, benevolent, charitable or scientific institutions, see n. 1, supra, conducted for no private gain. Using the provision applicable to the instant case as illustrative, the public, benefit which the government \u201creasonably might assume\u201d is sufficiently proved. wben the activity is 13 ,in fact seientffic anf Private is excluded<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Acz\">on. The District of Columbia also contends that the Tax Court erred in admitting evidence of the Federation\u2019s activities-subsequent to July 1, 1952, since the status of the property in relation to the exemption is that which it had on July 1; but examination of the evidence as a whole demonstrates to us that the Tax Court was justified in finding that as of July 1, 1952, the Federation was a scien-tifie institution, incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia, and not conducted for private gain,</p>\n<p id=\"agk-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\">. \u00a7 47-1208, D.O.Code (1951), exempts \u201c * * * The personal property of all library, benevolent,, charitable, and scien- \u25a0 tifie institutions incorporated under the laws of the United States or of the Dis-triot of Columbia and not conducted for private gain.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-33\">.

If a religious exemption, see \u00a7 47-80-la, D.C.Code (1951), were involved it could hardly be thought it must be denied because the government could not directly engage in the establishment of religious institutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
