The only defense asserted at the trial was that Durham was of unsound mind at the time of the offense. We are now urged to reverse the conviction (1) because the trial court did not correctly apply existing rules governing the burden of proof on the defense of insanity, and (2) because existing tests of criminal responsibility are obsolete and should be superseded.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Durham has a long history of imprisonment and hospitalization. In 1945, at the age of 17, he was discharged from the Navy after a psychiatric examination had shown that he suffered \u201cfrom a profound personality disorder which renders him unfit for Naval service.\u201d In 1947 he pleaded guilty to violating the National Motor Theft Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****and was placed on probation for one to three years. He attempted suicide, was taken to Gallinger Hospital for observation, and was transferred to St. Elizabeths Hospital, from which he was discharged after two months. In January of 1948, as a result of a conviction in the District of Columbia Municipal Court for passing bad checks, the District Court revoked his probation and he commenced service of his Motor Theft sentence. His conduct within the first few days in jail led to a lunacy inquiry in the Municipal Court where a jury found him to be of unsound mind. Upon commitment to St. Elizabeths, he was diagnosed as suffering from \u201cpsychosis with psychopathic personality.\u201d After 15 months of treatment, he was discharged in July 1949 as \u201crecovered\u201d and was returned to jail to serve the balance of his sentence. In June 1950 he was conditionally released. He violated the conditions by leaving the District. When he learned of a warrant for his arrest as a parole violator, he fled to the \u201cSouth and Midwest obtaining money by passing a number of bad checks.\u201d After he was found and returned to the District, the Parole Board referred him to the District Court for a lunacy inquisition, wherein a jury again found him to be of unsound mind. He was readmitted to St. Elizabeths in February 1951. This time the diagnosis was \u201cwithout mental disorder, psychopathic personality.\u201d He was discharged for the third time in May 1951. The housebreaking which is the subject of the present appeal took place two months later, on July 13, 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">According to his mother and the psychiatrist who examined him in September 1951, he suffered from hallucinations immediately after his May 1951 discharge from St. Elizabeths. Following the present indictment, in October 1951, he was adjudged of unsound mind in proceedings under \u00a7 4244 of Title 18 U.S.C., upon the affidavits of two psychiatrists that he suffered from \u201cpsychosis with psychopathic personality.\u201d He was committed to St. Elizabeths for the fourth time and given subshock insulin therapy. This commitment lasted 16 months \u2014 until February 1953 \u2014 when he was released to the custody of the District Jail on the certificate of Dr. Silk, Acting Superintendent of St. Elizabeths, that he was \u201cmentally competent to stand trial and * * * able to consult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>with counsel to properly assist in his own defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">He was thereupon brought before the court on the charge involved here. The prosecutor told the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-5\">\u201cSo I take this attitude, in view of the fact that he has been over there [St. Elizabeths] a couple of times and these cases that were charged against him were dropped, I don\u2019t think I should take the responsibility of dropping these cases against him; then Saint Elizabeths would let him out on the street, and if that man committed a murder next week then it is my responsibility. So we decided to go to trial on one case, that is the case where we found him right in the house, and let him bring in the defense, if he wants to, of unsound mind at the time the crime was committed, and then Your Honor will find him on that, and in your decision send him back to Saint Elizabeths Hospital, and then if they let him out on the street it is their responsibility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Shortly thereafter, when the question arose whether Durham could be considered competent to stand trial merely on the basis of Dr. Silk\u2019s ex parte statement, the court said to defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-8\">\u201cI am going to ask you this, Mr. Ahern: I have taken the position that if once a person has been found of unsound mind after a lunacy hearing, an ex parte certificate of the superintendent of Saint Eliza-beths is not sufficient to set aside that finding and I have held another lunacy hearing. That has been my custom. However, if you want to waive that you may do it, if you admit that he is now of sound mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-22\">The court accepted counsel\u2019s waiver on behalf of Durham, although it had been informed by the prosecutor that a letter from Durham claimed need of further hospitalization, and by defense counsel that \u201c* * * the defendant does say that even today he thinks he does need hospitalization; he told me that this morning.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon being so informed, the court said, \u201cOf course, if I hold he is not mentally competent to stand trial I send him back to Saint Elizabeths Hospital and they will send him back again in two or three months.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this atmosphere Durham\u2019s trial commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-24\">His conviction followed the trial court\u2019s rejection of the defense of insanity in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-25\">\u201cI don\u2019t think it has been established that the defendant was of unsound mind as of July 13, 1951, in the sense that he didn\u2019t know the difference between right and wrong or that even if he did, he was subject to an irresistible impulse by reason of the derangement of mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-26\">\u201cWhile, of course, the burden of proof on the issue of mental capacity to commit a crime is upon the Government, just as it is on every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>other issue, nevertheless, the Court finds that there is not sufficient to contradict the usual presumption of [sic] the usual inference of sanity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-4\">\n<em>\u201cThere is no testimony concerning the mental state of the defendant as of July IS, 1951, and therefore the usual presumption of sanity governs.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">\n<em>\u201cWhile if there was some testimony as to his mental state as of that date to the effect that he was incompetent on that date, the burden of proof would be on the Government to overcome it. There has been no such testimony, and the usual presumption of sanity prevails.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-7\">\u201cMr. Ahern, I think you have done very well by your client and defended him very ably, but I think under the circumstances there is nothing that anybody could have done.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">We think this reflects error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">In Tatum v. United States we said, \u201cWhen lack of mental capacity is raised as a defense to a charge of crime, the law accepts the general experience of mankind and presumes that all people, including those accused of crime, are sane.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> So long as this presumption prevails, the prosecution is not required to prove the defendant\u2019s sanity. But \u201cas soon as \u2018some evidence of mental disorder is introduced, * * * sanity, like any other fact, must be proved as part of the prosecution\u2019s case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Here it appears that the trial judge recognized this rule but failed to find \u201csome evidence.\u201d We hold that the court erred and that the requirement of \u201csome evidence\u201d was satisfied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-17\">In Tatum we held that requirement satisfied by considerably less than is present here. Tatum claimed lack of memory concerning the critical events and three lay witnesses testified that he appeared to be in \u201cmore or less of a trance,\u201d or \u201cabnormal,\u201d but two psychiatrists testified that he was of \u201csound mind\u201d both at the time of examination and at the time of the crime. Here, the psychiatric testimony was unequivocal that Durham was of unsound mind at the time of the crime. Dr. Gilbert, the only expert witness heard,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> so stated at least four times. This crucial testimony is set out in the margin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Intensive questioning by the court failed to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>duce any retraction of Dr. Gilbert\u2019s testimony that the \u201cperiod of insanity would have embraced the date July 13, 1951.\u201d And though the prosecution sought unsuccessfully in its cross- and reeross-examination of Dr. Gilbert to establish that Durham was a malingerer who feigned insanity whenever he was trapped for his misdeeds, it failed to present any expert testimony to support this theory. In addition to Dr. Gilbert\u2019s testimony, there was testimony by Durham\u2019s mother to the effect that in the interval between his discharge from St. Elizabeths in May 1951, and the crime \u201che seemed afraid of people\u201d and had urged her to put steel bars on his bedroom windows.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">Apparently the trial judge regarded this psychiatric testimony as \u201cno testimony\u201d on two grounds: (1) it did not adequately cover Durham\u2019s condition on July 13, 1951, the date of the offense; and (2) it was not directed to Durham\u2019s capacity to distinguish between right and wrong. We are unable to agree that for either of these reasons the psychiatric testimony could properly be considered \u201cno testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">(1) Following Dr. Gilbert\u2019s testimony that the condition in which he found Durham on September 3, 1951 was progressive and did not \u201carrive overnight,\u201d Dr. Gilbert responded to a series of questions by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-10\">\u201cQ. [Court]. Then is it reasonable to assume that it is not possible to determine <em>how far </em>this state of unsound mind had progressed by July 13th? Isn\u2019t that so? A. [Dr. Gilbert]. As to the seriousness of the symptoms as compared with them and the time I observed him, that\u2019s true, except that his travels were based, according to his statement to me, on certain of the symptoms and his leaving Washington, his giving up his job and work and leaving the work that he had tried to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-11\">\u201cQ. But you can\u2019t tell, can you, <em>how far </em>those symptoms had progressed and become worse by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>13th of July? A. No, not <em>how far </em>they were, that is correct.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Thereafter, when the prosecutor on recross asked Dr. Gilbert whether he would change his opinion concerning Durham\u2019s mental condition on July 13, 1951, if he knew that Durham had been released from St. Elizabeths just two months before as being of sound mind, the court interrupted to say: \u201cJust a minute. The Doctor testified in answer to my question that he doesn't know and he can\u2019t express a definite opinion as to his mental condition on the 13th of July.\u201d This, we think, overlooks the witness' unequivocal testimony on direct and cross-examination,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and misconceives what he had said in response to questioning by the court, namely, that certain symptoms of mental disorder antedated the crime, although it was impossible to say how far they had progressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Moreover, any conclusion that there was <em>\u201cno </em>testimony\u201d regarding Dui'ham\u2019s mental condition at the time of the crime disregards the testimony of his mother. Her account of his behavior after his discharge from St. Elizabeths in May 1951 was directly pertinent to the issue of his sanity at the time of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">(2) On re-direct examination, Dr. Gilbert was asked whether he would say that Durham \u201cknew the difference between right and wrong on July 13, 1951; that is, his ability to distinguish between what was right and what was wrong.\u201d He replied: \u201cAs I have stated before, if the question of the right and wrong were propounded to him he could give you the right answer.\u201d Then the court interrupted to ask:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-7\">\u201cThe Court. No, I don\u2019t think that is the question, Doctor \u2014 not whether he could give a right answer to a question, but whether he, himself, knew the difference between right and wrong in connection with governing his own actions. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-8\">If you are unable to answer, why, you can say so; I mean, if you are unable to form an opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-10\">\u201cThe Witness. I can only answer this way: That I can\u2019t tell how much the abnormal thinking and the abnormal experiences in the form of hallucinations and delusions \u2014 delusions of persecution \u2014 had to do with his anti-social behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-11\">\u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone can answer that question categorically, except as one\u2019s experience leads him to know that most mental cases can give you a categorical answer of right and wrong, but what influence these symptoms have on abnormal behavior or anti-social behavior\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-12\">\u201cThe Court. Well, your answer is that you are unable to form an opinion, is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-13\">\u201cThe Witness. I would say that that is essentially true, for the reasons that I have given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Later, when defense counsel sought elaboration from Dr. Gilbert on his answers relating to the \u201cright and wrong\u201d test, the court cut off the questioning with the admonition that \u201cyou have answered the question, Doctor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">The inability of the expert to give categorical assurance that Durham was unable to distinguish between right and wrong did not destroy the effect of his previous testimony that the period of Durham\u2019s \u201cinsanity\u201d embraced July 13, 1951. It is plain from our decision in Tatum that this previous testimony was adequate to prevent the presumption of sanity from becoming conclusive and to place the burden of proving sanity upon the Government. None of the testimony before the court in Tatum was couched in terms of \u201cright and wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">Finally, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the court, contrary to the plain meaning of its words, recognized that the prosecution had the burden of proving Durham\u2019s sanity, there would still be a fatal error. For once the issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>insanity is raised by the introduction of \u201csome evidence,\u201d so that the presumption of sanity is no longer absolute, it is incumbent upon the trier of fact to weigh and consider \u201cthe whole evidence, including that supplied by the presumption of sanity * * * \u201d on the issue of \u201cthe capacity in law of the accused to commit\u201d the crime.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here, manifestly, the court as the trier of fact did not and could not weigh \u201cthe whole evidence,\u201d for it found there was \u201cno testimony concerning the mental state\u201d of Durham.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">It has been ably argued by counsel for Durham that the existing tests in the District of Columbia for determining criminal responsibility, <em>i. e., </em>the so-called right-wrong test supplemented by the irresistible impulse test, are not satisfactory criteria for determining criminal responsibility. We are urged to adopt a different test to be applied on the retrial of this case. This contention has behind it nearly a century of agitation for reform.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-22\">A. The right-wrong test, approved in this jurisdiction in 1882,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was the exclusive test of criminal responsibility in the District of Columbia until 1929 when we approved the irresistible impulse test as a supplementary test in Smith v. United States.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The right-wrong test has its roots in England. There, by the first quarter of the eighteenth century, an accused escaped punishment if he could not distinguish \u201cgood and evil,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>if he \u201cdoth not know what he is doing, no more than * * * a wild beast.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Later in the same century, the \u201cwild beast\u201d test was abandoned and \u201cright and wrong\u201d was substituted for \u201cgood and evil.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And toward the middle of the nineteenth century, the House of Lords in the famous M\u2019Naghten case<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> restated what had become the accepted \u201cright-wrong\u201d test<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in a form which has since been followed, not only in England<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> but in most American jurisdictions<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as an exclusive test of criminal responsibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-23\">\u201c * * * the jurors ought to be told in all cases that every man is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction ; and that, to establish a de-fence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">As early as 1838, Isaac Ray, one of the founders of the American Psychia-trie Association, in bis now classic Medical Jurisprudence of Insanity, called knowledge of right and wrong a \u201cfallacious\u201d test of criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This view has long since been substantiated by enormous developments in knowledge of mental life.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In 1928 Mr. Justice Cardozo said to the New York Academy of Medicine: \u201cEveryone concedes that the present [legal] definition of insanity has little relation to the truths of mental life.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">Medico-legal writers in large number,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1949-1953,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and The Preliminary Report by the Committee on Forensic Psychiatry of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> present convincing evidence that the right-and-wrong test is \u201cbased on an entirely obsolete and misleading conception of the nature of insanity.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The science of psychiatry now recognizes that a man is an integrated personality and that reason, which is only one element in that personality, is not the sole determinant of his conduct. The right-wrong test, which considers knowledge or reason alone, is therefore an inadequate guide to mental responsibility for criminal behavior. As Professor Sheldon Glueck of the Harvard Law School points out in discussing the right-wrong tests, which he calls the knowledge tests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">\u201cIt is evident that the knowledge tests unscientifically abstract out of the mental make-up but one phase or element of mental life, the cognitive, which, in this era of dynamic psychology, is beginning to be regarded as not the most important factor in conduct and its disorders. In brief, these tests proceed upon the following questionable assumptions of an outworn era in psychiatry:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">(1) that lack of knowledge of the \u2018nature or quality\u2019 of an act (assuming the meaning of such terms to be clear), or incapacity to know right from wrong, is the sole or even the most important symptom of mental disorder; (2) that such knowledge is the sole instigator and guide of conduct, or at least the most important element therein, and consequently should be the sole criterion of responsibility when insanity is involved; and (3) that the capacity of knowing right from wrong can be completely intact and functioning perfectly even though a defendant is otherwise demonstrably of disordered mind.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-16\">Nine years ago we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-17\">\u201cThe modern science of psychology * * * does not conceive that there is a separate little man in the top of one\u2019s head called reason whose function it is to guide another unruly little man called instinct, emotion, or impulse in the way he should go.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-18\">By its misleading emphasis on the cognitive, the right-wrong test requires court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>and jury to rely upon what is, scientifically speaking, inadequate, and most often, invalid <footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and irrelevant testimony in determining criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">The fundamental objection to the right-wrong test, however, is not that criminal irresponsibility is made to rest upon an inadequate, invalid or indeterminable symptom or manifestation, but that it is made to rest upon <em>any </em>particular symptom.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In attempting to define insanity in terms of a symptom, the courts have assumed an impossible role,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> not merely one for which they have no special competence.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> As the Royal Commission emphasizes, it is dangerous \u201cto abstract particular mental faculties, and to lay it down that unless these particular faculties are destroyed or gravely impaired, an accused person, whatever the nature of his mental disease, must be held to be criminally responsible * * <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In this field of law as in others, the fact finder should be free to consider all information advanced by relevant scientific disciplines.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-17\">Despite demands in the name of scientific advances, this court refused to alter the right-wrong test at the turn of the century.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> But in 1929, we reconsidered in response to \u201cthe cry of scientific experts\u201d and added the irresistible impulse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>test as a supplementary test for determining criminal responsibility. Without \u201chesitation\u201d we declared, in Smith v. United States, \u201cit to be the law of this District that, in cases where insanity is interposed as a defense, and the facts are sufficient to call for the application of the rule of irresistible impulse, the jury should be so charged.\u201d <footnotemark>39</footnotemark> We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-4\">\u201c * * * The modern doctrine is that the degree of insanity which will relieve the accused of the consequences of a criminal act must be such as to create in his mind an uncontrollable impulse to commit the offense charged. This impulse must be such as to override the reason and judgment and obliterate the sense of right and wrong to the extent that the accused is deprived of the power to choose between right and wrong. The mere ability to distinguish right from wrong is no longer the correct test either in civil or criminal cases, where the defense of insanity is interposed. The accepted rule in this day and age, with the great advancement in medical science as an enlightening influence on this subject, is that the accused must be capable, not only of distinguishing between right and wrong, but that he was not impelled to do the act by an irresistible impulse, which means before it will justify a verdict of acquittal that his reasoning powers were so far dethroned by his diseased mental condition as to deprive him of the will power to resist the insane impulse to perpetrate the deed, though knowing it to be wrong.\u201d <footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">As we have already indicated, this has since been the test in the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Although the Smith case did not abandon the right-wrong test, it did liberate the fact finder from exclusive reliance upon that discredited criterion by allowing the jury to inquire also whether the accused suffered from an undefined \u201cdiseased mental condition [which] deprive [d] him of the will power to resist the insane impulse * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The term \u201cirresistible impulse,\u201d however, carries the misleading implication that \u201cdiseased mental condition[s]\u201d produce only sudden, momentary or spontaneous inclinations to commit unlawful acts.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\">As the Royal Commission found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-14\">\u201c* * * In many cases * <em>* </em>* this is not true at all. The sufferer from [melancholia, for example] experiences a change of mood which alters the whole of his existence. He may believe, for instance, that a future of such degradation and misery awaits both him and his family that death for all is a less dreadful alternative. Even the thought that the acts he contemplates are murder and suicide pales into insignificance in contrast with what he otherwise expects. The criminal act, in such circumstances, may be the reverse of impulsive. It may be coolly and carefully prepared; yet it is still the act of a madman. This is merely an illustration; similar states of mind are likely to lie behind the criminal act when murders are committed by persons suffering from schizophrenia or paranoid psy-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>aboses due to disease of the brain.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">We find that as an exclusive criterion the right-wrong test is inadequate in that (a) it does not take sufficient account of psychic realities and scientific knowledge, and (b) it is based upon one symptom and so cannot validly be applied in all circumstances. We find that the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d test is also inadequate in that it gives no recognition to mental illness characterized by brooding and reflection and so relegates acts caused by such illness to the application of the inadequate right-wrong test. We conclude that a broader test should be adopted.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\"> B. In the District of Columbia, the formulation of tests of criminal responsibility is entrusted to the courts <footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and, in adopting a new test, we invoke our inherent power to make the change prospectively.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-14\">The rule we now hold must be applied on the retrial of this case and in future cases is not unlike that followed by the New Hampshire court since 1870.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> It is simply that an accused is not criminally responsible if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">We use \u201cdisease\u201d in the sense of a condition which is considered capable of either improving or deteriorating. We use \u201cdefect\u201d in the sense of a condition which is not considered capable of either improving or deteriorating and which may be either congenital, or the result of injury, or the residual effect of a physical or mental disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Whenever there is \u201csome evidence\u201d that the accused suffered from a diseased or defective mental condition at the time the unlawful act was committed, the trial court must provide the jury with guides for determining whether the accused can be held criminally responsible. We do not, and indeed could not, formulate an instruction which would be either appropriate or binding in all cases. But under the rule now announced, any instruction should in some way convey to the jury the sense and substance of the following: If you the jury believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was not suffering from a diseased or defective mental condition at the time he committed the criminal act charged, you may find him guilty. If you believe he was suffering from a diseased or defective mental condition when he committed the act, but believe beyond a reasonable doubt that the act was not the product of such mental abnormality, you may find him guilty. Unless you believe beyond a reasonable doubt either that he was not suffering from a diseased or defective mental condition, or that the act was not the product of such abnormality, you must find the accused not guilty by reason of insanity. Thus your task would not be completed upon finding, if you did find, that the accused suffered from a mental disease or defect. He would still be responsible for his unlawful act. if there was no causal connection between such mental abnormality and the act.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> These questions must be determined by you from the facts which you find to be fairly deducible from the testimony and the evidence in this case.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">The questions of fact under the test we now lay down are as capable of determination by the jury as, for example, the questions juries must determine upon a claim of total disability under a policy of insurance where the state of medical knowledge concerning the disease involved, and its effects, is obscure or in conflict. In such cases, the jury is not required to depend on arbitrarily selected \u201csymptoms, phases or manifestations\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> of the disease as criteria for determining the ultimate questions of fact upon which the claim depends. Similarly, upon a claim of criminal irresponsibility, the jury will not be required to rely on such symptoms as criteria for determining the ultimate' question of fact upon which such claim depends. Testimony as to such \u201csymptoms, phases or manifestations,\u201d along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>with other relevant evidence, will go to the jury upon the ultimate questions of fact which it alone can finally determine. Whatever the state of psychiatry, the psychiatrist will be permitted to carry out his principal court function which, as we noted in Holloway v. U. S., \"is to inform the jury of the character of [the accused\u2019s] mental disease [or defect].\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The jury\u2019s range of inquiry will not be limited to, but may include, for example, whether an accused, who suffered from a mental disease or defect did not know the difference between right and wrong, acted under the compulsion of an irresistible impulse, or had \u201cbeen deprived of or lost the power of his will * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Finally, in leaving the determination of the ultimate question of fact to the jury, we permit it to perform its traditional function which, as we said in Holloway, is to apply \u201cour inherited ideas of moral responsibility to individuals prosecuted for crime * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Juries will continue to make moral judgments, still operating under the fundamental precept that \u201cOur collective conscience does not allow punishment where it cannot impose blame.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> But in making such judgments, they will be guided by wider horizons of knowledge concerning mental life. The question will be simply whether the accused acted because of a mental disorder, and not whether he displayed particular symptoms which medical science has long recognized do not necessarily, or even typically, accompany even the most serious mental disorder.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">The legal and moral traditions of the western world require that those who, of their own free will and with evil intent (sometimes called <em>mens rea), </em>commit acts <em>which </em>violate the law, shall be criminally responsible for those acts. Our traditions also require that where such acts stem from and are the product of a mental disease or defect as those terms are used herein, moral blame shall not attach, and hence there will not be criminal responsibility.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The rule we state in this opinion is designed to meet these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-8\">.

It is impossible to express this adequately in words, alone, since such diagnostic judgments involve clinical skill and experience which cannot wholly be verbalized. * * * The medical profession would be baffled if asked to write into the legal code universally valid criteria for the diagnosis of the many types of psychotic illness which may seriously disturb a person\u2019s responsibility, and even if this were attempted, the diagnostic criteria would have to be rewritten from time to time, with the progress of psychiatric knowledge.\u201d Quoted in Guttmacher &amp; Weihofen, Psychiatry and the Law 419-20 (1952).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b920-20\">. \u201c * * * the legal profession were invading the province of medicine, and attempting to install old exploded medical theories in the place of facts established in the progress of scientific knowledge.\u201d State v.

Such a doctrine would be dangerous in the extreme. The law does not recognize it; and a jury cannot without violating their oaths.\u201d This position was emphatically reaffirmed in Snell v.

Mental abnormalities vary infinitely in their nature and intensity and in their effects on the character and conduct of those who suffer from them. Where a person suffering from a mental abnormality commits a crime, there must always be some likelihood that the abnormality has played some part in the causation of the crime; and, generally speaking, the graver the abnormality, * * * the more probable it must be that there is a causal connection between them.
