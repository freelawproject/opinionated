In its course, a great deal of testimony was offered and, though there were some conflicts, the testimony on the issues of the negligence and gross negligence of defendant preponderated to prove the facts substantially as claimed by plaintiff, and at its conclusion the cause was submitted to the jury on special issues, all of which were found in favor of plaintiff with the exception that in answer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>question No. 38, the jury found that plaintiff was negligent in failing to substitute HF for HF-X as requested by defendant. It found, though, in answer to question 39 that this negligence was not a proximate cause of the fire and in answer to other questions that de-, fendant\u2019s negligence and gross negligence were.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Upon the issue of exemplary or punitive damages, the parties stipulated that if such damages should be allowed, they would be fixed at $17,500, the amount of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, and the jury allowed and fixed them at that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Appealing from the judgment on the verdict, defendant is here with nine numbered specifications of error presented and argued under six numbered points, insisting that its motion for an instructed verdict should have been granted and the judgment should be here reversed and rendered, or, in the alternative, that the judgment should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">For the reasons hereafter briefly stated as to each of these grounds, we do not think so. Appellant\u2019s main, its most confidently argued point is the one asserting that plaintiffs are bound by the terms and provisions of the \u201cacknowledgment of order\u201d, particularly those against warranty, which defendant insists constituted the contract between plaintiff and it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">Appellees, in reply to this contention, citing many cases,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> urge upon us: (1) that the contract was made and the obligations of the parties fixed before the acknowledgment of order was delivered to plaintiff; (2) that the provision in it on which defendant relies was not seen by, or called to the attention of plaintiff, and, therefore, was not agreed to by, or binding upon, it; (3) that contracts which it is claimed exempt from negligence are strictly construed and will not exempt therefrom unless the exempting provision claiming it is plain and imperative to that effect, especially is that so when exemption from gross negligence is claimed; and (4) that the provision relied on here does not even purport to exempt from either simple or gross negligence. It especially does not exempt from subsequent negligence after discovered peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">We are of the clear opinion that appellant\u2019s claim of exemption from the consequences of its negligence and gross negligence is without merit under the facts of this case. This is so because: (1) the \u201cacknowledgment\u201d relied on was not contractual, the contract having already been made <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> before the acknowledgment was sent to plaintiff\u2019s office; and (2) if it was a part of the contract and should be given effect as a covenant against warranting, it did not purport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>to, it did not, contract against its negligence and gross negligence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Appellant stands no better on its second point that the verdict, finding plaintiff negligent but that this was not the proximate cause of the loss, required: a judgment for defendant on the ground that the negligence of plaintiff was as matter of law the proximate cause of the loss, and the verdict, that it was not, was without support in the evidence; or, in the alternative, the granting of a new trial because the findings were fatally inconsistent and would not support the judgment. This is so because the answers to questions 38 and 39 must be read in the light of the court\u2019s definition of \u201cnegligence\u201d and \u201cproximate cause\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In the light of those definitions, the findings certainly did not require the entry of judgment for defendant. In their light it is quite plain that the jury meant by the answer to question 38 to say that a prudent person would have substituted HF for HF-X as requested by defendant, but it did not mean to say that he would have done this because he would have foreseen that the natural and probable consequences of its failure to do so would have resulted in the fire and injury in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In answering questions 38 and 39 as it did, the jury thus fitted its answers to the questions asked and not to some suppositious content of the word \u201cnegligence\u201d which had been otherwise defined in the charge. If the evidence supports the verdict that plaintiff was negligent in the sense of the definition of \u201cnegligence\u201d contained in the charge, and we express no opinion on that point, it certainly as clearly supports and fully justifies the finding that such negligence was not the proximate cause of the fire but defendant\u2019s negligence was.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">While it thus clearly appears, that defendant was not entitled to a judgment on the verdict, it appears with equal clarity that there was no fatal inconsistency in the verdict, indeed no&gt; inconsistency at all. Under settled law, the submission of the issues of negligence and proximate cause under two separate questions was usual and proper. Besides, no objection was made to the submission of the issues in the form chosen. In the light of the definitions used, the two separate findings were not, they could not be, inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Appellant\u2019s vigorous argument and Its reliance upon Phillips v. Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co., Tex.Civ.App., 223 S.W.2d 258, 263, in which the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">\u201cImplicit in attributing the quality of negligence to an act or omission is the notice of or a duty to know of its harmful tendency. 38 Am.Jur., p. 667, par. 24; Seale v. Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 65 Tex. 274, 57 Am.Rep. 602; City of Dal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>las v. Maxwell, Tex.Com.App., 248 S.W. 667, 27 A.L.R. 927 * * \u201d will not, therefore, avail it here, for the definition of \u201cnegligence\u201d, under which question 38 was submitted, negatived what appellant, on the authority of the cited cases, claims is \u201cimplicit\u201d in the quality of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">It may be true that the definition the court gave was not a correct one, but the time to call attention to that was at the submission, and this was not done. The jury was controlled by the definitions given in the charge, and in their light the answers are not at all inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">What was said by the Supreme Court of Texas in the case of Ford v. Carpenter, 147 . Tex. 447, 216 S.W.2d 558, is peculiarly apposite here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201cIt is the duty of the trial court to reconcile apparent conflicts in the jury\u2019s finding if they can be reasonably done in the light of the pleadings and the evidence, the manner in which the issues were submitted, and in view of the other findings when considered as a whole.!\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABgH\">Appellant\u2019s three remaining questions have to do; (1) with the claim that the insurance companies were indispensable parties to the suit, or at least were real parties at interest under rule 17, and appellant should have had the b\u00e9n-efit of making the fact that they were parties known to the jury; (2) with the claim of the insufficiency of the evidence to support a finding of gross negligence; and (3) with the claim that a part of plaintiff\u2019s demand was barred by limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Since it is clear from the record that the suit was properly prosecuted by plaintiff under loan receipts, it is also clear that the insurance companies were neither indispensable nor necessary parties, and that, while the action of the court in permitting them to intervene in the suit was neither necessary nor proper, the defendant took no prejudice therefrom. The Clark Company was, under the undisputed facts of record, the real party at interest in the sense of the rule governing suits filed under loan receipt procedure,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but if they were proper parties, the defendant has suffered no legal wrong from the way the cause was tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">As appellant points out in its brief, the purpose of the practice long obtaining in the federal courts and now set forth in Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A., that every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest, is to enable the defendant to avail himself of evidence and defenses that the defendant has against the real party in interest, and to assure him finality of the judgment, and that he will be protected against another suit brought by the real party at interest on the same matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\"> In the light of the real meaning of the rule, if the insurance companies were proper parties, the defendant has suffered no legal wrong from the way the cause was tried. It was not deprived of offsets or defenses it might have had against them. It was understood by all that the counsel for the insurance companies were in active conduct of the suit and the judgment entered would have barred them whether or not they were actually in the cause, so that defendant was at no time concerned with the question of lack of finality of the judgment or the possibility of its being again sued. Its real, its only concern was not to have the insurance companies brought into the suit to protect itself against being again sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>or with respect to offsets or claims against them but for the possible prejudice which plaintiff might suffer in the minds of the jury because of the knowledge that plaintiff was insured. Such a purpose is neither a proper nor a legal purpose. The courts have uniformly condemned it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">To appellant\u2019s point that the claim of the insurance companies in the sum of $78,800 was by subrogation not to the claim of the plaintiff but to the claim of R.F.C. for damages to its mortgage interest, and the suit of plaintiff did not toll the running of the statute of limitations because the causes of action of the plaintiff and of the insurance companies are different, appellee correctly replies: that this is not so; that the insurance companies adjusted their loss not with the R.F.C. but with plaintiff, making their checks payable to plaintiff and the R.F.C., as mortgagee, jointly; that with the proceeds of this insurance, plaintiff\u2019s debt to the R.F.C. was paid off, and when its debt was paid, such rights, if any, as R.F.C. had in the insurance reverted to plaintiff; and that long before the two year statute of limitation ran, this suit was brought; and under rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when the insurance companies intervened, the amendment related back to the date of the original filing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\"> There is no substance in appellant\u2019s final point that the evidence does not support a finding of gross negligence. Indeed, we think that the conduct of defendant in not specifically warning plaintiff of the dangers of the continued use of the I1F-X it had induced plaintiff to use, after it discovered them, is so flagrant as almost, if not quite, to support an instruction for plaintiff that defendant was guilty of gross negligence as matter of law. Indeed, we are of the clear opinion that under the undisputed facts there was subsequent negligence after plaintiff\u2019s peril was known to it of such a nature, whether it is called gross or not, as, under the humanitarian doctrine which underlies the law of discovered peril, to entitle plaintiff to an instructed verdict on that score.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\">. In 1949 Clark was engaged in the hydraulic die casting business in San Marcos, Texas. The hazard of fire is inherent in this business. The die casting machine operates under a pressure of approximately one thousand pounds per square inch, and a hydraulic fluid is used to transmit this pressure. Molten metal is poured into the die casting machine, and the machine casts or stamps that metal into products. To keep that metal molten in order to pour it into the machine, there must be a furnace almost immediately adjacent to the die casting machine which is operated at extremely high temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">Clark had been using as a hydraulic fluid Aroclor, a product of Monsanto Chemical Company. This was apparently satisfactory from the standpoint of not catching on fire, but whenever a line break occurred the odors were so terrifie that they caused the employees to become ill, and the plant had to be shut down for an appreciable length of time in order to get the odors out of the building. Furthermore, the substance was toxic, and if any of it got on an employee\u2019s hands he immediately had to take steps to protect his skin. In addition, it ate into the gaskets in the machine, so that the gaskets frequently had to be replaced. The product, therefore, from these standpoints was unsatisfactory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-20\">. On July 12, 1949, Clark wrote to Cel-anese at its home office in New York to inquire of its product Lindol HF, an oily substance manufactured from coal tar and chemically known as tricresyl phosphate. Mr. W. W. Bell, director of sales of the organic phosphates department, chemical division, of Celanese, personally wrote back to Clark, giving the specifications of Lindol HF and describing it as being \u201cnonflammable\u201d and stating that it would not \u201csupport combustion\u201d. Accompanying this letter were testimonials from die casters and several pages of literature on Lindol HF. In the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>communication Mr. Bell stated tliat Cel-anese was putting a new product on the market called Lindol HF-M which would combine all the advantages of Lindol HF with a superior viscosity at a lower price.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-5\">. Clark then wrote back asking for details on Lindol HF-M, and in response Celanese telegraphed Clark on Aug. 5, stating that Lindol IIF-X tests had been completed and offering it at $2.30 per gallon. 1 Shortly thereafter Clark forwarded its order by mail for 104 gallons of Lindol HF-X, which arrived in San Marcos and was placed in Clark\u2019s hydraulic lines about Sept. 1, 3949. Lindol HF-X was the third fluid sold by Celanese as a product of trieresyl phosphate, an oily derivative of coal tar, and it was the second adulteration of trieresyl phosphate. The first adulteration was Lindol HF-M, which was nothing more than 50 percent trieresyl phosphate and 50 percent petroleum oil. Lindol 11F-X was 50 percent trieresyl phosphate, 46 percent aromatic petroleum oil, and 4 percent Santodex, which was a viscosity improver. However, from the standpoint of fire hazard, Lindol HF \u2014 M and Lindol HF-X were the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\">.
