The first is whether the Veterans\u2019 Administration properly applied two premiums paid to it for the reinstatement of five year level premium term insurance. The second is whether the court below was correct in holding that the United States was not. estopped to assert the lapse in the insured's policy as a defense to the action. See D.C., 118 F.Supp. 446. The method of allocation of the premiums employed by the Veterans\u2019 Administration represented a proper administrative construction. The.application of the premiums \"clearly was in aeT cord with the pertinent provisions of the National Service Life, Insurance Act of 1940 as amended, 54 Stat. 1014, 38 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 801 et seq. Although', at' .the critical time, there was no regulation in effect as to the manner in which reinstatement premiums were to be allocated, the Veterans\u2019 Administration Manual, M9-A, set out a proper method of allocation; viz., one premium for the prior grace month and one for the premium month of application.\u2019 Clearly there was no estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">The pertinent issues are discussed fully and adequately in the excellent opinion of Judge Murphy in the court below. No further discussion is required. We find no error in the decision of the court below. Its judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
