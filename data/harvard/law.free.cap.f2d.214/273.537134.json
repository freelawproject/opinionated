He commenced this action seeking a declaratory judgment and in-junctive relief, and from the . District Court\u2019s order granting appellees\u2019 motion io dismiss, he brought this appeal. We are presented with the question whether the government after a Loyalty Review Board decision that reasonable grounds did not exist to believe the appellant disloyal under the standard set forth in Executive Order No. 9835, 12 F.R. 1935, 3 C.F.R., (Supp.1947), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 631 note, could later, on the same charges, reexamine and determine his loyalty status according to a different standard contained in Executive Order No. 10241, 16 F.R. 3690, 3 C.F.R. 431 (Supp.1951), U. S. Code Congressional and Administrative News 1951, p. 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"A_t\">I</p>\n<p id=\"APV\">\" * * * <em>reasonable grounds exist for belief that the person involved is disloyal. </em>* * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AjO\">Appellant had been a classified civil service regular clerk in the Philadel-Pennsylvania, Post Office from 1923 until 1945 when he became a na-ft0nal officer of a labor organization rec-0gnjze(j jjy the Post Office Department. gjnce 1949 he devoted full time to his organizati0n duties, on leave without pay pursuant to Department permission,</p>\n<p id=\"akt-dedup-0\">In 1948 appellant was served with a ]\\y0hiCe of Proposed Removal Action pur-guant t0 the provisions of Executive Or-9835, setting forth certain charges of disloyalty to the government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9fg\">Appellant filed an answer, a hearing was held on February 28, 1949, and the Department Loyalty Board found, on September 6, 1949, that reasonable grounds did exist for belief that appellant was disloyal. An appeal was then taken to the Postmaster General who found after further hearing, that reasonable grounds existed for believing that appellant was disloyal. On appeal to the Loyalty Review Board in the Civil Service Commission it was concluded on November 2, 1950 that reasonable grounds did not exist for believing that appellant was disloyal. In reversing the rulings of the Department Loyalty Board and of the Postmaster General, the Loyalty Review Board construed and applied as the test or standard for removal the provision from Executive Order No. 9835 that \u201creasonable grounds exist for belief that the person involved is disloyal to the Government of the United States.\u201d The Board recommended that appellant be restored to his position and the Postmaster General then concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlC\"><em>\"There is a reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the person involved. </em>* * *\u00ab</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtD\">On April 28, 1951 Executive Order No. 9835 in one important particular, was amended by Executive Order No. 10241, but in all other respects was continued in full force and effect. The \u201creasonable grounds\u201d standard was eliminated, and in lieu thereof the Order prescribed that the standard to be applied should read: \u201cThere is a reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the person involved to the Government of the United States.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 23, 1951, the Loyalty Review Board issued its Memorandum No. 66 which provided: \u201cEach department or agency loyalty board having jurisdiction shall adjudicate under the standard of Executive Order No. 10241 all loyalty cases in which unfavorable determinations made by any board were reversed on appeal prior to May 1, 1951, provided the individuals concerned are still employed in the department or agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"a_e-dedup-0\">Thereafter, pursuant to the quoted instructions the Department Loyalty Board served on the appellant, on January 10, 1952, a new Notice of Proposed Removal Action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant filed his answer, and after a hearing on May 5, 1952 before the Department Loyalty Board and a finding by the Board on August 7, 1952 that \u201cthere is a reasonabIe doubt as to y\u00b0ur loyalty to the government of the United States,\u201d apPeRaiR appealed to the Postmaster Generab December 9, 1952 the Post-m^ter General issued a similar finding and affirmed the findings and recommendations of the Department Loyalty Boar(L The decision of tbe Loyalty Re' view Board after faring on appeal, affirmed tbe decision of the Postmaster General on April 2, 1953, requested that aPPellant be separated from the service, and on APril 10, 1953&gt; aPPellant was notlfied of his removal from the Post 0ffice Department. Appellant then cornmenC6d this action,</p>\n<p id=\"AMD1\">GI</p>\n<p id=\"AlY\"> Appellant\u2019s principal contention is that the decision of the Loyalty Review Board in the 1949 hearing preeluded re-examination in the 1952 hearing on the same charges under the standard set up in Executive Order No. 10241. We find this contention untenable. In Churchill Tabernacle v. Federal Communications Commission, 1947, 81 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>App.D.C. 411, 160 F.2d 244, 246, we rejected an extension of the principle of <em>res judicata </em>to administrative proceedings. Speaking for this Court, Chief Justice Groner pointed out that it is well settled \u201cthat <em>res judicata </em>and equitable estoppel do not ordinarily apply to decisions of administrative tribunals *r * *\u201d He cautioned against [transplanting] into the realm of admmistrative law rules of procedure, trial and review which have evolved m the history and experience of courts Id 81 U.S.App.D.C. at page 413, 160 F.2d at page 246.</p>\n<p id=\"aky-dedup-0\">Even were we inclined to disregard the cogent ^ observations of that distinguished jurist, and we are not, the language of the standard set out in Executive Order No. 10241 cannot be ignored. A markedly different legal sit\u00faation was presented.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0Q\">When the Loyalty Review Board considered appellant\u2019s case under the standard found in Executive Order No. 9835, the ultimate fact which was the subject of inquiry was <em>disloyalty, </em>disloyalty to the government of the United States. The standard did not deal in terms with grounds which might have existed in the past for a finding that some person had at some earlier time been disloyal. Rather, the Board was bound in the exercise of prudence and caution to determine whether or not the facts and circumstances established a \u201cbelief\u201d \u2014 that is, a present or immediate assurance of \u201cdisloyalty.\u201d The tense of the verbs used, \u201cexist\u201d and \u201cis,\u201d was the present tense. The \u201creasonable grounds\u201d had to be actually or really in being, <em>presently, </em>at the time of review, The \u201cbelief\u201d was not some past belief but a then existent belief. The evidence, the mass of details, the facts and the inferences appropriately to be drawn therefrom had to be tested by the standard to be derived from the words employed to state it. Cumulatively all factors had to culminate in a justifiable con-elusion of present disloyalty. It is not a simple matter now, nor was it in 1949 for any Board to say that a person involved is disloyal.</p>\n<p id=\"AUP\">Quite different was the test which the Board was to apply under the prescription of Executive Order No. 10241:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aja-dedup-0\">\u00abThe standard for the refusal of employment or the removal from employment in an executive department or agency on grounds relating t() loyalty sha\u00a1, be tha&lt;. on aI1 the evidence; there is a reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the person in_ volved to the Government of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4_\">The Board\u2019s duty at the second review Was thus to inquire whether or not on all evidence there existed a reasonable basis for a present doubt. But that doubt, if any, was to operate in relation an ultimate fact of <em>loyalty, </em>not disloyalty. The word \u201cdoubt\u201d implies an unsettled state of opinion concerning the reality of an event, or the truth of an assertion, or as in this case, a doubt as to the loyalty of the person involved, Stated otherwise, the Board was no longer to be bound to inquire as to whether the proof reasonably was sufficient to convince and direct its understanding and to satisfy its reason and judgment as to disloyalty. Rather, the amended standard applied a more rigid test of suitability for government employment, It contemplated the possible existence of proof or information which, while not capable of inducing a belief that the person \u201cis disloyal,\u201d does cause a reasonable doubt as to whether he is in fact loyal.</p>\n<p id=\"As0I\">Appellant would have us say that the two standards mean the same thing, that the amended standard changed nothing, and he so argued, even as he hastened to assure us that he could not expect that the President would do a vain thing, Throughout World War II, the standard prescribed under Executive Order No. 10241 had prevailed. In 1947 the wartime standard was replaced by that provided in Executive Order No. 9835. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Whether it was because of the war in Korea and the President\u2019s declaration of the existence of an emergency in 1951, or whether the President felt that the Board was placing a more narrow interpretation than he intended on the \u201cpresent\u201d disloyalty construction of Executive Order No. 9835 or for some other reason, the fact remains that he struck down the standard found in Executive Order No. 9835 and re-promulgated the World War II standard found in Executive Order No. 10241. The two are quite different, both in language and in effect, and with appellant, we cannot say that the President did a vain thing.</p>\n<p id=\"APSJ\">Moreover, there is no vested right in federal employment, and except as restricted by law, the Executive must enjoy wide discretion in determining hiring and firing policies. See Bailey v. Richardson, 1950, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 248, 253, 259, 182 F.2d 46, affirmed by an equally divided court, 1951, 341 U.S. 918, 71 S.Ct 669, 95 L.Ed. 1352, and cases there cited. We can rightfully no more prevent the Executive from <em>reconsidering </em>the standards to be applied in determining the loyalty of federal employees than prescribe the tests in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"awm-dedup-0\">One point remains to be noticed. After Executive Order No. 10241 was issued April 30,1951, the Loyalty Review Board promulgated on May 10, 1951 Memorandum No. 65 addressed to all executive departments and agencies on the subject of \u201creopening loyalty cases under Executive Order No. 10241 when an individual receives a new appointment in the federal service.\u201d The Board took note of the amended standard of Executive Order No. 10241 and advised of its program to review the case of an individual receiving a <em>new </em>appointment notwithstanding that previously as to such persons, \u201cadjudications should not be subject to more than one adjudication on the same set of facts.\u201d Appellant was not a person receiving \u201ca new appointment,\u201d so that he was not affected by Memorandum No. 65. One week was to pass before the Board met to consider its policy with reference to other categories of federal employees,</p>\n<p id=\"aiv-dedup-1\">On May 17, 1951, the Loyalty Review Board met to consider cases such as that 0f the appellant as well as of federal employees falling into certain other categories. There were some 9300 individuals involved.</p>\n<p id=\"aek-dedup-2\">0n May 23&gt; 19Blj the Loyalty Review Board issued Memorandum No. 66 to all executiVe departments and agencies on the subject \u00abAdjudication under the standard Established by Executive Order No_ 10241 of Loyalty Cases Deter_ mined and cloged Prior to May R 19gl under Executive Order No. 9835.\u201d The Memorandum recited: \u201cThe Loyalty Re-view Board took into consideration that under Article II, Section 2, of the Con-stitution of the United States, the Acts of Congress thereunder, and the decisions of the courts, heads of depart-ments and agencies have the right to hire and fire employees. Accordingly, the Board recognized that department and agency heads have an inherent right to review any loyalty cases at any time in order to determine the qualifications of any individual for continued employ-ment.\u201d The Board further pointed out that by Presidential order the head of eac^ department and agency in the Executive Branch of the government was Personally responsible for an effective program to assure that disloyal civil-*an emPl\u00b0yees are not retained in em-Pl\u00b0yment- Again, pursuant ^ to Presidential order, the Board advised of its Purpose to coordinate employee loyalty P\u00b0llcies&gt; to achieve uniformity of treat-men^</p>\n<p id=\"ays-dedup-0\">It was against that background, that as to \u201ccases reversed on appeal\u201d the \u201cnew standard\u201d was prescribed. The Memorandum also dealt with \u201ccases reviewed in post-audit\u201d and \u201cother cases.\u201d Appellant\u2019s case clearly fell within the first category. The Board surely possessed authority to issue its Memorandum No. 65 to deal with an individual receiving a new appointment. It was equally within the Board\u2019s authority to issue its Memorandum No. 66 to deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>with other categories such as that in-eluding the appellant\u2019s case. The Board correct ly pointed out that the head of each department possesses an inherent right to review any loyalty cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6In-deed, it is the continuing duty of any department or administrative agency to execute its function in such fashion as may be required to effectuate its purposes and to accomplish its objectives. Cf. Wilbur v. United States ex rel. Kadrie, 1930, 281 U.S. 206, 217, 50 S.Ct. 320, 74 L.Ed. 809. There, the Supreme Court considered the power of the Secretary of the Interior in 1927 to reconsider and revoke a decision made in 1919. Flatly ruling that there was no want of power in the circumstances, the Court continued: \u201cThe decision in 1919 was, not a judgment pronounced in a judicial proceeding, but a ruling made by an executive officer in the exertion of administrative authority. That authority was neither exhausted nor terminated by its exercise on that occasion, but was in its nature continuing. Under it the Secretary who made the decision could reconsider the matter and revoke the decision if found wrong; and so of his suecessor.\u201d Likewise, in N. L. R. B. v. Seven-Up Bottling Co., 1953, 344 U.S. 344, 73 S.Ct. 287, 97 L.Ed. 377, where Congress had charged the National Labor Bela-tions Board with the task of devising remedies to effectuate the policies of the Act, the Board was said to possess broad discretionary power. \u201cIn fashioning remedies to undo the effects of violations of the Act, the Board must draw on enlightenment gained from experience.\u201d Id. 344 U.S. at page 346, 73 S.Ct. at page 289.</p>\n<p id=\"akd-dedup-1\">We have never heard it disputed that employees in fact disloyal to the government may and should be removed. We see no basis for holding that an executive department must retain in the service those whose loyalty is reasonably doubtful. Even under the standard set up by Executive Order No. 9835, the Department Loyalty Board and the Posimaster General had respectively found and affirmed that reasonable grounds existed for the belief that the appellant was disloyal. The President had promulgated that Executive Order as well as the standard here involved. He had the undoubted right by a later Executive Order to define and proclaim the new standard in Executive Order No. 10241.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\u201cReasonably grounded suspicion of disloyalty indicates a risk, and no concept of the Constitution requires the executive to endure recognizable and preventable risks in the administration of the law.\u201d Bailey v. Richardson, supra, 86 U.S.App.D.C. at page 263, 182 F.2d at page 61. Hundreds of thousands of persons in government employ whose loyalty is beyond the faintest shadow of suspicion inspire the admiration and respect of the public. All of us can feel more secure and believe it entirely just when procedures are evolved and applied by the Chief Executive to weed out and separate from government service those , , , ,, , who are actually disloyal or those as to . . ,, , <em>, </em>... whom reasonably grounded suspicion of , ,, . , ,, , , , disloyalty exists. No person can be loyal ... .... , \u201e ,, ., to the political cause of some worldwide conspiratorial movement which plots and seeks the destruction of our form of government and still remain loyal to the American cause. We rule that the President was justified in prescribing as a standard for the refusal of employment or the removal from employment \u201cthat, on all the evidence, there is a reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the person involved to the Government of the United States \u201d \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"ais-dedup-1\">Appellant has not demonstrated, m-deed he has not seriously urged, that the removal proceedings against him failed to conform with the procedural require- ... ments ot the civil service laws and regulations and the pertinent executive orders. Cf. Williams v. Cravens, 1954, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 380, 210 F.2d 874 and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"agv-dedup-0\">The District Court ordered that appellant\u2019s complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. With this action we are in accord for the reasons already , given. The District Court also decided that it was without jurisdiction of the subject matter and dismissed the complaint on that basis as well. This we think was error. Our own numerous decisions following challenges to the loyalty and other employee removal procedures permit no doubt as to the jurisdiction of the district courts to hear cases such as this. See e. g. United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 1947, 330 U.S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754; Kutcher v. Gray, 1952, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 266, 199 F. 2d 783; and Deak v. Pace, 1950, 88 U.S. App.D.C. 50, 185 F.2d 997. However, since the complaint was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim for relief, the judgment of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"A06Q\">Affirmed,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ago-dedup-0\">.

Actually this was not a now standard.
