Appellee admits that appellant has distributed pistol holsters, pistol holster sets and cartridge belts bearing its mark, \u201cTexas Ranger,\u201d but denies that prior to about 1948 it distributed any toy pistol holsters and toy cartridge belts under the mark, \u201cTexas Ranger,\u201d and denies that appellee\u2019s use of its mark, \u201cThe Texan,\u201d on toy holster sets it sells will result in confusion in the minds of the public or that any damage to appellant will be caused by appellee\u2019s continued use of its mark, \u201cThe Texan,\u201d on toy holster sets.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Both parties have filed stipulated evidence in narrative form from which it appears that as early as 1929 appellant and its said predecessor operated a tannery and began the manufacture of leather products including harn\u00e9ss, horse collars, saddles, cowboy chaps, riding equipment, and men\u2019s and\u2019 boy\u2019s belts, gun cases and pistol holsters; that the mark, \u201cTexas Ranger,\u201d was first applied to belts as early as 1927; \u2019 that appellant is the owner of trade-mark registration No. 342,616 issued January 19, 1937 for \u201cTexas Ranger\u201d for belts for men; that continuously since 1939 appellant has sold cartridge belts and children\u2019s belts, including \u201cJunior Texas Ranger Belt;\u201d that beginning in' 1933 the use of the mark,' \u201cTexas Ranger,\u201d was extended to boys\u2019 belts; that in 1947 a complete line of cowboy outfits for kids' was added to the \u201cTexas Ranger\u201d line; that the \u201cTexas Ranger\u201d brand of goods including belts for men and boys and pistol holster sets of some type have been continuously sold since 1933; that the first sale of children\u2019s equipment . marked \u201cTexas Ranger\u201d was made in' 1933; that in 1947 the youth line under the mark, \u201cTexas Ranger,\u201d was extended to' include chaps, suits,\u2019scabbards,' hats and toy pistols; that appellee has sold toy holster sets under its mark, \u201cThe Texan,\u201d in all the states of the United States continuously since November 1940; that in 1941 ap-pellee\u2019s sales were in excess of fifty thousand dollars and that since 1941 such sales have gradually increased until its sales in 1950 were in excess of one million dollars; and that appellee has advertised its toy holster sets sold under its mark, \u201cThe Texan,\u201d since 1940 in trade journals and by catalogues.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The Examiner of Interferences did not agree with appellee\u2019s contention that its line of toy holster sets for juvenile use is so dissimilar to the utilitarian goods of appellant that there would be no likelihood of confusion even if similar marks are contemporaneously used on the respective goods of the parties hereto. It was his view that the similarities of the goods of the parties are obvious and that while a toy set may not be made as durable as one for utilitarian use it would be only natural to believe that both types of goods were manufactured by the same company. However, he held that' the words, \u201cThe Texan\u201d and \u201cTexas Ranger,\u201d are not so similar as to be likely to cause confusion in trade as to the origin of the goods to which applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The Examiner of Interferences stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av7\">\u201cWhile it is true that one would think of a \u2018Texas Ranger\u2019 as being a \u2018Texan? still the term \u2018Texas Ranger\u2019 is so well known and so much a part of American lore, that the very mention of the name brings to mind that particular group of Texans to which, through the years, the name has reference; whereas the term \u2018The Texan\u2019 does not bring to mind any particular individual.or group of individuals or any'one particular thing related t\u00f3 Texas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The Examiner in Chief did not agree with the opinion of the Examiner of Interferences that the marks here involved are not confusingly similar and held that the words, \u201cThe Texan\u201d arid \u201cTexas Ranger/\u2019 have a more or less substantial identity arid that the use of the marks on the goods specified would very likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>lead to confusion or deception of purchasers as to the origin of the goods. However, he held that the evidence does not establish prior use by appellant of his mark, \u201cTexas Ranger,\u201d on children\u2019s cartridge belts or on toy holster sets and for that reason, affirmed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences dismissing the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Following the decision of the Examiner in Chief, appellant filed a \u201cRequest for Reconsideration\u201d in reference to which the Examiner in Chief stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cThe petition points out that the examiner of interferences in his decision held:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201c \u2018A holster set includes a belt and a holster; while a toy set may not be made as durable as one for utilitarian use, the similarities are obvious ; and it would only be natural to believe that both types of goods were manufactured by the same company,\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">but states it is apparent in order to reach the decision rendered in this case that it was necessary to find that the goods of the respective parties were not similar, and since no ruling was made on this point in the decision, the opposer now requests that a ruling be made thereon.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">\u201cAt first glance it might appear that a holster set which includes a belt and holster for real pistols and real cartridges are similar to toy holster sets for toy pistols. However, it must be remembered that one is made to hold a weapon and the other to hold a toy. Holster sets including real pistols and toy holster sets including toy pistols are not normally sold either to the same class of purchasers or in the same stores, and while I am of the opinion that the marks \u2018Texas Ranger\u2019 and \u2018The Texan\u2019 would be confusingly similar if applied to the same goods,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">I do not think that there would be a likelihood of confusion if \u2018Texas Ranger\u2019 were applied on leather goods and equipment including real pistol holster sets and cartridge belts and \u2018The Texan\u2019 were applied to toy holster sets for toy pistols.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-13\">\u201cThe petition for reconsideration is granted to the extent indicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">We have given careful consideration to the stipulated testimony, the briefs of the parties and the oral arguments before us and we agree with the decision of the Examiner of Interferences that the involved marks are not confusingly similar. We do not think the concurrent use of the marks on the goods of the parties would be likely to confuse or deceive purchasers as to the origin of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">In view of this holding, it is unnecessary to discuss other issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">However, one more matter remains to be considered. Appellant did not include in the record an index to appellee\u2019s exhibits E to Q inclusive. This index was added on the motion of appellee to correct diminution of the record. This added matter was necessary for a proper decision of this case and costs for making such addition are therefore assessed against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-17\">For the reasons stated the decision appealed from dismissing the notice of opposition is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-19\">JACKSON, Judge, retired, sat for GARRETT, Chief Judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
