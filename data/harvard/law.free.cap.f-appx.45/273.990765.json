We affirm Jack\u2019s conviction and sentence. Jack was charged in a one-count indictment with being an alien who had been deported from the United States subsequent to a conviction for the commission of an aggravated felony without obtaining express consent of the Attorney General in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). The indictment in which Jack was charged mischaraeterized a September 1995 conviction as an aggravated felony. Jack concedes, however, that he had a 1999 conviction that met the definition of an aggravated felony. The district court found Jack guilty of unlawful re-entry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). The Government gave Jack notice it would seek an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 1326(b). At sentencing, the district court sentenced Jack to forty-six months in prison using the sentencing enhancement in \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-20\">Jack argues his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 in violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Section 1326 provides a two-year maximum sentence for any alien who illegally enters the United States after having been deported. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a)(1). If the removal was subsequent to a conviction for the commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against the person, or both, or a felony other than an aggravated felony, the maximum sentence is ten years. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). If the removal was subsequent to a conviction for the commission of an aggravated felony, the maximum is twenty years. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1326(b) is a sentencing factor rather than a separate offense. We have expressly determined that the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi. United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216, 220 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2606, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2002). Accordingly, the Government was not required to charge the fact of Jack\u2019s prior conviction in the indictment or prove it beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>doubt. The district court properly concluded the mischaracterization of Jack\u2019s September 1995 conviction was not material to the crime with which he was charged and properly sentenced him under \u00a7 1326(b)(1). We therefore affirm Jack\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
