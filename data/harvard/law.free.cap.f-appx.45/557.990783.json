Although Mitchell was displeased with the district court\u2019s pretrial rulings to exclude certain witnesses and documentary evidence, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Mitchell\u2019s pro se request, on which his counsel did not comment, for a continuance. <em>See Rydder v. Rydder, </em>49 F.3d 369, 373 (8th Cir.1995) (standard of review). Given the denial of Mitchell\u2019s request for a continuance and his refusal to participate at trial, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>conclude the district court was left with little choice and did not abuse its discretion in following through with its admonishment that Mitchell\u2019s refusal to participate would result in the dismissal of his case. <em>See Rodgers v. Curators of Univ. of Mo., </em>135 F.3d 1216, 1219 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\">.
