RApp. P.'34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-22\">Proceeding pro se, Tomi Edward Jennings appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. Mr. Jennings, a prisoner at the Wyoming State Penitentiary, alleges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>the defendant prison officials unlawfully restricted his access to certain legal materials, thereby frustrating his ability to prosecute his direct criminal appeal and pursue other post-conviction remedies. He claims that the defendants\u2019 actions deprived him of his right to represent himself, violating the rule announced in <em>Faret-ta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). He further claims that the limits placed on his access to the prison\u2019s law library constituted a due process violation under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">The district court ruled that Mr. Jennings failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). It also concluded that even if he did exhaust his administrative remedies, he is barred from seeking money damages by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). And in any event, said the district court, Mr. Jennings has failed to raise an issue of material fact on the merits of his constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Having reviewed the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, as well as the relevant law, this court concludes that the district court\u2019s decision was correct. We reach that conclusion for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order dated January 14, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming is AFFIRMED. Mr. Jennings\u2019s motion to amend the complaint is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
