Plaintiff Griffin Industries (\u201cGriffin\u201d) appeals from two District Court orders granting judgment in favor of Defendant Slammiri Canz Incorporated (\u201cSlammiri Canz\u201d) following a jury trial. Because we conclude that the District Court erred in its charge to the jury and in alternatively entering judgment in favor of Slammin\u2019 Canz as a matter of law, we will vacate both orders and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">Griffin is an established business that recycles \u201cbakery waste\u201d into animal feed \u201ccookie meal\u201d and sells this feed to others for a profit. The cookie meal is used to feed cattle and chicken as a substitute for corn. Slammiri Canz is in the business of hauling bakery waste. It generally collects the waste left over from \u201csmall mom and pop\u201d bakeries. <em>See </em>App. at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-18\">Slammiri Canz contacted Griffin because it needed another outlet for the bakery waste it had at its disposal. Representatives of the two entities met to discuss an agreement whereby Slammiri Canz would deliver bakery waste to Griffin. As a result of this meeting, the parties entered into and signed a written \u201cSERVICE AGREEMENT\u201d dated March 31, 2000. The Agreement stated that it was for six years and employed the following language on the quantity of bakery waste to be delivered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-19\">Broker [Slammiri Canz] agrees to supply to Recycler [Griffin Industries] and Recycler agrees to accept a minimum quantity of surplus food by-products (hereinafter called \u201cBy-Products\u201d) minimum quantity to be negotiated on an as needed bases [sic],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-20\">App. at 37. The Agreement had an integration clause and specifically stated that it would be \u201cgoverned by the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\u201d App. at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-21\">The parties began performing under the Agreement on or about April 1, 2000. Slammiri Canz delivered an average of 150 to 170 tons of bakery waste per week to Griffin for a period of about seven weeks. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>At that point, Slammin\u2019 Canz completely stopped delivering bakery waste to Griffin. Griffin then filed the instant suit against Slammin\u2019 Canz in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleging breach of contract and seeking approximately two million dollars in consequential damages for lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">At the close of testimony, Slammin\u2019 Canz moved for judgment as a matter of law. The District Court decided that it would reserve on the Motion in favor of submitting two specific interrogatories to the jury. The District Court apparently felt that the answers to these interrogatories might be dispositive and thus obviate the need to rule on the Motion. The first interrogatory asked whether Slammin\u2019 Canz was \u201cjustified in terminating the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> App. at 192. The second interrogatory asked whether there was an agreement between the parties \u201cas to the minimum quantity [of bakery waste] that [Slammin\u2019 Canz] was required to supply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After the jury received these two interrogatories, the District Court permitted both parties to conduct closing arguments specifically addressing the two questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The jury returned an answer of \u201cno\u201d to both questions. The District Court then proceeded to make an oral \u201calternative ruling\u201d in favor of Slammin\u2019 Canz on the Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law. App. at 216. The District Court explained that: (1) the written Agreement was \u201cillusory;\u201d (2) there was no clear agreement on a minimum quantity term; (3) there was no evidence of recoverable damages; and (4) any evidence of \u201coral agreements or understanding\u201d outside the written terms of the Agreement should not have been allowed into evidence because they were barred by the integration clause. App. at 217-18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court concluded that \u201capart from the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d judgment as a matter of law should be granted to Slam-min\u2019 Canz. App. at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">On September 18, 2001, the District Court entered an order \u201cin accordance with the jury verdict\u201d granting judgment in favor of Slammin\u2019 Canz. App. at 5. Counsel for Griffin then requested that the docket be changed to reflect that judgment in favor of Slammin\u2019 Canz was not based on the jury verdict, but rather on the District Court\u2019s decision regarding Slam-min Canz\u2019 Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law. <em>Id. </em>The District Court responded by entering a second order on September 27, 2001. The Memorandum accompanying that order stated that judgment in favor of Slammin\u2019 Canz was entered based on the jury\u2019s verdict, but that, \u201cas to any liability issues not fully resolved by the jury\u2019s answers, [the judgment is] also a result of my grant of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment [as a matter of law.]\u201d App. at 6. The District Court reiterated the reasons for granting judgment as a matter of law that were placed orally on the record after the jury returned its answers to the interrogatories. Griffin appeals both orders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this matter based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Griffin argues that the District Court erred by: (1) not holding a charge conference where the Court would have been informed that the commercial law of Kentucky controls the Agreement; (2) not charging the jury on Kentucky commercial law; (3) not submitting the \u201centire case\u201d to the jury (as opposed to using two limited interrogatories); and (4) alternatively granting judgment as a matter of law. On this last point, Griffin argues that there was sufficient proof of recoverable consequential damages in the form of lost profits. Additionally, Griffin contends that the Agreement\u2019s integration clause, under Kentucky law, did not bar the evidentiary presentation of alleged oral understandings or of \u201ccourse of performance\u201d to establish a contractual quantity term.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">We review an assertion of improper jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>See Tormenia v. First Investors Realty Co., Inc., </em>251 F.3d 128, 136 (3d Cir.2000). Our review of a grant of judgment as a matter of law is plenary. <em>Northview Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>227 F.3d 78, 88 (3d Cir.2000). We conclude that the jury received an inadequate charge. Pursuant to the written Agreement, the law of Kentucky (as embodied in its commercial code) controls this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Had the jury been fully instructed on Kentucky commercial law, it would not have rendered an inconsistent verdict as it did in this matter. The jury found that the parties had not reached an agreement on minimum quantity, a finding that implies that there was no enforceable contract, yet the jury also found that Slammin Canz\u2019 was <em>not justified </em>in halting performance. The answers to the two interrogatories simply cannot be reconciled with fundamental principles of Contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">In addition, we agree with Griffin\u2019s assertion that judgment as a matter of law was improperly granted in favor of Slam-min\u2019 Canz. Griffin adduced sufficient evidence under the Uniform Commercial Code as applied in Kentucky to submit the damages question to the jury for consideration. Accordingly, the District Court erred in holding that Griffin\u2019s alleged lost profits were not recoverable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the two orders appealed from and remand the matter to the District Court for a new trial on both liability and damages. On remand the District Court should charge the jury pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code in force in Kentucky, after first conducting an appropriate charge conference pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">. Slammin Canz' contended at trial that it was justified in stopping performance because Griffin had caused unreasonable delays in unloading Slammin\u2019 Canz\u2019 trucks and had unreasonably interpreted the pricing schedule attached to the written Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-14\">. At trial, there was conflicting testimony on what oral understanding, if any, the parties came to with regard to the amount of bakery waste to be delivered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b179-15\">. The case was submitted to us on Griffin\u2019s brief only. Slammin\u2019 Canz has not filed an answering brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\">. <em>See A &amp; A Mech., Inc. v. Thermal Equip. Sales, Inc., </em>998 S.W.2d 505, 509 (Ky.Ct.App.1999) (Kentucky has adopted the Uniform Commercial Code). Apparently, Griffin's Pre-Trial Memorandum pointed to the relevant sections of Kentucky commercial law as the controlling doctrine of this dispute. Plaintiff\u2019s brief at 17 n. 2. We note that there is no citation to the record in Griffin\u2019s brief that supports this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
