Hackendahl was found guilty, by reason of insanity, of assaulting a federal police officer, after which he was committed to the custody of the Attorney General. The district court later conditionally discharged him, but revoked the discharge following a hearing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4243(g). Hackendahl appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">Under section 4243(g), a district court may revoke a person\u2019s conditional discharge after a hearing if, \u201cin light of his failure to comply with the prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment, his continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another.\u201d Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude the district court\u2019s finding that revocation was warranted is not clearly erroneous. The district court was presented with evidence Hackendahl had been manipulative about taking his prescribed medication; he had refused to participate in the residential facility\u2019s programs; and he had threatened to kill himself, hurt others, and \u201cstop\u201d people from using the Lord\u2019s name in vain.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-20\">We thus affirm the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
