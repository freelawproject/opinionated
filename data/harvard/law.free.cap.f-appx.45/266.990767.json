McClelland was convicted by a magistrate judge of a traffic offense. He filed an appeal with the federal district court. On February 25, 2002, the district court dismissed McClelland\u2019s appeal. McClelland now seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because McClel-land\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Parties are accorded ten days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 197 (4th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Schuchardt, </em>685 F.2d 901, 902 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on February 25, 2002. McClelland\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on April 24, 2002. Because McClelland failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension, we .dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
