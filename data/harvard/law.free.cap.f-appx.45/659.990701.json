Oliver of possession of a firearm by a felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and possession of methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). Oliver appeals only the felon in possession charge. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not recount them in detail except as necessary. Oliver argues that the district court erred by receiving in evidence the opinion testimony of Mendocino County Sheriff Sergeant Bruce Smith. The testimony in issue consisted of Smith\u2019s opinion that various items found in Oliver\u2019s car were consistent with \u201cpoaching\u201d \u2014 an illegal, two-person form of hunting. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hankey, </em>203 F.3d 1160, 1166 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cEvidentiary rulings will be reversed for abuse of discretion only if such nonconstitutional error more likely than not affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">Oliver\u2019s arguments concerning the Smith testimony boil down to two: First, Oliver contends that Smith was not qualified to express an opinion about the combined significance of the various items found in Oliver\u2019s truck. Under Fed.R.Evid. 702, Smith was shown to have the requisite knowledge, training and experience as an investigator of fish and game violations to qualify him to express an opinion on the matters about which he was asked, and thus any error was not reversible. <em>See United States v. Mendoza, </em>244 F.3d 1037, 1046 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Figueroa-Lopez, </em>125 F.3d 1241, 1247 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Secondly, Oliver argues that Smith\u2019s testimony about poaching was irrelevant for two reasons. He contends that under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b), the poaching testimony was inadmissible evidence of \u201cother crimes.\u201d We reject this argument because the testimony was received, not to prove that Oliver acted in conformity with a bad character trait, but to show how and when Oliver possessed the firearm. Such evidence was admissible because it was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the evidence of possession. <em>See United States v. Carrasco, </em>257 F.3d 1045, 1049 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">He also argues that the testimony was irrelevant as lacking in probative value. That is, Smith\u2019s poaching testimony was immaterial and irrelevant because it required too many leaps of logic in order to infer that Oliver had possessed the rifle and ammunition earlier in the evening. It is true that Oliver was not charged with poaching, and that the government did not need to prove that Oliver intended to use the firearm for illegal purposes. It is also true that Smith\u2019s testimony did not prove that it was any more likely that Oliver held the gun than that his companion did. However, Smith\u2019s expert testimony did not have to prove the entire case. Evidence is sufficiently probative if it supplies even a small piece of the puzzle. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 401 (Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact ... more or less likely that it would be without the evidence.\u201d). Smith\u2019s testimony tended to prove that it was more likely than not that Oliver and his companion were poaching. That\u2019s one piece. Oliver\u2019s proximity to the ammunition found in the truck, and the statement he made about his fingerprints being found on the rifle, are the additional pieces of the puzzle. Pieced together, the evidence was probative of an inference that Oliver was in possession of the rifle, not merely holding a flashlight for someone else, or innocently giving someone a ride. Accordingly, Smith\u2019s opinion testimony served to \u201cassist the trier of fact\u201d as required by Fed. R.Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b708-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
