GreaL-West Life argues that its action to enforce the reimbursement provision of the Plan is one for \u201cequitable relief\u2019 because it seeks equitable restitution or a constructive trust. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-19\">In this suit, Great-West is seeking to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money which is a classic action at law and not an equitable claim. <em>See Westaff Inc. v. Arce, </em>298 F.3d 1164 (9th Cir.2002) (holding \u00a7 1132(a)(3) did not authorize an action brought by a plan administrator to enforce a reimbursement provision of an ERISA plan because the substance of the remedy sought was not equitable). The fact the funds sought by Great-West have been placed in a trust account and are specifically identifiable does not transform its action into one for equitable relief. <em>See Arce, </em>at 1166 (concluding a reimbursement action remained an action for money damages where the funds sought had been placed in an escrow account and remained specifically identifiable).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-20\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Great-West Life\u2019s Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for reconsideration of summary judgment. <em>See 389 Orange Street Partners v. Arnold, </em>179 F.3d 656, 661 (9th Cir.1999). Great-West Life\u2019s argument that the Plan administrator\u2019s discretionary interpretation of the reimbursement provision disclaimed the \u201cmake whole\u201d rule was raised for the first time in the motion for reconsideration. <em>See id. </em>at 665 (abuse of discretion review precludes reversing the district court for declining to address an issue raised for the first time in a motion for reconsideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-16\">.
