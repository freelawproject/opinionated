The permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 apply. <em>See Castro-Espinosa v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1130, 1131 n. 1 (9th Cir.2001). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">On September 30, 1999, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found Hernandez removable and denied his applications for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure. On appeal to the BIA, Hernandez was represented by counsel. On March 16, 2000, the BIA dismissed Hernandez\u2019s appeal, but did not notify counsel of its decision. On March 21, 2000, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) removed Hernandez from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">On April 25, 2001, counsel first learned of the BIA\u2019s dismissal and filed a motion for reconsideration on May 25, 2001. The BIA denied that motion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(d) on July 11, 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">Respondent John Ashcroft (\u201cRespondent\u201d) asserts that the lack of communication between Hernandez and his attorney after deportation, moots this appeal. We disagree. In <em>United States v. Valdez-Gonzalez, </em>957 F.2d 643, 646-47 (9th Cir.1992), we considered whether an appeal of a sentencing departure was moot when the defendants had been deported and no one knew their whereabouts. <em>Id. </em>Relying on <em>United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, </em>462 U.S. 579, 581 n. 2, 103 S.Ct. 2573, 77 L.Ed.2d 22 (1983), we held that the appeal was not moot because the deportees faced collateral consequences from the deportation. These collateral consequences included the potential that the deportees \u201ccould face further proceedings in this case upon reentering the country,\u201d <em>Valdez-Gonzalez, </em>957 F.2d at 647, and that \u201cthe Government could bar any attempt by [the deportees] to voluntarily re-enter this country,\u201d <em>Villamonte-Marquez, </em>462 U.S. at 581 n. 2; <em>see also United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1211 n. 8 (9th Cir.2002) (listing numerous collateral consequences for an alien convicted of an aggravated felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">These same consequences sustain a case or controversy here. Hernandez\u2019s deportation may result in a bar to Hernandez\u2019s re-entry into the United States. Moreover, if he re-enters without authorization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>from the Attorney General, he may be subject to criminal prosecution for unlawful re-entry after deportation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Respondent also contends that the BIA lacked jurisdiction over the motion for reconsideration because Hernandez\u2019s counsel filed that motion subsequent to his client\u2019s removal from the United States. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Section \u00a7 3.2(d) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">A motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the United States. Any departure from the United States, including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings, occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">We have previously held that \u201cdeparture from the United States\u201d applies only to a legally executed departure. In <em>Mendez v. INS, </em>563 F.2d 956, 958 (9th Cir.1977), as here, the INS deported an immigrant without notifying his counsel, thereby depriving him of due process. At that time, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a deprived the courts of jurisdiction over a petition to review once the petitioner had departed from the United States. Section 1105a provided that \u201c[a]n order of deportation or of exclusion shall not be reviewed by any court if ... [the petitioner] has departed from the United States after the issuance of the order.\u201d <em>Mendez, </em>563 F.2d at 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">We held that \u00a7 1105a did not bar this court from exercising jurisdiction when the deportation resulted from a due process violation. We later applied the reasoning in <em>Mendez </em>to \u00a7 3.2(d). In <em>Wiedersperg v. INS, </em>896 F.2d 1179, 1181-82 (9th Cir.1990), we concluded that \u00a7 3.2(d)\u2019s bar to BIA review of a deportation order after the petitioner departed the United States applied only if the departure was legally executed. Holding that petitioner\u2019s departure was not legally executed, we reversed the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Here, the BIA failed to notify Hernandez\u2019s counsel of its decision upholding the IJ\u2019s removal order, thereby violating Hernandez\u2019s due process rights. Because Hernandez\u2019s due process rights were violated, his removal was not \u201clegally executed.\u201d Accordingly, the BIA erred in dismissing Hernandez\u2019s motion for reconsideration pursuant to \u00a7 3.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">We REVERSE the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Hernandez\u2019s motion for reconsideration and REMAND to the BIA for a determination on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">PETITION GRANTED; REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"A4i\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-11\">. The BIA mistakenly found that Hernandez was removed from the United States <em>after </em>the filing of the motion for reconsideration, thus resulting in withdrawal of the motion. <em>(See </em>Administrative Record at 2.) However, the record reflects that Hernandez was removed over one year <em>prior </em>to the filing of the motion for reconsideration. Section 3.2(d) provides for withdrawal of the motion only when petitioner is removed <em>after </em>the motion is filed. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s reliance on that part of \u00a7 3.2(d) was misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
