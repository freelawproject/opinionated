Castaneda\u2019s (\u201cCastaneda\u2019s\u201d) sentence following his guilty plea conviction for aiding and abetting in the manufacture of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Following remand, Castaneda appeals his amended sentence, contending that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1) by failing to make specific findings as to his eligibility for a minimal role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a) and as to his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-15\">The district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This court reviews the district court\u2019s compliance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 de novo. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>219 F.3d 863, 866 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-16\">The issue before us for decision is not the merits of a particular sentence but the propriety of the procedure followed by the district court in sentencing. We hold that the district court violated Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1) by not making explicit findings during the sentencing hearing as to Castaneda\u2019s eligibility for a minimal role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a) and as to his credibility after he had specifically raised both issues at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-17\">The basic facts have already been set forth by both parties in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-18\">During a sentencing hearing, a district court\u2019s duties are clearly set forth in Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-19\">At the sentencing hearing, the court must afford counsel for the defendant and for the Government an opportunity to comment on the probation officer\u2019s determinations and on other matters re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>lating to the appropriate sentence, and must rule on any unresolved objections to the presentence report .... For each matter controverted, the court must make either a finding on the allegation or a determination that no finding is necessary because the controverted matter will not be taken into account in, or will not affect, sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">\u201c[Wjhen the district court fail[s] to make the required Rule 32 findings or determinations at the time of sentencing, we must vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez-Angulo, </em>897 F.2d 1514, 1516 (9th Cir.1990) <em>(en banc). See also United States v. Karterman, </em>60 F.3d 576, 583 (9th Cir.1995) (noting that Rule 32 findings must be express and explicit).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The district court in this case failed to explicitly address the Probation Office\u2019s position that Castaneda was ineligible for a four-level minimal role adjustment because he was aware he was moving materials for the manufacturing of methamphetamine. Although Castaneda raised his objection to the Probation Office\u2019s position during his sentencing hearing, the district court found that he was eligible for a three-level adjustment only without specifying whether this decision was influenced by the Probation Office\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Likewise, during his sentencing hearing, Castaneda specifically controverted the government\u2019s claims that he was lying in various statements he gave law enforcement. Only after the sentencing hearing, in the district court\u2019s written Amended Findings of Fact, does the court explicitly state that it did not find Castaneda credible. This post-hearing clarification is insufficient to meet the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1). <em>See United States v. Standard, </em>207 F.3d 1136, 1142 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">We VACATE the defendant\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b640-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
