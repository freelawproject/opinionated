Witcher asserts the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to comply with Fed. R.Civ.P. 8. Although Witcher\u2019s amended complaint did not comply with the district court\u2019s instruction to allege his claims in one-sentence paragraphs, nor was the complaint a model of clarity, it was adequate to inform the Defendant of the nature of Witcher\u2019s claims and the factual basis for those claims. Such is all that is required under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8. <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 998, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal order and remand <em>for </em>further proceedings.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-27\"> We express no opinion about the merits of Witcher\u2019s claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
