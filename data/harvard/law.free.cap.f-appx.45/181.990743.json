Citing <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Matos contends the sentencing guidelines\u2019 career offender adjustment is inapplicable unless the elements of the adjustment were pleaded in the information and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-25\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b229-26\">After his arrest for robbing two federally insured banks in Pennsylvania, Matos pled guilty to two counts of bank robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a)). Matos faced a maximum prison sentence of twenty years on each count. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). The information did not cite the prior convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>tions. At sentencing, the District Court found that Matos was a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because (1) bank robbery constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) his criminal record included at least two prior convictions for crimes of violence; and (3) he was 18 or older at the time he committed the instant offense. As a \u201ccareer offender,\u201d Matos\u2019 offense level was set at 32 because under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) the maximum sentence for bank robbery is 20 years. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Matos\u2019 receipt of an acceptance of responsibility credit reduced his offense level to 29. The \u201ccareer offender\u201d guideline specified a criminal history category of VI, resulting in a guideline sentencing range of 151-188 months. After departing downward based on Matos\u2019 extraordinary post-offense rehabilitation, the District Court imposed a sentence of 120 months imprisonment on both counts, to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Matos contends his prior convictions and status as a career offender should have been charged in the information and proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury because they were used to increase his sentence range. But when a sentence is imposed below the statutory maximum, it is not constitutionally objectionable under <em>Apprendi. United States v. Williams, </em>235 F.3d 858, 863 (3d Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 49, 151 L.Ed.2d 19 (2001). As noted, Matos was sentenced to 120 months, well under the original statutory maximum of twenty years on each count (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a)). Therefore, Matos\u2019 \u201ccareer offender\u201d status did not result in a sentence beyond the statutory maximum. <em>Williams, </em>235 F.3d at 863; <em>see also United States v. Pressler, </em>256 F.3d 144, 159 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 503, 151 L.Ed.2d 413 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-5\">. \" \u00a7 4B1.1.
