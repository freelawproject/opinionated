(\u201cFetish <em>&amp; </em>Fantasy\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing its facial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>as-applied constitutional challenges to Nevada\u2019s statutory scheme authorizing courts to issue pre-judgment writs of attachment without either prior notice to the defendant or a pre-deprivation hearing. Fetish &amp; Fantasy brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against Ahern Rentals, Inc. (\u201cAhern\u201d) and the Eighth Judicial District Court, State of Nevada (\u201cState of Nevada\u201d), seeking a declaratory judgment that the Nevada statute violates due process and an injunction dissolving a Nevada state court\u2019s writ of attachment, pursuant to which money owed to Fetish &amp; Fantasy was seized, in an action initiated by Ahern. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343(a)(3), and we have jurisdiction over Fetish &amp; Fantasy\u2019s timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand with instructions to issue a stay under <em>R.R. Comm\u2019n v. Pullman Co., </em>312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of this case, we do not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Conducting <em>de novo </em>review, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that Fetish &amp; Fantasy lacks standing to bring facial constitutional challenges to subsections of Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31.017 other than \u00a7 31.017(5). <em>See S.D. Myers, Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>253 F.3d 461, 474 (9th Cir.2001) (reviewing a standing question <em>de novo). </em>Because Ahern sought and obtained the pre-judgment writ of attachment in state court solely under Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31.017(5), the district court properly held that Fetish &amp; Fantasy suffered no injury from, and thus does not have standing to challenge, any other subsection of \u00a7 31.017. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 563, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (the \u201cinjury in fact\u201d necessary for standing \u201crequires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">We <em>sua sponte </em>consider <em>Pullman </em>abstention for the first time on appeal, <em>see Columbia Basin Apartment Ass\u2019n v. City of Pasco, </em>268 F.3d 791, 802 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Bellotti v. Baird, </em>428 U.S. 132, 143 n. 10, 96 S.Ct. 2857, 49 L.Ed.2d 844 (1976), and conclude that <em>Carey v. Sugar, </em>425 U.S. 73, 96 S.Ct. 1208, 47 L.Ed.2d 587 (1976) (per curiam), a Supreme Court case that neither of the parties brought to the district court\u2019s or our attention, governs our resolution of Fetish &amp; Fantasy\u2019s remaining facial and as-applied constitutional challenges. In <em>Carey, </em>the Supreme Court applied <em>Pullman </em>abstention to a \u00a7 1983 suit contesting the constitutionality of New York\u2019s <em>ex parte, </em>pre-judgment attachment statute. <em>Carey, </em>425 U.S. at 77-79. Like Fetish <em>&amp; </em>Fantasy, the federal plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that the attachment statute violated due process because it provided an inadequate post-deprivation hearing and failed to require a showing of the plaintiffs likely success on the merits. <em>Id. </em>Finding the New York statute susceptible to a construction that allowed a hearing for preliminary inquiry into the merits of the plaintiffs claim, the Supreme Court held that <em>Pullman </em>abstention was warranted because a decision of the New York courts as a matter of state law could moot the federal constitutional issues. <em>Id. </em>at 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The case before us now is indistinguishable from <em>Carey. </em>Fetish &amp; Fantasy asks us to decide the constitutionality of Nevada\u2019s attachment statute without the benefit of an authoritative statutory construction by the Nevada Supreme Court. The Supreme Court observed in <em>Carey </em>that it was possible that the New York attachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>statute as ultimately construed by the New York courts would violate the United States Constitution, and that on the other hand the New York courts may construe the statute in a way that meets constitutional requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In this case, it is possible that the Nevada courts will construe the Nevada attachment statute, as Fetish &amp; Fantasy argues, to preclude a judicial determination of the probable merit of the plaintiffs claim, a judicial determination of the validity of the exigent circumstances of Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31.017(5) that justify attachment without prior notice or a pre-deprivation hearing, and an opportunity for a prompt and meaningful post-deprivation hearing. On the other hand, the Nevada courts may construe Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 31.020 and 31.022 to require the plaintiff to establish more than a subjective, good-faith belief that the defendant is liable, and more than a facially valid complaint. <em>See Connecticut v. Doehr, </em>501 U.S. 1, 13-14, 111 S.Ct. 2105, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991). Under \u00a7 31.020, the plaintiffs application for an <em>ex parte, </em>prejudgment writ of attachment must set forth the validity of the claim for relief and the facts showing the existence of the exigent circumstances of \u00a7 31.017(5) that permit the attachment. Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31.020(l)(a) <em>&amp; </em>(c). Under \u00a7 31.022, the state court can receive evidence to determine whether the plaintiffs application adequately sets forth the validity of the claim and whether the exigent circumstances alleged exist. Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31.022. The Nevada courts may interpret these statutory provisions to mandate the judicial findings that Fetish &amp; Fantasy seeks, findings based upon the plaintiffs documentary proof regarding the likelihood of the plaintiffs success on the merits and the existence of the exigent circumstances of \u00a7 31.017(5) that warrant attachment without notice to the defendant. The Nevada courts may also construe Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31.200 to provide the prompt and meaningful post-deprivation hearing that Fetish <em>&amp; </em>Fantasy wants. We note in this regard that the State of Nevada argues that its attachment statute is susceptible to a constitutional interpretation; \u201c[t]he interpretation placed on the statute by [the officials charged with its enforcement] is of some importance and merits attention.\u201d <em>Bellotti, </em>428 U.S. at 143.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Fetish &amp; Fantasy\u2019s remaining facial and as-applied constitutional challenges to Nevada\u2019s attachment statute thus turn on uncertain issues of state law. \u201cUncertainty for purposes of <em>Pullman </em>abstention means that a federal court cannot predict with any confidence how the state\u2019s highest court would decide an issue of state law.... Resolution of an issue of state law might be uncertain because ... the question is novel and of sufficient importance that it ought to be addressed first by a state court.\u201d <em>Pearl Inv. Co. v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>774 F.2d 1460, 1465 (9th Cir.1985) (internal citation omitted). The resolution of these state law questions \u201c \u2018might avoid in whole or in part the necessity for federal constitutional adjudication, or at least materially change the nature of the problem.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bellotti, </em>428 U.S. at 147 <em>(quoting Harrison v. NAACP, </em>360 U.S. 167, 177, 79 S.Ct. 1025, 3 L.Ed.2d 1152 (1959)). The pending state-court action between Fetish &amp; Fantasy and Ahern provides an opportunity for the Nevada courts to construe the attachment statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>in a way that might alleviate Fetish &amp; Fantasy\u2019s concerns about the statute\u2019s constitutionality. \u201cThat a pending state court litigation ... might resolve the issues presented weighs in favor of abstention.\u201d <em>Al-modovar v. Reiner, </em>832 F.2d 1138, 1140 (9th Cir.1987). Under these circumstances, we conclude that it would be unwise for us to address the constitutionality of Nevada\u2019s attachment statute, \u201cthe continued utilization of which is undoubtedly of importance to that State.\u201d <em>Carey, </em>425 U.S. at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">We reject Fetish &amp; Fantasy\u2019s argument that abstention is inappropriate because the Supreme Court did not abstain in <em>Doehr, </em>but proceeded to decide the constitutionality of Connecticut\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>attachment procedure. <em>See Doehr, </em>501 U.S. at 18. Although <em>Doehr </em>followed <em>Carey, Doehr </em>in no way overruled <em>Carey. </em>Because <em>Pullman </em>abstention does not implicate federal courts\u2019 subject matter jurisdiction, federal courts are never required to apply the doctrine. <em>Columbia Basin, </em>268 F.3d at 802. Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s failure to invoke <em>Pullman </em>abstention in <em>Doehr </em>is of no significance to the doctrine\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal, for lack of standing, of Fetish &amp; Fantasy\u2019s facial constitutional challenges to subsections of Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31.017 other than \u00a7 31.017(5). We reverse the court\u2019s dismissal of Fetish &amp; Fantasy\u2019s remaining facial and as-applied constitutional challenges,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and remand with instructions to enter a stay under <em>Pullman </em>and abstain from deciding the federal constitutional issues until the parties have had an opportunity to obtain a construction of the Nevada attachment statute from the Nevada state courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Carey, </em>425 U.S. at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.

We emphasize, however, that we consider here only whether it is possible for the Nevada courts to construe Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 31.017(5) and the other sections of the Nevada attachment statute in a way that meets constitutional requirements. We express no opinion on whether the subsections of \u00a7 31.017 that Fetish &amp; Fantasy lacks standing to challenge are susceptible to a constitutional interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b636-6\">. <em>See San Remo Hotel v. City &amp; County of San Francisco, </em>145 F.3d 1095, 1105 n. 6 (9th Cir.1998) (\"a holding that the district court should have abstained under <em>Pullman </em>is deemed a reversal of a dismissal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\">. Fetish &amp; Fantasy is also free, of course, to let the state courts determine all of the issues in this case. The choice belongs to Fetish &amp; Fantasy: if it wishes to preserve the federal constitutional issues (should they remain) for federal-court determination, it should simply reserve the relevant federal issues in the state-court proceedings. <em>See England v. Louisiana State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, </em>375 U.S. 411, 421, 84 S.Ct. 461, 11 L.Ed.2d 440 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
