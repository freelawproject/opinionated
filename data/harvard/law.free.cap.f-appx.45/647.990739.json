The district court did not err when it denied defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the indictment. The drug statutes at issue do not offend the constitutional principles set forth in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because those statutes do not prohibit the jury from determining drug type and quantity. <em>See United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173, 1180-83 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109-10 (9th Cir.2002). Neither does <em>Apprendi </em>require that the indictment allege or the government prove that the defendants knew the type and amount of the controlled substance they imported or possessed. <em>See United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir.2002). Additionally, the indictment need not allege aiding and abetting. Aiding and abetting is not an essential element of the charged offense, \u201cbut rather describes the kinds of individuals who can be held responsible for a crime .... \u201d <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>909 F.2d 1238, 1243 (9th Cir.1990) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). For that reason, \u201c[ajiding and abetting is implied in every federal indictment for a substantive offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1241 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">2. The district court did not err when instructing the jury. Since knowledge of drug type and quantity are not elements of the charged offense, the district court properly instructed the jury that defendants need only know that the substance was some kind of prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>drag. <em>See Carranza, </em>289 F.3d at 644. Additionally, all prerequisites for aiding and abetting, including knowledge and intent, were adequately stated in the jury instructions. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>72 F.3d 1370, 1385 (9th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Burgess, </em>791 F.2d 676, 679-80 (9th Cir.1986) (approving an instruction similar to the one given by the district court in this case). The jury was only required to find that the defendants acted with the specific intent to facilitate the crime, which at least equaled the mental state required for conviction of the underlying offense. <em>See United States v. Sayetsitty, </em>107 F.3d 1405, 1412 (9th Cir.1997). <em>Sayetsitty </em>and the line of cases of which it is a part distinguish the \u201cintent to facilitate the commission of a crime\u201d from \u201cthe requisite intent of the underlying substantive offense\u201d merely to clarify that aiding and abetting requires specific intent even if the underlying crime is a general intent crime. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Gaskins, </em>849 F.2d 454, 459 (9th Cir.1988); <em>United States v. McDaniel, </em>545 F.2d 642, 644 (9th Cir.1976) (indicating that to be an aider and abetter, defendant must know that the activity condemned by the law is actually occurring and must intend to help the perpetrator).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">3. The district court did not err in denying defendants\u2019 requests to sever their trial. <em>See Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 208-09, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987). The district court properly precluded Gomez from raising the issue that he entered Mexico in a car other than the Mercury Tracer in which he was riding when crossing the border with Real. Such a tactic would have been misleading to the jury and was only available because Gomez\u2019 statement was redacted to protect Real. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403 (\u201cevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of ... misleading the jury\u201d); <em>Herring v. New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 862, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593 (1975) (indicating that a trial court may limit closing arguments that \u201cimpede the fair and orderly conduct of the trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">4. The district court erred in disallowing Gomez\u2019 argument that the marijuana was in the Mercury Tracer when it was purchased. This argument was not misleading and was fairly raised by the evidence. <em>See Conde v. Henry, </em>198 F.3d 734, 739 (9th Cir.1999). The error, however, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (indicating that constitutional error may be disregarded if, under the totality of the circumstances, the reviewing court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict). The jury rejected Gomez\u2019 argument that he did not know about the marijuana and therefore would have rejected Gomez\u2019 more wildly improbable argument that he did not know about the marijuana because the car was unknowingly purchased complete with a large stash of valuable drags hidden in the bumper and side panel. <em>See United States v. Sawyer, </em>443 F.2d 712, 713-14 (D.C.Cir.1971) (affirming conviction despite trial court\u2019s error in excluding closing argument, because trial court permitted a comparable argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b697-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
