To the contrary, the circumstances suggest that the judge ultimately determined there was not reasonable cause to believe Fields was not mentally competent to stand trial. The judge therefore made no findings that triggered \u00a7 4241(a)\u2019s competency hearing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">We reject Fields\u2019 argument that a \u00a7 4241(a) hearing was required simply because the district judge did, in fact, entertain serious doubts about Fields\u2019 competency. The test we apply is \u201cwhether a reasonable judge ... should have experienced doubt with respect to competency to stand trial,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> not whether the trial judge actually did express serious doubts at some point in the proceedings. Accordingly, the trial judge\u2019s view of the defendant\u2019s competency is not controlling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, it is but one of several factors to be considered,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> each of which is individually nondet-erminative.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the fact that the district judge entertained serious doubts about Fields\u2019 competency did not require the court to hold a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">We further note that the district judge\u2019s reasons for doubting Fields\u2019 competency were insufficient to require a competency hearing. The record demonstrates that the judge\u2019s doubts were rooted in Fields\u2019 general lack of legal knowledge and in the bizarre nature of his legal arguments. Neither of these considerations required a competency hearing. The inability to mount a legally adequate \u2014 or even comprehensible \u2014 defense is not a \u201cmental disease or defect.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the fact that Fields\u2019 jurisdictional arguments were \u201cextraordinarily bizarre\u201d and \u201cundeniably weird\u201d was insufficient to trigger the hearing requirement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>II. <em>Other Evidence That Fields Was Not Competent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">We reject Fields\u2019 argument that his persistence in clinging to his jurisdictional legal theories demonstrated a mental illness or lack of competency. It is true that Fields submitted additional filings predicated on his jurisdictional theories, even after the district court rejected them in denying his motion to dismiss. However, Fields did not seek hearings on any of the additional filings, and he did not attempt to re-argue his jurisdictional theories in any presentencing hearing, even though he had several opportunities. While Fields did resurrect his jurisdictional theories at the sentencing hearing, he did so in the context of his statement of allocution, which was his right,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as he obviously recognized. In light of Fields\u2019 evident concern with making an adequate record, and abundant affirmative evidence of Fields\u2019 competency \u2014 which we discuss below \u2014 the foregoing facts do not suggest an irrational persistence in re-arguing discredited legal theories so much as a strongly held conviction that he had the law right and a determination to preserve the relevant issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">We also reject Fields\u2019 contention that his insistence on proceeding <em>pro se </em>was motivated by an irrational desire to be in complete control of all aspects of his defense. The <em>Faretta </em>hearing transcript shows that Fields gave the court a reasoned explanation for his desire to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Fields\u2019 decision might be characterized as inadvisable, but it was not irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">III. <em>Evidence That Fields </em>Was <em>Competent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">Fields cites no other evidence tending to show that he was not competent. In addition, outside of Fields\u2019 bizarre jurisdictional arguments and the judge\u2019s comments, we can find nothing in the record that even hints at a competency problem. However, there is considerable evidence that Fields was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">No one involved in the proceedings, other than one of the two judges, voiced any doubts about Fields\u2019 competency. Fields\u2019 appointed counsel \u2014 the person \u201cin the best position to evaluate [Fields\u2019] compe-tenc[y]\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 told the <em>Faretta </em>hearing judge that Fields was competent. The judge \u2014 \u2022 who had just engaged in a lengthy colloquy with Fields \u2014 accepted this appraisal without expressing any doubts. The <em>Faretta </em>hearing prosecutor voiced no doubts regarding Fields\u2019 competency, even though the court had raised the issue and sought the prosecutor\u2019s viewpoint. The prosecutor during the post-Fareiia hearing proceedings affirmatively stated that he thought Fields was competent. Finally, Fields\u2019 probation officer, who had met with him at least thirty times, told the court that she did not feel that a mental examination would be worthwhile.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">In addition, the record reflects that Fields well understood the nature and object of the proceedings, including the possibility of a long jail term,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that he was \u201cresponsive and rational\u201d during the various hearings,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> demonstrated \u201ccomplex reasoning ability\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in colloquies with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>court, \u201cexpressed himself boldly and effectively when he chose to do so\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and \u201crationally eonsult[ed]\u201d with his advisory counsel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Fields was also reasonably polite and respectful in court, speaking in turn, listening to the court and opposing counsel, and engaging in no outbursts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, it is undisputed that Fields had no history of mental illness.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">In sum, Fields\u2019 arguments that there was reasonable cause to hold a competency hearing are unpersuasive. In addition, the record contains considerable evidence that Fields was competent to stand trial. We conclude that the district court did not err in failing to hold a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Finally, while Fields\u2019 opening brief stated that one of the issues raised in this case was whether a defendant whom the district court \u201cbelieves\u201d is incompetent should be permitted to represent himself, Fields made no supporting argument that the court \u201cbelieved\u201d that Fields was incompetent. Fields thus waived the issue.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In any event, while the district court entertained some serious doubts about Fields\u2019 competency, nothing in the record can fairly be read as demonstrating that the court at any point affirmatively believed Fields was incompetent. Accordingly, this appeal does not raise the question of whether a court should allow a defendant that it believes to be incompetent to defend himself or herself, precluding us from addressing it.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b787-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-13\">.
