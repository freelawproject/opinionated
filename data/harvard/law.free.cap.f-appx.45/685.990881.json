Tezak appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habe-as corpus petition challenging the Bureau of Prison\u2019s denial of his request for credit for completing the drug rehabilitation program provided for in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-21\">The critical question in this case is whether Tezak had a \u201csettled expectation of legitimate eligibility for early release under \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B).\u201d <em>Furguiel v. Be-nov, </em>155 F.3d 1046, 1049 (9th Cir.1998). Tezak claims that he relied on the language of \u00a7 3621(e) as well as the oral advice of the prison\u2019s drug abuse program coordinator, before he entered the treatment program, that he would be eligible for a sentence reduction for participating in it. However, as the district court correctly observed, there is no evidence of this notification in the record. Indeed, the record evidence is to the contrary. The government tendered uncontested evidence that the prison\u2019s drug treatment specialist had determined specifically that Tezak was not eligible, and that the prison\u2019s drug abuse program coordinator so advised Tezak. Thus, Tezak\u2019s circumstance is the same as the petitioner in <em>Furguiel, </em>and he is not entitled to relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-22\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s conclusion that Tezak had no legally settled expectations concerning his eligibility for early release, we need not reach the question of whether the Bureau of Prison\u2019s actions violated the Ex Post Facto clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-23\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b733-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
