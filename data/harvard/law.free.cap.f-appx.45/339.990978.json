The defendants, Elton Carter, Antonio Smith, and James Stone argue that their Fourth Amendment rights were violated in the search of the van and the hotel room, that their Fifth Amendment right to remain silent was violated at interrogation and at trial, that their Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury was violated when the jury did not decide the amount of drugs involved for each count of the indictment, and that the district court erred by making the entire drug quantity attributable to each defendant at sentencing. Defendants now appeal from their respective convictions and sentences under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-18\">This appeal presents six issues for our review: (1) whether the district court properly admitted evidence under the Fourth Amendment from the officers\u2019 stop and search of Stone and Smith\u2019s van; (2) whether the district court properly determined under the Fourth Amendment that defendants had consented to the officers\u2019 search of the hotel room; (3) whether the district court properly determined that the evidence was sufficient to support Carter\u2019s and Smith\u2019s drug convictions; (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>whether the district court properly determined under the Fifth Amendment that the prosecutor did not improperly comment on Carter\u2019s, Smith\u2019s, and Stone\u2019s decision to remain silent; (5) whether the district court properly sentenced Carter, Smith, and Stone in accord with the mandate of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), where the jury was not permitted to decide the amount of drugs named in each count of the indictment; and 6) whether the district court properly found that Carter and Smith were responsible for more than sixty grams of cocaine base. We find no error with respect to these claims, and AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6i\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Just after 1 a.m. on October 11, 1999, Sergeant Greg Jennings and Detective Jack Dawson observed a blue Chevrolet van with Michigan license plates pass at a rapid speed and stop abruptly at the stoplight at the intersection of Russell Cave Road and New Circle Road in Lexington, Kentucky. The two Lexington-Fayette Urban County police officers were in an unmarked police truck and followed the van on New Circle Road. The officers later testified that the van was exceeding the speed limit by ten miles per hour as it traveled west on New Circle Road. The van then turned left onto Georgetown Road, made a U-turn by pulling into a side parking lot, and continued in the opposite direction on Georgetown Road past the two officers. The van then turned left on Roosevelt Avenue, a cul-de-sac in what is described as a low-income neighborhood. The two officers did not follow the van into the cul-de-sac, but instead waited in a parking lot for the van to re-emerge. From their position, the officers could not see anyone exit the van during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Approximately five to ten minutes later, the van re-emerged from the cul-de-sac and turned right onto Georgetown Road. At trial, the officers testified that the van crowded and crossed the yellow line in the center of the road, and was speeding \u201cat least ten miles per hour above the posted speed limit of thirty-five miles per hour.\u201d The officers followed the van to downtown Lexington, and then pulled it over at the intersection of Elm and Sixth Streets. Three people were inside the van: James Stone was driving, and Lia Hicks and Yolanda Parker were passengers. The officers testified that Stone smelled of alcohol, and administered three field sobriety tests. Stone passed two objective tests, but did not pass a subjectively-judged sobriety test. Stone then agreed to take a preliminary breath test, which showed a blood alcohol level of 0.090, below the drunk driving limit in Kentucky of 0.100. Sergeant Jennings then arrested Stone for reckless driving under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Pursuant to the arrest, the officers conducted a search of Stone\u2019s person. In the course of this search, the officers recovered a room key to a local Days Inn hotel. In addition, a narcotics-detection dog alerted to the scent of narcotics in the van, which precipitated a full search of the van. Inside the van, the officers discovered a compact containing cocaine residue and marijuana stems on the floor of the vehicle. The officers decided to tow the van, detain Hicks and Parker at the site of the traffic stop, and transport Stone to the jail. After Parker noted that the group was staying at the Days Inn with someone named \u201cE,\u201d the officers decided to investigate the room number indicated on the hotel key found on Stone.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The officers arrived at the Days Inn just after 2 a.m. Sergeant Jennings and Detec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>tive Dawson were informed by the desk clerk that room 264, the room indicated on the key obtained from Stone, was registered in the name of John Carter. Officer David Straub knocked on the door, identified himself as a police officer, and asked Raymond Williams \u2014 the man who answered the door \u2014 if he owned a blue Chevrolet van. Williams replied that he did not, but Antonio Smith \u2014 another occupant of the room \u2014 spoke up and stated that he was the owner of the van. Officer Straub then asked permission to enter the room; Williams \u201cprobably\u201d said yes, opened the door further, and stepped aside for the officers to enter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Straub latex-testified that neither Carter nor Smith objected when he entered the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Inside the room were Smith, Williams, and Elton Carter. After Officer Straub received permission, he, Jennings, Dawson, and Officer Brian Roberts entered the hotel room. Officer Dawson then asked Smith to follow him outside the room and answer some questions about the van. Meanwhile, the other officers questioned Carter and Williams. During the questioning, the officers claim they obsexwed in \u201cplain view\u201d digital scales, plastic baggies, a cigar blunt, and other drug paraphernalia. The officers also claim that they then advised each defendant of their <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In Carter\u2019s presence, Jennings suggested to Dawson that they should \u201cfreeze\u201d the scene and obtain a search warrant. Dawson disagreed, and Jennings instead asked Carter to sign a statement authorizing a search of the room, written on the back of a napkin. During the course of the ensuing search, the officers found sixty grams of cocaine base and $2,310 in cash. Carter, Williams, and Smith were immediately arrested, and Parker and Hicks were arrested when they returned from the scene of the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">At trial, the officers testified that they found cocaine base in multiple places during their search of the hotel room. They found cocaine base in the pockets of a jacket hanging in the closet, four baggies of cocaine base in a pillow on one bed, and two baggies of cocaine base under the mattress of the other bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">Carter, Smith, and Stone were indicted in a five-count indictment on January 6, 2000 by a federal grand jury in Lexington, Kentucky. Count one of the indictment charged conspiracy to distribute in excess of fifty grams of cocaine base. Count two charged that defendants knowingly and intentionally possessed with intent to distribute the sixty grams of cocaine base, and count three charged that defendants aided and abetted one another to intentionally possess\u2019 with the intent to distribute the cocaine base.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All three defendants entered pleas of not guilty. Before trial, the three defendants filed motions to suppress the evidence obtained from the van and the hotel room. The district court conducted a hearing, and found that as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>van, a traffic violation had occurred and the van had been properly stopped. Moreover, the district court found that the search was valid as an incident to Stone\u2019s arrest, and that the items found during the search of the van were lawfully discovered. The district court also concluded in a memorandum opinion that the evidence obtained from the hotel room should not be suppressed, because the government had sustained its burden of proving that Williams had apparent authority to consent to Straub\u2019s request to enter the room, and that both Williams\u2019s and Carter\u2019s consent was voluntarily given. As such, the district court concluded that the warrant-less search of the hotel room was consistent with the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">With neither the van nor hotel evidence suppressed, the case proceeded to trial on March 13, 2000. During trial, the prosecutor made several off-hand references to the defendants\u2019 decision to remain silent and not testify, and on one occasion was rebuked by the district judge for doing so. The jury reached guilty verdicts as follows: Carter was convicted on counts one and three; Stone was convicted on counts one, two, and three; and Smith was convicted on count three. The jury returned not guilty verdicts as follows: Carter was acquitted on count two, Smith was acquitted on counts one and two, and Williams <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was acquitted of all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended that all three defendants be sentenced based on the total amount of drugs that were found in the hotel room \u2014 sixty grams. The district court sentenced Carter to 240 concurrent months of imprisonment on counts one and three, Smith to 121 months of imprisonment on count three, and Stone to life imprisonment on counts one, two, and three.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The three defendants filed timely notices of appeal: Carter filed his appeal on June 23, 2000; Stone filed his appeal on June 27, 2000, and Smith filed his appeal on June 29, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">A. Whether the district court properly denied defendants\u2019 motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">1. Standard Op Review</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions on a motion to suppress, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Salgado, </em>250 F.3d 438, 455 (6th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Adu, </em>82 F.3d 119, 124 (6th Cir.1996). We consider the evidence in the light most likely to support the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>Salgado, </em>250 F.3d at 455 (citing <em>United States v. Williams, </em>962 F.2d 1218, 1221 (6th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">a. Whether the district court properly admitted evidence under the Fourth Amendment from the officers\u2019 stop and search of Stone and Smith\u2019s van.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">Smith and Stone argue that the stop of the van was pretextual and that the subsequent warrantless search of the vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Fourth Amendment provides that an officer\u2019s stop of a vehicle is reasonable where there is probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). This determination is fact-dependent and turns upon what the officer knew at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>stop. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>242 F.3d 707, 709 (6th Cir.2001). A lawful custodial arrest of a person once they have been pulled over justifies a contemporaneous warrantless search of the person arrested, as well as of the immediately surrounding area. <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 762-63, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). This immediately surrounding area includes the passenger compartment of an automobile. <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981). Probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of a stopped vehicle may also be established when a narcotics-detection dog alerts to the smell of drugs in a vehicle. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>195 F.3d 258, 273 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Here, the record reflects that Officers Jennings and Dawson observed Smith and Stone commit a multitude of traffic violations. Although the two defendants contend they were pulled over solely because they had out-of-state plates and were visiting a low-income neighborhood, Jennings and Dawson testified that a number of traffic violations were committed\u2014 speeding, a U-turn, erratic driving, and crossing the center line. These violations are a constitutionally permitted basis for a lawful stop under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Johnson, </em>242 F.3d at 709. Moreover, Stone was lawfully arrested for reckless driving under the applicable Kentucky statute. <em>See </em>KY. REV. STAT. \u00a7 189.290 (Michie 1997). Once the lawful arrest was made, the officer was justified in searching Stone and the contents of the van pursuant to the arrest. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. at 460. The dog\u2019s indication that drugs were present inside the van only provided a further factual basis for probable cause to conduct a warrantless search. <em>See Hill, </em>195 F.3d at 273. Smith and Stone fail to establish that the stop of the van was pretextual and that the subsequent warrantless search of the vehicle violates the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny defendants\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence from the search of Stone and the contents of the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">b. Whether the district court properly determined under the Fourth Amendment that defendants had consented to the officers\u2019 search of the hotel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The defendants argue that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their hotel room, that the initial search of and entry into the room were unlawful, and that Carter\u2019s subsequent consent was involuntary. The Fourth Amendment creates a subjective privacy expectation for an overnight guest. <em>Minnesota v. Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 95-96, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990). This privacy expectation extends to hotel rooms. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>106 F.3d 695, 698 (6th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 301, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966)). However, the prohibition against warrantless searches does not apply where voluntary consent to search is given. <em>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973); <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>594 F.2d 536, 539 (6th Cir.1979). Even when the owner of the premises does not himself give consent, a good faith belief by the police that the person giving consent has common authority over the premises is sufficient to allow the search. <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 186-89, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>979 F.2d 77, 79 (6th Cir.1992). This consent must be given prior to the time that a warrantless search begins. <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>913 F.2d 261, 265 (6th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>641 F.2d 425, 429 (6th Cir.1981). The burden of proof in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>showing that consent was given lies with the government. <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 248. The fruits of an illegal search, where consent was not given, should be suppressed. <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>904 F.2d 349, 356 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">While defendants did have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their hotel room, that expectation was relinquished when they consented to the officers\u2019 request to enter and later search the room. <em>See Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 219; <em>Reeves, </em>594 F.2d at 539. Williams ultimately admitted that he \u201cprobably\u201d had consented to Officer Straub\u2019s request to enter the room and talk with Smith, and Carter signed a statement of consent under no apparent coercion. The district court carefully considered whether consent was given, and found that it was \u201creasonable for the officers to conclude that Williams had authority to consent to their request to enter room # 264.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>979 F.2d 77. Moreover, it found that under the totality of the circumstances, Carter\u2019s written consent to the search of the hotel room and Williams\u2019s oral consent to enter the room were voluntarily given. <em>Id. </em>This finding of fact by the district court survives our clear error review, <em>see Bueno, </em>21 F.3d at 126, and allows the fruits of this search into evidence. <em>Buchanan, </em>904 F.2d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision not to suppress the evidence taken from the search of the hotel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">B. Whether the district court properly determined that the evidence was sufficient to support Carter\u2019s and Smith\u2019s drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">1. Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">A denial of a FED. R. CRIM. P. 29(c) motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Canan, </em>48 F.3d 954, 962 (6th Cir.1995). However, the decision of the district court must be affirmed if the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the government, \u201cwould allow a rational trier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>980 F.2d 388, 393 (6th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">Carter and Smith argue that there was insufficient evidence to support their convictions, and that the district court should have granted their Rule 29(c) motion for judgment of acquittal. In meeting the elements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 for possession with intent to distribute, and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance, circumstantial and direct evidence are accorded the same weight. <em>United States v. Blakeney, </em>942 F.2d 1001, 1010 (6th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">Carter and Smith reason that the evidence introduced at trial only demonstrated that they were associated with those who had broken the law. They claim that the United States failed to demonstrate any direct evidence that connected them to the drugs or money found in the hotel room. However, it is in the jury\u2019s discretion to infer that the defendant constructively possessed contraband found in his living quarters regardless of whether there was proof of actual possession. <em>Hill, </em>142 F.3d at 311-12. Here, no evidence shows that either Carter or Smith was in the room for a short period of time. Considerable drug paraphernalia was present in the hotel room \u2014 consistent with a professional operation. The drugs were packaged for distribution, the money present indicates that drug sales had already occurred, and the hotel records indicate that defendants had made numerous trips to Lexington. Taken together, this evidence is enough for the jury to infer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>that Carter and Smith were involved in the possession with intent to distribute drugs consistent for conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny defendants\u2019 Rule 29(c) motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">C. Whether the district court properly determined under the Fifth Amendment that the prosecutor did not improperly comment on Carter\u2019s, Smith\u2019s, and Stone\u2019s decision to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">1. Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The question of whether a prosecutor\u2019s conduct amounts to prosecutorial misconduct, and whether it rendered the trial fundamentally unfair, are mixed questions of law and fact that are reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Francis, </em>170 F.3d 546, 549 (6th Cir.1999). When there is no objection at trial, the alleged improper conduct is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>26 F.3d 1380, 1383 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Defendants argue that the prosecutor\u2019s decision to comment on their silence at arrest, their failure to present evidence, and their failure to testify in their own defense violates their rights against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. A defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights are violated when a prosecutor is permitted to use against him his choice to remain silent at trial. <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 613, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). Post-arrest silence also may not be used against a defendant at trial in order to imply guilt from that silence. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 611, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). Pre-arrest silence also may not be used as substantive evidence of guilt, and will be admitted at trial only for impeachment purposes. <em>See Combs v. Coyle, </em>205 F.3d 269, 281-83 (6th Cir.2000); <em>see also Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 628, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). As such, the use of an accused\u2019s pre-arrest silence is \u201cnot a legitimate governmental practice.\u201d <em>Combs, </em>205 F.3d at 285. However, a conviction will not be overturned without viewing the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the context of the entire trial. <em>United States v. Cobleigh, </em>75 F.3d 242, 247 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">The defendants cite the following examples of prosecutorial misconduct:</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">During Officer Straub\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-13\">Q. When the officers found the crack, was there any reaction from any of the individuals in the room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-14\">A. Not that I can recall. I really wasn\u2019t paying attention to their reactions. There wasn\u2019t any outcry of, you know, anybody disclaiming anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">During Detective Dawson\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-16\">Q. Okay. When the drugs were found, what was the response of any of the defendants? What was their reaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-17\">A. A little disheartened, that\u2019s how I would characterize it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-18\">Q. Why do you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-19\">A. It\u2019s not the reaction that I had expected from someone who didn\u2019t know anything about drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-20\">Nash: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-21\">Griffin: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-22\">Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-23\">Q. Now, did anyone, at that time, indicate that the drugs were not theirs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-24\">A. Everyone \u2014 At that particular time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-25\">Q. Yes, when they were found, right then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-26\">A. No, no one said anything.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Three other instances of alleged misconduct occurred during the prosecution\u2019s closing statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">I asked Detective Dawson, when you found the drugs, when you found them, what was the reaction of each of them? Was there any reaction? None. Common sense. Common sense. At that point, something is found that you have no knowledge about that is illegal. Common sense. Knowledge. Involvement and agreement: \u201cspoken or unspoken,\u201d as the instruction says. An agreement that they knew what was going on, and at that point, they were caught. It\u2019s all over, their faces when you saw them there, it\u2019s all over their actions, it\u2019s all over their conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Later during the closing statement, the prosecutor added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">... the unrefuted evidence of this case is that over 60 grams of crack cocaine is found in a hotel room in which these four defendants were staying; unrefut-ed, uncontroverted, undenied, it is where the evidence was found, it is where all the officers have testified that it was found under \u2014 in a pillow case on a bed where Mr. Williams was sitting, the same bed that Mr. Stone had been on, a bed that Mr. Smith was on, that he admitted to Mr. \u2014 to Detective Dawson that he had been on; a jacket that the evidence was that that was the jacket that Mr. Carter was wearing, he had been wearing FUBU pants, FUBU shoes and a FUBU jacket. That\u2019s the evidence that you\u2019ve heard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Finally, the prosecution stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">The search of that room clearly produced 60 grams of crack cocaine. Three individuals there; Mr. Stone, who\u2019s driving the van where crack is found; where Mr. Carter is using a fake I.D.; cell phone; scales; pager; all indicative of trafficking in drugs. That\u2019s unrefuted. There\u2019s no speculation there. The evidence, common sense dictates that these individuals were here trafficking in cocaine, and that\u2019s what they were \u2014 and that\u2019s what happened and had been doing, and they were caught. And that\u2019s why they hung their head, and that\u2019s why there was no surprise, and that\u2019s the simple truth of the matter. I ask you to return a verdict of guilty on all the charges. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The prosecution\u2019s constant references to the defendants\u2019 decision to remain silent are improper, and violate the defendants\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights under <em>Griffin, </em>380 U.S. at 613, <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 611, and <em>Combs, </em>205 F.3d at 281-283. However, the defendants failed to object to most of these statements, and thus have failed to preserve this claim for this court\u2019s review. In fact, it was the district court that suggested to the defendants that the prosecutor\u2019s statement about unrefuted evidence may be improper, and went so far as to offer to declare a mistrial over the prosecutor\u2019s conduct. The defendants indicated that they did not want a mistrial. The district court then issued a general cautionary instruction to the jury to consider only the evidence, and not the \u201clawyers\u2019 statements and arguments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Waiver is the \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right,\u201d and these rights are not reviewable. <em>See United States v. Aparco-Centeno, </em>280 F.3d 1084, 1088 (6th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-33, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). Like the defendant in <em>Aparco-Centeno, </em>the defendants here agreed with the district court\u2019s proposed course of conduct, and then later charged the court with error for that conduct. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Sloman, </em>909 F.2d 176, 182 (6th Cir.1990)). Furthermore, the defendants\u2019 counsel here dissuaded the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>from following the most curative remedy of all \u2014 declaring a mistrial- \u2014 and instead urged the district court to issue a curative instruction regarding the prosecution\u2019s comments. A decision whether or not to accept a mistrial falls firmly within the set of strategic decisions through which a counsel may bind her client, regardless of whether the client participates in that decision. <em>See Watkins v. Kassulke, </em>90 F.3d 138, 143 (6th Cir.1996); <em>see generally </em>3 W. Lafave <em>&amp; </em>J. Israel, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 11.6(a) n. 40 (1999). Because the decision of defendants\u2019 counsel to reject the offer for a mistrial is a legitimate strategic decision, their agreement with the district court\u2019s proposed course of conduct constitutes knowing waiver of this issue. <em>See Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">We therefore decline to review defendants\u2019 claims that the district court committed plain error by not declaring a mistrial following the prosecutor\u2019s decision to comment on the defendants\u2019 silence at arrest, their failure to present evidence, and their failure to testify in their own defense. The defendants\u2019 refusal of the court\u2019s offer to declare a mistrial constitutes waiver and thus bars any further relief. <em>See Fleming v. United States, </em>332 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">D. Whether the district court properly sentenced Carter, Smith, and Stone in accord with the mandate of <em>Apprendi </em>where the jury was not permitted to decide the amount of drugs named in each count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">1. Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Where a defendant raises a cognizable <em>Apprendi </em>challenge in the district court, we review the <em>Apprendi </em>issue <em>de novo </em>for harmless error. <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>287 F.3d 422, 442 (6th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Strayhorn, </em>250 F.3d 462, 467 (6th Cir.2001). Where a defendant fails to raise the issue in the district court, or abandons it on appeal, we review for plain error only. <em>Humphrey, </em>287 F.3d at 442 (citing <em>United States v. Graham, </em>275 F.3d 490, 521 (6th Cir.2001)). Under the plain error test of FED. R. CRIM. P. 52(b) for an error not raised at trial, an appellate court must find (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights before it is able to correct that error. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (citing <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997), and <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). If all three of these conditions are met, \u201c\u2018an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 467).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">The defendants argue that they were not sentenced in accord with the mandate of <em>Apprendi </em>because the drug quantity was not alleged nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt. It is well-established that any fact that serves to enhance the sentence of a defendant, aside from prior convictions, must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In federal prosecutions, such facts must also be charged in the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 476. However, the \u201csame cannot be said of a fact that increases the mandatory minimum (but not extending the sentence beyond the statutory maximum),\u201d since the jury\u2019s verdict authorized the judge to impose the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>minimum irrespective of any findings she may make. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2414, 153 L.Ed.2d 524, \u2014 (2002) (Kennedy, J., writing for the Court in a four member plurality opinion, the holding of which is supported by a separate concurrence by Breyer, J.). Within the penalty range set by a jury\u2019s verdict, it does not violate the Constitution to require defendants to serve minimum terms based upon a judge\u2019s factual findings. <em>Id. </em>at 2419. This is because even the minimum term is within the range authorized by the jury\u2019s factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">We find that Carter, Smith,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Stone fail to present a viable <em>Apprendi </em>argument that we may recognize under the plain error test of <em>Cotton. See </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 122 S.Ct. at 1785. In considering these claims, we first must analyze whether each defendant raised the <em>Apprendi </em>issue at the district court. None of the defendants objected to the failure to include drug quantity in the indictment for count three, nor made a contemporaneous objection to the jury instruction that allowed a finding of guilty \u2014 even for counts one and two of the indictment that did specify a drug quantity in excess of fifty grams \u2014 upon a finding of any \u201cmeasurable amount of cocaine base.\u201d Carter and Smith failed to challenge either the indictment, the standard of review, or the fact that the determination was made by the district judge rather than by the jury. Stone made no drug quantity objection at all. This does not constitute an adequate objection to preserve the <em>Apprendi </em>issue on appeal. <em>Humphrey, </em>287 F.3d at 444. We thus review the <em>Apprendi </em>violation for plain error. <em>Cotton</em>, \u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 122 S.Ct. at 1785.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">Next we look to whether an <em>Apprendi </em>violation occurred. Stone was convicted under counts one, two, and three, and was sentenced to life imprisonment under the third offender provision for each count. Carter was convicted under counts one and three, and was sentenced to 240 months based on his second offender status. Smith was convicted on count three only, and was sentenced to 121 months imprisonment. In the indictment for each count, only counts one and two named a drug quantity \u2014 \u201cin excess of fifty (50) grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base, that is, \u2018crack cocaine,\u2019 a Schedule II controlled substance.\u201d The indictment for count three contained no reference to drug quantity. The jury instructions specific to counts one and two made the same reference to \u201cin excess of fifty (50) grams\u201d of drug quantity, while the instructions specific to count three likewise omitted any reference to drug quantity. Following the three count-specific instructions, the district court also instructed the jury generally (Instruction No. 20) as to all three counts It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5E\">In the indictment, it is alleged that a particular amount or quantity of cocaine base (crack cocaine) was involved. The evidence in the case need not establish that the amount or quantity of cocaine base (crack cocaine) was as alleged in the indictment, but only that a measurable amount of cocaine base (crack cocaine) was in fact the subject of the acts charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">The jury verdict forms listed each count with a box to mark whether each defendant was guilty or not guilty, without any finding of drug quantity on the verdict form. Given this combination of jury instructions and verdict forms, we can only assume that the jury made a finding be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>yond a reasonable doubt for each count consistent with Instruction No. 20, allowing \u201cany measurable amount of cocaine base\u201d rather than the \u201cparticular amount or quantity of cocaine base\u201d as charged in the indictment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Stokes, </em>261 F.3d 496, 498-99 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">At sentencing, the district court raised an inference that it felt constrained to sentence the defendants within the higher statutory range of the mandatory minimum sentence required under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) rather than \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>See Strayhom, </em>250 F.3d at 470. The district court\u2019s drug quantity finding of sixty grams for each defendant increased Carter\u2019s sentence from a maximum term of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) to a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The district judge then sentenced Carter to the very bottom of the higher range, but within the maximum sentence of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). The same occurred for Smith \u2014 the district court\u2019s finding of sixty grams of drug quantity increased his sentence from a maximum of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. Smith was sentenced to 121 months of imprisonment, again right at the minimum allowed under the applicable sentencing range, but also within the maximum sentence allowable under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Stone\u2019s treatment is different, however. The finding of sixty grams of drug quantity increased his sentence from a maximum term of thirty years\u2019 imprisonment to a mandatory life sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Unlike the others, the district court\u2019s finding of drug quantity increased the maximum sentence to which Stone was exposed, and Stone was sentenced above the maximum sentence of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) pursuant to that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The district court also stated at sentencing that it felt constrained to sentence each defendant within the higher statutory range. <em>See Strayhorn, </em>250 F.3d at 470. For Carter, the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">All right. The Court has no discretion here. If the Court had discretion, the Court would sentence Mr. Carter to a substantially lesser sentence. But that is neither here nor there, because I don\u2019t have the authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">The Congress has told me that I must sentence Mr. Carter to 240 months on each count to be served concurrently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">So, pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, that will be the judgment of the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">For Smith, evidence of the district court\u2019s perception of constraint was more ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">Well, I think a sentence at the low end of the guideline range is more than adequate here in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">The district court showed no ambiguity whatsoever regarding the constraint it felt with respect to Stone\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">All right. I think oftentimes in this country we overreact to situations. I think the Congress has overreacted to the drug problems in this country. I can\u2019t imagine that it was the intent of Congress to sentence somebody like Mr. Stone, who is a minor player in the drug culture, to life imprisonment. I just can\u2019t imagine that that was the intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxdR\">But, nevertheless, that is the law, and that\u2019s what I have to do. And I hope that the Congress will change the law. I hope they change the law, and I hope it will apply to Mr. Carter \u2014 or to Mr. Stone. And that\u2019s not beyond the realm of possibility, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>But, \u2014 so I am going to state the sentence now \u2014 and reluctantly state the sentence \u2014 wish I didn\u2019t have to do it. So pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, it is the judgment of the Court that the defendant James A. Stone be committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for a term of life on Counts One, Two, and Three, to be served concurrently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The United States is correct with regard to Carter and Smith when it argues that the defendants\u2019 sentences were within the statutory maximum for each offense, which does not violate the express mandate of <em>Apprendi. See </em>530 U.S. 466 at 483 n. 10, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435. Even with no drug quantity specified, Carter would have been sentenced under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which provides for a statutory maximum sentence of thirty years. His sentence of twenty years does not exceed this thirty-year statutory maximum. A similar argument applies for Smith \u2014 his sentence of just over ten years\u2019 imprisonment falls within the statutory maximum for their respective offenses and career offender levels under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) where no drug quantity finding is required. The Supreme Court recently clarified its jurisprudence in this area, noting that as long as a fact increases the statutory minimum but does not extend the sentence beyond the statutory maximum, then neither <em>Apprendi </em>nor the Constitution has been violated. <em>Harris, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 122 S.Ct. at 2419. This is the exact situation before us \u2014 the finding of sixty grams of drug quantity by the district court raised the mandatory minimum for each defendant, and the district court sentenced each defendant right at the mandatory minimum of the higher penalty range.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fact that the district court felt constrained to sentence each defendant within the higher statutory range no longer implies an <em>Apprendi </em>violation under our case law. <em>Id. </em>Because the district court\u2019s factual finding of sixty grams of cocaine base did not extend the sentence of defendants Carter and Smith beyond the statutory maximum on the respective counts for which they were convicted, no <em>Apprendi </em>violation occurred. <em>Id. </em>With no <em>Apprendi </em>violation before us, Carter and Smith also fail to meet the first element of the plain error test, that an error occurred. <em>See Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 468; <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 733. Our plain error analysis ends here.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Stone\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment, however, does not implicate an increased mandatory minimum sentence, but rather an increased maximum sentence. Because of the district court\u2019s determination that sixty grams of cocaine base were involved, Stone was sentenced to life imprisonment under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), beyond the statutory maximum of thirty years in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>Apprendi </em>requires that any fact that enhances the sentence in this manner must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 483. Because Instruction No. 20 clearly informed the jury that they need not find the amount alleged in the indictment, \u201cbut that only a measurable amount of cocaine base (crack cocaine) was involved,\u201d the jury made no finding regarding drug quantity sufficient for the district court to sentence Stone beyond the thirty year maximum allowable for possessing \u201ca measurable amount of cocaine base\u201d under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, Stone\u2019s sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>tenee of life imprisonment violates <em>Ap-prendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Having concluded that an <em>Apprendi </em>violation occurred with regard to Stone\u2019s sentence, and because the claim was waived in the district court, we must review the claim for plain error. <em>Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 122 S.Ct. at 1785. Our recent decision in <em>United States v. Norman Lee Harris </em>interprets the plain error test in <em>Cotton </em>as to preclude Stone\u2019s claim. <em>See United States v. Norman Lee Harris, </em>293 F.3d 970, 974 (6th Cir.2002). Where the defendant fails to raise the <em>Apprendi </em>objection at trial, and where the drug amount used was in fact clearly shown, then enhancement of the sentence by the trial judge based on the amount of drugs does not seriously affect the fairness of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>As such, Stone fails to meet the final prong of the plain error test of Rule 52(b) \u2014 that the plain error affecting substantial rights must also \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 122 S.Ct. at 1786.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence for Carter, Smith, and Stone as in accord with the mandate of <em>Apprendi </em>and the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">E. Whether the district court properly found that Carter and Smith were responsible for more than sixty grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">1. Standard Of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs involved in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Walton, </em>908 F.2d 1289, 1300-1301 (6th Cir.1990). The approximation will meet this clear error standard if it is supported by competent evidence in the record. <em>United States v. Mahaffey, </em>53 F.3d 128, 132 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Carter and Smith submit that the district court improperly found that each was responsible for more than sixty grams of cocaine base. A defendant who has been convicted of a conspiracy may be charged with all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions in furtherance of that conspiracy. <em>United States v. Neuhausser, </em>241 F.3d 460, 475 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Critton, </em>43 F.3d 1089, 1098-99 (6th Cir.1995)). This includes attributing all those involved in the conspiracy with the same quantity of drugs. <em>Id. </em>However, this attribution process should not be mechanical. <em>See United States v. Meacham, </em>27 F.3d 214, 217 (6th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Milledge, </em>109 F.3d 312, 316 (6th Cir.1997). The trial court must make individualized findings for each member of the conspiracy, regarding the scope of the conspiracy and the duration and nature of each conspirator\u2019s participation. <em>United States v. Bingham, </em>81 F.3d 617, 624 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">The district court properly made individualized findings for each member of the conspiracy sufficient to survive our clear error review regarding the quantity of drugs attributed to Carter and Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">Regarding Carter, the district court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-13\">The testimony at trial established that Mr. Carter met the other defendants at the New Circle Inn on Friday. Prior to the arrest they ate and drank together throughout the weekend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-14\">On Sunday morning Mr. Carter registered for a motel room at the Days Inn under his brother\u2019s name using his brother\u2019s identification and paid for the room with money which he received from James Stone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-15\">All six members, or all six of those indicted, stayed in the Days Inn Motel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>room on Sunday. Throughout the day members of the group left and returned. Early Monday morning police officers found Mr. Carter in the motel room, which contained digital scales, plastic bags, cigar blunting material, an iron, and all in plain view; as well as approximately 60 grams of crack cocaine, over $2,000 in currency, cell phone, pager, ammunition, glass measuring cup, and a notebook containing a recipe for crack cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">So based on what I have just said, based on the testimony which I heard at trial, the Court would find that Mr. Carter engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity; that is, conspiracy to possess, and aiding and abetting, and possession of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">The possession of the entire amount of the crack cocaine in the motel room was in furtherance of that jointly undertaken criminal activity and was reasonably foreseeable to Mr. Carter in connection with that activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">Considering Mr. Carter\u2019s role in obtaining a motel room, his contacts with the other defendants throughout the weekend, and the close quarters shared by the defendants, the Court finds sufficient evidence to sentence Mr. Carter based on the entire amount of drugs found in the motel room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Regarding Smith, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">At trial Leah Hicks and Yolanda Parker testified that they traveled to Lexington, Kentucky from Michigan with Mr. Stone and Mr. Smith in Mr. Smith\u2019s van.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">Upon arriving in Lexington, they met Mr. Carter and Raymond Williams and other individuals at the New Circle Inn ... Throughout the weekend the group met and ate and spent time together. Mr. Smith allowed others to use his van. On Sunday morning the group moved to Day\u2019s Inn where they checked into one room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">And early Monday morning the police found Mr. Smith in the motel room, which contained digital scales, plastic bags, a cigar butt, and materials in plain view, and about $2,000 in currency, and over 60 grams of crack cocaine; found a cell phone, pager ammunition, measuring cup, and a notebook containing a recipe for crack cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">In a statement to the police, Mr. Smith stated that he had never left the motel room that evening. And he acknowledged that he recognized crack cocaine, and he knew that digital scales were used to weigh drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\">The Court then would find that Mr. Smith and the other defendants engaged in a jointly undertaken criminal activity, specifically with regard to Mr. Smith aiding and abetting, possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-15\">The possession of the entire amount of crack cocaine found in the motel room was in furtherance-of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, and it was reasonably foreseeable for Mr. Smith in connection with that activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-16\">Considering the fact that Mr. Smith maintained almost constant contact with the other defendants throughout the weekend and shared close quarters with the other defendants, the Court finds sufficient evidence to sentence Mr. Smith based on the entire amount of drugs found in the hotel room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">These individualized findings for Carter and Smith fulfill the mandate of <em>Meacham </em>and <em>Bingham </em>to analyze the scope, duration, and nature of each defendant\u2019s participation, <em>see Meacham, </em>27 F.3d at 217; <em>see also Milledge, </em>109 F.3d at 316, and are supported by enough competent evidence in the record to meet our clear error re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>view of the district court\u2019s determination. <em>Mahaffey, </em>53 F.3d at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to find both Carter and Smith responsible for more than sixty grams of cocaine base at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\">.
