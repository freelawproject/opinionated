(\u201cZales\u201d). Mr. Perrelli claims violation of his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>Mr. Perrelli main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>tains that Zales had a duty to provide him with a free appraisal, which it refused to perform. We have examined the record and find that Mr. Perrelli does not allege any fact indicating that Zales\u2019 actions were motivated by Mr. Perrelli\u2019s asserted disability or otherwise implicating the Americans with Disabilities Act. Accordingly, Mr. Perrelli fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted. While it is possible that Mr. Perrelli may have been wronged, he does not allege a wrong that has a remedy under federal law. We have considered all of Mr. Perelli\u2019s claims and find them meritless. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
