Thompson offered to retrieve the gun, but Officer Coleman requested permission to enter the home to see the gun. Although Officer Coleman did not have a warrant to enter the premises, Thompson said it was \u201cokay\u201d for the officer to enter. Officer Coleman seized two firearms from the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-20\">Thompson made a motion to suppress the evidence, arguing that he did not give Officer Coleman consent to enter the premises. The district court found Officer Coleman a more credible witness and denied Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress. \u201cA district court\u2019s determination as to the credibility of a witness is virtually unre-viewable on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v.
