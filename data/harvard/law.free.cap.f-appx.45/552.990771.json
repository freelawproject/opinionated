Having reviewed the district court\u2019s summary judgment determination de novo, <em>see Hudson v. Norris, </em>227 F.3d 1047, 1050 (8th Cir.2000), we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-25\">Mr. White, a former inmate at the Hempstead County Detention Facility, brought this action against, inter alia, jail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ers Lloyd Wood<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Jeremy Brown, alleging that in 2001 they failed to protect him from an attack by another inmate, Stacy Trotter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officers Wood and Brown moved for summary judgment, claiming qualified immunity. In a verified response, Mr. White declared that when he was booked he notified another officer and Brown that Trotter should be put on his enemy-alert list because of a problem Mr. White just had with Trotter\u2019s wife; Trotter thereafter threatened to kill Mr. White for what Mr. White had done to Trotter\u2019s wife; Mr. White told Wood that Trotter was his enemy and was going to try to get him; when Wood led Mr. White in handcuffs to Trotter\u2019s \u201cpod,\u201d Mr. White asked Wood \u201cat least\u201d to handcuff Trotter before opening the door, but Wood refused; and when Wood opened the door, Trotter attacked Mr. White. Mr. White also declared that Brown (knowing Trotter was Mr. White\u2019s enemy) should not have let Wood \u201cgo back there by [himself],\u201d but should have been present to help. The district court held that the jailers were entitled to qualified immunity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Mr. White\u2019s allegations in his summary judgment response, taken as true, established a constitutional violation. <em>See Hope v. Pelzer, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 2513, 153 L.Ed.2d 666, \u2014 (2002) (\u201cThe threshold inquiry a court must undertake in a qualified immunity analysis is whether plaintiffs allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation.\u201d). \u201cDespite their participation in this constitutionally impermissible conduct, [defendants] may nevertheless be shielded from liability for civil damages if their actions did not violate \u2018clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2515 (quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). Mr. White\u2019s right to be free from the attack was, however, well settled by 2001. <em>See Prater v. Dahm, </em>89 F.3d 538, 541 (8th Cir.1996) (it is well settled that Eighth Amendment imposes duty on prison officials to protect prisoners from violence at hands of other prisoners); <em>Erickson v. Holloway, </em>77 F.3d 1078, 1080-81 (8th Cir.1996) (jail guard who was informed of inmate\u2019s report of threat from prisoner but who allegedly failed to disable cell block control panel when he left his post or to investigate prisoner\u2019s sudden movement toward area in which inmate was located was not entitled to qualified-immunity protection). Under the facts alleged, we conclude it was not objectively legally reasonable for the jailers to believe that their conduct did not violate Mr. White\u2019s clearly established Eighth Amendment right. <em>See Curry v. Crist, </em>226 F.3d 974, 977 (8th Cir.2000) (critical inquiry for qualified-immunity purposes is whether it was objectively legally reasonable for prison official to believe his conduct did not violate inmate\u2019s clearly established right).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">We hold, as to the failure-to-protect claim, that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of officers Wood and Brown on the basis of qualified immunity. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\">. The record seems to indicate that this jailer's name is \"Wood,\u201d not \u201cWoods.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-10\">. Mr. White also asserted a medical deliberate-indifference claim, but he has abandoned it by not raising it in his appellate brief. <em>See Etheridge v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 619, 622 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
