We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm, in part; reverse, in part, and remand with instructions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Sass contends that his multiple convictions for second degree murder (CaLPenal Code \u00a7 187(a)), gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated (CaLPenal Code \u00a7 191.5), driving under the influence causing injury (drunk driving with injury) (Cal. Veh.Code \u00a7 23153(a)), and driving with greater than .10 percent blood alcohol causing injury (Cal. Veh.Code \u00a7 23153(b)), violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">Sass is entitled to habeas relief if the state court\u2019s adjudication of his double jeopardy claim was contrary to clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the imposition of multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>See Ball v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 856, 864-65, 105 S.Ct. 1668, 84 L.Ed.2d 740 (1985) (\u201c[A] second conviction, even if it results in no greater sentence, is an impermissible punishment.\u201d). Where the same act constitutes a violation of two distinct statutes, the test to determine whether there are two offenses or only one for double jeopardy purposes is whether each offense \u201crequires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>See Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">Under California law, gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated requires proof of facts which need not be proved when the charge is murder, namely, intoxication and use of a vehicle. <em>See People v. Sanchez, </em>24 Cal.4th 983, 103 Cal.Rptr.2d 698, 16 P.3d 118, 120-21 (2001); <em>cf. Brown v. Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 167, 97 S.Ct. 2221, 53 L.Ed.2d 187 (1977) (stating that a state court has the final authority to interpret its own statutes). Accordingly, we conclude that second degree murder and gross vehicular manslaughter, as defined by the California Supreme Court, do not constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d under <em>Block-burger. </em>Therefore, Sass\u2019s multiple convictions for those offenses did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See Blockbur-ger, </em>284 U.S. at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">Gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, however, necessarily includes proof that a defendant committed a Cali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>fornia Vehicle Code section 23153 drunk driving with injury offense. <em>See People v. Miranda, </em>21 Cal.App.4th 1464, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 611-12 (1994) (stating that drunk driving with injury, in violation of section 23153 is a lesser included offense of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated). Because a defendant may not be convicted of both an offense and a lesser offense necessarily included within that offense, <em>see Rutledge v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 292, 307, 116 S.Ct. 1241, 134 L.Ed.2d 419 (1996) (holding that multiple convictions were barred where appellant was convicted of both greater and lesser included offense), we conclude that Sass\u2019s drunk driving with injury convictions are unauthorized punishment for a separate offense, and must be vacated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">We, therefore, reverse the district court\u2019s denial of the writ of habeas corpus and remand with instructions to grant the writ as to both of Sass\u2019s section 23153 drunk driving with injury convictions. <em>Cf. Wilcox v. McGee, </em>241 F.3d 1242, 1246 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">AFFIRMED, in part; REVERSED, in part; and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b865-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-14\">. Sass incorrectly states that his April 17, 2001 request for enlargement of certif\u00edcate of appealability (COA) was granted by the Appellate Commissioner on June 4, 2001. Instead, Sass\u2019s request was construed as a motion for broader certification and referred to the merits panel for consideration. <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Sass's motion for broader certification, now before us, is hereby denied. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Accordingly, our review is limited to the Double Jeopardy issue specified in the March 30, 2001 COA. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
