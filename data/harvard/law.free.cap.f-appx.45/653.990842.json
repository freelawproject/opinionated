Black contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel when she failed to interview the only two eyewitnesses to the events that led to his conviction for assault with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">We reverse the district court\u2019s denial of the writ. We conclude that the failure to interview these witnesses falls below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and that it is reasonably probable that the jury would have reached a different verdict had they heard the witnesses\u2019 testimony. We hold that, under the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (April 24, 1996) (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), the state court unreasonably applied the standard set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 684-95, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), when it denied Black\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 390-91, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1152-54 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">1. Arteaga</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">Trial counsel\u2019s failure to adequately investigate Arteaga\u2019s potential to exculpate Black constitutes deficient performance. <em>See Hart v. Gomez, </em>174 F.3d 1067, 1070 (9th Cir.1999). Although generally we defer to counsel\u2019s decision not to proffer a witness at trial, that decision is entitled to less deference when the attorney fails to interview the witness. <em>Lord v. Wood, </em>184 F.3d 1083, 1095 (9th Cir.1999) (noting that counsel cannot make judgments about the credibility and appearance of a witness without \u201clooking him in the eye and hearing him tell his story.\u201d). Douglas Arteaga\u2019s statements that he did not see a weapon on Black either during the incident or later were directly relevant to whether Black had a weapon, which was central to the charge of assault with a deadly weapon. Evidence contradicting Abea\u2019s testimony that Black had a knife would have, been critical to contesting that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-15\">We reject the State\u2019s reasoning that defense counsel\u2019s decision not to interview Arteaga was reasonably based on her belief that he would not make a good appearance because he had been on juvenile probation, had gone to juvenile probation camp, and \u201cprobably looked like a gang member.\u201d <em>See Avila v. Galaza, </em>297 F.3d 911, 2002 WL 1602508, *5-7 (9th Cir. July 22, 2002) (holding that concern that witnesses might not make the best appearance at trial was not a valid basis to fail to interview them); <em>Lord, </em>184 F.3d at 1095 (explaining that the decision as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the testimony of a witness could benefit the defense at trial cannot reasonably be made until counsel has interviewed the witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Black\u2019s counsel made the decision that Arteaga was not a credible witness prematurely. Neither she nor her investigator had spoken to Arteaga when she decided not to call him as a witness. Her assumptions about Arteaga\u2019s appearance and the value of his testimony may have changed had she interviewed him. <em>See id. </em>at 1095. Without seeing him or hearing his account, there was no reasonable basis for concluding that his testimony was valueless to Black\u2019s defense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The State\u2019s argument lacks merit that Arteaga\u2019s version of the incident was so distinct from Abea\u2019s, and so self-serving, that it would have harmed Black\u2019s defense. Arteaga\u2019s declaration is consistent with the understandings of two of the other three people at the scene: Alvarado and Black. His testimony would have bolstered the testimony Alvarado could have given about the absence of a weapon. Moreover, Arteaga\u2019s statements are not self-serving because he had no strong ties to Black.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Finally, defense counsel\u2019s remaining reason for failing to interview Arteaga \u2014 that she made several attempts but could not reach him by telephone \u2014 is not compelling. She did not send an investigator to the address on the police report, or make any other attempts to contact him. <em>See Rios v. Rocha, </em>2002 WL 1760585, *12-13 (9th Cir. July 31, 2002); <em>see also Sullivan v. Fairman, </em>819 F.2d 1382,1386-87, 1391-92 (7th Cir.1987). Subsequent investigators succeeded in contacting him despite a significant passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">2. Alvarado</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">We also hold that defense counsel did not provide effective assistance when she failed to interview Jose Alvarado, the only other eyewitness to the altercation. In a declaration submitted to the district court, Alvarado stated, like Arteaga, that he did not see a weapon in Black\u2019s hands during the incident. Defense counsel knew of Alvarado\u2019s potentially exculpatory testimony because the police report highlighted his statement that he saw no weapons. See <em>Lord, </em>184 F.3d at 1093-94; <em>Hart, </em>174 F.3d at 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The State\u2019s justifications for defense counsel\u2019s failure to interview Alvarado are unconvincing. First, the State\u2019s contention that trial counsel did not decline to interview Alvarado is not persuasive. Trial counsel made no attempt to contact Alvarado after her investigator received a call from Abea saying that Alvarado would not answer any questions regarding the incident. In light of the importance to the defense of Alvarado\u2019s statements, it was incumbent upon his counsel to go beyond the third-party representations of Abea and ascertain from Alvarado whether he would consent to an interview. <em>See Avila, </em>297 F.3d 911, 2002 WL 1602508 at *6; <em>see also Sullivan, </em>819 F.2d at 1391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Second, the State\u2019s contention lacks merit that defense counsel reasonably relied on the police report as an adequate indicator of Alvarado\u2019s potential as a witness. The State asserts a strategic rationale for the failure of Black\u2019s counsel to interview Alvarado: that Alvarado\u2019s testimony would have supported the carjacking charge by corroborating Abea\u2019s testimony that Black shouted \u201cGet out of the car.\u201d The police report does not support the State\u2019s argument. It shows only that Alvarado did not see Black approach, and emphasizes that Alvarado \u201cdid not see any weapons on either of the suspects.\u201d This statement, if believed by the jury, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>have undermined the prosecution\u2019s theory that Black was attempting to carjack the truck, and would have bolstered the defense argument that the incident was no more than a verbal altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Finally, the State\u2019s argument that Alvarado was a faulty witness who would not have been as credible as Abea does not affect our decision. Even if Alvarado was frightened, anxious, and stressed by the proceeding, had a \u201cpoor, faulty memory\u201d and did not have \u201cmuch of a present recollection of anything related to this case,\u201d these conclusions do not alter the fact that Alvarado made consistent statements over time that he did not see Black carrying a weapon. He made those statements to the police, in the state evidentiary hearing, and later to investigators who interviewed him in connection with Black\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In sum, it was not reasonable for defense counsel to decide not to interview Alvarado, and to have terminated any attempts to contact him after Abea\u2019s phone call to the investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">B. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">We conclude that Black was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance because there is a reasonable probability that the jury \u201cwould have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt\u201d had his counsel interviewed and called as witnesses Alvarado and Arteaga. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695. The only witness for the prosecution was Abea. Had either Alvarado or Arteaga testified, the jury would have heard statements that contradicted Abea\u2019s account from another eyewitness who was not directly involved in the confrontation. The consistency of their accounts on the critical issue for the defense, when the two witnesses were unknown to one another and had no apparent motive to testify falsely, may well have bolstered their credibility in the eyes of the jury. Because defense counsel did not interview these witnesses, there was no opportunity for the jury to evaluate their testimony. That the jury deliberated for three days indicates that this was a close case.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The absence of these two eyewitnesses\u2019 testimony undermines our confidence in the result. We conclude, therefore, that the error was prejudicial, and constituted an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland </em>under \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
