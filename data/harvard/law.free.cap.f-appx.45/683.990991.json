Rev.Code \u00a7 49.46.130. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and review an award of attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Haworth v. Nevada, </em>56 F.3d 1048, 1051 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Coldiron worked for appellee Casteel, Inc. d/b/a Canal Automotive (\u201cCanal\u201d) in Belfair, Washington, as a car mechanic from April 12, 1997, until the initiation of the underlying suit exactly three years later. Coldiron\u2019s federal and state overtime wage claims alleged that Canal\u2019s failure to pay was willful within the meaning of the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 255, 259, and Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 49.52.050. The complaint requested costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216, and under Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 49.52.070, both of which require showings of willful failure to pay wages for an award of fees. Coldiron\u2019s complaint did not request fees under two other state statutory fee provisions that did not require a willfulness showing, <em>see </em>Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 49.48.030, 49.46.090, and did not include a general prayer for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The court granted summary judgment in favor of Coldiron on the state unpaid wages claim. During the subsequent bench trial, the court dismissed the FLSA and breach of contract claims and all allegations of willful failure to pay wages, and awarded Coldiron unpaid overtime wages under \u00a7 49.46.130 in the amount of $2,236.31 plus interest. The court did not award costs or attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Coldiron again sought a fee award in a timely Rule 59(e) motion to amend judgment, specifically relying on Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 49.48.030, 49.46.090. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">Neither the minutes of the bench trial, the court\u2019s judgment, nor the court\u2019s denial of the Rule 59 motion indicate whether the district court denied Coldiron\u2019s application for attorney\u2019s fees on the merits or whether Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 49.48.030, 49.46.090 was even considered. We read the first to require consideration of the fee issue. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev.Code 49.48.030 (providing that \u201creasonable attorney fees, in an amount to be determined by the court <em>shall </em>be assessed\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>See also Dautel v. Heritage Home, Inc., </em>89 Wash.App. 148, 153, 948 P.2d 397 (Wash.Ct.App.1997) (\u201cBecause [plaintiff] was entitled to an award or attorney fees under Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 49.48.030, the trial court should have examined the facts of the case and exercised its discretion to determine an appropriate award\u201d). We read the second to at least provide the court with discretion to award attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 49.48.090 (providing \u201cfor costs and such reasonable attorney\u2019s fees <em>as may be allowed </em>by the court\u201d) (emphasis added). Noting also the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(f) (\u201call pleadings shall be so construed as to do substantial justice\u201d) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(c) (\u201cEvery final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in the party\u2019s pleadings\u201d), we remand to the district court for an explanation of the action taken with respect to the fee application. The district court may have concluded that plaintiff was not entitled to fees at all or that there was some defect in the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>the fee application; we simply cannot discern that from this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
