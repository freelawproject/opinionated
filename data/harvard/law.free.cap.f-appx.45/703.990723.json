Steve Garvey, </em>532 U.S. 504, 121 S.Ct. 1724, 149 L.Ed.2d 740 (2001). <em>Garvey v. Roberts, </em>255 F.3d 1153 (9th Cir.2001). The district court then denied Garvey\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitration awards and entered judgment against Garvey. Garvey now appeals arguing that the district erred in denying his motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s awards and not remanding the case to the arbitrator for further arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">The district court\u2019s denial of Garvey\u2019s motion was mandated by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion. On May 14, 2001 the Supreme Court held that we had erred in reversing the arbitration awards which the district had confirmed. \u201c[T]he Court of Appeals erred in reversing the order of the District Court denying the motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award .... the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\u201d 121 S.Ct. at 1729. Pursuant to the direction of the Supreme Court, we then remanded the case to the district court to take the action required by the Supreme Court. 255 F.3d 1153. Since the Supreme Court determined that we \u201cerred in reversing the order of the District Court denying the motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award,\u201d the district court had no choice but to do again what it had originally done, that is, to deny the motion to vacate. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion cannot be read to require the case to be submitted again to arbitration. Such a reading would negate the effect of the Court\u2019s opinion holding that we erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>previously vacating the award. Therefore, the order of the district court denying Garvey\u2019s motion to vacate, entering judgment in favor of respondent, the Major League Baseball Players Association, and dismissing Garvey\u2019s claims with prejudice is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b752-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
