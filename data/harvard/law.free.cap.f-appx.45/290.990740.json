Although the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>court had not yet ruled on the motion at the time Clark filed his appeal, the district court entered an order denying the motion while this action was pending. Construing Clark\u2019s action as a petition for a writ of mandamus requesting that this court order the district court to rule on the motion, we note that, in light of the district court\u2019s order, the petition is moot. Moreover, the district court\u2019s denial of a temporary restraining order is not appealable. <em>Drudge v. McKernon, </em>482 F.2d 1375, 1376 (4th Cir.1973). Accordingly, we deny the petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
