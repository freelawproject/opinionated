Miranda was found removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), based on his conviction for the aggravated felony of possession for sale of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-23\">Under INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), this Court lacks jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). <em>See Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir.2000). However, we do have \u201cjurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction,\u201d and thus may consider the petition to the extent that it challenges whether the conviction that served as the basis of the final removal order was an aggravated felony. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-24\">Miranda\u2019s conviction on August 21, 1991, for possession for sale of a controlled substance, constitutes an aggravated felony as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Although Miranda contends that the Final Removal Order did not provide him with notice of the conviction on which his removal was based, and that his removal was actually based on his misdemeanor conviction for driving under the influence, these arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-25\">The INS Officer found Miranda removable based on his \u201cfinal conviction of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>1101(a)(43),\u201d which defines an aggravated felony as including \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\u201d Miranda\u2019s August 1991 conviction falls within this definition. Further, Miranda did not contest the allegations which subjected him to removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Because a final order of removal was entered against Miranda based on his conviction for an aggravated felony, we lack jurisdiction to review his petition under INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b725-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-18\">. We lack jurisdiction on direct appeal over both Miranda\u2019s statutory and constitutional challenges to his removal. <em>See Calcano-Mar-tinez v. INS, </em>533 U.S. 348, 351-52, 121 S.Ct. 2268, 150 L.Ed.2d 392 (2001); <em>Randhawa v. INS, </em>298 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir.2002). However, Miranda is not precluded from raising those challenges through a collateral proceeding. <em>See id.; Flores-Miramontes v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 1133, 1135-36 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
