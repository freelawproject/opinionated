Advent Int\u2019l Corp., </em>220 F.3d 99, 102 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Before considering the merits of defendant\u2019s appeal, we must determine whether we have appellate jurisdiction. Section 16 of the Federal Arbitration Act provides that an appeal may be taken from an order refusing to stay an action pending arbitration pursuant to FAA 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(1)(A); <em>Smith v. Equitable, </em>209 F.3d 268, 272 (3d Cir.2000) (\u201cSection 16(b) makes [it] clear that with respect to an interlocutory order issued in an ongoing proceeding, any order favoring litigation over arbitration is immediately appealable.... \u201d); <em>Corpman v. Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc., </em>907 F.2d 29, 30 (3d Cir.1990) (per curiam) (stating that when a district court\u2019s order \u201cis in essence an order refusing to stay [litigation] under section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act,\u201d we have jurisdiction to hear an appeal under FAA 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Here, plaintiff Edward Klepper seeks to exercise stock options under a stock option incentive plan administered by his former employer SLI, Inc. The SLI stock option incentive plan contains an arbitration clause providing that \u201c[a]ny dispute or disagreement which shall arise under or as the result of this Option Grant shall be settled by an arbitrator.\u201d Rather than submit his stock option claim to arbitration, plaintiff brought this suit for breach of contract and violation of the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law, 43 P.S. \u00a7 260.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Defendant has requested a ruling on the arbitrability of the stock option claim. On June 22, 2001, the District Court issued an order requiring the parties to complete discovery \u201con all pending issues, including the stock option issue.\u201d In so doing, it appears the district judge may have permitted the litigation to proceed without a prior ruling on the arbitrability issue. Or she may have simply wanted the parties to develop a record on the arbitrability of the stock option claims. <em>Cf. Suarez-Valdez v. Shearson Lehman/American Exp., Inc., </em>858 F.2d 648, 649 (11th Cir.1988) (Tjoflat, J., concurring) (\u201cThe district court erred in refusing to stay discovery. An agreement to arbitrate is an agreement to proceed under arbitration and not under court rules [like the Fed. R. Civ. P.] .... \u201d), <em>quoted in Corpman, </em>907 F.2d at 31. We are not certain, but to move this matter along, we hold the District Court\u2019s Order \u201cin essence\u201d constituted a declination to stay litigation pending arbitration under FAA 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3. Therefore we have jurisdiction to hear defendant\u2019s appeal from the Order of June 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">The Federal Arbitration Act \u201cfederalizes arbitration law\u201d and \u201ccreates a body of federal substantive law establishing and regulating the duty to honor an agreement to arbitrate.... \u201d <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. v. Olick, </em>151 F.3d 132, 136 (3d Cir.1998). <em>See also Seus v. Nuveen &amp; Co., </em>146 F.3d 175, 178 (3d Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>1998) (asserting the FAA was enacted to make agreements to arbitrate enforceable to the same extent as other contracts); <em>Sharon Steel Corp. v. Jewell Coal, </em>735 F.2d 775, 778 (3d Cir.1984) (stating the FAA reflects \u201ca legislative determination of the desirability of arbitration as an alternative to litigation....\u201d). Accordingly, FAA \u00a7 3 provides that \u201cupon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration,\u201d the court \u201cshall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3. Thus requiring the parties to submit to full discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure may unnecessarily subject them \u201cto the very complexities, inconveniences and expenses of litigation that they determined to avoid.\u201d <em>Suarez, </em>858 F.2d at 649 (Tjoflat, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">For these reasons, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s discovery order of June 22, 2001 and remand for examination of the scope and applicability of the stock option plan\u2019s arbitration clause in accordance with <em>Blair v. Scott, </em>283 F.3d 595, 604 (3d Cir.2002) (examining the enforceability of an arbitration agreement under basic contract principles) and <em>Hancock, </em>151 F.3d at 137 (describing \u201cthe threshold questions a district court must answer before compelling or enjoining arbitration .... \u201d). Of course, to the extent discovery is appropriate on the arbitrability issue, we leave that to the sound discretion of the able District Judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\">. F.A.A. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3 provides, \u201cIf any suit or proceeding be brought ... upon an issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit or proceeding is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-12\">. Klepper's Complaint alleged four counts: a breach of contract claim (Count I), the state law WPCL claim (Count II), and two ERISA claims (Count III and IV). The two ERISA claims were dismissed and are not on appeal here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
