Maybeck filed a first \u00a7 2255 motion in February 1991 challenging his February 1990 convictions for bank robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm. The district court dis-missed that motion; however, we reversed the district court\u2019s order and remanded for re-sentencing. <em>See United States v. Maybeck, </em>23 F.3d 888 (4th Cir.1994). Maybeck\u2019s present \u00a7 2255 motion challenges issues arising from his re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-26\">To be entitled to a certificate of appeala-bility, Maybeck must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). When a district court dismisses solely on procedural grounds, the movant \u201cmust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>demonstrate both (1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right,\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was cor-rect in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201c <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In <em>In re Taylor, </em>171 F.3d 185, 187-88 (4th Cir.1999), this Court held that when a prisoner files a \u00a7 2255 motion that expressly seeks to raise issues that originate at the time of his re-sentencing, the motion is not \u201csecond or successive\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(b). Accordingly, because Maybeck\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion that is the subject of this appeal specifically sought to raise issues arising from his re-sentencing, we conclude the district court erred in dismissing it as second or successive. Nevertheless, Maybeck is not entitled to relief. Upon examination of Maybeck\u2019s motion, we cannot conclude that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether Maybeck has stated a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right because he has failed to sufficiently allege such a claim. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
