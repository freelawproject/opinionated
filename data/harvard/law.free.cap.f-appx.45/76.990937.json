Mancus appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Schwartz, <em>J.) </em>dismissing his petition on summary judgment. Mancus sought to vacate an arbitral award that sustained the termination of his employment by The Pierre Hotel (\u201cThe Pierre\u201d). The arbitration was conducted pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between Local 6 of the New York Hotel-Motel Trades Council, AFL-CIO (the \u201cUnion\u201d) and the Hotel Association of New York, of which The Pierre is a member. We affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Mancus v. The Pierre Hotel, et al., </em>00 Civ. 4484 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 27, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">This petition to vacate an arbitration award has been brought under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, and requires a showing that the Union breached its duty of fair representation. <em>United Parcel Services, Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 62, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (1981). To satisfy this requirement, the Union\u2019s conduct must have been \u201carbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith\u201d or have \u201cseriously undermine[d] the arbitral process.\u201d <em>Samuels v. Air Transport Local 504, </em>992 F.2d 12, 16 (2d Cir.1993) (citations omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate where the non-moving party has failed to establish the existence of a genuine dispute of fact as to an essential element of his claim. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">Here, Mancus has failed to raise a genuine factual dispute as to whether the Union acted in bad faith or seriously undermined the arbitral process. Mancus points to altercations with two non-supervisory Union delegates as grounds for the Union\u2019s alleged ill-will, but he presents no factual basis for attributing the delegates\u2019 hostility to the Union. Mancus also relies on the appointment of an arbitrator who ruled against Mancus in a previous disciplinary action. But that circumstance, standing alone, does not support an inference of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">In addition, Mancus points to several tactical decisions made by his counsel in the course of the arbitration. However, none was \u201cso egregious [or] so far short of minimum standards of fairness to the employee\u201d as to be arbitrary or suggest bad faith. <em>Barr v. United Parcel Serv., </em>868 F.2d 36, 43 (2d Cir.1989) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Finally, Mancus argues that bad faith may be inferred from the failure of the union-appointed representative to convey a settlement offer to him. However, even viewing the evidence presented in the light most favorable to him, Mancus has at most shown \u201cmere negligence\u201d \u2014 an insufficient ground for establishing that the Union breached its duty of fair representation. <em>United Steel Workers of Am. v. Rawson, </em>495 U.S. 362, 372-73, 110 S.Ct. 1904, 109 L.Ed.2d 362 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
