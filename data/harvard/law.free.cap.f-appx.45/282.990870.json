(1997), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000). For the reasons explained below, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">This court does not review a defendant\u2019s appeal of the extent of a downward departure unless the departure resulted in an illegal sentence or resulted from an incorrect application of the guidelines. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1995) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) (2000)). Gadson argues that his sentence was imposed both in violation of law and as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines because the district court relied on a mechanical formula to determine the extent of the departure, instead of making an individualized evaluation of the nature of his cooperation and its value to the government. Gadson\u2019s appeal rests solely on the district court\u2019s statement that \u201cI normally grant a three level departure for the kind of cooperation that has been given to date in this case.\u201d The court\u2019s statement came after the government had described Gadson\u2019s assistance at length and in very positive terms. The government informed the court that Gadson had \u201cdone a very thorough, very complete job of cooperation, given full and truthful cooperation [and] as a direct result of his assistance we got several bank robbery cases resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">Gadson\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>United States v. King, </em>53 F.3d 589, 591-92 (3d Cir.1995), and <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>33 F.3d 8 (5th Cir.1994), cases which find fault with the district court for failing to make an independent or individualized determination of the defendant\u2019s cooperation, because here the court\u2019s statement that it usually gave a three-level departure for the kind of cooperation that Gadson had provided does not establish that it failed to evaluate his cooperation individually. Rather, the court\u2019s statement suggests that it reserved a three-level departure for cooperation which was unusually extensive and beneficial to the government. While it would have been helpful to have the court explain its departure decision more fully, we cannot find that the district court imposed an illegal sentence or incorrectly applied the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">We therefore dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>gument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-12\"> The information was initially filed in the Southern District of Georgia and was transferred to the District of South Carolina pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
