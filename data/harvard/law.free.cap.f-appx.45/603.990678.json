We grant the petition for review and remand. Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">1. Torres has not explained how or why it was \u201cmandatory\u201d that she prepare for the civil lawsuit deposition at the same time that her removal hearing was scheduled to take place. Nor has she explained \u2014 assuming the \u201cmandatory\u201d nature of this deposition preparation \u2014 why she did not notify the IJ before the hearing to request rescheduling. The BIA did not, therefore, abuse its discretion by concluding that Torres\u2019s decision to attend the deposition preparation in lieu of the scheduled hearing did not qualify as an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d that was \u201cbeyond [her] control.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C), (e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">2. The Form 1-213 proffered by the INS as evidence of Torres\u2019s removability does not state that Torres is removable (or that she conceded that she is) or that she overstayed the period for which she was authorized to remain in the United States. Although the Form 1-213 does state that Torres is a citizen of the Philippines and that she entered the United States in 1989 as a visitor for pleasure, this information does not constitute \u201cclear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence\u201d that she is \u201cremovable.\u201d \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A); <em>Orhorhaghe v. INS, </em>38 F.3d 488, 504-05 (9th Cir.1994). Moreover, the information that Torres entered the United States in 1989 could only have come from the asylum application, as the information appears in the record only on that application and not in the handwritten notes of the later interview. The INS therefore did rely on Torres\u2019s 1992 asylum application to meet its burden of proof. Such reliance is prohibited by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.11(e). Accordingly, the BIA abused its discretion in holding that the INS clearly, convincingly, and unequivocally established Torres\u2019s removability. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">3. We do not have jurisdiction to consider Torres\u2019s argument that the BIA abused its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision not to reopen the in absentia removal proceedings in order to consider whether Torres should receive asylum. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b652-13\">The petition for review is GRANTED, and remanded for rescission of the order of removal entered in absentia.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
