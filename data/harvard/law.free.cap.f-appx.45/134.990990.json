On appeal, Bellitti contends the District Court erred in adding two levels to his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because it was not \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d that his co-conspirators would be in possession of firearms during drug trafficking activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Because the District Court did not err by enhancing defendant\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(b)(1), we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Construction of the guidelines is subject to plenary review, but \u201cfactual determinations underlying guideline application are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. McQuilkin, </em>97 F.3d 723, 727 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">In the late 1980s, the FBI began investigating a criminal drug organization being managed by defendant Francesco Bellitti and Ignazio Lena. As part of this investigation, undercover FBI agents purchased heroin from Bellitti and others. The investigation culminated in July 1989 when the undercover agents arranged to purchase one and a quarter kilograms of heroin for $310,000 from Bellitti\u2019s organization. When four of Bellitti\u2019s associates delivered the heroin in Delaware, they were arrested. At the time of their arrest, two of Bellitti\u2019s associates were in possession of firearms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-17\">Based on the amount of narcotics involved, Bellitti\u2019s base offense level was 36. Bellitti\u2019s sentence was increased by another three levels because of his supervisory role under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). In addition, this offense level was enhanced two levels in accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) because some of his co-conspirators possessed weapons during the commission of the offense. Bellitti also received a reduction of two levels for his acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). As a result of these adjustments, Bellitti was assigned a total offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>level of 39 and sentenced to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">On appeal, Bellitti challenges the two-level sentencing enhancement applied for possession of firearms because he alleges it was not \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d that his coconspirators would possess firearms while carrying out the heroin deal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The sentencing guidelines provide that if \u201ca dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed, increase by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). Furthermore, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) provides that a coconspirator is to be held accountable for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction.... \u201d <em>See also United States v. Johnson, </em>199 F.3d 123, 127 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201cSentencing adjustments may include \u2018all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>190 F.3d 656 (5th Cir.1999) (citing \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B))); <em>United States v. Collado, </em>975 F.2d 985, 995 (3d Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Missick, </em>875 F.2d 1294, 1301 (7th Cir.1989) (\u201c[Defendant] may still have been properly subject to an enhanced sentence based on the possession of firearms by [co-defendants] without individually possessing a firearm under the theory of coconspirator liability.\u201d) (quoted in <em>Johnson, </em>199 F.3d at 127); <em>United States v. Bianco, </em>922 F.2d 910, 912 (1st Cir.1991) (\u201cThe value and quantity of controlled substances are simply relevant indicators as to whether a codefendant\u2019s possession of a firearm, and the concomitant increase in the risk of violence, during the course of their joint criminal venture, were reasonably foreseeable to the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Here, Bellitti had a managerial role in the drug conspiracy. Bellitti and Ignazio Lena set up and engineered a transaction in which their associates were to deliver over $300,000 worth of heroin to buyers in Delaware. During the planned delivery, Bellitti\u2019s associates were arrested and FBI agents found some of them in possession of firearms. We endorse the proposition that firearms are the \u201ctools of the trade\u201d for drug dealers, especially in large-scale transactions. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>938 F.2d 1078, 1083-84 (10th Cir.1991) (surveying cases) (cited in <em>United States v. Price, </em>13 F.3d 711, 719 (3d Cir.1994)); <em>see also United States v. Dean, </em>59 F.3d 1479, 1490 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cWe have observed repeatedly that firearms are the tools of the trade of those involved in illegal drug activity.\u201d). On these facts, we do not believe it was clear error to conclude that the coconspirators\u2019 possession of firearms at the scene of the drug exchange was reasonably foreseeable to Bellitti. <em>See Colla-do, </em>975 F.2d at 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-13\">. Specifically, defendant pled guilty to Counts 1, 5, 7, 8, 11 and 14 of a superseding indictment. Count 1 was for conspiracy to distribute heroin and cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A); Counts 5, 7, and 8 were for the distribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B); Count 11 was for interstate travel in aid of racketeering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(3); and Count 14 was for racketeer influenced and corrupt organization in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-20\">. These two associates were arrested while sitting inside a Dodge Caravan containing heroin. Upon conducting a search, FBI agents found a loaded gun inside co-defendant Vincenzo Maori\u2019s belt.
