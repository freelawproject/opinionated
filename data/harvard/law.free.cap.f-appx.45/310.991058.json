For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand for further proceedings. The district court, acting sua sponte, determined from the face of Mock\u2019s petition that his claims were barred by the one-year limitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) (2000), and dismissed the action without giving Mock notice and an opportunity to respond. At the time it issued its decision, the district court did not have the benefit of our recent opinion in <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir.2002). <em>Hill </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>v. Braxton </em>now requires the district court to provide such notice and opportunity to respond \u201cunless it is indisputably clear from the materials presented to the district court that the petition is untimely and cannot be salvaged by equitable tolling principles or any of the circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 2244(d)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Because it is not \u201cindisputably clear\u201d that Mock cannot salvage his petition, we grant a certificate of appealability, vacate the district court\u2019s order, and remand to the district court to provide Mock with the notice and opportunity to respond to which he is now entitled pursuant to <em>Hill. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
