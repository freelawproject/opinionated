We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), as amended by IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c), <em>see Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1195 n. 4 (9th Cir.2000),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We review final orders of removal from the BIA under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 338-39 (9th Cir.1995). Reversal of the BIA is appropriate only if the record evidence is so \u201ccompelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite persecution or fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). If the record contains substantial evidence supporting the denial of asylum and withholding of deportation, we must affirm. <em>Id:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Gomez contends that the evidence compels the conclusion that he suffered past persecution \u201con account of\u2019 his anti-communist political opinion. We disagree. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s conclusions that the threats made against Gomez were no more than attempts at financial extortion made on account of Gomez\u2019 perceived ability to pay. The record evidence does not compel the conclusion that Gomez\u2019 putative prosecutors knew that he was anti-communist or imputed anti-communist beliefs to him and persecuted him on account of that political opinion. <em>Cf. Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 736 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that petitioner was persecuted on account of her political opinion where NPA members threatened her after she \u201carticulated her political opposition to the NPA as the reason for her refusal to join\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">Because Gomez failed to establish statutory eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more onerous standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-20\">. Because the INS initiated deportation proceedings against Gomez prior to April 1, 1997, and Gomez\u2019s final order of removal was issued on or after October 31, 1996, IIRIRA transitional rules apply to this case. <em>See Ave-tova-Elisseva, </em>213 F.3d at 1195 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
