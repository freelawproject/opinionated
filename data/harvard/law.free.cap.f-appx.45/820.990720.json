R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Jose Humberto Varela-Marquez appeals his 36-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for unlawful reentry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Varela-Marquez contends that his presentence report (PSR) was insufficient proof that his 1984 burglary conviction was an aggravated felony for purposes of the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) (2000). We review for plain error because Varela-Marquez raised no objection below. <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>258 F.3d 1120, 1123-25 (9th Cir.2001) , <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 1115, 151 L.Ed.2d 1009 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">We previously stated that California\u2019s general burglary statute is broader than the generic definition of burglary. <em>United States v. Velasco-Medina, </em>No. 01-50064, 2002 WL 1832330, at *9 (9th Cir. Aug.12, 2002) . The PSR failed to state Varela-Marquez\u2019s specific statute of conviction or cite to judicially noticeable documents. Furthermore, we cannot consider the specific underlying facts in the PSR to determine whether the crime was aggravated. <em>See United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1212 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (holding that PSR with only a recitation of the facts is insufficient evidence for purposes of determining whether a prior conviction is an aggravated felony because courts should not consider the underlying facts of the prior conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">Consequently, we remand for re-sentencing to allow the district court to review the existing record and any state court documents that may be obtained in order to determine whether Varela-Marquez\u2019s 1984 burglary conviction qualifies for the aggravated felony enhancement. <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880, 889-90 (9th Cir.) (en banc) (allowing the district court to permit the government to introduce omitted evidence on remand), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2345, 153 L.Ed.2d 173 (2002). <em>Cf. United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 908-09 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (stating that when a the statute is broader than the generic definition, the court should examine other documents or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish the prior conviction is a predicate conviction for enhancement purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-21\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b869-23\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
