He was acquitted on all other counts. The District Court sentenced Pedroni to 37 months and ordered him to pay $500,000 in restitution. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction, some of the evi-dentiary rulings and jury instructions, as well as his sentence. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Pedroni and his coconspirators participated in a \u201cdaisy chain\u201d scheme to evade excise taxes on the sale of certain kinds of fuel. The elements of such schemes have been detailed sufficiently elsewhere. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Morelli, </em>169 F.3d 798, 801 (3d Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 820, 120 S.Ct. 63, 145 L.Ed.2d 54 (1999) (citations omitted). From 1989 until at least 1993, Pedroni operated as the president of Pedroni Fuels, a fuel supply company operating at the top of the daisy chain. We will add further factual detail below as it becomes necessary to the legal discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Pedroni first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, we must ask whether any rational jury could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. See <em>United States v. Veksler, </em>62 F.3d 544, 551 (3d Cir.1995) (citations omitted). Count One of the Superseding Indictment charged the conspirators with a multiple-object conspiracy to defraud the United States and to commit tax evasion, wire fraud on the State of New Jersey, and money laundering. The Government was required to prove three elements: \u201c(1) the existence of an agreement, (2) an overt act by one of the conspirators in furtherance of the objectives, and (3) an intent on the part of the conspirators to agree, as well as to defraud the United States\u201d or to commit an underlying offense. <em>United States v. Shoup, </em>608 F.2d 950, 955-56 (3d Cir.1979). Pedroni challenges the sufficiency of the first and third elements, arguing that he had no actual knowledge of the illegal objective of the conspiracy nor the requisite intent required.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">We are satisfied that a rational finder of fact could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the Government met its burden of proof. A jury could rationally infer that Pedroni had actual knowledge of the conspiracy, and that he intended that excise taxes would not be paid on the fuel Pedro-ni supplied to the daisy chain. For example, Pedroni stock-transferred fuel into Pe-tro Plus\u2019 account at the terminal despite invoicing the fuel to a middle company in the chain. He called Kings to determine which company to invoice for the fuel, and it was Kings (and not Petro Plus) that paid Pedroni for the fuel before Pedroni even sent invoices for the middle companies to Kings. When documents and certification were lacking, Pedroni called personnel at Kings, instead of calling the actual purchaser, to give that particular purchasing company an opportunity to provide correct documentation. It did not matter that Pe-droni sold to middle companies in the daisy chain that had 637 Licenses (making the initial transactions tax-exempt) because Pedroni clearly knew that he was in effect selling to PetroPlus and that taxes were not being payed along the chain. The record reflects numerous examples of similar deceptions. It is apparent from the record that the trial provided sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could find the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">B. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">Pedroni argues that the District Court erred when it did not deliver a charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>which included instructions on good-faith defense, willfulness, multiple conspiracy, missing witness, and unity of purpose instructions. Additional error is alleged because the District Court did not instruct the jury that each element must be found unanimously and advised the jury to disregard the evidence that Pedroni lacked a stake in the venture. \u201cWe will reverse the [District [Cjourt\u2019s denial to charge a specific jury instruction only when the requested instruction was correct, not substantially covered by the instructions given, and was so consequential that the refusal to give the instruction was prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>959 F.2d 1187, 1191 (3d Cir.1992). In determining whether the District Court stated the appropriate legal standards in its charge, our review is plenary. <em>United States v. Johnstone, </em>107 F.3d 200, 204 (3d Cir.1997). The jury charge must clearly articulate the legal standards at issue and be structured to avoid confusion, we examine the charge in its entirety. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">We have previously made clear that a District Court\u2019s failure to give a good-faith defense instruction does not constitute an abuse of discretion, so long as the charge included detailed instructions on the elements of the crime. <em>Gross, </em>961 F.2d at 1103 (\u201c[A] jury finding of good faith is inconsistent with a finding that the defendant acted knowingly and willfully.\u201d). Consistent with our practice to review the entire jury charge as a whole, the record is clear that the District Court adequately charged the jury on willfulness. It was not in error to refuse to charge the defense of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">As to the failure to charge on multiple conspiracies, the District Court did instruct the jury that the \u201cfirst element for you to determine is whether the conspiracy charged in Count One existed\u201d and that \u201c[i]n order to find a defendant guilty of conspiring to defraud the United States, you must find that he was a participant in the scheme to defraud the United States set forth in the Indictment, and not some other scheme.\u201d App. at 627, 630. The District Court further instructed the jury that it could not consider whether a defendant was a member of the conspiracy unless it found that \u201cthe evidence shows that the conspiracy charged in Count One existed.\u201d App. at 633. The charge, viewed in its entirety, substantially covered the instruction Pedroni argues should have been included. <em>See, e.g., Phillips, </em>959 F.2d at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Pedroni argues that the District Court should have given a missing witness instruction because the government chose not to call three of its cooperating witnesses. It is clearly established precedent in this Circuit that a missing witness instruction is not appropriate when the witness is available to both the defense and the prosecution. <em>United States v. Busic, </em>587 F.2d 577, 586 (3d Cir.1978), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>446 U.S. 398, 100 S.Ct. 1747, 64 L.Ed.2d 381 (1980). Pedroni does not assert that these three witnesses were not available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Pedroni\u2019s argument that the District Court erred by failing to charge the jury with a unity of purpose likewise fails. The District Court instructed the jury that it had to find \u201c \u2018a unity of purpose\u2019 or a \u2018common design\u2019 to do something that the law forbids.\u201d App. at 631. This more than substantially covered Pedroni\u2019s proffered additional (and therefore unnecessary) instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">Pedroni argues that the District Court failed to inform the jury that each element of the offenses had to be found unanimously. Again, reviewing the jury charge in its entirety, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>adequately charged the jury. The District Court instructed that the jury \u201cmust be unanimous as to which one of the objects of the conspiracy the defendant agreed to pursue,\u201d App. at 627-28, and that the jury \u201cverdict must be unanimous.\u201d App. at 659. The jury was properly charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Pedroni also takes issue with the instructions to the jury that it should disregard evidence that Pedroni lacked a stake in the venture. We have previously held that the government need not prove \u201cthat each conspirator expected to benefit from the conspiracy\u201d in order to support a conspiracy conviction. <em>United States v. Shoup, </em>608 F.2d 950, 957 (3d Cir.1979). The instruction was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">C. Undercover Operation</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Pedroni argues that the Government\u2019s payment of cash \u201cbribes\u201d to Pedroni\u2019s broker, Robert Recek, induced Pedroni to sell fuel to the Government\u2019s undercover business. The record reveals that in May of 1991, the Government established an undercover business. Pedroni became the undercover business\u2019 first supplier. The undercover agent initially secured supplies from Pedroni through Pedroni\u2019s broker, Recek. In addition to the normal broker\u2019s fee, the undercover business payed Recek an additional .5&lt;t per gallon for every gallon of fuel secured from Pedroni.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Whether the Government\u2019s conduct in running the undercover operation was so outrageous as to violate Pedroni\u2019s due process rights is a legal question over which our standard of review is plenary. <em>United States v. Driscoll, </em>852 F.2d 84, 85 (3d Cir.1988). We have expressed the view that, \u201cto the extent a government misconduct defense distinct from entrapment is available, it \u2018must be predicated on intolerable government conduct which goes beyond that necessary to sustain an entrapment defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86 (citing <em>United States v. Jannotti, </em>673 F.2d 578, 606 (3d Cir.1982) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, 457 </em>U.S. 1106, 102 S.Ct. 2906, 73 L.Ed.2d 1315 (1982)). We reject Pedroni\u2019s contention that the undercover government business and agent, with the help of Recek, rose to a level that violated Pedroni\u2019s due process rights. The Government did not initiate the criminal activity and Pedroni actively and willingly participated in it. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Twigg, </em>588 F.2d 373 (3d Cir.1978) (government approached defendant and supplied all essential material and equipment for methamphetamine production); <em>United States v. West, </em>511 F.2d 1083 (3d Cir.1975) (government suggested narcotics sale and provided source of the supply for the sale and arranged the sale to another undercover agent).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">D. Expert Witnesses at Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Pedroni asserts that the District Court erroneously permitted three Government witnesses to offer expert opinions that Pedroni was a part of the criminal conspiracy. A decision to admit expert testimony is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d 188, 211 (3d Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1131, 120 S.Ct. 969, 145 L.Ed.2d 840 (2000) (citation omitted). The trial judge is given \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to admit or exclude such testimony, based upon whether it is helpful to the trier of fact. <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed.R.Evid.702).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">The three witnesses are Malcolm Fox, Paul Malloy, and Steven Bursey. As an initial matter, the Government did not offer Fox as an expert witness and the District Court did not allow Fox to testify as an expert. As a lay witness, Fox was allowed to testify to opinions and inferences if they were \u201c(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>mony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 701. A review of the record reveals that Fox\u2019s testimony fell within the permissible parameters of Rule 701. We find no abuse of discretion concerning the Fox testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Malloy, an IRS agent, testified about tax returns and financial transactions, the taxing structure as it pertained to motor fuel excise tax, and taxes and the methods of evasion or tax fraud (as elicited on the record by Pedroni\u2019s counsel after the Government presented evidence concerning Malloy\u2019s qualifications). Bursey, a former FBI Special Agent, testified about his experiences as an undercover agent operating the undercover business to which Pedroni sold fuel on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Our review of the record has failed to uncover any evidence where these two witnesses explicitly opined about Pedroni\u2019s part in the conspiracy. <em>Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d at 212 (\u2018Where an expert in a criminal case has not explicitly testified about a defendant\u2019s intent, courts [are] reluctant to exclude the expert\u2019s testimony under Rule 704(b).\u201d (emphasis added)). Many of the passages from the transcript challenged by Pedroni are statements made by the witnesses in response to questions posed on cross-examination. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in allowing these witnesses to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">E. Evidence of Other Conspiracies and Other Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Count 38 of the Superseding Indictment charged one of Pedroni\u2019s coconspirators, Daniel Enright, with a conspiracy to extort money from two other coconspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Pedroni argues that this Count, along with other charges in the Indictment, had nothing to do with him and that he was prejudiced by the District Court\u2019s decision to deny his motion for severance. The \u201cother charges\u201d in the Indictment include: Count 39 which charged Enright and Was-serstrom with committing a currency reporting violation; evidence concerning En-right\u2019s personal returns for 1990 through 1993; evidence of excise tax evasion occurring after Pedroni stopped providing fuel to the daisy chain; evidence of wire fraud and money laundering charges involving payments to different suppliers; and evidence that Enright received millions of dollars of income from his participation in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">If it appears that a defendant or the government is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or other defendants in an indictment or information or by such join-der for trial together, the court may order an election or separate trials of counts, grant a severance of defendants or provide whatever other relief justice requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">The burden of showing prejudice lies on Pedroni. <em>United States v. Eufrasio, </em>935 F.2d 553, 568 (3d Cir.1991). Our review of the District Court\u2019s denial of the severance motion requires that we \u201cfirst determine from the record as it was when the severance motions were made, what trial developments were then reasonably foreseeable, and in that light decide whether the court abused its discretion denying severance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If we determine that the District Court abused its discretion, then we must determine whether the denial caused trial prejudice, asking \u201cwhether the jury could have been reasonably expected to compartmentalize the allegedly prejudicial evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>light of the quantity and limited admissibility of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Pedroni\u2019s Rule 14 severance motion. Severing Pe-droni\u2019s trial was not required, even if some potential for prejudice might be associated with evidence of the Enright extortion conspiracy and other charges in the Indictment unrelated to Pedroni. \u201cPrejudice should not be found in a joint trial just because all evidence adduced is not germane to all counts against each defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the District Court instructed the jury to \u201ccarefully weigh the evidence relating to each defendant and each charge,\u201d which it clearly did when we observe it convicted Pedroni on only one count and acquitted him on all remaining counts. We see no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">F. Other Allegedly Prejudicial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Pedroni raises a number of challenges to the order of the District Court\u2019s to admit evidence on and concerning tapes made by undercover agents relating to the undercover business. Pedroni argues that the evidence should have been excluded under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) is a \u201ccodification of the common law prohibition against the admission of evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or other acts relevant solely to prove the defendant\u2019s \u2018general criminal predisposition to do wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Scarfo, </em>850 F.2d 1015, 1019 (3d Cir.1988) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). The rule prohibits the admission into evidence of extrinsic acts intended to prove a defendant\u2019s propensity for crime or to suggest to the jury unfavorable inferences reflecting on his character. But evidence that bears on a relevant issue in a case, though possessing the potential to damage the defendant\u2019s cause, \u201cis not inadmissible for that reason alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1018-19. If the evidence is offered for another proper reason, \u201cthe same evidence of other crimes or acts is subject only to the ordinary limitations under Rules 402 and 403,\u201d which include undue prejudice <em>Id. </em>at 1019. Intended as a \u201crule of inclusion,\u201d the possible uses of other crimes evidence has been used to prove such things as: motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, background information, parties familiarity with one another, concert of action, parties continuing relationship, and to assist jurors in understanding defendant\u2019s role in the scheme. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Before admitting evidence of other acts under Rule 404(b), the District Court must ask, \u201cWhether that evidence is probative of a material issue other than character.\u201d <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 685, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 1499, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988). Under Rule 403, the District Court must \u201cappraise the genuine need for the challenged evidence and balance that necessity against the risk that the information will influence the jury to convict on improper grounds.\u201d <em>Scarfo, </em>850 F.2d at 1019. Our review of a District Court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence is for abuse of discretion, \u201cand such discretion is construed especially broadly in the context of Rule 403.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>264 F.3d 321, 326-27 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">As the record clearly reveals, the District Court performed the balancing test mandated under Rule 403 and admitted those portions of the tapes which it found were not unduly prejudicial to Pedroni. Despite Pedroni\u2019s challenges to the contrary, the District Court gave proper and timely limiting instructions with regard to the challenged evidence which it admitted. The District Court also conducted a care<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ful review of the tapes, and excluded those portions of the tapes which it found excludable under Rule 403. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">G. Restitution</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Pedroni argues that the District Court improperly ordered him to pay $500,000 in restitution. We review the appropriateness of a District Court\u2019s award of restitution for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Simmonds, </em>235 F.3d 826, 829 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">As the Government aptly points out, the District Court could have ordered up to $74 million dollars in restitution, given that the total loss was estimated at $132 million and the loss associated with the charges for which Pedroni was acquitted totaled almost $58 million. In such a light, we find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s (rather generous) restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">We have thoroughly reviewed all the arguments presented by Pedroni in his submissions to this Court, and those presented at oral argument, and find no basis to disturb the conviction or the sentence imposed by the District Court. The judgment of the District Court entered on March 8,1999, will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
