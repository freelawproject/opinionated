First, Petitioner alleges that insufficient evidence supports his state-court conviction for attempted first-degree sexual assault. Second, Petitioner contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-36\">The Court of Appeals of Alaska correctly concluded that sufficient evidence supported the inference that Petitioner had the specific intent to \u201csexually penetrate\u201d his victim. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational factfinder could conclude that Petitioner had the specific intent to sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>assault the victim, as that crime is defined by Alaska law. <em>See Turner v. Calderon, </em>281 F.3d 851, 881-82 (9th Cir.2002) (stating standard). Petitioner made sure that he and M.A.W. were alone and then asked if she wanted to \u201cdo something\u201d with him. When she refused, he trapped her in his cabin and threatened to release attack dogs. When she tried to leave, he grabbed her, threw her to the floor, and kicked her in the chest and punched her in the face. During this struggle, Petitioner tore M.A.W.\u2019s blouse, exposing her breasts. Ignoring her pleas for help, Petitioner pulled her toward the back room of his cabin.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision to refrain from calling witnesses who would attack the victim\u2019s character for truthfulness was objectively reasonable. <em>See Delgado v. Lewis, </em>223 F.3d 976, 980 (9th Cir.2000) (stating standard). Counsel weighed the risk of challenging M.A.W.\u2019s credibility (she was \u201ca sympathetic and believable witness\u201d) against the possible benefit of doing so when there was \u201cno solid evidence\u201d of her reputation for lack of veracity. Even if that decision were error, Petitioner cannot show that the decision prejudiced him. Several witnesses, including a village police officer, reinforced the victim\u2019s version of events. Even if the victim\u2019s credibility had been aggressively challenged, Petitioner cannot show a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Dows v. Wood, </em>211 F.3d 480, 485 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 908, 121 S.Ct. 254, 148 L.Ed.2d 183 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b745-37\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
