Far from ignoring considerations favorable to the petitioner, <em>cf. Mattis v. INS, </em>774 F.2d 965, 968 (9th Cir.1985), the Board, in its March 10, 2000, decision, took note of Flores\u2019s arguments, as well as the new supporting evidence she offered \u2014 including \u201cdeclarations by [Flores], her husband, and an assistant public defender, a psychologist\u2019s letter, and a medical diagnosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">Although the Board concluded that the waiver should nonetheless be denied, it did not arrive at this conclusion in a \u201csummary or conclusory\u201d fashion. <em>Id. </em>at 967. Instead, it provided reasons for rejecting Flores\u2019s hardship argument: The marriage occurred after deportation proceedings had already been commenced against Flores, and Flores\u2019s husband stated that he would accompany Flores to Taiwan if she was deported. Furthermore, the Board explained that even if Flores\u2019s hardship argument and the alleged mitigating circumstances surrounding her welfare fraud conviction were credited, they would not overcome her \u201csignificant adverse history of disregarding the laws of this country, both immigration and otherwise.\u201d Because the decision is not \u201carbitrary], irrational[ ], or contrary to law,\u201d <em>Eide-Kahayon v. INS, </em>86 F.3d 147, 149 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam), it will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-22\">We reject Flores\u2019s argument that, under <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976), her American husband\u2019s interest in the marital relationship requires the Board to hold a hearing before discretionary relief is denied. Flores can point to no case where a court has applied the <em>Mathews </em>framework in this context. Even assuming that <em>Mathews </em>applies, the balance of factors does not weigh in favor of yet another hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-23\">First, the \u201cprivate interest\u201d is weak. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 96 S.Ct. 893. Flores was determined to be a deportable alien through an earlier process that included a fair hearing. The current petition concerns only the Board\u2019s exercise of its discretion to deny a waiver. A deportable alien does not have a recognized interest in remaining in the country or delaying her deportation through reopening of deportation pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>ceedings. <em>See, e.g., INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Similarly, the spouse who married an alien knowing that deportation might be imminent can claim no cognizable interest in lengthening her stay once the alien is found deportable.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Second, the \u201cprobable value ... of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\u201d is minimal. <em>Mathews, </em>424 U.S. at 335, 96 S.Ct. 893. The facts \u2014 most notably, the initial sham marriage and the welfare fraud conviction \u2014 are essentially undisputed. The outcome boils down to a discretionary decision in balancing the favorable and unfavorable factors, a task entrusted by law to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Finally, the government has a strong interest in avoiding further delays in Flores\u2019s deportation. <em>See id. </em>\u201cMotions for reopening of immigration proceedings are disfavored [because] ... every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Doherty, </em>502 U.S. at 323, 112 S.Ct. 719 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Because the <em>Mathews </em>factors weigh decidedly against Flores, due process does not require a hearing on Flores\u2019s waiver application.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b757-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
