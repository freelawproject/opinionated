The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Roma-ni had a severe disorder of the sacrum and a history of ulcerative colitis, but that Ro-mani did not have a listed impairment or the medical equivalent and that she was not prevented from performing her past relevant work as a machine operator. Ro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>mani sought review of the ALJ\u2019s decision by the Appeals Council, but the Council concluded that there was no basis for review. This amounted to a final decision by the Commissioner. After the District Court affirmed this decision, Romani made a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We are bound by the Commissioner\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d means \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>E.g., Morales v. Apfel, </em>225 F.3d 310, 316 (3d Cir.2000) (internal citations omitted). Although we are deferential, we \u201cretain a responsibility to scrutinize the entire record and to reverse or remand if the [Com-missionerj\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317. Because aspects of the record indicate that Romani could <em>not </em>perform her past relevant work, and the ALJ\u2019s decision that she <em>could </em>is not supported by substantial evidence, we will reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Romani worked as a machine operator for Frigidaire from 1977 to 1990 making plastic parts for air conditioners. Tr. 37, 40. She testified that she had to stand and bend up and down, lift, use a spray can and other tools, and move mold headings. Tr. 39-40. The job did not involve frequent lifting or carrying of more than 10 pounds and the heaviest weight she had to lift was over 20 pounds. Tr. 40. She also testified that the job had to be done very quickly: \u201cThe machines have to be open[ed] and close[d] only in ... 20 seconds, 30 seconds.\u201d Tr. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In concluding that Romani could perform her past work, the ALJ rejected the evidence of a treating physician, which normally is afforded great weight in disability determinations. <em>See, e.g., Morales v. Apfel, 225 </em>F.3d 310, 317 (3d Cir.2000). Here, Dr. Hochberg, who treated Romani from 1988 to 1990, opined that she should not carry objects weighing more than five pounds and should not lift objects weighing more than two pounds. Tr. 233. He specifically eliminated sitting and standing from the list of work activities that Romani could perform. Later examiners estimated that Romani could lift slightly more.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the evidence of Dr. Hoch-berg, coupled with the other evidence referenced below, makes it questionable whether Romani could do her prior work.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">One of the reasons the ALJ gave for rejecting Dr. Hochberg\u2019s evaluation of Ro-mani\u2019s lifting capacity was \u201cthe overall lack of consistency in [Romani\u2019s] alleged complaints and reported activities of daily living.\u201d Tr. 20. But the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the claimant\u2019s daily activities is misplaced, as it appears that driving a car is the most exertion she engages in \u2014 Romani reported that she was unable to do household maintenance, but watched TV and drove a car. Tr. 173, 266, 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The evidence from Dr. Hochberg is bolstered by the testimony of Dr. Mylod, Romani\u2019s medical expert. Dr. Mylod, who had more than a decade of experience as a medical expert at Social Security hearings, was the sole expert witness at the hearing. Although he had not examined Romani, he had reviewed all her medical records. He testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>[Romani\u2019s] ability to stand in an eight-hour day would be no more than two hours, 15 minutes at a time based on\u2014 because of the radiculopathy and the meningocele that\u2019s in the sacral. And her ability to sit is restricted also. Again, because of the pressures in the spinal cord and in the disks (inaudible) are actually increased when seated. So she has radiculopathy when she\u2019s seated. And the radiculopathy in her hand is certainly going to affect her hand \u2014 her ability to do fine manipulations. And I estimate her ability to lift probably no more than ten pounds, probably less than 20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Tr. 62. The ALJ rejected Dr. Mylod\u2019s opinion \u201cbecause it appears to be based on an uncritical acceptance of [Romani\u2019s] self-serving complaints,\u201d but accepted the view of the \u201cmedical consultants who reviewed the evidence of record at both the initial and reconsideration levels of the adjudication review process\u201d that Romani did not suffer from a listed impairment. Tr. 16-17. The ALJ failed to explain how lack of examination made Dr. Mylod\u2019s views as to the claimant\u2019s condition and ability to perform work suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Moreover, the medical reports consistently note the slowness of Romani\u2019s movement, while her work as a machine operator required speed. Her own report that she walked very slowly, Tr. 187, was corroborated by medical records from 1995 that reflect that she \u201cwalked and moved slowly\u201d and \u201cwith difficulty.\u201d Tr. 281, 284. Further, a 1997 report states that she could walk on her heels and toes \u201cslowly,\u201d Tr. 325, and Dr. Vekhnis, who examined Romani in January 1997, reported that all of her motions were \u201cvery slow.\u201d Tr. 328, 329. All of these reports were from physicians and therapists who had treated and examined Romani.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Finally, the ALJ acknowledged that an individual\u2019s symptoms, including pain, \u201ccan play a significant role in determining her residual functional capacity,\u201d but rejected Romani\u2019s allegations of pain as \u201cunsupported by objective medical evidence\u201d and \u201calso inconsistent with the weight of the nonmedical evidence and ... not, therefore, entirely credible.\u201d Tr. 19, 20. We have stated that the standard as to subjective pain requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">(1) that subjective complaints of pain be seriously considered, even where not fully confirmed by objective medical evidence; (2) that subjective pain \u201cmay support a claim for disability benefits,\u201d and \u201cmay be disabling\u201d; (3) that where such complaints are supported by medical evidence, they should be given great weight; and (4) that where a claimant\u2019s testimony as to pain is reasonably supported by medical evidence, the ALJ may not discount claimant\u2019s pain without contrary medical evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-11\"><em>Green v. Schweiker, </em>749 F.2d 1066, 1068 (3d Cir.1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">Romani testified at the hearing that she had constant pain, and she consistently reported such pain during her medical and therapeutic visits. Tr. 44, 287.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. My-lod testified that the medical record supported Romani\u2019s complaints of pain, including back, neck, and joint pain. Tr. 58. Further, Dr. Vekhnis found that Romani \u201chas a history of sacral fracture and this gives her a significant amount of pain.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Tr. 329. Even the ALJ points to MRIs performed in November 1988 and August 1989, that \u201cyielded abnormal findings suggestive of a thecal sac meningocele or ara-chnoidal cyst in the distal end of the sacrum\u201d and \u201celectrodiagnostic testing done in June 1990 [that] was consistent with bilateral sacral radiculopathy.\u201d Tr. 17. This evidence of a spinal cyst and its connection to the reported constant pain was not adequately explained by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">For the reasons above, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence and will REVERSE the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Romani\u2019s claim and REMAND to the District Court with directions to remand to the Commissioner for additional proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\">. For instance, Dr. Collins stated that she could occasionally lift 20 pounds and frequently lift 10. Tr. 123. Dr. Chungloy ordered her to refrain from lifting 25 pounds, but was focused on her recovery from surgery to repair an umbilical hernia, not on her back pain. Tr. 230-31. Dr. Mylod gave the same opinion, Tr. 62, presumably based on his review of these reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-7\">. The ALJ\u2019s statement that Romani had not \"even complained of, or been actively treated for, back pain since 1991,\u201d Tr. 17, is inaccurate. In 1996, Dr. Bahrt recorded Rosari\u2019s complaint of pain, including lower back pain, that had \"reached a point where she can hardly function at all.\u201d Tr. 307. That same year, Romani's complaint of back pain is recorded in a psychological evaluation. Tr. 295. Also, in 1992, Dr. Bahrt had recorded \"a great deal of pain in the spinal area\u201d including the lower back. Tr. 310, 311.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
