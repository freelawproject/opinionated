Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Mandamus relief is only available when there are no other means by which the relief sought could be granted, <em>see In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987), and it may not be used as a substitute for appeal. <em>In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). The party seeking mandamus relief carries the heavy burden of showing that he has \u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief he desires\u201d and that his right to such relief is clear and indisputable. <em>Allied Chem. Carp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). Gore has not made such a showing. Accordingly, although we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>grant Gore\u2019s request to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny his petition for a writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
