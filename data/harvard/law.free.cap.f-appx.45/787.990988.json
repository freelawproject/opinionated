We find that we lack jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, and we dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The parties are familiar with the facts and the procedural history of the case. Therefore, we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">A writ of habeas corpus must \u201cbe directed to the person having custody of the person detained.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243; <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 2242 (requiring that application for writ must allege \u201cthe name of the person who has custody over [the applicant] and by virtue of what claim or authority, if known.\u201d). We lack personam jurisdiction over the custodian and, therefore, cannot grant relief if the petition fails to name the detainee\u2019s custodian as the respondent. <em>See Braden v. 30th Jud. Cir. Ct., </em>410 U.S. 484, 494-95, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">We have held that the \u201cproper respondent in a federal habeas corpus petition is the petitioner\u2019s \u2018immediate custodian.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brittingham v. United States, </em>982 F.2d 378, 379 (9th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Demjanjuk v. Meese, </em>784 F.2d 1114, 1115 (D.C.Cir.1986)). \u201cA custodian \u2018is the person having a day-to-day control over the prisoner. That person is the only one who can produce \u2018the body\u2019 of the petitioner.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Guerra v. Meese, </em>786 F.2d 414, 416 (D.C.Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Aristica-Rodriguez\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus named the INS as the respondent. However, the INS is not Ar-istica-Rodriguez\u2019s \u201cimmediate custodian.\u201d The INS is a governmental agency, not a \u201cperson\u201d to whom we could direct an order to release Aristica-Rodriguez\u2019s \u201cbody\u201d from detention. <em>See id. </em>Rather, Aristica-Rodriguez\u2019s immediate custodian is the warden of the jail at which he is being held. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">Aristica-Rodriguez is in custody in the Kern County Jail, a California State facility, which has arranged with the INS for the custody of alien detainees. Because the warden of that jail is not the named respondent, we lack jurisdiction to entertain Aristica-Rodriguez\u2019s appeal. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s decision and remand with instructions to dismiss the habeas petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b836-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
