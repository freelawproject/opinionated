On appeal, LeBlanc raises a Fifth Amendment challenge to the admission of his out-of-court statements, and he challenges the exclusion of his proffered expert testimony regarding the susceptibility of children to coercive or suggestive interviewing techniques. We find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-17\">\n<em>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-18\">The events giving rise to the charge occurred on an evening when the defendant was at home alone with his six-year-old step-daughter, S.S, and his young son. His wife, the children\u2019s mother, was away helping a neighbor prepare for a party at a nearby residence. According to LeBlanc\u2019s testimony on direct examination, he was sitting on the couch watching a pornographic movie when S.S. entered the room. LeBlanc testified that he put cartoons on the television for her and reclined on the couch. As S.S. sat watching cartoons at the bottom of the couch between LeBlanc\u2019s legs, he said, he had thoughts of \u201chaving her give me oral sex.\u201d He admitted having had such thoughts once before, when S.S. was in the shower with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-19\">Meanwhile, LeBlanc\u2019s wife, Sonja, realized that she had forgotten to bring a pan from home and asked her neighbor, Heather Bowen, to retrieve it. Bowen drove to the LeBlanc residence and walked up to the back door. Through the glass door, Bowen looked into the house and saw LeBlanc lying on the couch with S.S. \u201clay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ing on top of him,\u201d with her \u201chead down in his genital area.\u201d Bowen testified that she believed that LeBlane was \u201cmolesting\u201d S.S. She further testified that once Le-Blanc became aware of her presence, he quickly \u201cjumped up off the couch\u201d and adjusted his pants. After stepping into the house, Bowen told LeBlane that she was there to pick up a pan and observed that he was acting \u201c[njervous and scared.\u201d According to Bowen, LeBlane gave her the pan, and asked her as she was leaving \u201cnot to say anything to anybody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">After leaving the LeBlane residence, Bowen returned to the party, but she did not tell Sonja what she had seen. However, after talking with a friend on the following Monday, Bowen reported the incident to Child Protective Services, a Michigan state agency. Ultimately, the matter was referred to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for investigation. After interviewing Bowen, BIA investigator Levi Carrick, along with Captain Ben Carrick of the Bay Mills Indian Community police department, decided to interview S.S. and her mother. According to Investigator Carrick, S.S. \u201cconfirm[ed]\u201d the allegations of sexual abuse to the investigators.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">As a result, Carrick decided to question LeBlane. Carrick testified that he was preparing to leave the tribal police department\u2019s parking lot to drive to LeBlanc\u2019s residence, when a ear pulled into the lot and the driver motioned to Carrick to return. As Carrick turned his car around, a second car pulled into the lot. The driver of the first car was Sonja LeBlane, and the driver of the second car was Daniel Le-Blanc. Daniel was attempting to talk to his wife, who was rebuffing his attempts. Carrick described the scene in the police department parking lot as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">I stepped between the vehicles and asked what the problem was, what\u2019s going on. Dan said he just wanted to explain everything to her, but she wouldn\u2019t talk to him. I asked if he would explain it to me, and he said no, not until \u2014 unless she talks to me. I asked her if she would talk to him after we were \u2014 after we were done if he would explain it to me. She said she would. Dan agreed to that, and I offered to go inside the police department and discuss it with [him].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">LeBlane followed Investigator Carrick into a small interviewing room in the police station. Immediately after sitting down, LeBlane told Carrick that he wanted to \u201cexplain everything.\u201d According to Car-rick, LeBlane told him that he wanted to explain to Sonja his feelings about his step-daughter and said, \u201cFriday night I was gonna try my daughter. I was gonna have her give me oral sex but it didn\u2019t get that far.\u201d Carrick recounted to the jury LeBlane\u2019s explanation of what happened the preceding Friday evening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">He said that he was watching a pornographic movie and his daughter walked in, so he turned it off. He was sitting on the couch. He said that he \u2014 he laid down and exposed himself. He said he was already erect. He asked his daughter if she wanted to suck him, and she didn\u2019t say nothing, so he thought she did. He told her, [c]ome here. She laid on top of him, and he said that she put her hand on his penis and put her mouth on the \u2014 on his penis, and the penis went in her mouth just a little ways, just past the teeth, he explained. He said just the tip was in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">And then Heather came to the door, so he pushed her off and jumped up. Heather was after a pan, he said, and he told her that nothing happened. You\u2019re not gonna tell anybody, are you? She said, [d]on\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t say nothing. Then she left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>LeBlanc further explained to the investigator that he had been having sexual thoughts about his step-daughter ever since his wife had told him that she had been sexually abused as a child. The interview lasted about 35-40 minutes. Afterward, Investigator Carriek asked LeBlanc if he would make a written statement regarding the events of Friday evening, explaining \u201cthat we generally start it that no promises or threats or coercion or any type of force was used against you to make the statement.\u201d LeBlanc agreed, and Carriek left him alone for 20-25 minutes to prepare the written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The following is LeBlanc\u2019s signed written statement, which was introduced at trial and read to the jury by Investigator Carriek:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">I, Daniel LeBlanc, make this statement. There were no promises or threats given to me. This is a voluntary statement. On Friday night, June 2, I had thought of having my daughter give me oral sex after watching a porno. I know it was wrong, and if I could turn back time, I would. Heather entered my house when I was attempting this incident and said that she didn\u2019t see anything, but I knew she did and wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone. I knew if I didn\u2019t tell Sonja, that she would \u2014 that she would find out so how [sic], but over the weekend I just couldn\u2019t build up enough courage to tell her. I told [S.S.] not to tell her mom because I would tell her because it was wrong and [S.S.] would not be in trouble ... but Daddy would be. The only time before ... was in the shower when I attempted to and [S.S.] saw and was surprised, so I told her to get dressed because I was having these feelings. Before this occurred I was told a story about Sonja about what happened to her, but I don\u2019t ... what went through my mind. If I make things right I willing cooperate in any way possible. I love my kids very much and my wife. If I lose them, what use of living. I cannot go on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">After LeBlanc completed the statement, Officer Baragwanth attempted to find Sonja, but she had already left in her car. The officers asked LeBlanc if he had anywhere else to go, but LeBlanc expressed a desire to return home. Carriek drove Le-Blanc back to his house and \u201casked him not to have any kind of contact with Sonja or the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Later that evening, the tribal police department received a phone call regarding a problem at the LeBlanc residence. Officer Donnay went to the house and found a distraught LeBlanc, who asked for his mother and aunt. LeBlanc\u2019s mother arrived and performed a \u201cspiritual cleansing\u201d with her son. Officer Donnay, still present at the residence, testified at trial that he overheard LeBlanc tell his mother that \u201che made a big mistake on Friday\u201d and also recount details of the incident with S.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">At trial, six-year-old S.S. testified to the circumstances under which she had been led into committing fellatio on the defendant. In response, the defense offered as an expert witness psychologist Terrence Campbell, Ph.D., who proposed to testify regarding \u201cthe questioning of [S.S.] and the reliability of her testimony.\u201d The government objected and, after a <em>Daubert </em>hearing, the district court disallowed the expert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Following the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty, the district court entered judgment on the verdict and sentenced LeBlanc to 138 months\u2019 imprisonment. He now appeals his conviction, challenging the admissibility of his inculpatory statements and the exclusion of his proffered expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFL\">A. The Motion To Suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">LeBlanc argues on appeal that his written and oral confessions to Investigator Carrick were subject to exclusion under the Fifth Amendment because Investigator Carrick\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d to LeBlanc that he could speak with his wife if he spoke first with investigators \u201cwas sufficient to overbear, and did overbear, his will.\u201d We conclude that this claim must fail, not only because it is deficient on its merits, but also because LeBlanc has waived his right to present this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Prior to trial, LeBlanc filed a motion to suppress his various statements to law enforcement officers, contending that he had not been given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings pri- or to interrogation. After a suppression hearing at which LeBlanc and Investigator Carrick both testified, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation to the district court concluding that Le-Blanc\u2019s statements were not made in a custodial setting and that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were, therefore, not required. After LeBlanc failed to file any objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, the district court adopted the report and denied the motion to suppress. Under the law of this circuit, a party failing to file objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s report waives appellate review, so long as the party receives proper notice of this consequence. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>638 F.2d 947, 949-50 (6th Cir.1981). Here, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation included a clear warning to the parties that objections to the conclusions therein were due to be filed within ten days of receipt of the report, and that \u201c[flailure to file timely objections constitutes a waiver of any further right to appeal of those issues or claims addressed or resolved as a result of the Report and Recommendation.\u201d Le-Blanc failed to file any objections, thus waiving his right to appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Moreover, the specific issue raised on appeal, that the statements were the product of coercion, was not presented to the district court and thus is not subject to review on appeal. <em>See Chandler v. Jones, </em>813 F.2d 773, 777 (6th Cir.1987) (\u201cIt is a well-established principle of appellate review that appellate courts do not address claims not properly presented below.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Even if the claim had been properly preserved, there is simply no factual support for it in the record before us. In order to show that a confession was involuntary, the defendant must establish that: \u201c(1) the police activity was objectively coercive; (2) the coercion in question was sufficient to overbear defendant\u2019s will; and (3) defendant\u2019s will was in fact, overborne as a result of the coercive police activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Rigsby, </em>943 F.2d 631, 635 (6th Cir.1991). Here, the only conduct alleged to be coercive is Investigator Carrick\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d to LeBlanc that he could speak with his wife after he spoke with Carrick. However, the facts as the magistrate judge found them were that \u201cInvestigator Carrick, after speaking with defendant\u2019s wife, told defendant that his wife would be willing to talk to defendant after defendant spoke with Carrick.\u201d Based upon the magistrate judge\u2019s finding, which is supported by Carrick\u2019s testimony, it appears that Carrick did nothing more than pass along to LeBlanc an apparent promise made by his wife, not a promise from the police. LeBlanc emphasizes his overwrought \u201cmental state\u201d at the time of the interview, arguing that because of his \u201cdesperate state of mind,\u201d Carrick\u2019s actions must be deemed coercive. The Supreme Court has held, however, that \u201cwhile mental condition is surely relevant to an individual\u2019s susceptibility to police coercion, mere examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the confessant\u2019s state of mind can never conclude the due process inquiry.\u201d <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 165, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986). <em>See also United States v. Newman, </em>889 F.2d 88 (6th Cir.1989) (\u201cEvidence that a defendant suffered, at the relevant time, from a condition or deficiency that impaired his cognitive or volitional capacity is never, by itself, sufficient to warrant the conclusion that his confession was involuntary for purposes of due process; some element of police coercion is always necessary.\u201d). According to Carrrick\u2019s testimony, his encounter with LeBlanc lasted about 40 minutes, during which LeBlanc appeared to be sober and did not manifest any confusion or lack of understanding. Carrick further affirmed that he did not make any promises to LeBlanc or use any \u201ctricks or deceit\u201d against him. Although it is evident that LeBlanc was in a state of mental and emotional distress at the time, we conclude that, under the totality of the circumstances, Investigator Carrick\u2019s actions plainly did not amount to objectively coercive police activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">B. Exclusion of the Defendant\u2019s Expert Witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The defense proffered the testimony of Terence Campbell, described as a psychologist with a Ph.D. in human development and \u201ca person educated in child interviewing techniques\u201d who could testify regarding the \u201csuggestibility of th[e] questioning techniques [used to question S.S.] as they may have provided [S.S.] with the appropriate answers or inappropriate answers in this matter.\u201d The district court held a hearing mid-trial to determine the admissibility of Dr. Campbell\u2019s testimony. At the hearing, Dr. Campbell himself offered the following overview of his proffered testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">I would testify regarding the appropriateness and related problems involved in the different interview procedures that [S.S.] underwent. I would specifically be talking about how accurately interviewers in fact can recall events from an interview. Moreover, I would be testifying regarding the manner in which the memories of young children the age of [S.S.] can readily become distorted and contaminated because of unintentional inadvertent adult influence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Dr. Campbell\u2019s direct examination at the admissibility hearing was focused almost exclusively upon the existence of a handful of published articles upon which he relied to support his theories. According to Dr. Campbell, those articles focused principally upon two areas: (1) the accuracy of an interviewer\u2019s report of an interview with a child, and (2) issues concerning children\u2019s memory and suggestibility. On cross-examination, Dr. Campbell admitted that he had not participated in any research relating to the area of his proffered testimony and that none of the studies upon which he relied involved the study of the memory and suggestibility of sexually abused children.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">After the hearing, the district court ruled that Dr. Campbell would not be permitted to testify. According to the district court, Dr. Campbell\u2019s proposed testimony was deficient because: (1) his theories were not generally accepted in the psychological community; (2) his theories were based on a \u201csoft science\u201d that is \u201cnot repeatable\u201d and in which \u201cerror is ... rampant\u201d; (3) he had done no research in the area of his testimony; (4) he \u201c[wa]s clearly an advocate\u201d; and (5) the subject of his testimony invaded the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">The defendant contends that the district court\u2019s exclusion of his proffered expert witness was improper and denied him of a fair trial. We review a district court\u2019s evi-dentiary rulings, including those regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the admission or exclusion of expert testimony, for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Federal Rule of Evidence 702, which governs the testimony of experts, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ae--dedup-0\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An5\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), that Rule 702 places upon trial judges an obligation to ensure \u201cthat an expert\u2019s testimony rests upon a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\u201d The Court suggested several factors that trial courts may consider in evaluating the admissibility of expert testimony: (1) whether a theory or technique has been or can be tested; (2) whether the technique has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error; and (4) whether the technique has been accepted by the \u201crelevant scientific community,\u201d or \u201chas been able to attract only minimal support within the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593-94. In <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 147, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999), the Supreme Court explained that the \u201cbasic gatekeeping obligation\u201d as explained by the Court in <em>DaubeH </em>applies not just to \u201cscientific\u201d testimony, but to \u201call expert testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Of course, the factors suggested in <em>Dau-beH </em>are not to be applied mechanically; rather, district courts are accorded wide latitude in determining the reliability of expert testimony. <em>See Gross v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>272 F.3d 333, 339 (6th Cir.2001) (\u201c[Tjhough helpful, the <em>DaubeH </em>factors are not dispositive in every case.\u201d). Although the district court here did not expressly refer to <em>DaubeH </em>in evaluating Campbell\u2019s proffered testimony, it is clear that the court relied upon at least some of the <em>DaubeH </em>factors in reaching its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s ruling excluding Dr. Campbell\u2019s testimony, we conclude that several of the reasons given for exclusion were questionable. Without engaging in extended analysis, we note that the proposed testimony was not subject to exclusion either on the basis that the theories employed by Dr. Campbell have not been generally accepted in the relevant scientific community or because they were based on \u201csoft science\u201d that could not be tested.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Nevertheless, although Dr. Campbell\u2019s testimony regarding child suggestibility did suffer from at least one serious flaw that justified keeping it from the jury. Obviously, expert testimony is subject to the same relevancy constraints as all other kinds of evidence. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 402. Rule 702 requires that the testimony \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d The question of relevance, or \u201cfit,\u201d is a preliminary question for the trial judge. The proponent of expert testimony must establish its admissibility by a preponderance of proof. <em>See Nelson v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co., </em>243 F.3d 244, 251 (6th Cir.2001). This preliminary showing that the proffered expert testimony is \u201csufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute,\u201d is a necessary precondition to admissibility. <em>United States v. Downing, </em>753 F.2d 1224, 1242 (3d Cir.1985) (cited in <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 591). <em>See also State v. Sargent, </em>144 N.H. 103, 738 A.2d 351, 354 (N.H.1999) (holding that proper interview techniques used to interview child sexual abuse victims is appropriate subject of expert testimony, but that <em>\u201c[tjhere must be a particularized showing that improper interview techniques were used ... before a party can introduce expert testimony\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Here, as the government notes, LeBlanc failed entirely to demonstrate the \u201cfit\u201d between Dr. Campbell\u2019s proffered testimony and any fact at issue in this case. At no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>time during the <em>Daubert </em>hearing did Campbell point to a single instance in which S.S. was supposedly subjected to allegedly coercive or suggestive questioning techniques. This is so in spite of the fact that the defense had every opportunity to cross-examine the police investigator who initially interviewed S.S., as well as the social worker who conducted her direct examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, although Dr. Campbell stated that he also wished to provide testimony regarding the accuracy of an <em>interviewer\u2019s </em>report of an interview with a child, the government did not introduce any evidence of interviews with S.S. through an interviewer-witness. Finally, it is clear from the child\u2019s testimony at trial that she was able to recount what occurred on the evening in question without undue prompting.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">At the outset of its remarks at the close of the hearing, the district court observed that \u201c[tjhere appears to be nothing by way of proffer to indicate that in fact the specific evidence in this case is to be given an opinion concerning.\u201d We agree and observe that without any showing whatsoever that improper techniques were used with <em>this witness, </em>Dr. Campbell\u2019s testimony would have presented the jury with an abstract theory having the potential to presumptively malign the testimony of S.S. as a product of coercion in the absence of any evidence that such was the case. The fact that LeBlanc failed to lay an adequate foundation for Dr. Cambpell\u2019s testimony is a sufficient basis on which to conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding him. It is therefore unnecessary to evaluate in detail the district court\u2019s remaining problems with the proffered testimony. However, a review of the transcript shows that the defense\u2019s abbreviated effort to establish Dr. Campbell\u2019s expertise in this area was less than compelling, and it is not surprising that the district court was not convinced that Dr. Campbell\u2019s opinions were adequately supported by his expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Finally, it should be noted that, even if the defense had been able to lay an adequate foundation and the exclusion of Dr. Campbell did amount to error, the error would have to be considered harmless, given the powerful evidence of LeBlanc\u2019s guilt \u2014 specifically, LeBlanc\u2019s out-of-court confessions \u2014 that was wholly unrelated to the <em>child\u2019s </em>recollection of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The district court did not commit plain error in failing to suppress, <em>sua sponte, </em>LeBlanc\u2019s inculpatory statements to law enforcement officers. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal, the evidence does not show that the confessions resulted from objectively coercive police conduct. In addition, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the defendant\u2019s proffered expert testimony regarding coercive or suggestive interviewing techniques, given that the defense failed to make a foundational showing of the relevance of such testimony to this case. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\">. Indeed, a review of a significant body of research on this subject led the New Jersey to Supreme Court to conclude that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">[A] sufficient consensus exists within the academic, professional, and law enforcement communities, confirmed in varying degrees by courts, to warrant the conclusion that the use of coercive or highly suggestive interrogation techniques can create a significant risk that the interrogation itself will distort the child\u2019s recollection of events, thereby undermining the reliability of the statements and subsequent testimony concerning such events.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-12\"><em>State v. Michaels, </em>136 N.J. 299, 642 A.2d 1372, 1379 (N.J.1994). <em>See id. </em>at 1384 (\"Experts may ... be called to aid the jury by explaining the coercive or suggestive propensities of the interviewing techniques employed.\u201d). This conclusion finds support in the legal academic literature. <em>See </em>Dana D. Anderson, <em>Assessing the Reliability of Child Testimony in Sexual Abuse Cases, </em>69 S. Cal. L.Rev. 2117, 2146 (1996) (\"The consensus in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the social-science literature indicates that, depending on the procedures used, children can be suggestible, and coercive interviewing techniques can render their accounts of abuse unreliable.\u201d); Lisa R. Askowitz &amp; Michael H. Graham, <em>The Reliability of Expert Psychological Testimony in Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, </em>15 Cardozo L.Rev. 2027 (1994) (\u201cA report published in 1991 by the American Psychological Association, titled The Suggestibility of Children\u2019s Recollections ... suggests that adults can manipulate young children into making false accusations.\u201d); Diana Younts, <em>Evaluating and Admitting Expert Opinion Testimony in Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, </em>41 Duke L.J. 691, 697 (1991) (\"[C]hilden can be influenced by adults to produce false allegations \u2014 either through an adult's misinterpretation of what a child has said, hysteria about the possibility of abuse, or through maliciousness on the part of the adult. Some of the studies examining children's suggestibility have found children to be prone to conforming their stories to the beliefs of the questioning adult.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The degree of acceptance attained by this theory is borne out in the case law evaluating the admission of expert testimony in this area. As the Supreme Court of Wisconsin observed seven years ago, \u201c[m]any jurisdictions ... recognize the utility of expert testimony on the suggestive interview technique used with a young child and how suggestive techniques can shape a young child witness's answers.\u201d <em>State v. Kirschbaum, </em>195 Wis.2d 11, 535 N.W.2d 462, 466 (Wis.App.1995) (citing cases). The Eighth Circuit has also acknowledged the potential usefulness of such testimony, but has cautioned that experts cannot \"opine as to a child witness's credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Rouse, </em>111 F.3d 561, 571 (8th Cir.1997). In sum, the district court's decision to exclude Dr. Campbell\u2019s proffered testimony is not properly grounded on a conclusion that his theory lacked \"general acceptance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The district court also appeared to place too much weight on the notion that Dr. Campbell\u2019s proffered testimony on child suggestibility was unreliable because it was based upon what the district court called, \"soft science.\u201d Properly qualified experts in so-called \"soft sciences,\u201d such as psychology and economics, regularly provide testimony that is helpful to juries in evaluating issues. The commentary to Rule 702 provides that, \"[sjome types of expert testimony will be more objectively verifiable, and subject to the expectations of falsifiability, peer review, and publication than others. Some types of expert testimony will not rely on anything like a scientific method, and so will have to be evaluated by reference to other standard principles attendant to the particular area of expertise.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 702 advisory committee\u2019s note. So long as the proponent of such testimony can demonstrate that it is relevant and reliable, it should not be excluded on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\">. Dr. Campbell stated at the hearing, \"Of course, I don't know exactly how [S.S.] was interviewed, for example, on June 6; and I don\u2019t know exactly how she was interviewed by Ms. Waters on October 9, October 10, and October 16. And the problem is no one else knows either.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
