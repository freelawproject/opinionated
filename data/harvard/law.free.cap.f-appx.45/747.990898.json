Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 12940. She challenges a jury instruction relating to the employer\u2019s duty in reaching a reasonable accommodation of Fitz\u2019s disability. RGIS contends that Fitz waived the instructional issue. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-23\">Fitz waived her challenge to the district court\u2019s rejection of her proposed instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>tion to the jury when her attorney failed to make an adequate objection. Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states: \u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\u201d In civil eases, failure to object to an instruction bars a challenge to that instruction on appeal. <em>Voohries-Larson v. Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>241 F.3d 707, 713-14 (9th Cir.2001) (explaining that \u201cthere is no \u2018plain error\u2019 exception in civil cases in this circuit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Fitz contends that the objection was adequately preserved, and alternatively argues that the trial court erred when it failed to preserve the record of her objection. We are not persuaded. The purpose of Rule 51 is to alert the district court that an instruction is defective. <em>Id. </em>at 713. The objection must have been \u201csufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the alleged error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Palmer v. Hoffman, </em>318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943)). Underpinning this requirement of specificity is the need to \u201cbring possible errors to light while there is still time to correct them without entailing the cost, delay and expenditure of judicial resources occasioned by retrials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bertrand v. S. Pac. Co., </em>282 F.2d 569, 572 (9th Cir.1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The record reflects that Fitz objected to the absence of an instruction on the interactive process during a conference with the district court off the record. Subsequent proceedings, however, negated Fitz\u2019s earlier objection. After the off-the-record discussions, the district court finalized the jury instructions on the record. The judge began by stating, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go back through them so you can put your objections on the record <em>and make such suggestions as you like, </em>and we\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d When, during the ensuring proceeding, the district court reached Fitz\u2019s proposed interactive process instruction, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">THE COURT: The next one is the interactive process, and I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">MR. BOOTH (counsel for Fitz): You sort of scratched that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-10\">THE COURT: We scratched that one. So that one comes out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">The unembellished statement of Fitz\u2019s counsel that the district court \u201csort of scratched that\u201d lacks any hint of the contention Fitz now raises on appeal. <em>See Bertrand, </em>282 F.2d at 572 (\u201cOnly by broadest inference does the remark even relate to the objection to the instruction now being urged.\u201d). The district court\u2019s response, and its order denying the motion for a new trial stating that Fitz failed to object to the instruction, reflect that the judge did not perceive her counsel\u2019s remark as an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">We agree with the district court that Fitz waived any objection by her conduct during the final settlement of the instructions on the record. Although Fitz may have interposed a valid objection earlier, she abandoned it during the later proceeding. Moreover, because the subsequent proceeding represented a bona fide opportunity for Fitz to bring any error to light, it would not have been a mere formality for Fitz to have renewed her objection. <em>Voohries-Larson, </em>241 F.3d at 713. The district court gave Fitz the opportunity to object to the instructions on the record and to \u201cmake such suggestions as you like.\u201d The court stated that unless it heard an objection, it would assume that the instructions were acceptable. Despite the district court\u2019s clear directive, Fitz\u2019s counsel did not renew a specific objection. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number><em>Id. </em>Fitz therefore waived any objection to the jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b795-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
