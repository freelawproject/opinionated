Vizcarrondo was caught red handed by an FBI agent, admitted his participation in the frauds, and implicated Dangervil and two others. He formed a written cooperation agreement with the government wherein, if satisfied with his \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d and compliance with other obligations, the government promised to file a motion for a downward sentencing departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-23\">At sentencing, the court granted a downward departure of six months pursuant to the government\u2019s motion. Vizcar-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>rondo contends that the sentence nonetheless violates due process \u2014 not on grounds of harshness, but because, he says, the punishment reflects the sentencing judge\u2019s misunderstanding of a key fact. To wit: whether a protective order against Vizcar-rondo for domestic violence, mentioned in the Pre-Sentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), was in place at the time of sentencing. The PSR states that the child-abuse petition on which the protective order was premised had been dismissed after Vizcarrondo\u2019s ex-girlfriend missed a scheduled hearing. See PSR H 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 strictly limits appellate review of a sentencing judge\u2019s decisions. <em>See United States v. Soliman, </em>889 F.2d 441, 443 (2d Cir.1989). Generally, only the government may appeal a sentencing judge\u2019s decision to depart downward from the Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>An exception to this rule obtains, however, where the sentence was imposed in violation of law. <em>Id.,citing </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3742(a)(1), (b)(1). A sentence based on the judge\u2019s misapprehension of a relevant fact violates due process, and hence gives this Court jurisdiction to hear a defendant\u2019s downward-departure appeal. <em>See United States v. McDavid, </em>41 F.3d 841, 843-44 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Having carefully reviewed the record in the instant case, we are confident that no such mistake was made here. Midway through the proceedings, the sentencing judge asked some clarifying questions about whether a protective order was in place against Vizcarrondo. These questions did not yield much clarity, but there is no evidence that, in sentencing Vizear-rando, the District Court relied on any mistaken belief about the protective order. It is evident from the record that the sentencing judge, on account of the seriousness of Vizcarrondo\u2019s crime and the financial losses suffered by the defrauded investors, simply chose not to be as lenient as Vizcarrondo had hoped she would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We have considered Vizcarrondo\u2019s arguments and find them meritless. Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
