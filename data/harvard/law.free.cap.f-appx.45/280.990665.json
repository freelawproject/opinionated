Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances, and Johnson\u2019s petition does not establish extraordinary circumstances warranting mandamus relief. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Moreover, our review of the district court\u2019s docket sheet discloses that there has been significant action in this case in the past six months, and therefore, there has been no undue delay in the consideration of Johnson\u2019s motion. Accordingly, we deny Johnson\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pau-peris and his motion for a writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
