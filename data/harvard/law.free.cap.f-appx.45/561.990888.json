On appeal, Hayslett urges that the District Court erred when it denied his motion to suppress <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the District Court further erred when it enhanced his offense level by four levels because his possession of the firearm was \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)(2000). We find no error in the record before us and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-22\">We review the District Court\u2019s finding of facts for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo for both issues. <em>See United States v. Kenney, </em>283 F.3d 934, 936 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review for application of sentencing guidelines); <em>United States v. Wells, </em>223 F.3d 835, 838 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of <em>review for </em>motion <em>to </em>suppress). In the first instance, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s denial of Hayslett\u2019s motion to suppress. The initial stop of the vehicle in which Hayslett was riding was lawful because the driver\u2019s failure to stop at a stop sign created sufficient probable cause for the police to stop the vehicle. <em>See United States v. Foley, </em>206 F.3d 802, 805 (8th Cir.2000). Hayslett\u2019s statement upon exiting the car that he had a gun created sufficient suspicion that he was armed to satisfy <em>Terry v. </em>Ohio\u2019s requirements for the officer\u2019s subsequent search. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (holding that the Fourth Amendment \u201cpermit\u00eds] a reasonable search for weapons for the protection of the police officer where he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime\u201d). Therefore, the District Court properly denied his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-23\">We also find no error in the four-level enhancement of Hayslett\u2019s offense based on his possession of the firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2000). There is no question that Hayslett\u2019s possession of even a small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>amount of crack cocaine was a felony under Missouri Law. <em>See </em>Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 195.202 (2000). Here, Hayslett claims not that he did not \u201cuse[] or possess[]\u201d the firearm, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), but rather that his possession of it was merely for his own protection and was not \u201cin connection with,\u201d and was actually independent of, his drug possession. In <em>United States v. Regans, </em>125 F.3d 685 (8th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1065, 118 S.Ct. 1398, 140 L.Ed.2d 656 (1998), we upheld a similar enhancement and observed that \u201cwhen a drug user chooses to carry his illegal drugs out into public with a firearm, there are many ways in which the weapon can facilitate the drug offense and dangerously embolden the offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687. As in <em>Regans, </em>in this case, it was not \u201cclearly improbable that\u201d Hayslett\u2019s possession of the weapon facilitated, or had the potential to facilitate, his possession of the narcotics. <em>See id. </em>at 687 (quoting U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2D1.1, Application Note 3 (1997)). Therefore, there was no error in the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">There being no merit to the appeal, we accordingly affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-19\">. The Honorable Howard F. Sachs, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Sarah W. Hays, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
