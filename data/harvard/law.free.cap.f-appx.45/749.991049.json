We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, because Hamade was not adjudged removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) or any provision dependent upon a prior conviction. \u201c[T]he INS\u2019 mere allegation that a crime was committed is insufficient to bar appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, </em>225 F.3d 1084, 1090 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-24\">Having reviewed the record, and in light of the Board\u2019s determination that Hamade complied with all procedural requirements, we hold that the Board abused its discretion in refusing to reopen the case to consider the material evidence he presented. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(1); <em>Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222 (9th Cir.2002) (standard of review). We therefore remand with a direction to reopen the case to consider the new evidence. In light of this determination, we need not address the remaining issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-25\">PETITION GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b797-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-28\">.
