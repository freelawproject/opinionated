The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied Rush\u2019s claims, finding that she was not \u201cdisabled\u201d as defined by the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-17\">The District Court affirmed, holding that \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d supported the ALJ\u2019s denial of Rush\u2019s claim. Rush appeals from the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner of Social Security.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-18\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and we have jurisdiction on appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our standard of review requires us to determine whether there the ALJ\u2019s determination was based on \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Pe-rales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-19\">The ALJ denied Rush\u2019s application at step five of the sequential evaluation process, finding that she retained the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform the physical exertion requirements of light work with certain specified restrictions and that jobs existed in the national economy which she was able to perform. The ALJ\u2019s decision regarding her RFC was based in part upon the objective medical evidence, including the medical records of Rush\u2019s treating physicians, and in part upon the fact that Rush continued to maintain a full range of daily living activities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>In reaching her conclusion, the ALJ specifically rejected Rush\u2019s subjective complaints due to conflicts with objective medical evidence. Finally, the ALJ relied on the vocational expert\u2019s opinion that based on Rush\u2019s RFC, age, education, and past work, a significant number of jobs existed in both the regional and national economies.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Rush first claims that the ALJ failed to adequately consider the Medical Listings at step three of the sequential process. We decline to address this issue, however, as Rush raises it for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Rush raises three additional arguments considered by the District Court: (1) the ALJ erred in finding that Rush\u2019s RFC relegated her to a range of light rather than sedentary work, (2) the ALJ did not properly evaluate the medical evidence of record, and (3) the, ALJ did not properly evaluate Rush\u2019s credibility. After a thorough review of the record, and giving due consideration to the briefs filed in this appeal, we believe that the ALJ carefully considered the evidence in this case and his denial of her claim was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">We do agree with Rush that the range of work the ALJ concluded she was able to perform is more properly characterized as sedentary rather than light work as defined at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.967. Specifically, the ALJ determined that \u201cclaimant has the residual functional capacity to perform the exertional demands of light work, with the restrictions that she needs a sit-stand option, must not engage in any prolonged standing or walking, must not engage in continuous repetitive motions of her hands and wrists, and needs to elevate her legs.\u201d Based on this detailed RFC, and not a general ability to do \u201clight work,\u201d the ALJ determined that there were jobs existing in the national economy which she could perform. Rush adduced no medical evidence that any of her medical impairments rendered her unable to do the type of work the ALJ found her capable of. Therefore, whether her capacity was labeled as light or sedentary, the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion would remain the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Accordingly, we will AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
