We find that we lack jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, and we dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The parties are familiar with the facts and the procedural history of the case. Therefore, we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">A writ of habeas corpus must \u201cbe directed to the person having custody of the person detained.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243; <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 2242 (requiring that application for writ must allege \u201cthe name of the person who has custody over [the applicant] and by virtue of what claim or authority, if known.\u201d). We lack personam jurisdiction over the custodian and, therefore, cannot grant relief if the petition fails to name the detainee\u2019s custodian as the respondent. <em>See Braden v. 30th Jud. Cir. Ct., </em>410 U.S. 484, 494-95, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">We have held that the \u201cproper respondent in a federal habeas corpus petition is the petitioner\u2019s \u2018immediate custodian.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brittingham v. United States, </em>982 F.2d 378, 379 (9th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Demjanjuk v. Meese, </em>784 F.2d 1114, 1115 (D.C.Cir.1986)). \u201cA custodian \u2018is the person having a day-to-day control over the prisoner. That person is the only one who can produce \u2018the body\u2019 of the petitioner.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Guerra v. Meese, </em>786 F.2d 414, 416 (D.C.Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">Bermudez-Cardiel\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus named Sonchik as the respondent. However, Sonchik is not Ber-mudez-Cardiel\u2019s \u201cimmediate custodian\u201d because she is not the \u201cperson having a day-to-day control over the prisoner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, Bermudez-Cardiel\u2019s immediate custodian is the warden of the INS facility at which he is being held. <em>See id.; see also Yi v. Maugans, </em>24 F.3d 500, 507-08 (3d Cir.1994) (holding that the district director is not the proper respondent in an alien\u2019s habeas action because \u201cit is the warden that has day-to-day control over the prisoner and who can produce the actual body\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-17\">We recognize that Sonchik, as the district director, has the power to enforce an order of deportation against the alien. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.32 (2002). We also accept as true the INS\u2019 representation that Sonchik is responsible for overseeing the INS detention facilities within her district, including the facility in Florence, Arizona. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>ever, neither of these facts transforms her into Bermudez-Cardiel\u2019s custodian. <em>See Yi, </em>24 F.3d at 507 (\u201cThat the district director has the power to release the detainees does not alter our conclusion. Otherwise, the Attorney General of the United States could be considered the custodian of every alien and prisoner in custody because ultimately she controls the district directors and the prisons.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Bermudez-Cardiel is being held at the INS detention facility in Florence, Arizona. Because the warden of that facility is not the named respondent, we lack jurisdiction to entertain Sonchik\u2019s appeal. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s decision and remand with instructions to dismiss the habeas petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b834-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
