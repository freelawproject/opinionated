The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) Did Not Improperly Reject Any Medical Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Treating doctors other than Drs. Swank and Steffen concluded that Sheffer had neither multiple sclerosis nor any other disabling physical impairment. Because the ALJ was entitled to resolve this evidentiary conflict between conflicting opinions of equal weight, he did not need to provide specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting the Swank and Steffen opinions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even if the specific and legitimate reasons standard applied, the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting the Swank and Steffen opinions \u2014 such as the fact that their conclusions were based primarily on Sheffer\u2019s less-than-credible subjective complaints, and contradicted by a considerable amount of objective medical evidence \u2014 would have been specific and legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">The ALJ did not reject any of Dr. Gree-nough\u2019s opinions. The ALJ expressly accepted Dr. Greenough\u2019s \u201cmajor depression\u201d opinion and incorporated it into his analysis. The other statements to which Sheffer points are not opinions. They merely point out something this circuit\u2019s law has long recognized: that a person can be rendered disabled from the combined effect of physical and mental impairments that are not individually disabling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the ALJ recognized and complied with his obligation to consider the combination of Sheffer\u2019s mental and physical impairments. Indeed, the ALJ\u2019s decision and the record demonstrate that it was almost impossible to analyze Sheffer\u2019s physical and mental impairments in isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">II. The ALJ\u2019s Failure to Request Medical Source Statements Was Not Reversible Error</p>\n<p id=\"b693-15\">We need not determine whether the ALJ was required to request medical source statements from Sheffer\u2019s doctors because even if he was, his failure to do so would not have been reversible error. A number of the doctors \u2014 including Drs. Swank and Steffen \u2014 stated opinions regarding what work, if any, Sheffer could still perform. Medical source statements provide the same information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ALJ\u2019s failure to request medical source statements did not result in any prejudice or unfairness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b693-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-12\">. <em>See Thomas v.
