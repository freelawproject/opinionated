We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">Luna-Comacho contends that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence sixteen (16) levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), as an aggravated felon. Specifically, Luna-Comacho argues that his 1993 and 1997 Washington state felony convictions under its Uniform Controlled Substance Act, Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 69.50.401, do not qualify as aggravated felonies because the Washington statute encompasses non-aggravated felony conduct under the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq. Further, Luna-Comacho asserts that because the Washington statute is overly broad in this manner, the district court erred in examining probable cause statements to determine that the facts of these prior convictions still constituted aggravated felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">Luna-Comacho\u2019s contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Ibarra-Galindo, </em>206 F.3d 1337, 1341 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1102, 121 S.Ct. 837, 148 L.Ed.2d 718 (2001) (finding that a violation of Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 69.50.401 is punishable under the federal Controlled Substances Act, thus an aggravated felony for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)). Accordingly, it is unnecessary for this court to address LunaComacho\u2019s remaining arguments regarding the facts of his prior Washington State convictions and the district court\u2019s examination of probable cause statements. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (unless a statute reaches both aggravated and non-aggravated felony conduct, the sentencing court should generally look only to the fact of conviction and statutory definition of the prior offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
