Ritter appeals the district court\u2019s revocation of his supervised release. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s revocation of a term of supervised release for an abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Daniel, </em>209 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 999, 121 S.Ct. 499, 148 L.Ed.2d 469 (2000). We review de novo alleged due process and confrontation clause violations. <em>See United States v. Peterson, </em>140 F.3d 819, 821 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, </em>103 F.3d 767, 780 (9th Cir.1996). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Ritter contends the government violated his due process and confrontation clause rights, by failing to give him a copy of his probation officer\u2019s chronological notes either before or during his revocation hearing. This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Due process did not require the government to produce the probation officer\u2019s notes because the notes were not used as evidence against Ritter. <em>See United States v. Donaghe, </em>924 F.2d 940, 944 (9th Cir.1991). Further, lack of access to the notes did not compromise Ritter\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause to a \u201cfair and meaningful opportunity to refute or impeach the evidence against him.\u201d <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>984 F.2d 308, 310 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b658-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
