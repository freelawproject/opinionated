Meredith Corp., </em>991 F.2d 1072, 1074 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We find that the plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on both issues. First, the plaintiffs registration of the VIRGIN mark for retail stores selling, <em>inter alia, </em>computers and electronic apparatus, is sufficiently broad to cover the sale of telephones. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1076-77. Second, as a matter of law plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success on the issue of likely consumer confusion. Our conclusion is based on the strength of plaintiffs VIRGIN mark, both in terms of its arbitrariness as applied to telephones, and its fame; the similarity of defendants\u2019 mark to plaintiffs mark; the proximity of the products as between those declared in plaintiffs registration and those sold under the mark by the defendants; the likelihood at the time the defendants adopted the mark that the plaintiff would bridge the gap by selling the same wares; the evidence of actual confusion among consumers; and the lack of sophistication of consumers of the parties\u2019 products. <em>See Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Elecs. Corp., </em>287 F.2d 492, 495 (2d Cir.1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying the plaintiffs application for a preliminary injunction is vacated, and the matter is remanded with instructions to enter an order granting a preliminary injunction to the plaintiff. Opinion by this court to follow.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
