We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion a dismissal for discovery abuses, <em>Valley Eng\u2019rs Inc. v. Elec. Eng\u2019g Co., </em>158 F.3d 1051, 1052 (9th Cir.1998), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion. Barbieri\u2019s ongoing refusal to comply with his discovery obligations despite being ordered to do so demonstrates that he acted willfully and in bad faith. <em>See Hyde &amp; Drath v. Baker, </em>24 F.3d 1162, 1167 (9th Cir.1994). Rio Suites was prejudiced by Barbieri\u2019s discovery abuses, particularly his refusal to be deposed, in that Barbieri\u2019s discovery abuses deprived Rio Suites of access to information that it needed to adequately defend itself against Barbieri\u2019s claims. <em>See id. </em>at 1166-67. Less drastic alternatives to dismissal were not feasible because Barbieri continued his abusive tactics despite having filings stricken, being assessed monetary sanctions, and being warned that his behavior would lead to dismissal. <em>See id. </em>at 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">We do not reach any of Barbieri\u2019s contentions regarding the merits of his lawsuit because only the district court\u2019s dismissal of Barbieri\u2019s claims as a sanction for discovery abuses is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b701-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
