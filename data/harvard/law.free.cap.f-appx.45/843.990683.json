R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cases are therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Phoma Xayaso and Mesa Rith were convicted of armed bank robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a) and (d)) and carrying and using a firearm during a crime of violence (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)). In this appeal, they ask that their sentences be vacated and their cases be remanded for resentencing. Appellants were co-defendants and the resolution of their issues relies on identical facts and a common record. Accordingly, we have companioned these appeals for disposition. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(b)(2)(2). We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">On November 24, 1998, defendant Xaya-so and an individual named Sonasi Pouha robbed the Zion\u2019s First National Bank in Magna, Utah. Both robbers were masked and gloved, and carried firearms. They left the bank with about $7,300. Defendant Rith was the driver of the get-away car.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">During the robbery, Mr. Xayaso mainly stayed in the lobby area, holding a rifle at waist level. At one point, he approached a branch manager who was talking on the telephone, silently pointed the rifle at her, and hung up the phone. Mr. Pouha advanced on the tellers, pointed the revolver, and shouted at them to give him their money. One of the tellers voluntarily fell to the floor in an effort to activate an alarm. As soon as Mr. Pouha noticed the teller, he shouted for him to get up.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">The charges against Mr. Xayaso and Mr. Rith proceeded to a jury trial. Mr. Pouha entered a guilty plea and testified at trial on behalf of the government. The co-defendants were convicted of armed bank robbery and carrying and using a firearm during that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-11\">At sentencing, the district court found that the co-defendants had brandished their weapons, resulting in an increase of the mandatory minimum sentence from five years to seven years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). Furthermore, the court concluded that the facts warranted a two-level sentencing increase for the physical restraint of a person \u201cto facilitate commission of the offense,\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B). Mr. Xayaso was sentenced to a total prison term of 161 months; Mr. Rith was sentenced to a total prison term of 221 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">On appeal, Mr. Xayaso and Mr. Rith raise substantially the same arguments: (1) that the \u201cbrandishing\u201d of a firearm is not a sentencing factor, but rather is an element of the crime of carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, which must be charged in indictment and proved beyond reasonable doubt; and (2) that the district court erred by adjusting their offense level upward based on findings of physical restraint of a victim during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-13\"><em>United States v. Xayaso, </em>No. 01-4055</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">For his first issue on appeal, Mr. Xayaso states that the indictment in this case charged him with using and carrying a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), but did not include a reference to brandishing. He argues that, under the reasoning of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the brandishing clause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) sets forth an element of the offense that must be specifically charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Mr. Xayaso did not raise this challenge before the district court. We therefore review the issue for plain error. Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b). Under the plain-error standard, appellant must demonstrate that the trial court erred, the error was plain, and the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Cernobyl, </em>255 F.3d 1215, 1218 (10th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). This court has discretion to remedy plain error if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The Supreme Court has recently made it plain that a district court does not err in basing a two-year increase in the minimum sentence on a judicial finding of brandishment. The Court directly held that brandishing is a \u201csentencing factor[ ] to be found by the judge, not an offense element to be found by the jury.\u201d <em>Harris v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2414, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contrary to Mr. Xayaso\u2019s contentions, this factor \u201cneed not be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2420.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We uphold the imposition of the increased mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">Mr. Xayaso also asserts that the district court erred in applying the physical restraint guideline to his offense. \u2018We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>285 F.3d 909, 915 (10th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. July 1. 2002) (No. 02-5120). We give \u201cdue deference\u201d to the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">The sentencing guidelines authorize a two-level upward adjustment from the base offense level for a robbery \u201cif any person was physically restrained to facilitate commission of the offense or to facilitate escape.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B). Mr. Xayaso argues that his and Mr. Po-uha\u2019s conduct toward bank employees did not amount to physical restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-15\">In <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>132 F.3d 1327 (10th Cir.1997), we held that \u201c[physical restraint is not limited to physical touching- of the victim. Rather, physical restraint occurs whenever a victim is specifically prevented at gunpoint from moving, thereby facilitating the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30 (citation omitted), <em>see also United States v. Pearson, </em>211 F.3d 524, 525-26 (10th Cir.) (citing <em>Fisher </em>approvingly and noting that \u201cwe have determined an enhancement for physical restraint is applicable when the defendant uses force, including force by gun point, to impede others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>from interfering with commission of the offense\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 899, 121 S.Ct. 234, 148 L.Ed.2d 168 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Under the well-established Tenth Circuit interpretation of USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B), the district court properly applied the guideline to Mr. Xayaso\u2019s case. Using his rifle at close range, Mr. Xayaso restrained the bank manager from remaining on the telephone and reporting the robbery to the person on the other end of the line. Additionally, Mr. Pouha pointed his pistol at a teller attempting to activate an alarm and ordered him to stand. Both of these actions amounted to the use of force in an attempt to facilitate the bank robbery. The two-level adjustment for restraint of a victim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\"><em>United States v. Rith, </em>No. 01-4100</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Mr. Rith admits that, as the getaway car driver, he was an aider and abetter in the bank robbery and thus liable for the acts committed by Mr. Xayaso and Mr. Pouha. For the same reasons we have rejected identical arguments made by Mr. Xayaso, we determine that Mr. Rith\u2019s arguments fail. The increased mandatory minimum sentence for brandishing a firearm, under \u00a7 924(e)(l)(A)(ii), and the two-level adjustment for the physical restraint of a victim, USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B), were appropriate. We grant the government\u2019s motion for leave to incorporate and use the record on appeal as designated in Mr. Xayaso\u2019s case, No. 01-4055.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">In <em>United States v. Xayaso, </em>No. 01-4055, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. In <em>United States v. Rith, </em>No. 01-4100, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b891-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
