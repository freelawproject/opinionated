The petition was dismissed by the court as time-barred on October 17, 2001. Ferrell did not file a notice of appeal within the thirty-day time period prescribed by Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), but on May 15, 2002, he filed an \u201cApplication for Habeas Corpus Relief Appeal Out of Time.\u201d In ruling on this application, the district court noted the language of Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6) that a court \u201cmay reopen the time to file an appeal ... but only if all the following conditions are satisfied: (A) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice of the entry, whichever is earlier....\u201d Because over two-hundred days had elapsed since the district court\u2019s entry of judgment denying Ferrell\u2019s habeas petition, the court determined that the conditions of Rule 4(a)(6) had not been met. Ferrell\u2019s application was therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-15\">We conclude that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s October 17, 2001 judgment dismissing Ferrell\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. The thirty-day deadline for the filing of a notice of appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1) had expired, and this time limitation is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Senjuro v. Murray, </em>943 F.2d 36, 37 (10th Cir.1991) (per curiam). Furthermore, this court \u201clacks discretion to consider the merits of a ease over which it is without jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 379, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>Our conclusion that we have no jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ferrell\u2019s habeas petition, however, does not bring an immediate end to our inquiry. Ferrell timely filed an application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 4(a)(6) motion, and that matter is therefore properly before us. We may issue a COA, however, only if an applicant \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Meeting this standard requires \u201ca demonstration that ... includes showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were \u2018adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quoting <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 893 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983)). We review the legal conclusions of a district court in a habeas proceeding de novo. <em>Martin v. Kaiser, </em>907 F.2d 931, 933 (10th Cir.1990). Because Ferrell has filed his application for a COA pro se, we construe his petition liberally. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Before the district court, Ferrell argued that his \u201clack of action\u201d in filing a timely appeal was due to his being separated from his legal papers during his transfer to a new correctional facility. (R. Doc. 25 at 2.) To the extent that he contends before us that the district court erred by not applying equitable tolling principles to his application to appeal out of time <em>(see </em>Applic. for COA at 3), we conclude there is no merit to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">\u201c[Njothing within Rule 4(a)(6) indicates it is permissive or that its limitations may be waived for equitable reasons. The 180-day limitation ... is specific and unequivocal.\u201d <em>Clark v. Lavallie, </em>204 F.3d 1038, 1040 (10th Cir.2000). The district court thus properly refused to grant Ferrell\u2019s application to appeal out of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Ferrell\u2019s application for a COA with respect to the district court\u2019s October 17, 2001 dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Ferrell\u2019s application for a COA with respect to the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 4(a)(6) motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-12\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-13\">. Ferrell has also submitted to this court a paper titled \"Supplemental Evidence to Support Claim of Error by District Court in Applying AEDPA Time Barred Order Brief in Support\u201d (\"Supp.Evid.Mot\u201d), which we construe as a motion for permission to file a supplemental brief, together with the supplemental brief itself. That motion is granted. In this document Ferrell argues that the district court erred in denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus as time-barred, contending that his direct appeal in state court is \"still an open and pending motion\u201d (Supp. Evid. Mot. at 2), and that the one-year period of limitations for filing a habeas petition imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 should therefore be tolled. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (\"The time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>view with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this section.\u201d). Because, as noted above, Ferrell did not file a timely notice of appeal, we lack jurisdiction to consider this argument as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
