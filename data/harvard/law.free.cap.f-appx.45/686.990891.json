He contends that the district court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings and also erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. The facts are known to the parties and we do not recite them here, except as necessary to explain our reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">A. Coconspirator Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b736-16\">Hernandez argues that the district court violated Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) and the Confrontation Clause when it admitted testimony that Hernandez\u2019s coconspirator, Guadelupe Reyes (\u201cReyes\u201d), identified Hernandez as the owner of the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-17\">1. Rule 801(d)(2)(E)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-18\">\u201c[A] statement by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in the furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d is admissible under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule. Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). In order for a coconspirator\u2019s out-of-court statements to be admissible, however, the defendant\u2019s \u201cknowledge of and participation in an alleged conspiracy with the putative coconspirator ... must be established! ] by a preponderance of the evidence....\u201d <em>United States v. Castaneda, </em>16 F.3d 1504, 1507 (9th Cir.1994) (citation omitted). In order to establish the defendant\u2019s knowledge of and partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ipation in the conspiracy, the prosecution \u201cmust produce some independent evidence which, viewed in light of the co-conspirator statements, establishes the requisite connection between the accused and the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a district court\u2019s decision that sufficient evidence exists linking a defendant to a conspiracy for the purpose of Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) remains unclear in this circuit.\u201d <em>Id. see United States v. Bowman, </em>215 F.3d 951, 960 (9th Cir.2000) (applying abuse of discretion review); <em>United States v. Garza, </em>980 F.2d 546, 553 (9th Cir.1992) (applying clear error review); <em>United States v. Arias-Villanueva, </em>998 F.2d 1491, 1502 (9th Cir.1993) (applying de novo review).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The government argues that the recorded 4:30 p.m. telephone conversation between Reyes and FBI informant Rafael Juarez (\u201cInformant Juarez\u201d) establishes Hernandez\u2019s knowledge of and participation in a conspiracy with Reyes. During the conversation, Reyes said that he needed to consult with a \u201cyoung man\u201d about whether to go forward with the deal, and an unidentified male overheard in the recording made comments about going forward with the deal. The government offered three pieces of circumstantial evidence that Hernandez was the man Reyes consulted with about the drug transaction during the telephone conversation: (1) Hernandez was in Reyes\u2019 house during the telephone conversation; (2) Hernandez and Reyes were the only men seen going into Reyes\u2019 house before the telephone conversation and coming out of it after-wards; and (3) when the arresting officer did a security sweep of the house a five-year-old boy was the only male inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Given the record in this case, we need not decide the proper standard of review for a trial court\u2019s admission under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) of coconspirator statements. The evidence here \u2014 when viewed in light of Hernandez\u2019s conduct on the afternoon of the drug transaction, and Reyes\u2019 statement that Hernandez was the owner of the heroin \u2014 establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that Hernandez had knowledge of and participated in a conspiracy with Reyes. Under any standard of review, the district court did not err or abuse its discretion when it admitted the testimony that Reyes identified Hernandez as the owner of the heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">2. Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Hernandez also contends that the admission of Reyes\u2019 testimony that Hernandez was the \u201cowner\u201d of the heroin violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause. Because Hernandez did not raise a Confrontation Clause objection at trial, this challenge is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>256 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">The Supreme Court\u2019s Confrontation Clause jurisprudence provides that when a hearsay declarant is not available for cross-examination at trial, \u201chis statement is admissible only if it bears adequate \u2018in-dicia of reliability.\u2019 Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). In <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 183-84, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987), the Court held that coconspirator statements under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) were among the \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exceptions to the hearsay rule and, therefore, \u201ca court need not independently inquire into the reliability of such statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Hernandez argues that the Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999), calls into question its earlier decision in <em>Bourjaily. </em>In <em>Lilly, </em>a plurality of four Justices ruled that the admission of a non-testifying accomplice's confession violated the defendant\u2019s right to confront the accomplice because the declaration against penal interest was not a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception and because it lacked \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126-27, 137-38 (plurality opinion). Nothing in <em>Lilly, </em>however, calls into question Bourjaily\u2019s holding that a coconspirator statement is a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>483 U.S. at 183-84. Thus, the admission of Reyes\u2019 testimony did not violate Hernandez\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">B. Opinion Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Hernandez contends that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the following lay opinion testimony: (1) FBI Agent Elizabeth Stevens\u2019 (\u201cAgent Stevens\u201d) testimony that she understood from the 4:30 p.m. telephone conversation that Informant Juarez was going to meet two people at Reyes\u2019 house; (2) Agent Stevens\u2019 testimony that she believed that Hernandez was acting as a lookout in Reyes\u2019 front yard when she came to arrest him; (3) Agent Stevens\u2019 characterization of the unidentified male in the 4:30 p.m. conversation as an \u201cadult male\u201d; (4) the translation of \u201cmuchacho\u201d as \u201cyoung man\u201d and not \u201cboy\u201d in the transcript of that conversation; and (5) Informant Juarez\u2019s interpretation of various parts of the transcript. We review these evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>229 F.3d 782, 788 (9th Cir.2000) (admission of lay opinion testimony is reviewed for an abuse of discretion); <em>United States v. Armijo, </em>5 F.3d 1229, 1235 (9th Cir.1993) (admission of transcript is reviewed for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The admissibility of lay opinion testimony is governed by Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019 testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">1. Agent Stevens\u2019 understanding of with whom Informant Juarez would meet</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Agent Stevens testified without objection that, when she overheard Reyes\u2019 conversation with the unidentified male in the background during the 4:30 p.m. telephone conversation, she concluded that there was another person with Reyes and thought that there might be another person present at the drug transaction. Later, Agent Stevens testified that she \u201cunderstood there were two people that would be participating in negotiations.\u201d Hernandez\u2019s objection to this testimony was overruled. Agent Stevens was testifying about her rational perception, based on the conversation she overheard between Reyes and the unidentified male. Thus, this testimony was helpful to the jury\u2019s clear understanding of her testimony. It was not an abuse of discretion to admit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">2. Agent Stevens\u2019 testimony that Hernandez was acting as a lookout</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">Agent Stevens testified that when she approached Hernandez to arrest him, he \u201c[ajppeared to be looking in both directions of the street\u201d and she \u201cperceived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>him to be acting as a lookout ... because of the way he was standing there and he knew what was happening with the transaction.\u201d Hernandez\u2019s objection to this testimony as speculative was overruled. A lay witness may testify based on visual observations of conduct and may make reasonable inferences regarding that conduct. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 701; <em>see also United States v. Fleishman, </em>684 F.2d 1329, 1335-36 (9th Cir.1982). Agent Stevens\u2019 testimony concerned the reasonable inferences she drew from her perceptions of Hernandez\u2019s conduct when she came to arrest him, and her testimony was relevant to whether Hernandez participated in a conspiracy with Reyes. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">3. Agent Stevens\u2019 \u201cadult male\u201d testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Agent Stevens testified that she recalled hearing several voices on the recording of the 4:30 p.m. telephone conversation, including \u201can unknown female ... Mr. Reyes .. and ... another adult male\u2019s voice.\u201d Hernandez objected to Agent Stevens\u2019 characterization of the unknown male as an \u201cadult male.\u201d The district court overruled the objection and instructed Hernandez\u2019s counsel that he \u201ccan cross-examine her on that.\u201d Agent Stevens\u2019 characterization of the voice as an \u201cadult male\u201d was rationally based on her perception of the unidentified male\u2019s voice, and such testimony would be helpful in the jury\u2019s determination of whether Hernandez was the male voice Agent Stevens heard. <em>Cf. United States v. Meling, </em>47 F.3d 1546, 1556-57 (9th Cir.1995) (testimony of a 911 operator that caller was feigning grief is admissible lay opinion testimony). There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">4. The transcript of the 4:30 p.m. telephone conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Hernandez objected to the admission of a translated transcript of the 4:30 p.m. telephone conversation between Reyes and Informant Juarez on the ground that Reyes\u2019 reference to \u201cmuchacho\u201d was translated by Agent Stevens as \u201cyoung man\u201d and not \u201cboy.\u201d An FBI translator certified the translation as accurate, Hernandez had the opportunity to submit his own translation and call an expert witness to contest the transcript\u2019s accuracy, and Hernandez does not dispute that \u201cmuchacho\u201d can mean \u201cyoung man\u201d or \u201cboy,\u201d depending on the context. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the translation. <em>See Armijo, </em>5 F.3d at 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">5. Informant testimony regarding the 4:30 p.m. telephone conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">After the entire translated transcript of the 4:30 p.m. telephone conversation was read into evidence, the government asked Informant Juarez to explain what portions of the conversation meant. Hernandez objected to two of these questions, which the court overruled. In both instances, Informant Juarez\u2019s testimony was rationally based on his perception of the telephone conversation and, as such, would assist the jury in understanding the context and meaning of the telephone conversation. <em>See United States v. Simas, </em>937 F.2d 459, 464 (9th Cir.1991) (ruling that lay opinion testimony regarding the meaning of a conversation was admissible).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no abuse of discretion in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>6. Harmless error</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Even assuming that the district court abused its discretion in admitting any or all of the challenged testimony, any error other than the admission of the co-conspirator statement would be harmless. <em>See United States v. Hankey, </em>203 F.3d 1160, 1166 (9th Cir.2000) (a non-constitutional evidentiary error warrants reversal of a conviction only if the error more likely than not affected the verdict). Evidence that Reyes identified Hernandez as the owner of the heroin, viewed in light of Hernandez\u2019s conduct on the afternoon of the drug transaction, was sufficient to support Hernandez\u2019s conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">C. Rule 29 motion</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence in a Rule 29(c) motion, a district court should consider \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Estrada-Macias, </em>218 F.3d 1064, 1066 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). We review de novo the denial of a Rule 29(c) motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence. <em>United States v. </em>Magallon-<em>Jimenez, </em>219 F.3d 1109, 1112 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Evidence properly admitted at trial shows that Hernandez was the person Reyes consulted with about whether to go forward with the drug transaction during the 4:30 p.m. telephone conversation with Informant Juarez, and that Reyes told Informant Juarez that Hernandez was the owner of the heroin. This evidence, viewed in light of evidence of Hernandez\u2019s conduct on the afternoon of the drug sale, is a sufficient basis to support the jury\u2019s verdict on the conspiracy charge. The trial court did not err in denying the Rule 29 motion for an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b736-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-12\">. Hernandez was convicted at a second trial, after his first trial ended in a mistrial after the jury deadlocked. On this appeal, Hernandez also challenges evidentiary rulings made during his first trial. The district court\u2019s grant of a mistrial, however, rendered harmless any errors that occurred during the first trial. <em>See United States v. Lorenzo, </em>570 F.2d 294, 299 (9th Cir.1978). Thus, we do not address Hernandez\u2019s claims of error occurring during the first trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\">. To the extent that Hernandez challenges other questions by the government about Informant Juarez\u2019s interpretation of the 4:30 p.m. telephone conversation \u2014 to which Hernandez did not object \u2014 they would be reviewed for plain error. For the reasons discussed above, it was not plain error to admit this additional testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
