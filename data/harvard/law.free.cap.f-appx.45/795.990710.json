The County argues that the Rule 68 bar on collection of \u201ccosts\u201d after a qualifying settlement offer also bars post-offer attorney\u2019s fees under California law. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The County argues that Cal.Civ. Proc.Code \u00a7 1033.5(c)(5) alters the meaning of Cal. Gov. Code \u00a7 12965(b) for Rule 68 purposes, requiring that attorney\u2019s fees be considered a component of costs. This argument was not made to the district court and absent exceptional circumstances, we do not consider an issue not so raised. <em>See United States v. Oregon, </em>769 F.2d 1410, 1414 (9th Cir.1985). The County argues that waiver should not apply because it raised Hasan\u2019s entitlement to post-offer fees generally, and merely refines its attack on appeal with citation to section 1033.5(c)(5). Its citations on this point are distinguishable. <em>Yee v. City of Escondido, </em>503 U.S. 519, 533-34, 112 S.Ct. 1522, 118 L.Ed.2d 153 (1992), and <em>Lebron v. National R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>513 U.S. 374, 379, 115 S.Ct. 961, 130 L.Ed.2d 902 (1995), concern waiver in the context of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257 certiorari jurisdiction, and are inapplicable. In <em>Puerta v. United States, </em>121 F.3d 1338, 1341-42 (9th Cir.1997), this court found that waiver did not apply to a claim explicitly raised below, but without citation to relevant legislative history. Here, the County does not simply \u201celaborate!] more articulately\u201d a section 1033.5(c)(5) argument raised in district court-it makes it for the first time. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we consider the section 1033.5(c)(5) issue waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Even if we were to address the County\u2019s argument, we are not persuaded that section 1033.5(c)(5) rewrites the whole of California law with respect to Rule 68 fee awards. <em>Marek v. Chesny, </em>473 U.S. 1, 9, 105 S.Ct. 3012, 87 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985), requires district courts to analyze the substantive statute underlying a plaintiffs claim to determine whether fees should be considered part of costs. Section 12965(b) clearly provides attorney\u2019s fees separately from costs. Further, the California Supreme Court has recognized that the award of attorney\u2019s fees to civil rights plaintiffs are important to the remedial scheme of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (\u201cFEHA\u201d), <em>see Flannery v. Prentice, </em>26 Cal.4th 572, 582-83, 110 Cal.Rptr.2d 809, 28 P.3d 860 (Cal.2001) (\u201c[I]f \u00a7 12965 awards were doubtful in California courts, this would effectively defeat the policy of keeping the California law as an effective remedy against [] discrimination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">We do not believe that a procedural rule aimed at clarifying the mechanisms for recovering fees and costs in California courts should be read to undermine the public policies underlying FEHA remedies simply because a FEHA plaintiff has litigated in federal court. <em>See Santisas v. Goodwin, </em>17 Cal.4th 599 618, 71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399 (1998) ((\u201cAs is evident from its substance, [section 1033.5(c)(5) ] is procedural, its purpose being to specify <em>methods </em>by which a court may fix the amount of attorney\u2019s fees claimed as costs.\u201d) (emphasis in original)). <em>Cf. Berkla v. Corel Corp., </em>No. 00-15166, 2002 WL 1772649, at *7 (9th Cir. Aug.2, 2002) (fees allowable as costs under Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1717 because section 1033.5(c)(5) specifically identifies section 1717).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Like federal law, <em>see Passantino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Prods., Inc., </em>212 F.3d 493, 517-18 (9th Cir.2000), California law commits the determination of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to the discretion of the trial courts. <em>See PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler, </em>22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095, 95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511 (2000) (recognizing that the \u201cexperienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court\u201d). Consistent with the recognition of that discretion, a trial judge\u2019s fee award, under California law as under federal law, <em>see Passantino, </em>212 F.3d at 517-18, \u201c \u2018will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>PLCM Group, </em>22 Cal.4th at 1095, 95 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511 (quoting <em>Serrano v. Priest, </em>20 Cal.3d 25, 49, 141 Cal.Rptr. 315, 569 P.2d 1303 (1977)). Here, the trial court observed both parties over the course of the litigation, and specifically found that much of Hasan\u2019s fee award could be attributed to the tactics of the County. The district court correctly applied the relevant law and was well within its discretion in determining both Hasan\u2019s entitlement to the attorney\u2019s fees and the amount ultimately awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b843-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b845-6\">SILVERMAN, Circuit Judge, concurring.</author>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">I concur in the result. Defendants\u2019 offer of judgment dated February 29, 2000 did not clearly and unconditionally offer plaintiff his attorneys fees. Athough the defendants offered to stipulate that plaintiff \u201cshall be considered a \u2018prevailing part/ solely for the purpose of <em>filing </em>an attorney fee application or motion,\u201d they specifically reserved the right to assert <em>\u201cany other objections </em>they may have to plaintiffs attorneys fee applieation/motion or any part thereof.\u201d This was not an unconditional offer of plaintiffs entitlement to attorneys fees. <em>See Herrington v. County of Sonoma, </em>12 F.3d 901, 907 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Defendants\u2019 offer of judgment dated May 17, 2000 (\u201cin the total amount of $200,000, inclusive of costs and reasonable attorneys fees, as <em>determined by the court, </em>incurred to the date of this offer\u201d) was ambiguous. Was it a flat offer of $200,000? Or were costs and reasonable attorneys fees to be \u201cdetermined by the court\u201d? An offer of judgment under Rule 68 must be clear and unambiguous. <em>Nusom v. COMH Woodburn, Inc., </em>122 F.3d 830, 833 (9th Cir.1997). This offer was neither.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
