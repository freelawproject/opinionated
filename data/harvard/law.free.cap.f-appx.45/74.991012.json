On appeal, Rivera contends that the Government failed to disclose material impeachment evidence concerning a co-defendant, Jos\u00e9 Vasquez, pursuant to <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 153-154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). We conclude that no constitutional violation occurred and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-22\">It is well established that the Government has an obligation to provide material exculpatory evidence and material impeachment evidence to the defendant upon request. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>86-87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Thus, the prosecution need not \u201cdisclose <em>all </em>exculpatory and impeachment material.\u201d <em>United States v. Coppa, </em>267 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 675, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985) (emphasis in original). Only \u201cwhen such evidence is material to guilt or punishment\u201d need the government disclose it. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[E]vi-dence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">A defendant must therefore demonstrate that his right to a fair trial was implicated by the non-disclosure of evidence by showing that: \u201c(1) the Government, either willfully or inadvertently, suppressed evidence; (2) the evidence at issue is favorable to the defendant; and (3) the failure to disclose this evidence resulted in prejudice.\u201d <em>Coppa, </em>267 F.3d at 140 (internal citation omitted). A failure to disclose impeachment evidence does not require a new trial if that evidence provides only an additional basis for challenging a witness whose credibility has already been shown to be questionable. <em>United States v. Payne, </em>63 F.3d 1200, 1210 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Rivera\u2019s claim fails because he did not suffer prejudice when the government failed to produce what allegedly was material impeachment evidence in a timely manner. Rivera was acquitted of the only count to which the alleged impeachment materials pertained. Because we must presume that the jury followed the district court\u2019s limiting instruction, <em>see United States v. Moskowitz, </em>215 F.3d 265, 269 (2d Cir.2000), we must conclude that no spillover effect occurred in relation to the other counts. Also, the alleged <em>Giglio </em>evidence had only incremental impeachment value because the co-defendant witness had already been impeached on other grounds. Finally, we conclude that sufficient other evidence existed in addition to the statements of the co-defendant to sustain the verdict against Rivera.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
