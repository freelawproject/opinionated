He was sentenced on February 28, 2001, to thirty-seven months active incarceration. On December 11, 2001, Rathburn filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, contending the district court should order a new trial based on \u201cnew evidence\u201d of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-16\">The district court denied Rathburn\u2019s Rule 33 motion as untimely. Furthermore, the district court, without notice to Rathburn, construed his motion as a motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2002), and denied \u00a7 2255 relief. Rathburn noted a timely appeal of this order. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-17\">On appeal, Rathburn contends his Rule 33 motion was timely filed. A Rule 33 motion \u201cpredicated on ineffective assistance of counsel must be brought, if at all, within seven days of judgment regardless of when the defendant becomes aware of the facts\u201d on which he relies. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>62 F.3d 641, 648 (4th Cir.1995). Because Rathburn did not file his Rule 33 motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel within seven days of judgment, the district court correctly found that such a motion was untimely. Accordingly, as to that portion of the district court\u2019s order, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-18\">Rathburn also claims that the district court erred when it characterized his Rule 33 motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion without providing him notice or an opportunity to respond. The district court did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644 (4th Cir.2002). In <em>Emmanuel, </em>we held a district court must give the movant notice of its intent to characterize a motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion and an opportunity to respond. Because the district court did not provide Rathburn notice and an opportunity to respond, and because Rathburn\u2019s ability to file a future \u00a7 2255 motion would be foreclosed by the district court\u2019s sua sponte construction of his Rule 33 motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>grant a certificate of appealability on this issue, vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Rathburn \u00a7 2255 relief, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with our decision in <em>Emmanuel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
