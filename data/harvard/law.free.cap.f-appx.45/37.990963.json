The 2000 Application was dismissed on the ground that it is time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-20\">Before a \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas application can be entertained by the district court, the petitioner must first \u201cmove in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), as amended by \u00a7 106 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 106, 110 Stat. 1217, 1220 (1996); <em>Liriano v. United States, </em>95 F.3d 119 (2d Cir.1996). Murray\u2019s 2000 Application repeats two of the claims made in a prior habeas application filed in 1996 (the \u201c1996 Application\u201d). Pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), the district court transferred the 1996 Application to this Court as a successive application, as all of the claims raised by Murray in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>1991 habeas application had been fully adjudicated on the merits. <em>Murray v. McGinnis, </em>No. 96-CV-4302 (E.D.N.Y. 1997). On April 8, 1997, this Court denied Murray authorization to file the 1996 Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Since Murray\u2019s 2000 Application raises claims presented to this Court when it denied authorization to file his 1996 Application, Murray is in effect asking us to reconsider or rehear that denial, something we lack power to do. Pursuant to \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E), the \u201cdenial of an authorization by a court of appeals to file a second or successive application shall not ... be the subject of a petition for rehearing.\u201d Murray\u2019s 2000 Petition is therefore properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
