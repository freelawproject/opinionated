The bankruptcy court\u2019s decision was affirmed by the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We affirm the bankruptcy court and deny Specialty\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The parties are familiar with the facts of the case. Stated briefly, Mooney claims over $2 million in damages based on two contracts. He claims that Specialty breached a covenant of good faith and fair dealing contained in a listing contract between Mooney and Specialty that expired in 1991. He also claims that Specialty intentionally interfered with a listing contract for the lease of the Foster City property between Mooney and Bridge Landing Assoc., L.P. (\u201cBLA\u201d), a limited partnership between Specialty, as limited partner, and Praxis Development Corp., as general partner. Specialty was not a party to the second contract. Mooney\u2019s claims are based on five acts by Specialty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-8\">(1) Specialty\u2019s repudiation of the BLA agreement through ultimately successful litigation against Praxis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-9\">(2) Specialty\u2019s retention of another broker to sell the property, which Mooney\u2019s contract with BLA gave him an exclusive right to lease;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-11\">(3) Removal of Mooney\u2019s sign from the property during the litigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">(4) The other broker\u2019s development proposals to Applied Biosystems, a prospective lessor presented by Mooney to BLA, and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-13\">(5) Specialty\u2019s direct contacts with Applied Biosystems, culminating in an offer to sell the property to Applied Biosystems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See In re Jastrem, </em>253 F.3d 438, 441 (9th Cir.2001). In decisions on appeal from the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, we independently review the decision of the bankruptcy court. <em>See In re Sheehan, </em>253 F.3d 507, 511 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">A. <em>Specialty\u2019s repudiation of the BLA agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b649-16\">Specialty claims that its conduct in its litigation to dissolve the BLA joint venture is privileged under California\u2019s litigation privilege. Cal. Civil Code \u00a7 47(b). The litigation culminated in the dissolution of the BLA joint venture, making the lease of the property through BLA impossible. The ruling was affirmed on appeal to the district court and to this court. <em>See Praxis Development Group v. Specialty Restaurants Corp., </em>No. CV 96-8246 (C.D.Cal. Jan. 12, 2000), <em>aff'd </em>21 Fed.Appx. 707 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-17\">California\u2019s litigation privilege applies to \u201cany communication (1) made in judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve objects of litigation; and (4) that have some connection or logical relation to the action.\u201d <em>Silberg v. Anderson, </em>50 Cal.3d 205, 212, 266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>P.2d 365 (1990). The privilege is \u201cabsolute in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365. As such, it is broadly construed to include communications outside of the courtroom. <em>See Wilton v. Mountain Wood Homeowners Assn., </em>18 Cal.App.4th 565, 569, 22 Cal.Rptr.2d 471 (1993). It is intended to afford \u201cthe utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.\u201d <em>Silberg, </em>50 Cal.3d at 213, 266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The privilege does not apply to cases brought without probable cause. <em>See Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Bear Stearns &amp; Co., </em>50 Cal.3d 1118, 1131, 270 Cal.Rptr.1, 791 P.2d 587 (1990). Absent fraud, probable cause is conclusively presumed from victory at trial. <em>See Hydranautics v. FilmTec Corp., </em>204 F.3d 880, 886 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Roberts v. Sentry Life Ins., </em>76 Cal.App.4th 375, 383, 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 408 (1999). Because Specialty was victorious at trial and Mooney does not allege fraud, the presumption of probable cause applies. Mooney makes several arguments as to why the presumption should not apply, none of which are convincing. Allowing third parties to relitigate the issue of probable cause would hardly further the policy of providing \u201cthe utmost freedom of access to the courts without fear of being harassed subsequently by derivative tort actions.\u201d <em>Silberg, </em>50 Cal.3d at 213, 266 Cal.Rptr. 638, 786 P.2d 365. Specialty\u2019s litigation against Praxis is privileged under Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 47 and cannot form the basis of liability under either an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing or tortious interference with contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">B. <em>Specialty\u2019s other actions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The bankruptcy court found that the evidence did not demonstrate that Specialty\u2019s retention of another broker, that broker\u2019s contacts with Applied Biosystems, and the removal of Mooney\u2019s sign from the property interfered with Mooney\u2019s contract with BLA or violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the expired listing agreement between Specialty and Mooney. Regarding Specialty\u2019s direct contacts with Applied Biosystems the bankruptcy court found that Applied Biosystems was not \u201cready, willing and able\u201d to enter into a lease for the property before the dissolution of the BLA j oint venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">A factual finding is clearly erroneous only if the court of appeals has a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes Aircraft Co., </em>162 F.3d 1027, 1030 (9th Cir.1998). \u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Working, </em>224 F.3d 1093, 1102 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). We do not believe that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in assessing the four acts by Specialty that are not protected by California\u2019s litigation privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Specialty\u2019s direct contacts with Applied Biosystems during the pendency of the <em>Praxis </em>litigation do present the closest question as to intentional interference with contract. We are unable to say, however, that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding that Applied Biosystems was not \u201cready, willing and able\u201d to enter into a lease for the property through Mooney. Ken Mantoani, Applied Biosystems\u2019 director of support services, was involved in negotiations with both BLA and Specialty. He testified that Applied Biosystems was straddling the fence between Specialty and BLA from the time it learned of the <em>Prax-is </em>lawsuit. Mooney admits as much in his reply brief: \u201cNot surprisingly, Mr. Man-toani\u2019s very first reason for [Applied Bios-ystems\u2019] having cooled off negotiations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>with Praxis was the pendency of the <em>[.Praxis </em>] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">As noted above, the <em>Praxis </em>litigation was privileged. In addition to the uncertainty surrounding the litigation, Applied Biosystems\u2019 potential lease of the property was hampered by internal changes within Applied Biosystems and a dispute between Applied Biosystems and its then landlord. Given these facts, the bankruptcy court could have found that Applied Biosystems was not \u201cready, willing and able\u201d to enter a lease for the property until after the <em>Praxis </em>litigation concluded, at which time a lease with BLA was no longer possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the bankruptcy court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Specialty\u2019s Motion for Sanctions is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
