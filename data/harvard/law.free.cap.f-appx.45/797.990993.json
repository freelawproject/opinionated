We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the procedural and factual history of the case, we do not recount it here except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to enforce the settlement agreement for an abuse of discretion. <em>Maynard v. City of San Jose, </em>37 F.3d 1396, 1401 (9th Cir.1994). Reversal is appropriate only if the court based its decision upon an error of law or clearly erroneous findings of fact. <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo, </em>and under California law, the district court\u2019s interpretation of the oral settlement agreement reached by the parties on the record. <em>See United Commercial Ins. Serv., Inc. v. Paymaster Corp., </em>962 F.2d 853, 856 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-14\">A settlement agreement is treated as any other contract for purposes of interpretation. <em>Id. </em>Under California law, the mutual intent of the parties at the time of contracting determines the contract\u2019s meaning. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1636; <em>Frankel v. Bd. Of Dental Exam\u2019rs, </em>46 Cal.App.4th 534, 54 Cal.Rptr.2d 128, 134 (1996). The intention of the parties must be determined first from the language of the contract itself. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1638; <em>Frankel, </em>54 Cal.Rptr.2d at 134. Likewise, the words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1644; <em>Beck v. Am. Health Group Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>211 Cal.App.3d 1555, 260 Cal.Rptr. 237, 242 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-15\">In this case, the magistrate judge placed the terms of the settlement agreement on the record. Part of the settlement agreement included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-16\">[T]he parties ... will provide a release for Joe Cusenza and his company, Global Tech. Except with respect to claims alleged to date in the lawsuit pending in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>New York and except in so far as\u2014 excuse me \u2014 that is subject to verification by New York counsel of Global [Encasement], which verification will be obtained not later than the close of business tomorrow, March 2, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Following this recital, both parties stated on the record that they agreed to these terms and that they understood them to be binding. When the parties attempted to reduce the settlement agreement to writing, however, they were unable to agree because of their differing views regarding the non-party release. Thoburn took the position that the \u201cverification by New York counsel\u201d language was simply a factual verification of the claims alleged to date in the New York litigation, and was included in the agreement so that claims and counterclaims already alleged in that litigation would not be inadvertently released. Appellants\u2019 California counsel, however, argued that the non-party release was contingent upon New York counsel\u2019s authorization, and that New York counsel had refused to approve the release. Thus, California counsel for Appellants claimed that the resulting settlement excluded the non-party release, but included the agreement\u2019s remaining terms. Through the grant of a motion to enforce, the district court agreed with Thoburn. We find no abuse of discretion in that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The language of the oral settlement evinces the parties\u2019 intent that Appellants\u2019 New York counsel did not have the authority to accept or reject the release. Rather, the role of New York counsel was limited to identifying which claims had in fact been alleged in the New York litigation as of March 1, 2001. Indeed, the language clearly shows that Appellants\u2019 consent to the non-party release was unconditional: \u201cGlobal ... <em>will </em>provide a release ... .\u201d <em>See Frankel, </em>54 Cal.Rptr.2d at 137-38 (\u201cConditions precedent are not favored in the law ..., and courts shall not construe a term of the contract so as to establish a condition precedent absent plain and unambiguous contract language to that effect.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">Appellants\u2019 argument that the \u201cplain language\u201d of the non-party release shows that it was subject to their New York counsel\u2019s authorization is without merit. To accept such an argument would confuse the definitions of \u201cverify\u201d and \u201cauthorize.\u201d <em>Compare </em>CAMBRIDGE DICTIONARY (defining \u201cverification\u201d as \u201cmakfing] certain of or prov[ing] the truth or accuracy of\u2019 a matter), <em>with id. </em>(defining \u201cauthorization\u201d as \u201cgivfing] official permission for (something) to happen, or ... giving (someone) official permission (to do something)\u201d). The argument is also unconvincing because the \u201csubject to verification\u201d language modifies the \u201cclaims\u201d excepted from the non-party release, not the actual obligation to provide the release. This placement of the qualifying \u201csubject to verification\u201d language confirms that Appellants\u2019 New York counsel had authority, only to \u201cverify\u201d the exceptions to the obligation, not to accept or reject the obligation to grant the non-party release. Thus, the most reasonable interpretation of the non-party-release language is that Appellants\u2019 New York counsel was to make certain that the claims excepted from the release were the claims that had been alleged in the New York litigation as of March 1, 2001. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1643; <em>Frankel, </em>54 Cal.Rptr.2d at 134 (\u201cThe court should accord an interpretation which is reasonable.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Appellants further argue that the district court\u2019s order, which was drafted by Thoburn, impermissibly included terms contrary to those orally agreed upon by the parties on the record. Specifically, Appellants contend that the order improperly (1) excluded from the non-party release \u201call claims <em>and defenses </em>\u201d alleged in the New York litigation as of March 1, 2001, when Magistrate Judge Zarefsky carved out only \u201cclaims alleged to date in the lawsuit pending in New York,\u201d and (2) added the requirement that those claims and defenses be \u201calleged in pleadings filed.\u201d We reject both arguments, finding that the order\u2019s language is a reasonable construction of Judge Zarefsky\u2019s words.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The exclusion of both claims and defenses from the non-party release is sensible; the release of defenses, but not claims, would preclude the parties to the New York litigation from defending themselves against the claims of the other. Moreover, the exclusion of defenses from the non-party release is consistent with Appellants\u2019 counsel\u2019s stated understanding of the carve-out in the March 2, 2001 letter to Thoburn\u2019s counsel. Regarding the non-party release, Appellants\u2019 counsel wrote: \u201cWe understand that any release in this matter would directly implicate Global/Keefe\u2019s affirmative defenses in the New York action.\u201d Likewise, the order\u2019s reference to claims and defenses \u201calleged in pleadings filed\u201d in the New York litigation as of March 1, 2001 is a fair and practical way of identifying what claims and defenses had been alleged in that lawsuit as of that date. Because Appellants\u2019 New York counsel refused to verify what claims had been alleged, Appellants cannot now object to this very reasonable construction of the non-party release submitted by Thoburn and accepted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Finally, Thoburn argues that Appellants\u2019 appeal is frivolous and seeks sanctions, including an award of attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in opposing this appeal and enforcing the settlement agreement. We have discretion to award attorneys\u2019 fees and double costs as a sanction against the bringing of a frivolous appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912; Fed. R.App. P. 38; <em>Scott v. Younger, </em>739 F.2d 1464, 1467 (9th Cir.1984). \u201cCourts have typically awarded ... sanctions [for the bringing of a frivolous appeal] in two types of cases: (1) when the appeal was wholly without merit or the result was obvious, and (2) when the appeal was not only frivolous but also taken in bad faith for purposes of delay or harassment.\u201d <em>Davis v. Jackson (In re Transcon. Energy Corp.), </em>764 F.2d 1296, 1300 (9th Cir.1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). We find that this case does not rise to either level and deny the request for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b846-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\">. The circumstances of the oral settlement also undermine Appellants\u2019 claim that they could not commit to the non-party release without first obtaining their New York counsel's authorization. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1647 (\"A contract may be explained by reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the circumstances under which it was made, and the matter to which it relates.\u2019\u2019). Magistrate Judge Zarefsky\u2019s order regarding the settlement conference required the presence of \u201ca person with full settlement authority\u201d for each party, and that each party \u201cbe fully prepared to discuss all economic and non-economic factors relevant to a full and final settlement of the case.\" In a letter delivered to Appellants\u2019 California counsel several weeks before the settlement conference, Tho-burn\u2019s counsel put forward the non-party release as a term of the proposed settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
