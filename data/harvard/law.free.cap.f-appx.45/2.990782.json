It is</p>\n<p id=\"b50-32\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order of April 26, 2001 be affirmed. While arguably the petition for writ of habeas corpus should not have been construed as being brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, <em>see United States v. Palmer, </em>296 F.3d 1135, 1144 (D.C.Cir.2002), even treated as a petition brought under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, petitioner\u2019s claim fails. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is not implicated because appellant\u2019s sentence does not exceed the maximum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b). <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (any fact, except that of prior conviction, that increases sentence beyond statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>United States v. Fields, </em>251 F.3d 1041 (D.C.Cir.2001) <em>(Apprendi </em>applies only to sentence that exceeds statutory maximum) (modifying on rehearing, <em>United States v. Fields, </em>242 F.3d 393 (D.C.Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
