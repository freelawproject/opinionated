Salti appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">Salti first argues the district court shifted to him the burden of proving the number and value of the counterfeit cassette tapes, for purposes of establishing the amount of loss attributable to his offense at sentencing, by requiring him to produce his evidence first. Salti did not raise this argument below, and no plain error occurred. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>203 F.3d 557, 558 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam). The court did not misstate the government\u2019s burden of proof, and the court\u2019s procedure yielded the evidence the court needed to resolve Salti\u2019s objections to the amount of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-17\">Salti also argues the government did not meet its burden of proof in establishing the amount of loss under U.S.S.C. \u00a7 2F.l(b)(l)(I) (1998) (requiring 8-level enhancement where loss exceeded $200,000). This argument also fails. Based on sentencing testimony about the number and source of counterfeit tapes, and their market value, the district court\u2019s finding that the amount of loss exceeded the $200,000 threshold for an 8-level enhancement was not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, comment, (n.9) (1998) (loss need not be determined with precision and need only be reasonable estimate); <em>United States v. Coon, </em>187 F.3d 888, 899 (8th Cir.1999) (standard of review), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1017, 120 S.Ct. 1417, 146 L.Ed.2d 310 (2000); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>952 F.2d 1110, 1118-19 (9th Cir.1991) (market value of counterfeited tapes is reasonable value to use in copyright case), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 920, 113 S.Ct. 334, 121 L.Ed.2d 252 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-18\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-19\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
