R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-21\">The United States commenced this action to reduce to judgment federal tax assessments against Jay Dee Pfannenstiel. It also sought to set aside as fraudulent Pfannenstiel\u2019s conveyance of certain real property located in New Mexico, to foreclose tax liens on that property, and to obtain a deficiency judgment for any deficiency remaining after the sale of the property. Appearing pro se, Pfannenstiel appeals the district court\u2019s ruling in favor of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-22\">The parties are familiar with the facts, so we need not repeat them here. On appeal, Pfannenstiel argues that the government\u2019s complaint lacked a critical allegation, namely, that the government issued Pfannenstiel a notice of deficiency. As a result, asserts Pfannenstiel, the district court lacked jurisdiction. He claims, as well, that the government\u2019s evidence, showing that it did in fact mail a notice of deficiency to Pfannenstiel, was inadmissible hearsay and should not have been admitted by the district court. The district court ruled that Pfannenstiel\u2019s jurisdictional challenge lacks any basis in law, and it similarly rejected Pfannenstiel\u2019s evidentia-ry objection. As to both rulings, we conclude that the district court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-23\">Pfannenstiel also raises an evidentiary challenge to certain documents admitted by the district court demonstrating the validity of the tax assessments leveled against him. We again conclude that in admitting the government-prepared \u201cCertificates of Assessments and Payments,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>the district court did nothing improper. Nor do we believe that the district court\u2019s reliance on this evidence had the effect of erroneously shifting the burden of proof to Pfannenstiel. Lastly, we reject Pfannen-stiel\u2019s assertion that the government\u2019s suit was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">For reasons substantially the same as stated by the district court, we AFFIRM the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b915-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
