He is also an experienced amateur aviator. In 1985, plaintiff purchased a Korean War-era jet fighter plane, a Grumman F9F-2 Panther, which he had restored to flying condition. The FAA issued plaintiff a permanent license in 1987, and he flew the Panther in a number of air shows in the years following.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In September 1996, plaintiff experienced problems with the fuel system shortly after takeoff and was forced to make an emergency landing. The plane overshot the runway, crossed a highway and ultimately crashed into a hill. Plaintiff sustained serious injuries, but fortunately recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The National Transportation and Safety Board, with the assistance of the AlliedSig-nal Company, investigated the accident and prepared a report. After reviewing the findings, plaintiff advised the Board that the report contained a number of errors, particularly with respect to his authorizations and qualifications to fly the Panther. The Board, conceding its mistakes, apologized to plaintiff, withdrew the report, and advised those who had obtained a copy of it of the errors. It then initiated another investigation in which some of the errors were corrected. Unfortunately, its second report, which was apparently posted on the NTSB\u2019s website in late December 1999, reiterated errors contained in the original report, including those suggesting that plaintiff was not qualified to fly the Panther.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Plaintiff filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the NTSB, some of its employees and AlliedSignal. His 53-page second amended complaint, together with a number of attached exhibits, alleged eight separate causes of action and sought compensatory and injunctive relief. The District Court, after conducting an exhaustive examination and analysis of each of the counts, dismissed the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim. We have carefully reviewed the District Court\u2019s opinion and, despite the excellent brief and oral argument on appeal by plaintiff, do not find reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">We can understand the plaintiffs frustration with the Board\u2019s actions. Although it acknowledged errors in its original report posted on the Internet, apparently through some sort of bureaucratic bumbling the Board repeated the same mistakes in the second report. We are certain that the District Court also sympathized with the plaintiffs irritation, but concluded-as do we-that there was not a legal basis for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">With respect to the plaintiffs criticism of the \u201cparty system\u201d employed by the NTSB in accident investigations, we are persuaded that changes to that procedure is a matter for Congress and not the courts. <em>See Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>435 U.S. 519, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
