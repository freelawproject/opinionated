Because the record shows that the District Court believed it had the authority under the Guidelines to depart downward, but exercised its discretion not to do so, we shall dismiss Colon\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-19\">After a jury trial, Colon was convicted of possession with intent to distribute in excess of five hundred grams of cocaine in violation of \u00a7 841(a), and of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of \u00a7 846. At sentencing, Colon requested a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 on the ground that he was a convicted deportable alien subject to potential consequences not visited upon others convicted of the same offenses. The District Court denied his request. Without elaborating, the Court stated that \u201cwhile [convicted deportable alien status] has been considered in some jurisdictions and not in the Third Circuit to the extent that I know, I agree with the government\u2019s position.\u201d The Court then sentenced Colon at the lowest end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>applicable sentencing range, imposing concurrent sentences of fifty-one months for each offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">We have no jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart downward when a district court believes it has the authority to do so but exercises its discretion to find a departure unwarranted. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>49 F.3d 109, 111 (3d Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Denardi, </em>892 F.2d 269, 272 (3d Cir.1989). We do have jurisdiction, however, when a district court denies a downward departure request because it thinks it lacks authority to grant it. <em>United States v. Marin-Castaneda, </em>134 F.3d 551, 554 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">When it is \u201cimpossible to discern from the record\u201d whether the denial of a downward departure request was based on a presumed lack of authority or an exercise of discretion, our Court\u2019s practice is to \u201cvacate the sentence and remand for the district court to clarify the basis for its ruling.\u201d <em>United States v. Mummert, </em>34 F.3d 201, 205 (3d Cir.1994).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus in <em>Mummert </em>we remanded because \u201cthe record [did] not make clear\u201d why the District Court rejected the defendant\u2019s grounds for departing downward. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>United States v. Powell, </em>269 F.3d 175 (3d Cir.2001), we vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence and remanded because we had \u201cno way of knowing why the district court denied the requested departure,\u201d as the Court \u201chad not given any reason for denying [the defendant\u2019s] request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">At Colon\u2019s sentencing hearing, the District Court did not explicitly say whether it believed it had the authority to depart downward based on Colon\u2019s immigration status. It did say, however, that it \u201cagree[d] with the government\u2019s position,\u201d which was that a downward departure was not appropriate because it would reward Colon merely for being an alien. The Government did not argue that the Court lacked the <em>authority </em>to depart downward on this ground; indeed, it acknowledged that some courts outside the Third Circuit have granted downward departures for convicted deported aliens.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>indicates that when the District Court said it agreed with the Government\u2019s position, it thought that it <em>could </em>depart downward but deemed this an imprudent exercise of its discretion. The District Court\u2019s explanation of its ruling was \u201cnot sufficiently ambiguous as to require vacatur and remand.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>223 F.3d 239, 247 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Although the record here is adequate for us to understand the District Court\u2019s reasoning, it is better that district courts state explicitly whether they believe they have the authority to grant a downward departure when one is requested. <em>See Mummert, </em>34 F.3d at 205 n. 2 (explaining that our policy of remanding where the record is ambiguous as to the district court\u2019s reasoning is designed \u201cto encourage district courts to make clear whether their departure rulings rest on legal or discretionary grounds\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Georgiadis, </em>933 F.2d 1219, 1222-23 (3d Cir.1991) (holding that district court\u2019s failure to state clearly whether it believed it had authority to depart downward was not reversible error where court denied departure on discretionary grounds, but \u201curg[ing] district courts to make sentencing decisions express whenever possible, especially when a defendant has requested a downward departure from the Guidelines,\u201d to avoid \u201cwasted resources on appeal and pointless remand\u201d). With that caveat, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">. Other circuit courts take a different approach. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Romero, </em>293 F.3d 1120, 1127 (9th Cir.2002) (\"Absent a clear statement to the contrary, it must be concluded that the court, while aware of its authority to grant a downward departure [based on, <em>inter alia, </em>deportable alien status] as a matter of law, was not persuaded to do so, based on the arguments presented.\u201d); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>30 F.3d 1318, 1319 (10th Cir.1994) (stating that \u201cunless the judge's language unambiguously states that the judge does not believe he has authority to downward depart, we will not review his decision\u201d); <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>975 F.2d 1028, 1035 (4th Cir.1992) (\u201c[W]here, as in this case, the record is silent with respect to the judge\u2019s refusal to depart downward, we cannot infer that the judge believed he lacked the authority to depart. Instead, we are constrained to find that the judge merely exercised his discretion under the guidelines not to depart.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-12\">. As both the District Court and the Government recognized, our Court has not decided whether deportable alien status can justify a downward departure. <em>See Marin-Castaneda, </em>134 F.3d at 554 (noting, but not deciding, the issue). However, the Supreme Court held in <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996), that appellate courts cannot deem a factor <em>per se </em>inappropriate for a downward departure unless the Guidelines foreclose consideration of that factor. <em>Id. </em>at 106-07. Since <em>Koon, </em>other circuit courts have recognized that deportable alien status can give rise to a downward departure when it results in extraordinary hardship that places the defendant outside the \"heartland\u201d of the Sentencing Guidelines, unless the applicable guideline presumes a defendant who is a deportable alien <em>(i.e., </em>in cases involving certain immigration offenses). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lopez-Salas, </em>266 F.3d 842, 847\u201448 (8th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Maldonado, </em>242 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2001); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number><em>Garay, </em>235 F.3d 230, 233 &amp; n. 18 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. DeBeir, </em>186 F.3d 561, 569-70 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Tejeda, </em>146 F.3d 84, 88 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Farouil, </em>124 F.3d 838, 847 (7th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Charry Cubillos, </em>91 F.3d 1342, 1344 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\">. Contrast <em>Evans, </em>which found the record \"sufficiently ambiguous\u201d to reject the Govern-merit\u2019s claim that the District Court believed it had the authority to depart downward where the Court said both that it was \"entitled\u201d to depart downward and that it ''[did] not have the power\u201d to do so. 49 F.3d at 112.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
