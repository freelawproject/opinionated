Casseus appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Kessler Institute of Rehabilitation, Inc. (\u201cKessler\u201d) on his claim of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (\u201cLAD\u201d), and the Age Discrimination and Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d). We exercise appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. After reviewing the record in this ease, we are satisfied that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment and, accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">The parties are familiar with the facts of this case. As a result, we will provide only a brief summary of those facts at the outset and will incorporate additional facts as they are relevant to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">Appellant Casseus, a male of Haitian descent, was 44 years of age at the time his complaint was filed. Casseus alleged that Kessler discriminated against him based on his sex, age, and national origin by failing to twice hire him for the position of Food Service Supervisor. In October, 1997, Casseus filed complaints with New Jersey\u2019s Division on Civil Rights (\u201cDCR\u201d) and with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). On February 4, 2000, the DCR, which had investigated Casseus\u2019s claims, issued a Finding of No Probable Cause with respect to the LAD claim. Detailing its investigation, the DCR reported finding insufficient evidence to support Casseus\u2019s allegations. Rather, it found evidence corroborating Kessler\u2019s claim that those hired for the position in question were better qualified than was Casseus. On June 1, 2000, the EEOC also dismissed Casseus\u2019s complaint with respect to the Title VII and ADEA claims, finding insufficient evidence of a violation by Kessler, and issued a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">Casseus filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking relief under Title VII, the LAD, and the ADEA. Kessler moved for summary judgment and Cas-seus moved for relief under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(f). On July 11, 2001, the District Court granted Kessler\u2019s motion and denied Casseus\u2019s request for Rule 56(f) relief. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-16\">The District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to Kessler.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>well understood, summary judgment is granted when \u201cno genuine issue [exists] as to any material fact and [when] the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 56(c). Facts and reasonable inferences therefrom are viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Reitz v. County of Bucks, </em>125 F.3d 139, 143 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The shifting burdens in employment discrimination cases are also well understood. Under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and its progeny, a plaintiff must set forth a prima facie case of discrimination. If he or she does so, the burden shifts to the defendant employer to articulate a non-discriminatory reason for an adverse employment decision. If the employer does so, then the plaintiff must show that the proffered reason was, in fact, a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Here, Casseus satisfied his burden of showing a prima facie case of discrimination, <em>i.e., </em>he was a member of a protected class, he was qualified for the position at issue, he was nevertheless not hired, and members outside the protected class were hired, <em>i.e. </em>non-Haitian females under forty. <em>Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 1101, 1108 (3d Cir.1997). In response to the prima facie showing, Kessler met its burden of articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for not hiring Casseus. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254-55, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). In particular, Kessler proffered evidence from the individual who interviewed the candidates that other candidates were more qualified than was Casseus.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">At this point, the burden of production fell on Casseus to \u201ccast sufficient doubt upon the employer\u2019s proffered reasons to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons are incredible.\u201d <em>Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>100 F.3d 1061, 1072 (3d Cir.1996) (en banc). This Casseus did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The District Court pointed out the flaws in Casseus\u2019s suggestions as to why Kes-sler\u2019s reason was pretextual. Casseus claimed that Kessler has never interviewed or hired an individual of Haitian descent. He did not, however, demonstrate that any such individual had ever applied to Kes-sler. For the same reason, Casseus\u2019s claim that no one over the age of 40 had been hired as a supervisor fails: he did not demonstrate that any qualified person in that age group had ever applied for such a position. Moreover, Casseus does not dispute Kessler\u2019s claim that two of the three supervisors at Kessler in 1997 were older than Casseus, that all of the supervisors were African American, and that one of the supervisors in 1997 was male. The District Court so found. Finally, a review of the record leaves no doubt that the candidate initially hired for the position in question \u2014 and the candidate subsequently hired when the supervisory slot again opened up \u2014 was better qualified than was Casseus. Accordingly, Casseus has not shown that Kessler\u2019s proffered reason for not hiring him was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">The District Court denied Casseus\u2019s motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">Should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party\u2019s opposition, the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">There was no error in denying the motion. First, there is no assertion in the record that Casseus was unable to present facts essential to his claim. Second, as the District Court found, the information which Casseus sought leave to ascertain did not bear on what the evidence revealed and why he was not hired: Casseus was not offered the supervisory position because the two successful candidates had superior credentials. Further discovery was unnecessary, and the District Court correctly denied Rule 56(f) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order of July 11, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\">. Casseus does not discuss the grant of summary judgment on his LAD claim. To the extent it is before us, we will affirm, noting that N.J.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 10:5-21 and 27 preclude Cas-seus from pursuing LAD relief. Rather, he may only seek state appellate review of the DCR decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
