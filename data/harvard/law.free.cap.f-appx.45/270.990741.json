We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>United States v. Gillins, </em>No. CR-94-163 (E.D. Va. filed July 23, 2001; entered July 24, 2001); <em>see San-Miguel v. Dove, </em>291 F.3d 257 (4th Cir. 2002) (holding that rule announced in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review regardless of whether action is filed under \u00a7 2255 or \u00a7 2241). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
