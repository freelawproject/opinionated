The presentence report recommended a four-level increase in Anderson\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), which dictates the increase when a \u201cdefendant used or possessed any firearm ... in connection with another felony offense.\u201d Anderson objected to the increase. At an evidentiary hearing, the Government presented evidence that Anderson possessed the stolen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>firearm and used it to shoot at his girlfriend\u2019s legs. The Government argued this conduct was another felony: second-degree assault under Minnesota law. Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.222 subd. 1. The Government introduced the transcript of the victim\u2019s 9-1-1 call, in which she stated Anderson \u201ctried to shoot [her]\u201d in their house. Government witnesses included the police officer who interviewed the victim several times and a second officer who responded to the victim\u2019s 9-1-1 call, found Anderson at a bar with his friend, Sean Wells, and recovered the firearm from Wells\u2019s vehicle. Anderson called Wells, who was in Anderson\u2019s house at the time of the shooting. Wells testified he heard Anderson and the victim arguing in their bedroom and what sounded like gun shots. Wells entered the bedroom and saw Anderson standing near the victim with the .380 firearm in his hands. After Wells took the firearm away from Anderson, Anderson picked up an object from the dresser and threw it at the victim. Based on the testimony and exhibits, the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> found the four-level enhancement applied and sentenced Anderson to 98 months in prison. Anderson appeals his sentence, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Anderson first contends the Government must prove that he committed \u201canother felony offense\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) beyond a reasonable doubt. Anderson relies on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which holds any fact, other than an earlier conviction, that increases a penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be charged and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no <em>Apprendi </em>issue here because Anderson\u2019s ninety-eight month sentence was not above the 120-month maximum sentence for a violation of \u00a7 922(j). <em>United States v. Eaton, </em>260 F.3d 1232, 1239 (10th Cir.2001) (rejecting <em>Ap-prendi </em>argument in context of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5)); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (providing ten-year maximum sentence for violation of \u00a7 922(j)). <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to sentencing factors that, as here, increase a defendant\u2019s guideline range, but do not increase the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>285 F.3d 664, 672 (8th Cir.2002). Contrary to Anderson\u2019s assertion, application of the enhancement to him absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not violate due process. <em>See Hayes v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 724, 726 (8th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">In the alternative, Anderson asserts the Government must prove he committed \u201canother felony offense\u201d by clear and convincing evidence. Although we have \u201cleft open the question of whether the government must prove non-garden variety sentencing facts by a preponderance of the evidence or by clear and convincing evidence,\u201d <em>United States v. McClain, </em>171 F.3d 1168, 1171 n. 2 (8th Cir.1999), the district court found that even under the heightened clear and convincing standard, the record supports the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">Anderson last asserts the district court misdefined a felony for the purpose of applying \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), and committed clear error in finding a felonious assault had occurred. \u201c \u2018Felony offense\u2019 as used in subsection [2K2.1](b)(5) means any offense (federal, state, or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought, or conviction obtained.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 n. 7. Minnesota Statutes \u00a7 609.222 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>subd. 1, the second-degree assault statute, provides, \u201cWhoever assaults another with a dangerous weapon may be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than seven years .... \u201d Anderson contends his act of firing a gun at his girlfriend\u2019s legs was not second-degree assault under Minnesota law because he did not intend to harm her. He points out his girlfriend stated she was not afraid during the shooting, and the fact none of the shots fired hit her is powerful evidence that he meant no harm. Intent to harm is not necessary, however. <em>State v. Hough, </em>585 N.W.2d 393, 395 (Minn. 1998). Assault includes an act done with intent to cause fear in another of immediate bodily harm or death. Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.02, subd. 10(1). Further, it does not matter whether Anderson\u2019s girlfriend was frightened when Anderson shot at her legs. \u201cThe crime is in the act done with intent to cause fear, not in whether the intended result is achieved.\u201d <em>Hough, </em>585 N.W.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Based on the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing, the district court could find by clear and convincing evidence that Anderson shot at his girlfriend\u2019s legs and infer that he intended to cause her to fear immediate bodily harm. The district court thus properly concluded Anderson committed \u201canother felony offense\u201d for the purpose of applying \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), and properly assessed the four-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Anderson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-5\"> The Honorable Ann.
