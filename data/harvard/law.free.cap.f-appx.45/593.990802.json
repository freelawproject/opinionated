(\u201cSpokane\u201d) and two of its officers for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over Emter\u2019s suit was premised on federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, arising from Emter\u2019s claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001-1461. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The parties are familiar with the facts of the case. Emter\u2019s claim was based on the \u201cEmployment Agreement\u201d he entered into in 1979, when he began working for Spokane. Article 12B of that agreement provided a severance benefit, entitling Emter to 4.3% (later changed to 4.4%) of the prior year\u2019s book value of Spokane if his employment terminated for any reason. Emter alleges that the severance benefit was an \u201cemployee welfare benefit plan,\u201d giving rise to an ERISA claim and federal question jurisdiction. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1002-1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">\u201c[A] relatively simple test has emerged to determine whether a plan is covered by ERISA: does the benefit package implicate an ongoing administrative scheme?\u201d <em>Delaye v. Agripac, Inc., </em>39 F.3d 235, 237 (9th Cir.1994). No such administrative scheme is implicated here. Emter was eligible for the lump-sum severance benefit regardless of how his employment was terminated. The amount of the benefit was calculated through a simple mathematical calculation based on the prior year\u2019s book value. It is true that the management of a company may make discretionary decisions affecting book value, e.g., by accelerating depreciation. It is also true that accounting \u2014 an art or alchemy, not a science\u2014 may affect the apparently simple calculation of book value. But nothing in these facts gives rise to the type of discretion that implicates an administrative scheme. <em>See Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 12, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">In the alternative, Emter argues that promises made to him at the time of his employment establish an ERISA employee welfare benefit plan through equitable es-toppel. In order to establish equitable estoppel in the ERISA context, a party must show, among other things, that the representation relied upon was an oral interpretation of the plan. <em>See Pisciotta v. Teledyne Indus., Inc., </em>91 F.3d 1326, 1331 (9th Cir.1996). Emter\u2019s severance benefit was not an \u201cemployee welfare benefit plan\u201d covered by ERISA and the representations do not establish such a plan. Without the ERISA claim, the district court lacked jurisdiction. Although the federal forum is not available, Emter is free to pursue his claims in a state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>For the above reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
