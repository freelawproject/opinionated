Skeddle appeals the district court\u2019s order denying him attorneys\u2019 fees under the Hyde Amendment, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, statutory note. Skeddle\u2019s claims that he is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending against a prosecution for various counts of tax fraud and filing false tax returns. According to Skeddle, the United States\u2019s legal positions in that prosecution were \u201cvexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith,\u201d given the readily ascertainable facts. For all of the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his motion under the Hyde Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">Skeddle\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees is the product of a lengthy and complicated federal criminal prosecution. In 1995, the government obtained a 313-count indictment against Skeddle, Darryl J. Costin, <em>see United States v. Costin, </em>Nos. 00-3195, 00-3287, 00-3288, and six other co-defendants. After pre-trial motions, Costin, Skeddle, and their co-defendants were tried on over 200 counts, which included mail and wire fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering. These charges were all directed at a transaction between Libbey-Owens-Ford Company (\u201cLOF\u201d), of which Skeddle and Costin were executives, and Computer Technoloy Management (\u201cCTM\u201d), a computer services company that Skeddle and Costin established. LOF contracted with CTM for computer consulting work.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">CTM was itself a complicated entity. It was wholly owned by three corporations, operated by Professor Clarence Martin, a computer scientist and friend of Costin and Skeddle. These three corporations were known as the Martin Companies. Each of three companies, CJD (owned and operated by Costin), SWR (operated by Skeddle), and BBE (owned and operated by Edward Bryant, another LOF executive), wholly owned one of the three Martin Companies respectively. SWR was formally owned by Skeddle\u2019s young children.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-17\">The indictment alleged that this elaborate configuration of corporations was designed to conceal self-dealing of LOF busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ness to the three LOF executives and to embezzle money from LOF through payments to CTM for phantom computer-consulting services. After an extensive jury trial, the jury acquitted all of the defendants of all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Coming up empty on the first prosecution, government prosecutors referred Costin, Skeddle, and Robert Hobe, their accountant, to the Tax Division of the Department of Justice. The government then obtained an eighteen-count indictment against Costin, Skeddle, and Hobe, including various charges of tax fraud. At various points in the proceedings, the district court entered judgments of acquittal for the defendants on sixteen of the eighteen counts. By the end of the trial, the district court had entered judgments of acquittal on all of the counts against Sked-dle. Only four counts \u2014 two against Hobe and two against Costin \u2014 remained when the case was finally submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">After the court had dismissed all charged against Skeddle by judgment of acquittal, Skeddle filed a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees under the Hyde Amendment. Skeddle claimed that each of the charges brought by the government had obvious flaws that could have been revealed through the slightest investigation by the government. Skeddle\u2019s attorney claimed that the fees, costs, and expenses incurred in defending against the tax fraud prosecution amounted to $654,000. Although none of the counts on which Skeddle was indicted reached the jury, the district court denied Skeddle\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. According to the court, the government\u2019s prosecution of Skeddle was neither vexatious, frivolous, nor taken in bad faith. While noting that the government\u2019s legal position in the prosecution was \u201clegally incorrect,\u201d the district court held that it was not \u201cunreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Skeddle now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Enacted in 1997, the Hyde Amendment permits courts to award criminal defendants damages when the government takes a position in a prosecution that \u201cwas vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith, unless the court finds that special circumstances would make such an award unjust.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, statutory note. Given the recency of the Amendment\u2019s passage, we have not had occasion extensively to discuss the standard governing the decision to award fees \u2014 although the Amendment does provide us some additional guidance. Awards shall be made, according to the Amendment, pursuant to the \u201cprocedures and limitations (but not the burden of proof) provided for an award\u201d under the Equal Access to Justice Act. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">The mere fact that the government prosecution was unsuccessful does not establish that the prosecution was \u201cvexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d 1293, 1302-03 (11th Cir.1999). Indeed, a criminal defendant seeking recovery under the Hyde Amendment faces \u201ca daunting burden.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>To demonstrate that a prosecution was taken in bad faith, the defendant must show more than simple negligence, but some evidence of conscious wrongdoing on the part of the government. <em>See United States v. True, </em>250 F.3d 410, 422-23 (6th Cir.2001). For a position of the government to be vexatious, it must be \u201cwithout reasonable cause or excuse.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">The substantive standard, requiring that the United States\u2019s position be \u201cvexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith\u201d before attorneys\u2019 fees are awarded, is not further defined in the statute. The elements of the standard are disjunctive: the position of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>States need only be either \u201cvexatious\u201d or \u201cfrivolous,\u201d or \u201cin bad faith\u201d to permit recovery. Several courts have struggled with clarifying the standard that the Hyde Amendment establishes. For example, one circuit court of appeals has explained at length that the \u201cvexatious\u201d prong of the Amendment requires that the government\u2019s position be <em>both </em>without factual or legal foundation <em>and </em>provide objective evidence of maliciousness on the part of government prosecutors. <em>See Knott, </em>256 F.3d at 30-31. We note that even if the vexatious prong of the Amendment requires maliciousness, a prevailing party may still recover because the government position was \u201cfrivolous,\u201d which appears only to require that the government\u2019s position completely lack evidential or legal merit. <em>See ibid, </em>(recognizing that the \u201cfrivolous\u201d element does not require a finding of maliciousness). The Hyde Amendment is not aimed at the general run of prosecutions, or even those that the government loses, but instead at instances of \u201cprosecutorial misconduct,\u201d where the government had undertaken obviously groundless positions in a prosecution or positions intended solely to harass defendants rather than to vindicate the rule of law. <em>Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d at 1303; <em>Knott, </em>256 F.3d at 28. In contrast, the Hyde Amendment does not shift to the government the risk of not prevailing always associated with litigating matters of law and fact on which reasonable people can disagree before courts and juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Insofar as the Hyde Amendment requires that the government\u2019s position be \u201cvexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith\u201d before the recovery of fees is permitted, it establishes a substantially more rigorous standard than the Equal Access to Justice Act, which merely requires that the government\u2019s position be \u201cnot substantially justified.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Knott, </em>256 F.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir.2001) (explaining that Congress expressly rejected the EAJA\u2019s substantive standard for recovery because it was too easy to meet). Also unlike the EAJA, the Hyde Amendment places the burden to prove the standard for a fee award on the criminal defendant. <em>Knott, </em>256 F.3d at 29. <em>Compare </em>Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (requiring that courts award attorneys\u2019 fees to a private party prevailing against the United States <em>\u201cunless </em>the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make the award unjust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Most importantly, we will only overturn a district court\u2019s denial of a request for fees under the Hyde Amendment for an abuse of discretion. <em>True, </em>250 F.3d at 421. The district court, having conducted the entire trial and witnessed the government\u2019s case, is in a far superior position to evaluate whether the government\u2019s position was vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith. The court has a fresh recollection of the government\u2019s conduct that this court\u2019s review of the cold record simply cannot provide. Nevertheless, the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review is not completely toothless: we will overturn a district court determination as an abuse of discretion when we are \u201cfirmly convinced that a mistake has been made,\u201d or put differently, \u201cwhen were are left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">We are not convinced that the district court abused its discretion in this case. Skeddle argues that the government\u2019s prosecution of him was \u201cvexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith\u201d in three respects. First, Skeddle contends that the government\u2019s position that he had filed a false tax return of SWR, by claiming that his children were the sole owners of the corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>tion, had no basis in law or fact. The district court found that it was literally true that Skeddle\u2019s children were the only owners of SWR and that the government \u201ccould have discovered earlier that it could not prevail on this claim.\u201d If we were to characterize the government\u2019s position as simply that Skeddle misrepresented the legal owners of SWR, we might hold that its true owners were so easy to discover that the government must have been consciously avoiding knowledge at best. But the government\u2019s theory was far more complicated, that Skeddle made his children record owners in order to conceal income that was actually his. \"While this theory of filing a false income tax return may not have survived a motion for acquittal, it certainly was not so clearly defective so as to lead us to suspect that the government was up to something nefarious.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Second, Skeddle contends that the government\u2019s \u201cshell theory\u201d was taken in bad faith. Similar to the allegations in Costin\u2019s prosecution, the government contended that SWR never engaged in any computer consulting and, therefore, was not a business and was not entitled to any business deductions. According to Skeddle, the government should have known that it could not prevail on this argument, given some evidence in the record that Skeddle used his contacts in the business community to create business for CTM. The district court found that because Skeddle\u2019s activities for CTM were so \u201cmodest,\u201d the government\u2019s theory was not frivolous, even if ultimately unsuccessful. We agree with the district court that Skeddle\u2019s consulting activities were sufficiently subtle that, given the significant income that SWR had from alleged consulting and the complexity created by the Martin pass-through corporations, the government\u2019s position was not so patently without merit that we must agree that the government had to be aware of its defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Third and finally, Skeddle argues that the government\u2019s contention that he never paid his children the salaries claimed as expenses by SWR. was frivolous and taken in bad faith. According to Skeddle, it should have been clear to the government, from the fact Skeddle withheld taxes for the children, that the salaries were paid. To us, however, the government\u2019s position does not seem all that absurd. While Skeddle withheld the taxes, the government\u2019s theory was that he retained the salaries for his own use \u2014 a reasonable, if ultimately unsuccessful, claim given that he controlled all his children\u2019s assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Throughout his argument, Skeddle claims that the government\u2019s case bears many similarities to <em>United States v. Holland, </em>34 F.Supp.2d 346 (E.D.Va.1999), in which the district court awarded the criminal defendant attorneys\u2019 fees under the Hyde Amendment. But Skeddle must see the difference between the district court\u2019s position in <em>Holland </em>and this court reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a Hyde Amendment fees. While granting fees in <em>Holland </em>may have been within the district court\u2019s discretion, the denial of fees quite likely would also have been within its discretion. Because we review the district court\u2019s denial of fees for an abuse of discretion, even a finding that this case and <em>Holland </em>were \u201con all fours\u201d would not determine our result.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Because the district court did not abuse its discretion, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying Skeddle fees under the Hyde Amendment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
