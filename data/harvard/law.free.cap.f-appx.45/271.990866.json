In their consolidated brief, they each contest the district court\u2019s denial of their motions for new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. Additionally, in No. 02-4127, Michael Jones challenges his in-court identification by a bank teller, and in No. 02-4190, Will Jones raises two issues with respect to the calculation of his sentence. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">First, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of the Joneses\u2019 motions for new trial. With respect to Michael Jones, the district court properly determined his Rule 33 motion was untimely. <em>See United States v. Emuegbunam, </em>268 F.3d 377, 397 (6th Cir.2001). The district court also properly declined to consider Will Jones\u2019 untimely supplement to his timely Rule 33 motion, as that supplement raised distinct issues from the issues raised in Will Jones\u2019 original motion, and thus cannot relate back to the original motion for timeliness purposes. <em>See United States v. Bramlett, </em>116 F.3d 1403, 1405-06 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Next, we find no error with respect to Michael Jones\u2019 claim in No. 02-4127 that the district court improperly admitted a bank teller\u2019s testimony identifying him as a perpetrator of the bank robbery, as it was based on her prior identification of his picture in an allegedly suggestive lineup. In so doing, we note Michael Jones failed to reproduce the lineup on appeal, and that our review of the pretrial hearing on this issue reveals no reason to question the reliability of the teller\u2019s identification. <em>See United States v. Wilkerson, </em>84 F.3d 692, 695 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Finally, we find no error with respect to Will Jones\u2019 claim in No. 02-4190 that the district court erred in calculating his sentence. The district court properly concluded Will Jones\u2019 two prior state convictions counted as separate convictions under <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1(3) (2000), despite the fact that they were consolidated for sentencing, as they were separated by an intervening arrest. <em>See United States v. Huggins, </em>191 F.3d 532, 539 (4th Cir.1999). Nor was Jones improperly denied a downward offense level adjustment for his acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, because rather than asserting and preserving issues unrelated to his factual guilt, i.e. constitutional challenges to a statutory provision or challenges to the application of the statute to acknowledged conduct, he contested only his factual guilt both at trial and in his Rule 33 motion. <em>See United States v. Dickerson, </em>114 F.3d 464, 469-70 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the Joneses\u2019 convictions and sentences, and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
