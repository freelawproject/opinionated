At his resentencing, Henson\u2019s guideline range was calculated at thirty-seven to forty-six months. However, because Henson had a prior conviction, he was sentenced to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment, based on the mandatory minimum under \u00a7 2252(b)(1). He now appeals the sentence, arguing that application of the mandatory minimum violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because his prior conviction was not charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-23\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Apprendi </em>that, other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be charged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 530 U.S. at 490. We find that <em>Apprendi </em>is inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-24\">First, <em>Apprendi </em>specifically excluded enhancements which are based on prior convictions from its holding. <em>Id. </em>Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>mandatory minimum challenged in this case was based on Henson\u2019s prior conviction, <em>Apprendi </em>is not applicable. Second, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to facts which increase the mandatory minimum so long as the sentence is not extended beyond the statutory maximum. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2414, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). Section 2252(b)(1) provides for a maximum sentence of fifteen years for violation of \u00a7 2252(a), where the defendant does not have a prior conviction. Since Henson was sentenced to five years, well below the statutory maximum with no enhancement, there is no <em>Apprendi </em>error. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 518 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 309, 151 L.Ed.2d 230 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Thus, we affirm Henson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-16\"> Application of the mandatory minimum was not an issue at Henson\u2019s first sentencing since even the low end of his guideline range exceeded the statutory minimum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
