He was sentenced by the district court to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release, and appeals his sentence. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">On appeal, counsel for Rosales-Sandoval filed an <em>Anders </em>brief and moved to withdraw as counsel. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) (permitting counsel who considers an appeal to be wholly frivolous to advise the court of that fact, request permission to withdraw from the case, and submit a brief referring to portions of the record that arguably support the appeal). In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel stated that he could find no error in the district court\u2019s imposition of the forty-six month sentence, and he accordingly referred to no portion of the record that might support Rosales-Sandoval\u2019s appeal. Rosales-Sandoval was afforded an opportunity to respond to the <em>Anders </em>brief, but declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">We have fully examined the proceedings as required by <em>Anders, id., </em>and conclude that the appeal is wholly frivolous. First, the record shows that Rosales-Sandoval\u2019s guilty plea was voluntary. The district court informed Rosales-Sandoval in open coxxrt of the nature of the charge and the maximum penalty, and instructed him as to the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 (discussing facts that must be disclosed to the defendant to ensure that his plea is voluntary).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">With regard to the sentencing, there was some discussion at the hearing as to the precise offense level appropriate under the Sentencing Guidelines. When a defendant is convicted of unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States following a prior drug-trafficking conviction, the appropriate offense level varies depending on the length of the sentence imposed for the prior felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. If the sentence for the prior felony exceeded thirteen months, the base offense level is to be increased by sixteen levels; if the sentence was for less than thirteen months, the base offense level is to be increased by twelve levels. <em>Id. </em>Following his conviction for possession and sale of a controlled substance, Rosales-Sandoval was sentenced on June 21, 1996, to 180-days\u2019 custody and thirty-six months\u2019 probation. This sentence, however, was revoked on November 13, 1996, and Rosales-Sandoval was sentenced to two-years\u2019 custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">Thus, the question might be raised which sentence should be considered for purposes of applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2: the original sentence, which was revoked, or the sentence imposed after revocation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In our judgment, the reference to the \u201csentence imposed\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>adverts to the second, post-revocation sentence, not the original sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Holbert, </em>285 F.3d 1257, 1263 (10th Cir.2002) (basing a sentencing calculation on the post-revocation sentence when a defendant\u2019s original sentence had been revoked). Nonetheless, this is an issue we need not decide, given counsel\u2019s failure to object at sentencing. \u201cPoints raised but not argued below ordinarily will not be considered on appeal.\u201d <em>Rademacher v. Colo. Ass\u2019n of Soil Conservation Dists. Med. Benefit Plan, </em>11 F.3d 1567, 1571 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">The offense level and criminal history category were properly calculated by the district court, and the lowest sentence available for that offense level and category \u2014 forty-six months \u2014 was imposed. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table). We see no issues in this case that might properly be the subject of an appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Rosales-Sandoval\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-9\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-14\">. This issue would not affect calculation of Rosales-Sandoval's criminal history category, because his criminal history category would be the same whether the point total is four or five. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a)-(b); <em>id. </em>ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
