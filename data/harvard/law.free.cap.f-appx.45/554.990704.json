The District Court sentenced Ledezma-Rodriguez to life imprisonment on the conspiracy and methamphetamine distribution convictions, to a concurrent thirty-year <em>term on </em>the cocaine distribution conviction, and to a consecutive sixty-month term on the firearm conviction, plus concurrent supervised release terms of ten, six, and three years, respectively. <em>On </em>appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the District Court erred in denying Ledezma-Rodriguez\u2019s motion <em>for </em>a new trial, in which Ledezma-Rodriguez argued that the jury\u2019s verdicts were based on perjured testimony and were otherwise unsupported. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">The District Court did not clearly and manifestly abuse its discretion in denying the new trial motion. <em>See United States v. Covey, </em>232 F.3d 641, 647 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 39, 151 L.Ed.2d 12 (2001). The government presented the testimony of police officers and a drug agent linking Ledezma-Rodriguez with drug trafficking and with a firearm, based on items found during a traffic stop and during a search of a residence Ledezma-Rodriguez used. And despite Ledezma-Rodriguez\u2019s contention that the testimony was false, the jury was entitled to believe the testimony of Ledezma-Rodriguez\u2019s coconspirators that Ledezma-Rodriguez was involved in the trafficking of methamphetamine and cocaine in the quantities found and that he carried a firearm in connection with his drug trafficking. <em>See United States v. Fellers, </em>285 F.3d 721, 725 (8th Cir.2002) (credibility determinations are left to jury); <em>United States v. Stroh, </em>176 F.3d 439, 440 (8th Cir.1999) (sufficiency of evidence reviewed in verdict\u2019s most favorable light).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">. The Honorable Robert W. Pratt, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
