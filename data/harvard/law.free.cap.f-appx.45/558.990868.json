Cannon pleaded guilty to distributing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found that Cannon was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, based on prior assault and burglary convictions, and sentenced him to 168 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court erred in finding Cannon was a career offender because his burglary conviction was not a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Cannon was convicted of second-degree burglary of an auto sales building. We previously have held that burglary of a commercial building is a crime of violence for purposes of the career-offender guideline. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>276 F.3d 1003, 1006 (8th Cir.2002), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. June 7, 2002) (No. 01-10767). Further, following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-11\">. The HONORABLE SCOTT O. WRIGHT, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
