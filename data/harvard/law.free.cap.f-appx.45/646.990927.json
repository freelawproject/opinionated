(\u201cCostco\u201d), in which Costco sought coverage under property insurance policies for costs incurred in connection with damage to its new warehouse in New Rochelle, New York after the building\u2019s foundation differentially settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Clicks Billiards Inc. v. Sixshooters, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1252, 1257 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">We hold that the district court did not err by granting Costco summary judgement because the \u201censuing loss\u201d exception to the policy\u2019s defective workmanship exclusion permits coverage for Costco\u2019s losses associated with the differential settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The basic facts have already been set forth by both parties in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The Perils Insured were \u201call risks of direct physical loss or damage from any cause whatsoever,\u201d except what was thereafter excluded. The Perils Excluded were of two types \u2014 (1) \u201closs\u201d from, e.g., nuclear radiation, and (2) particular named events such as fraud. Among these named events was \u201cFaulty or defective workmanship ... or design.\u201d That event, however, was limited by the provision that the insurer would be \u201cliable for the ensuing loss if such loss or damage is caused by or resulting from an insured peril.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Movement of the earth was a risk insured against. Movement of the earth caused Costco\u2019s loss. Movement of the earth is distinct from the defective design and the loss did ensue from the defective design. Movement of the earth was not an excluded peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">Costco is also entitled to the $873,559 in prejudgment interest awarded by the district court because Costco\u2019s motion for the interest was sufficiently supported by invoices to render the amount liquidated. \u201c[T]he existence of a dispute over part or all of a claim does not change the claim from a liquidated to unliquidated one.\u201d <em>Prier v. Refrigeration Engineering Co., </em>74 Wash.2d 25, 35, 442 P.2d 621 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-12\">Finally, the Insurers must pay reasonable attorneys fees and costs because Costco has prevailed in a legal dispute concerning the extent of coverage. <em>Olympic Steamship Co. v. Centennial Insurance Co., </em>117 Wash.2d 37, 52, 811 P.2d 673 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
