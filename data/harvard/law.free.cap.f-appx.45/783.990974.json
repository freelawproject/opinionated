He argues that the district court erred in denying him the additional one-level acceptance of responsibility reduction provided under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) (1998).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">The Government argues that Arronez-Escobedo waived the argument that he was entitled to the additional one-level reduction by failing to raise the issue in the district court. We disagree. Arronez-Escobedo did not file any objections to his Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which recommended that the district court grant the two-level acceptance of responsibility reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a) but deny the additional one-level reduction under subsection (b), and he did not argue for the three-level reduction at his sentencing hearing. However, because Arronez-Escobedo did not affirmatively confirm the factual accuracy of the PSR, his failure to raise the \u00a7 3El.l(b) argument was a forfeiture, not a waiver. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>258 F.3d 1120, 1124 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 1115, 151 L.Ed.2d 1009 (2002). We may therefore review his argument under the plain error standard. <em>See id. </em>We have discretion to reverse the district court if: (1) there was error; (2) the error was \u201cplain\u201d, i.e. \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d; and (3) the plain error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-17\">Arronez-Escobedo entered his guilty plea on the day his trial was scheduled to begin. There is no indication in the record that he notified the Government of his intention to plead guilty prior to that date. He was not entitled to the one-level reduction provided by \u00a7 3El.l(b)(2) because his plea did not allow the Government to avoid preparing for trial or permit the district court to allocate its resources efficiently. Further, Arronez-Escobedo\u2019s argument that \u00a7 3El.l(b)(2) is unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number><em>Villasenor-Cesar, </em>114 F.3d 970, 976 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Arronez-Eseobedo also argues that he fulfilled the requirements of \u00a7 3E1.1(b)(1) because he provided complete and truthful information about his conduct to border patrol agents and to the probation officer during his presentencing interview. Where the defendant qualifies for the two-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a), the additional one-level reduction is mandatory if he or she satisfies the conditions of either subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2). <em>United States v. Corona-Garcia, </em>210 F.3d 973, 980 (9th Cir.2000). The only issues are timeliness and completeness. <em>United States v. Blanco-Gallegos, </em>188 F.3d 1072, 1077 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">ArronezKEscobedo\u2019s disclosures to the border patrol agents were timely under \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l), but they were not complete. A defendant who admits all of the elements of the charged offense has given \u201ccomplete information\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3E.1.1(b)(1). <em>Id. </em>The necessary elements of a \u00a7 1326 violation are: alien status; prior deportaiton; and reentering the United States without proper authorization. <em>Corona-Garcia, </em>210 F.3d at 980. Because there is no indication in the record that Arronez-Eseobedo admitted being previously deported,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he did not provide complete information to the border patrol agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Arronez-Escobedo\u2019s disclosures during his presentencing interview, though complete, were not timely for purposes of \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l) because they did not assist the authorities in investing or prosecuting his offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n.6 (statingthat generally the conduct which qualifies a defendant for a reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l) or (2) occurs \u201cparticularly early in the case\u201d). The district court did not commit plain error in denying Arronez-Eseobedo the additional one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b832-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-12\">.
