He claims that the district court erred by finding that he is a \u201cprohibited person\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">At sentencing, the district court adopted the findings and recommendations of the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPIR\u201d). The PIR noted that Baker was subject to a restraining order at the time he committed the instant offense, and concluded that he was a \u201cprohibited person\u201d subject to a base offense level of twenty under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Baker did not object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the PIR\u2019s application of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B). In fact, Baker confirmed that, aside from an objection to the PIR\u2019s assessment of a criminal history point for a drug possession offense, there were no errors in the PIR\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Because Baker failed to object below to the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B), he has forfeited his right to appeal and is subject to this circuit\u2019s discretionary plain error review. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>258 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that, where a defendant failed to raise an objection before the district court, there was \u201can inadvertent forfeiture\u201d; under such circumstances, the court of appeals \u201cmay review his claims for \u2018plain error\u2019 \u201d); <em>United States v. Randall, </em>162 F.3d 557, 561 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cAlleged sentencing errors are reviewed for plain error where the defendant has failed to object before the district court and therefore forfeited his right to appeal.\u201d). Under this standard, Baker \u201cmust establish error that was clear or obvious and affected his substantial rights.... Even after that showing is made, [this court] will exercise discretion to correct an error only if it \u2018seriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Valencia Amezcua, </em>278 F.3d 901, 908 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). \u201cThus, more than plain error affecting substantive rights must exist for the court to reverse.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>62 F.3d 1180, 1188 (9th Cir.1995) (on remand from, and citing, <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Baker claims that the district court plainly erred because there was insufficient evidence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the PIR to establish that the restraining order met the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8)(A)-(C). <em>See supra </em>note 1. However, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Baker is correct, we decline to notice the forfeited error. Baker does not argue, on appeal, that the protective order does not meet the requirements of \u00a7 922(g)(8)(A)-(C). Instead, he argues that the Government did not provide sufficient evidence. However, the only reason the Government failed to do so is because Baker confirmed the accuracy of the PIR and did not contest the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(B). In fact, the Government specifically stated in its Guilty Plea Memorandum that it could prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of \u00a7 922(g)(8)(A)-(C)\u2019s requirements. Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s alleged error does not \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b810-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\">.
