The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s February 6, 2002 final judgment be affirmed. Issuance of a writ of mandamus is a \u201cdrastic\u201d remedy to be used in \u201cextraordinary situations.\u201d <em>Kerr v. United States, </em>426 U.S. 394, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). This case does not present such an extraordinary situation, as appellant failed to show a clear and indisputable right to the relief sought. <em>See Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., </em>485 U.S. 271, 289, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988). Appellee properly scheduled the parole rehearing in accordance with the applicable regulations for D.C.Code offenders. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.75(a), 2.80(j)(1), (m)(1); (m)(3) (2000). Appellant\u2019s due process claim fails because he has not shown that a constitutionally protected liberty interest was violated. <em>See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-19\">Additionally, appellant\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clause claim fails. <em>See Blair-Bey v. Quick, </em>159 F.3d 591, 592 (D.C.Cir.1998) (on petition for reh\u2019g). Under the prior regime, appellee\u2019s predecessor had the discretion to consider the inmate\u2019s offense, and a change merely in the manner in which appellee exercises its discretion does not offend the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See Blair-Bey v. Quick, </em>151 F.3d 1036, 1047 (D.C.Cir.1998) (citing 9 D.C.R.R. \u00a7 105.1(a)-(f) (1981)); <em>Warren v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>659 F.2d 183, 195 (D.C.Cir.1981). Finally, no \u201cdouble counting\u201d occurred because the information concerning the nature of the crime contributed to two distinct determinations. Independent of the scoring determination, appellee weighed the unusually dangerous nature of appellant\u2019s offense as a factor in determining appellant\u2019s next hearing date. <em>See Hall v. Henderson, </em>672 A.2d 1047, 1056 (D.C.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
