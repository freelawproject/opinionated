Solomon, J.), entered April 1, 2010, which granted the motion of plaintiffs\u2019 class counsel for approval of attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $200,000, modified, on the law and the facts, to the extent of remanding the matter to Supreme Court for an evidentiary hearing to determine an appropriate award of attorneys\u2019 fees, and otherwise affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The subject motion seeks attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in connection with the settlement of two related class actions. Plaintiffs brought the actions alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and violation of the Labor Law, to obtain prevailing wages for work they had performed at New York City public schools pursuant to public contracts. Following more than five years of litigation, the parties entered into a stipulation of class action settlement (stipulation), pursuant to which defendant-appellant was to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the difference between the wages paid to class members and prevailing wages, provided that the total settlement amount not exceed $600,000. Also pursuant to the stipulation, defendant agreed to pay class counsel\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, provided such fees were reasonable and did not exceed $200,000. Pursuant to procedures outlined in the stipulation, plaintiffs\u2019 total recovery was determined to be $116,648.66.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The court properly applied the lodestar method to calc\u00falate plaintiffs\u2019 class counsel\u2019s fee rather than the percentage method <em>(see Nager v Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys. of City of N.Y., </em>57 AD3d 389 [2008], <em>lv denied </em>13 NY3d 702 [2009]; <em>Flemming v Barnwell Nursing Home &amp; Health Facilities, Inc., </em>56 AD3d 162, 165-166 [2008], <em>affd </em>15 NY3d 375 [2010]). However, the record demonstrates that class counsel failed to establish through competent evidence that its fees were consistent with \u201ccustomary fee[s] charged for similar services by lawyers in the community with like experience and of comparable reputation,\u201d or were reasonable <em>(Friedman v Miale, </em>69 AD3d 789, 791-792 [2010], <em>lv denied </em>16 NY3d 706 [2011] [internal quotation marks omitted]). Class counsel also failed to submit evidence reflecting the training, background, experience and skill of some individual attorneys who performed work in connection with the class actions <em>(see Matter of Rahmey v Blum, </em>95 AD2d 294, 302 [1983]). The record reflects that a great deal of expense on all sides could have been avoided had plaintiffs\u2019 claims been appropriately investigated before a lawsuit was filed; concomitantly the number of hours expended was apparently excessive. In our view, the court should have undertaken an analysis as to whether all 1,256 hours expended by class counsel\u2019s attorneys, and the 433 hours worked by its paralegals, were useful and reasonable <em>(see Lunday v City of Albany, </em>42 F3d 131, 134 [2d Cir 1994]).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Notwithstanding the motion court\u2019s observations that the litigation was \u201ccontentious,\u201d \u201cheated\u201d and \u201chard-fought,\u201d in light of the fact that the fee far exceeded plaintiffs\u2019 recovery, we remand the matter to Supreme Court for an evidentiary hearing to determine an appropriate amount of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded <em>(see Friar v Vanguard Holding Corp., </em>125 AD2d 444, 447 [1986]). Concur \u2014 Friedman, Catterson and Rom\u00e1n, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Mazzarelli, J.E, and Manzanet-Daniels, J, dissent in part in a memorandum by Mazzarelli, J.E, as follows: I agree with the majority that the motion court properly applied the lodestar method in ascertaining the appropriate fee due to class counsel. However, the record reflects that the court, which was intimately familiar with the contentious nature of a litigation that was ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>gressively litigated by both sides, gave appropriate consideration to each of the lodestar factors, including the quality of class counsel\u2019s representation. Accordingly, a hearing on the application would be a poor allocation of judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">It is well established that a trial court\u2019s fee award in a class action is entitled to broad deference, \u201cand will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion, such as a mistake of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding\u201d <em>(Goldberger v Integrated Resources, Inc., </em>209 F3d 43, 47 [2d Cir 2000]).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This is because the trial court \u201cis intimately familiar with the nuances of [a] case, [and] is in a far better position to [rule on a fee application] than is an appellate court, which must work from a cold record\u201d <em>(In re Bolar Pharm. Co., Inc., Sec. Litig., </em>966 F2d 731, 732 [2d Cir 1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Disregarding these principles, the majority would remand this matter, and direct the court to engage in \u201can analysis as to whether all 1,256 hours expended by class counsel\u2019s attorneys, and the 433 hours worked by its paralegals, were useful and reasonable.\u201d This, the majority maintains, is necessary because the court did not account for expenses which \u201ccould have been avoided had plaintiffs\u2019 claims been appropriately investigated before a lawsuit was filed.\u201d However, the majority ignores several facts. First, the court has already analyzed the six lodestar factors, one of which is the quality of the representation provided. In addition, as the court expressly noted, the fee awarded to class counsel is 49% less than the amount actually billed. This reduction, it is reasonable to assume, more than embraces any work related to plaintiffs\u2019 unsuccessful attempt to have subclasses certified in connection with certain projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Further, it is unfair for the majority to characterize the amount of fees billed as primarily owing to strategic choices made by class counsel. After all, defendants also litigated the matter aggressively, making strategic choices which drove up class counsel\u2019s fees. In retrospect, some of these choices could be seen as ill-advised, such as prosecuting two unsuccessful appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The case which the majority relies on in suggesting that a more detailed analysis of the billings is necessary, <em>Lunday v City of Albany </em>(42 F3d 131, 134 [2d Cir 1994]), is readily distinguishable. In that case, a district judge presided over the merits of the litigation, and the fee application was decided by a magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>trate judge. Here, of course the same court that oversaw the a matter, which it described as \u201chard-fought,\u201d considered the fee request. Thus, it was in a far better position to assess an appropriate fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Furthermore, <em>Lunday </em>was decided under a unique set of facts. As in this case, the defendants raised questions about the reasonableness of the amount of time expended by counsel, and the Second Circuit properly stated that there was no requirement \u201cthat the court set forth item-by-item findings concerning what may be countless objections to individual billing items\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Indeed, the court observed that, while the bills submitted by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel were \u201cin certain respects eyebrow-raising ... we cannot conclude that the review conducted by the Magistrate Judge was erroneous, or lacking in care\u201d <em>(id.). </em>However, the <em>sole </em>reason why the court remanded the fee application in <em>Lunday </em>was because of the District Court\u2019s comment that to engage in a detailed review of the submitted billing would be \u201cto demean counsel\u2019s stature as officers of the court\u201d <em>(id. </em>[emphasis omitted]). The Second Circuit, while noting that none of the objections raised by the defendants appeared to be meritorious, remanded to ensure that the magistrate judge\u2019s comment did not reflect a level of undue deference afforded the fee request.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Here, there is no indication that the motion court may have improperly abdicated its obligation to review the fee application. Accordingly, it is appropriate to defer to the court\u2019s determination that the fees awarded were commensurate with the legal work, in light of all of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">I further disagree with the majority that class counsel failed to establish that its fees were consistent with \u201ccustomary fee[s] charged for similar services by lawyers in the community with like experience and of comparable reputation.\u201d The supervising partner swore in his affirmation in support of the application that his hourly rate of $375, reduced to $350 for this matter, is consistent \u201cwith the hourly rates charged by attorneys of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation in New York.\u201d In <em>Friedman v Miale </em>(69 AD3d 789 [2010], <em>lv denied </em>16 NY3d 706 [2011]), the case cited by the majority, the record was \u201cdevoid\u201d of such proof <em>(id. </em>at 791). It is noted that, in opposing the fee application, defendant did not question the reasonableness of class counsel\u2019s hourly rates, raising that objection for the first time on this appeal. Nor, did defendant challenge below the billings by the firm\u2019s associates on the basis that they failed to establish their \u201ctraining, background, experience and skill.\u201d In any event, the supervising partner\u2019s description of the associ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ates\u2019 years of experience as attorneys and the fact that they had assisted him in \u201cnumerous\u201d wage-and-hour law cases were certainly sufficient bases for the court to weigh the reasonableness of the relevant portions of the fee request.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the motion court acted within its broad discretion. Accordingly, I would leave undisturbed the court\u2019s award of fees to plaintiffs.
