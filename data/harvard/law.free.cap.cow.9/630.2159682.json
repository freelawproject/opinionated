On the trial there, \"Mariam Allen, the widow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>of Ephraim Allen, was offered as a witness for the plaintiff; but objected to by the-defendant as interested. She then released Abram. Allen, the plaintiff below, thus: \u201c of and from all and every sum or sums of money which he may recover or obtain, by suit or otherwise, from Anthony I. Blanchard, and which he the said *Anthoxy may owe to the said Abram Allen, as survivor of A. &amp; E. Allen, as partners in the practice of physio and surgery, and which, but for this release, I might be entitled to as the widow of the said Ephraim Allen, deceased. The release was objected to as insufficient to render the releasor a competent witness ; and the court of common pleas sustained the objection. The plaintiff below offering no further evidence, the C. P. directed-the jury to find for the defendant below, which they did. The plaintiff below excepted to the decision excluding the witness ; the cause was brought to the supreme court, by writ of error in behalf of the plaintiff below; and that .court affirmed the decision of the C. P. He then brought error to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-4\">The reasons for the- decision of the S. C. were now assigned as follows, by</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-5\">Sutherland, J. The custom or- law of merchants, excluding survivorship, extends to all traders. Whenever there is a joint undertaking in the way of trade, &amp;c. the jus <em>accrescendi </em>has no application. Thus in Jeffereys <em>v. </em>Small, (1 Vera. 217,) two personshaving jointly stocked a farm, and occupied it as joint tenants, a bill was filed to be relieved against survivorship, one of them being dead. The lord keeper said, if the farm had been taken jointly by them, and proved a good bargain, then the survivor should have had the benefit of it; but as to a stock employed in the way of trade, that should in no case survive. (Coke Lit. 182, a. Lit. s. 282. Viner\u2019s Ab. Survivor (D.) Jac. Law Die. Joint Tenancy, &amp;c.) <em>(a.) </em>The action survives, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>though the interest does not. (Watson\u2019s Law of Partner ship, 298, 450, &amp;c.) The declaration states the defendant below, to have, been indebted to the plaintiff, as survivor of Ephraim Allen, for medicine and attendance, &amp;c. This is sufficient to constitute them merchants or traders, so as to exempt them from the op eratiesa of the <em>jus </em>accrescendi, which is now regarded as odious. *A moiety of the Recovery, then would belong <em>to the </em>estate of the deceased partner, of which his widow would be entitled to her distributive share. A witness is incompetent to increase the fund, out of which he may receive a dividend, or in which he may, in any way, participate. (1 Phil. Ev. 512. 5 John. 258, 427. 1 Mass. Rep. 239. 2 Day, 466. 1 Camp. N. P. C..381. 2 Camp. N. P. C. 301. 2 New Rep. 331.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-10\">The assets of a deceased partner are liable for the debts of the firm, if they cannot be collected from the survivor. (2 John. Ch. Rep. 508. 1 Cain. Cas. Er. 122.) But so far as the interest of the witness resulted from the tendency of her testimony to increase the fund in which she was entitled to share, it was capable of being removed by a release. The case of Wood <em>v. </em>Williams, (9 John. 123,) is precisely in point to show that the interest of the witness in this case might be released. It was a present right, to take effect <em>in futuro, </em>and such a right may be released. (Coke Lit. 265, a.) But here there was no privity between the witness and the plaintiff in the cause to whom the release was given ; she could in no event have any claim or right of action against him, in respect to this demand. The personal representatives of the deceased partner were entitled to his share of what might be recovered, and it may admit of very serious doubt, whether the release would be available to the plaintiff, in an action brought by those representatives against him; and if it could not, it is very clear, that it could not prevent the widow from recovering her distributive share from the representatives of her husband. (Com. Dig. tit. Release, B.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-12\">But if the plaintiff should fail in this action, the estate of the deceased partner would be liable to contribute to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>costs, and the witness, in that point of view, had an interest in the success of the suit, not effected by the release, and which, of course, rendered her incompetent. She was therefore properly rejected.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b661-4\"><em>S. </em>Stevens, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhjJ\">stated the following points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-5\">I. The plaintiff is entitled, by the <em>jus accrescendi, </em>to all the partnership debts. Mariam Allen was, therefore, a competent witness without a release.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-6\">*2. If the witness had any interest in the subject matter of the suit, it was a present right to take effect <em>in futuro; such a right may be presently </em>released; <em>her release, therefore, rendered her a competent witness.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-7\">3. A possible or contingent interest may be released, and if the person to whom the release is made cannot take the thing released, the <em>release </em>will operate by way of extinguishment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-8\">4. But the release from the witness in this case was operative to the plaintiff, and conveyed to him her right to that demand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-9\">5. The <em>plaintiff </em>was, therefore, prosecuting the suit for his sole and only benefit, and he alone would be responsible for the costs if he failed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b661-10\"><em>J. Willard, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2y\">stated the following points:</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-11\">1. The witness offered was interested, because in the event of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, she, as widow of the deceased partner, would be entitled to one third part of the share belonging to the estate of her husband, by the statute of distributions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-12\">2. The witness -was interested, because, if the plaintiff failed in the suit, the costs consequent thereon would be a charge on the partnership fund, and would diminish, <em>pro rata, </em>her distributive share therein.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b661-13\">3. The interest could not be released, in the first case, because it is a mere contingent interest; and in the second, because the interest depending on the. witness\u2019 loss, is not the object of a release from her. \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b662-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>4. If the interest Contemplated in the first point is- suscep tibie of being released, it was- not discharged by the release given in- this case, it not having been given to' a person-capable of taking a release.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b662-12\">Jones, Chancellor,</author>\n<p id=\"AlOk\">was in favor of affirming the judgment below, for reasons substantially the same \"as assigned by that court.-</p>\n<p id=\"b662-13\">Jordan, Senator; desired to be excused' from giving any opinion, as. he was counsel in a cause involving precisely the same question as this.
