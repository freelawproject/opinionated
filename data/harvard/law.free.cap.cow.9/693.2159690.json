Bealls, the said Joseph D. Bealls was, and did become totally insolvent, which fact being well known to the said plaintiff and the said three other defendants, they, the said three other defendants, before the delivery of the said writ to the said Joseph D.

Bealls from the said office of deputy sheriff, for the purpose of indemnifying them, the said three other defendants, as the bail of the said Joseph D. Bealls against the insolvency of the said Joseph D. Bealls, which the said plaintiff neglected to do; whereby the said three other defendants, as the bail of the said Joseph D. Bealls, were deprived of any means of indemnifying *themselves against the insolvency of the said Joseph D.

Bealls after the issuing thereof, to wit, on the 13th day of January, 1818; and after the return day thereof, to wit, on the 20th day of April, 1822, a, rule was entered in this same court, requiring the said David J. Andrus to return the said <em>testatum fieri facias </em>within 20 days after he should have notice of the said rule, or that an attachment would issue against him; notice of which said rule was given to the said David J. Andrus after the entry thereof, to wit, on the 30th day of April aforesaid, according to the rules and practice of the said court; previous to which last mentioned day, and after the return day of said writ, the said Joseph D. Bealls became notoriously insolvent; and afterwards, to wit, on the 20th day of July, in the year last aforesaid, the said David J. Andrus, not having returned the said writ in pursuance of'the said rule, a writ of attachment was issued against him, for his default in not returning the said writ, in favor of the people of the state of New York, directed to the sheriff of Jefferson county, by which said writ the said sheriff was commanded to attach the said David J. Andrus, and him safely keep, \u00a1so that he might have him before the justices of the people of the state of New York, of the supreme court of judicature of the same people, at the cap\u00edtol in the city of Albany, on the first Monday-of August then next, to answer for certain trespasses and contempts in the said court done and committed ; and after the delivery of the said writ of attachment to the said sheriff, and before the return day thereof, to wit on the first day of August, in the year last aforesaid, he the said sheriff arrested the said David J. Andrus by his body, by virtue of the said writ, and detained him in his custody thereon; until afterwards, to *wit, on the same day and year last aforesaid, the said David J. Andrus appeared before one of the judges of the court of common pleas in and -for the county \u00a1of Jefferson, and then and there, with one George Andrus as his surety, entered into a recognizance before the said judge, conditioned that the said David ( J. Andrus should appear according to the exigency of the said writ; and the sheriff then and there, after the taking of the said recognizance, permitted the said David J. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>dms to go wheresoever he would, out of his custody. And the said three defendants last named further say, that the said David J. Andrus did not appear according to the exigency of the said writ, but made default therein, by means whereof the said recognizance became forfeited, and was afterwards, to wit, on the seventeenth day of August afore said prosecuted in this same court; and afterwards, to wit, at the October term of this same court, of the year last aforesaid, judgment was recovered by default against the said David J. Andrus and George Andrus, for the penalty of the said recognizance; upon which judgment execution issued, directed to the sheriff of Jefferson county, and upon that execution and no other, the said David J. Andrus paid the said $165 mentioned in the said declaration; so the said three defendants last named say that the said David J. Andrus paid the said sum of money for his own negligence and default, and not for any default of the said Joseph D. Bealls, in his said office of deputy sheriff, under the said plaintiff, as sheriff as aforesaid; and this they are ready to verify. Wherefore, &amp;c. Bealls also pleaded. Imparlance to August term, 1823. Similiter as to the first plea, and demurrer and joinder as to the 2nd and 3rd pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b733-4\"><em>R. Lansing &amp; E. Ten Eyck, </em>in support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b733-5\">1. As to the plea of notice to remove the deputy, if available at all, it must be so as setting up a release by operation of law, to which it bears no analogy, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We agree that courts have gone far to protect sureties against the fraud and connivance of the obligee; and when any act has been done by him which may in any way injure the surety, courts are very glad to lay hold of it in his favor.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> But in all the cases where sureties have been relieved, it was on account of *some act of the obligee contrary to good faith; or the neglect to do some act' required by law, or by the express agreement of the parties. The People <em>v. </em>Jansen, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> which will doubtless be relied on by the defendants, bears no analogy to the present. So also of Rathbone <em>v. </em>Warren, <footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the first the plaintiffs had disobeyed the express injunctions of the statute which required them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>remove the defaulting officer; and the ease is put upon that ground. The latter was on the ground that the payee had, by a written agreement, extended the time of paym\u00e9nt without the consent of the surety. Here was no duty to remove Bealls. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Only three of the bail made the request. The other three do not join in the plea, and must be considered as consenting to his continuance in office. Insolv ency does not incapacitate him. Poverty will not do it He may still be honest. . The bond was general, <em>-during his continuance in .office, </em>which was during the plaintiff\u2019s pleasure. This the bail knew when they gave the bond; and the duration of their liability was known to depend on the same pleasure. A surety cannot discharge himself whenever he pleases. If these bail are discharged, the same rule must apply to officers of government, who hold their offices during pleasure, which, we believe, was never pretended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b734-13\">The only analogous case is Payn <em>v. </em>Packard, <footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> There the plea was that the surety was injured by the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to prosecute the principal on request; and it was holden good. But here is no averment of loss, or that the default was the effect of insolvency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b734-14\">Again; the plea is bad because nothing can be pleaded to a <em>sci.fa. </em>which might be pleaded to the original action. <footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> The plea should therefore aver expressly that the matter of defence arose after the original judgment: and not leave this to inference. It is, <em>quasi, </em>a plea <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>which requires great certainty, <footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b734-15\"><em>2. </em>The second plea to which we have demurred, is no answer to the declaration. This sets up damages arising from Bealls\u2019 neglect to pay over monies; and the manner in which we were proceeded against is no defence. The defendants might as well set up any other proceeding in bar. Besides, *the very facts set up in this plea are sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover; for the plea must be based upon the idea that Bealls had neglected to return the <em>fi-fa. </em>mentioned. If of any avail, it goes only to the costs; and is bad as being an answer to only a part of the action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>W. D. Ford &lt;\u00a7\u2022 D. Tillinghast, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afy\">relied on the cases of Payn <em>v. </em>Packard and the People <em>v. </em>Jansen, which they said are not distinguishable in principle from the \"present case. The former furnishes a precedent for the first special plea. It underwent great consideration, and was affirmed in the court of errors, <footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In King <em>v. Baldwin,</em><footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the chief justice in delivering the opinion of the court, says of that case, \u201cThe principle adopted was, that where the creditors did an act injurious to the surety, or omitted to do an act when required, which equity and his duty to the surety enjoined it upon him to do, and which omission was injurious to the surety, in either of these cases the surety would be discharged.\u201d If the surety can protect himself by calling on the creditor to enforce payment, the reason is much stronger that he should be heard when he requests that a further debt should not be incurred. The People <em>v. </em>Berner &amp; Borst <footnotemark><em>(j)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>also sustains this plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-4\">It is a plain rule of common sense, that a surety ought never to be bound against his will, nor for a greater length of time than he sees fit. Common honesty and fair dealing require that when a man becomes bail or surety, he should have the power of extricating himself whenever he pleases. So is the case of special bail and bail to the sheriff. A request to the authority having the power of removal, would undoubtedly be sufficient for the surety in all cases, whether-of the government or individuals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-5\">True, as to the public, Bealls was in office during the plaintiff\u2019s will; but when the rights of the surety are in question, he must exercise that will for their benefit, or take the consequences upon himself. The sureties do not seek his discharge; but simply to secure themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-6\">*It appears on the face of the declaration that this matter of defence arose after judgment. Besides, the rule confining a plea to a <em>set. fa. </em>to subsequent matter, applies to those cases only where execution is sought for the money recovered by the original judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b735-7\">The facts in the second plea amount to a release by operation of law. Whenever the Obligee does any act, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>omits to do any act, by which the terms of the original undertaking are varied, the obligors are exonerated from liability.<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> ' Permitting the recognizance to be forfeited by his non-appearance, precluded all defence. Yet there was a defence. Barnes neglected for 4 years' to call for a return of <em>the fi. fa; </em>and in the' mean time Bealls failed. Such a delay discharged the sheriff from liability.<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark> In Rathbone <em>v. </em>Warren, all the cases upon this point are ably reviewed by the late chief justice, He says, \u201cthere can be no transaction with the principal debtor, without acquainting the surety who has a deep concern in it. You cannot keep him bound, and transact his affairs Without consulting him.\u201d The forfeiture of the recognizance shut out the defence of laches, and worked such a change in the rights of the parties, as to make the doctrine of Rathbone <em>v. </em>Warren applicable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b736-11\">Again; the plea shows that no default has been committed by Bealls, for which Andrus has been made liable. The recovery was for Andrus\u2019 non-appearance upon the recognizance, as is confessed by the demurrer. Had he appeared on the return of the attachment, it is shown expressly that he would have been discharged. In the People v. Spraker,<footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark> it is said that the recovery upon the recognizance is only argumentatively evidence of default in office by the sheriff. Equity and good faith towards the bail required that he should have appeared and saved their defence. His own, not Bealls\u2019 neglect, was the occasion of his being made liable, <em>!/</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b727-35\"> See also Bernard <em>v. </em>Darling, 11 Wen. 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b727-36\"> This cause was decided in August term, 1824.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b733-10\"><em> </em>Bac.
