Bryant continued in possession till about 1805, when M. Pitney, the father of Aaron &amp; Joseph T. Pitney, claimed the whole lot; and Bryant compromised with M. Pitney, surrendering part of the lot to him, and retaining another part to himself. Ihe defendant went \u2022into possession six or seven years before the trial, under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>quit-claim deed from Joseph T. Pitney, who derived title from his father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-9\">The judge expressed his opinion to the jury, that the evidence adduced on the part of the defendant established such a possession adverse to the plaintiff\u2019s title, for more than twenty years, as, in law, would bar the entry of the plaintiff; and the jury found for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b682-10\"><em>*H.

He said Bryant\u2019s title could not be connected with M. Pitney\u2019s, who claimed adversely to B. There was no privity between them. The former claimed) and came in under a title paramount to B\u2019s.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b682-11\"><em>D.

Leonard, the defendant, showed nothing like an adverse possession for 20 years. He purchased of Joseph T. Pitney only six or seven years before the trial, and then entered upon the lot for the first time. . Bryant swears expressly that he never sold to Leonard, or put him in possession of any part of the lot. Whether Bryant, or those claiming under him, could protect themselves on the ground of adverse possession, is not material; for' there was no privity between them and the defendant; and no continuity of Bryant\u2019s possession is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">In Brandt <em>v. </em>Ogden, (1 John. Rep. 159,) <em>Spencer, </em>J. says, \u201c Smeed\u2019s possession is not connected with that of Wing, nor is the defendant\u2019s with that of Smeed. There is no <em>continuity of possession. </em>Under these circumstances it cannot be pretended that this is an adverse possession of twenty years.\u201d So in Doe <em>v. </em>Campbell, (10 John. 477,) the court say, <em>\u201c </em>but the decisive objection to this defence (of adverse possession) is, that no regular deduction of title,' or privity and continuity of possession, was shown and deduced down from Smith to Elliott, or'tc any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>other defendants. Adverse possession must be marked by definite boundaries, and be regularly continued down, to render it availing.\u201d <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">New trial granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b683-36\"> Humbert <em>v. </em>Trinity Church, 24 Wen. 586.
