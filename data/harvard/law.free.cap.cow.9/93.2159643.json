This objection was overruled by the judge, and the deed was read |-0 j.^e jury..</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-5\">The defendant next gave in evidence a deed from Joseph Lay to Thomas Ocman and John Yost, for the whole lot, dated May 2d, 1796, acknowledged the. 29th of April, 1797, before Henry Van Rensselaer, master in chancery, and recorded in the Onondaga clerk\u2019s office, May 5th, 1797.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-6\">The defendant then offered in evidence a deed from John Yost and wife to Isaac Jerome, for two undivided fifths of the lot, dated May 10th, 1825, and acknowledged, as appeared from a certificate thereon, before Luther F. Stevens, first judge of Seneca county, a counsellor, &amp;c. and recorded in the county of Oswego, September 23d, 1826.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-7\">This evidence was objected to by the counsel for the plaintiff, on the ground that there was no certificate of the clerk of the county of Seneca attached to the deed, showing Mr. Stevens to be the first judge of Seneca county, and authorized to take the acknowledgment in pursuance of the fifth section of the act, (sess. 41, ch. 55, 4 Laws 44, 45, c,) passed March 24th, 1818. This objection was overruled by his honor the judge, who decided, that as the certificate showed Judge Stevens to be a counsellor, &amp;c. there was no necessity for any certificate from the county clerk.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-8\">The defendant next produced in evidence a' quit-claim deed from Isaac Jerome and wife to him, the defendant, for two undivided fifths of the lot, dated June 2d, 1825, duly acknowledged and recorded July 15th, 1826, in Oswego county.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0a\">For the purpose of showing an adverse possession for 20 years, and to impeach the plaintiff\u2019s title, the defendant called a witness, who testified as to various acts of possession and ownership by Fowler, in respect to the lot, and by part of *those claiming under him in virtue of the above deeds. The possession under Fowler commenced 35 years before the trial; but it did not appear to have been continued and connected with the defendant; but was interrupted by Barnes\u2019 entry. Nor did the possessions under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>claim of title appear to have been continued 20 years, by those under whom the defendant now claimed. The plaintiff called Elizabeth Barber again, with a view to establish circumstances inconsistent with a fact of the patentee having executed the deed to Fowler. Among other things, she testified, that her husband (the patentee) was a bad writer, but kept a book account, which, being shown to her, she recognized as his, although, on the book being presented to her, she could not read it. She was an aged woman, and had no spectacles. The book had not been in her possession for a year last past, but had been in possession of Giles Howland. The accounts purported to be dated at Stephentown, in 1797, where her husband then lived. She also testified that her husband wrote his surname with a small <em>b, </em>and that it was a subject of frequent conversation in the family, and that he spelled his name Abraham; that the name of Abraham Barnes had been cut out of the account book in one place, where he had signed it to a receipt of a settlement by one Cook.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-5\">It appeared from the deed offered in evidence by the defendant from Barnes to Fowler, that Barnes\u2019 given name was spelt Abrahem, and his surname written with a large capital B.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">The plaintiff then offered to prove that the said account book was in the genuine hand writing of said Barnes, and that his name appearing therein twice, was written by himself in 1797, and was spelt and written in the manner Elizabeth Barber declared he usually wrote and spelt his name; and that there was no similarity between the hand writing of Barnes in the account book and the signature to the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">This evidence was objected to by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and rejected by the judge, on the ground that it would be a comparison of hand writing, which he held inadmissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-8\">*The plaintiff then offered to prove that the part of the account book which appeared to be in the hand writing of Barnes was the genuine hand writing of Barnes, with a view to submit the book and deed to the inspection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>jury, which was also objected to by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and rejected by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-9\">After the plaintiff had called a witness, who had seen Barnes (the patentee) write, and who gave an opinion against the genuineness of the signature to Fowler\u2019s deed, he (the plaintiff) offered to prove by the same witness, that the hand writing in the account book was the genuine hand writing of Barnes. This was objected to by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and rejected by the judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-10\">Here the plaintiff rested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-11\">The defendant then offered in evidence a lease from John Yost to Abraham Barnes, for a part of the lot in'question, how much did not appear, bearing date June 13, 1806, to which the signature purporting to be that of Barnes, was made by spelling his first name. Abrahem, and writing his surname with a capital B, The lease purported to be executed in the presence of two witnesses, Abraham Hugunin and Peter Hugunin, both living at the\" time of the trial within the jurisdiction of the'court; but neither of them called to prove the execution. The defendant offered it as having been proved in pursuance of the first section of the act of 1813, concerning deeds, (sess, 36, ch. 97, \u00a7 1, 1 R. L. 369 ;) and the certificate of proof endorsed thereon, was in the words and figures following, viz, \u201c State of New York, Os-wego county, ss; on the 38th day of December, in the year of .our Lord, eighteen hundred and twenty-six, personally appeared before me Abraham Hugunin, to me personally known, who being duly sworn, deposeth and says, that he is personally acquainted with John Yost and Abraham Barnes, the grantors within named and described, and that the said John Yost and Abraham Barnes did acknowledge to him the said Abraham Hugunin, that they did sign, seal, and deliver the within instrument, as their voluntary act and deed, and for \"the uses and purposes therein mentioned, and that this deponent, subscribed *his name thereto as a witness at the same time. All which is satisfactory evidence to me of the due execution of said instrument. Peter D.

Peter Hugunin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-9\">This objection was overruled by the judge, and the lease was read to the jury for the purpose of showing an acknowledgment and acquiescence by Barnes in Yost\u2019s title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-10\">The defendant then gave further evidence as to the possession and acts of ownership by those claiming under Fowler. But the possession was not continued for 20 years, nor connected with the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-11\">Here the testimony closed, and the judge in charging the jury, among other things, stated that long possessions according to a title or claim, though they were interrupted and not continued for 20 years, were strong evidence in support of that title; which position of his honor was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-12\">The jury found a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-13\">A motion was now made, in behalf of the plaintiff, for a new trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-14\"><em>B.

By the \u00a1 * of January 8th, 1794, (sess. 17, ch. 1, \u00a7 1, 1 R. L. 209,) a*, deeds concerning the military lands, were, previous to the 1st of May, 1794, to be deposited with the clerk of Albany, who was by the 1st of June to deliver them to the clerk of Herkimer. If not deposited, they are to be deemed fraudulent and void against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees. This act was amended, and the time of depositing \u2022 enlarged to the 1st of May, 1795, by the act of March 27th, 1794. (1 R. L. 211, 12, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-16\">*This deed was not registered according to law. The first general registry act was that of February 26th, 1788; (2 Greenleaf\u2019s Laws, 99;) the next registry law was the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>of the 8th January, 1794, (1 R. L. 209,) already cited, and respects military lands only. By this, all deeds executed after the act passed must be recorded, in order to have effect against purchasers. Another general registry act passed in 1813, (sess. 36, ch. 97, 1 R. L. 369.) The 7th section of this act authorizes certain deeds, acknowledged previous to 1801, to be recorded; but it excepts deeds relating to the military tract, which were not deposited with the clerk of Albany previous to May, 1795. By these acts relating to military lands, the deeds, in order to be effectual, must be recorded in the clerk\u2019s office of the county of Herkimer, and the identity of the grantor must be shown. (1 R. L. 219.) By the act of February 4th, 1814, (sess. 37, ch. 5, 3 Laws, 9, c,) deeds of military land, executed previous to May 1st, 1797, could not be recorded unless acknowledged according to the 1st section of the general registry act of 1813. And the statute of April 14th, 1820, (sess. 43, ch 245, \u00a7 3, 5 Laws, 248, c,) is peremptory that no deed con. cerning these bounty lands, executed previous to May, 1797, shall be read in evidence, unless it be acknowledged or proved according to the first section of the act of April 12th, 1813. There cannot be a pretence that this deed does not come within that act. The officer does not certify that he knew the witness, or that the witness knew the grantor. Recording in the secretary\u2019s office did not remedy the defect. We are aware it may be said that a vested right to give this deed in evidence, was acquired under the act of 1788, according to which it was acknowledged; and that such right could not be divested by the act of 1820. But the same objection may be made against the act of 1794, and indeed all the provisions of the various acts to prevent frauds in respect to any deeds executed previous to their passage. Yet these statutes have always been acted upon. Jackson <em>v. </em>Howe, (19 John. 80,) was the case of a deed duly deposited and properly recorded before the act of 1820 passed. It was holden that such a deed was not affected by the subsequent statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-9\">*That is not this case. Here the leed was never deposited and never properly recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The acknowledgment of the deed from Olcott to Lay m April, 1796, being under the act of 1788, is now admitted to be sufficient, although the witness who proved the identity of the grantor was not named.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-4\">But it is insisted that there should have been a certificate that Mi Stevens was the first judge of Seneca county, to warrant the reading of the deed from Yost and wife to Jerome. This is virtually required by the act of March 24th, 1818, (sess. 41, ch. 55, \u00a7 5, 4 Laws, 44, 5, c.) By this act, no deed proved or acknowledged before a county judge can be recorded in any county of which he is not a judge, without the certificate of the clerk of his county authenticating his signature. True, by the act of the same session, of-April 20th, 1818, (ch. 195, \u00a7 1, 4 Laws, c,) judges of the common pleas of the degree of counsel, are authorised to perform all the chamber duties of a judge of the supreme court, of which the acknowledging or taking the proof of deeds is one; but this does not repeal the former act requiring a certificate. They are still local officers ; and the principle of the former act applies. The clerks were in danger of being imposed upon by forgeries. This was the evil; and the mischief is not removed by the circumstance that the judge is of the degree of counsel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-5\">It was competent for the plaintiff to prove Barnes\u2019 hand writing in his account book, to show the character of his hand, as well as the manner in which he spelt his name, and how he wrote it. It was important to show the dissimilarity between his name and hand writing at the date of his book, and the signature to the deed. It was at any rate admissible as refreshing the recollection of witnesses on the question of hand writing. It was also proper for the jury to make the comparison.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-6\">In Allesbrook v. Roach, (1 Esp. Rep. 351,) the jury were permitted to compare the signature to the instrument in question with specimens admitted to be the hand of the party who signed; and Lord Kenyon there pronounces distinctly in favor of a comparison of hands. The witness need not always *have seen the party write, or corres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ponded with him. It has been a long time the uniform practice at the <em>oyer and terminer </em>to prove the forgery of bank bills, without the witness either having seen the bank officers write, or corresponded with them. In State v. Bronson, (1 Root, 307,) the rule is laid down by the court generally, that comparison of the hand writing of the party-is admissible evidence even in a criminal prosecution ; and like all other evidence, to be left to the jury. In Titford <em>v. </em>Knott, (2 John. Cas. 211, 214,) this court held' that a witness was not confined to knowledge from seeing the party write, or corresponding with him; that he might be guided by his knowledge derived from authentic papers in the course of business, or, having in either of these ways acquired some knowledge of the hand, he might fortify his memory by a comparison of hands in court. (Burr <em>v. </em>Harper, 1 Holt\u2019s N. P. Cas. 420, S. P.) In Revet <em>v. </em>Braham, (4 T. R. 497, 1 Phil. Ev. 373, S. C,) a witness was allowed to speak to hand writing merely from his skill in detecting forgeries. And ancient writings may be proved, and (by parity of reason) disproved by a mere comparison of hands. (1 Phil. Ev. 372, 3, and the cases there cited, Am. ed. of 1820. Roe <em>v. </em>Rawlings, 7 East, 282, and note <em>(a) </em>there. 14 East, 327.) In Jackson <em>v. </em>Vanduzen, (5 John. 144,) the mark of a witness to a will was proved by comparison; the witness proving it, having seen him make his mark but once.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-8\">The lease purporting to have been made from Yost to Barnes, was not sufficiently proved.

L. 369, <em>\\ </em>1,) is that a deed must be proved by the <em>subscribing </em>witness. This must mean the witness who saw the original execution, or witnessed the deed at that time in fact. The proof here is no more than a\u00abbare confession of the party that he gave the lease. This is insufficient where there is a subscribing witness.

(Jackson <em>v. </em>How, 19 John. 80.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-7\">The first act in relation to the proof and recording of deeds given for military bounty lands, was passed on the 8th day of January, 1794, (1 R.

L. 212,) the time for depositing such deeds was prolonged until the 1st day of May, 1795.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-9\">By the first act, two kinds of deeds are spoken of, viz. deeds then executed at the time of passing the act, and deeds to be thereafter executed. The first were required to be deposited, and the last to be recorded. The deeds, which were filed, were not required to be recorded, and subsequent deeds could not gain a preference although they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>might be first recorded. In speaking of the manner in which \u201csuch deeds\u201d should be acknowledged, the legislature evidently had Reference to such deeds as were spoken of in the next preceding sentence, and which were deeds thereafter to be executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">The next act which-can have any bearing upon the deed in question, was passed the 14th of April, 1820, (sess. 43, ch. 245, 5 Laws, 248, b;) by the 3d section of which it is enacted \u201cthat no deed, conveyance or writing, relating to the title or property of any lands granted by this state as bounty lands to the officers and troops of this state who served in the army of the United States, executed on or before the first day of May, 1797,\u201d (see act of 12th February, 1798. 1. R L. 216,) \u201c shall hereafter be read in evidence in any court of this state, unless the same be acknowledged or proved according to the provisions of the first section of the act entitled, \u2018An act concerning deeds,\u2019 passed \u201ethe 12th day'of April, 1813; any thing in the seventh section of said act, or any law to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-10\">This section was evidently intended by the legislature to-extend no further than fully to repeal the 7th section therein referred to, which permitted all file deeds acknowledged or proved according to the then existing law, to be recorded and to be read in evidence; the former part pi which was repealed by the act of the 4th of February, 1814, (sess. 37, ch. 5, 3 Laws, 9, b,) leaving that part of the 7th section which authorized deeds so acknowledged to be read in evidence, in full force. And such are the constructions which have been virtually put upon the act of 1820, by the decision of this court in the cases of <em>Jackson, ex dem. </em>Yates, <em>v. </em>How, (19 John. 80,) and Jackson, <em>ex dem. </em>Hungerford and others, <em>v. </em>Eaton, (20 John. 478.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-11\">But few deeds for military lands were recorded before the 8th day of January, 1794. A vast many were recorded between that day and the 1st day of May, 1795, oeing the day limited for depositing them with the clerk of Albany, which recording was done for the purpose of preserving the evidence of the titles to the lands, as the deeds were to be placed beyond the control of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>owners. Certificates from the clerk of Cayuga county and the secretary will show this to be true. The practice under that act ought to have great weight in giving it a construction. (Jackson <em>v. </em>Gumaer, <em>2 </em>Cowen, 567)</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\">*If the deed was recorded in pursuance of a then existing statute, the legislature could not, by any subsequent statute, destroy the evidence of Fowler\u2019s title. His right became vested and could not be taken away. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">The deed was proved to have come from the proper office, when it was brought to court by the clerk of Cayuga county ; it was on file in his office; and the endorsements upon the back of the deed were as much evidence of its having been deposited with the clerk of Albany county, and recorded in the secretary\u2019s office, as the endorsement upon a judgment recorded or any other paper, would be of the time of filing or docketing such record or paper, which no person has thought proper to question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">The clerk was required by the act of 1794, to register in a book the names of the grantor and grantee; and the date of the deed, and his endorsement of having done so has always been taken as evidence of its having been done, and of the time of depositing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">But the lessors of the plaintiff were not <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, and they cannot object that the deed was not deposited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-8\">All the lessors of the plaintiff, excepting Parker, are heirs at law of the grantor in Fowler\u2019s deed; and Parker, the other lessor, is not a purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-9\">The certificate of acknowledgment of the deed from 01-cott to Lay was sufficient. If it was defective, it was of no consequence, as the deed to Fowler proved a subsisting title out of the lessors of the plaintiff. And the defendant being in possession under color of a <em>bona fide </em>title, may set up a subsisting outstanding title in a stranger, to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, although the defendant has no title in himself.

The reason usually given is, that unless a jury can read, they would be unable to institute a comparison, of judge of the supposed resemblance. Another reason for rejecting' such a comparison seems to be, that the writings intended as specimens to be compared with the disputed paper, would be brought together by a party to the suit, who is interested to select such writings only as may best serve his purpose ; and they are not likely, therefore, to exhibit a fair specimen of the general character of hand writing.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-10\">The latter reason applies with peculiar force in this case; as it appears, the name of Barnes had been cut out of the account book, where he had signed it to a settlement; and the only two places in which his name now appears, are supposed to be those which will best serve the plaintiff\u2019s purpose. The book is produced by the party in interest, and why cut out Barnes\u2019 name in any place, if he wants to exhibit a fair specimen ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-11\">In Stranger <em>v. </em>Searle, (1 Esp. Rep. 14,) Lord Kenyon ruled, that a witness should not be allowed to decide on comparison of hands, although in Allesbrook <em>v. </em>Roach, (1 id. 351,)he permitted it, saying he had always been inclined to admit it. And in The King <em>v. </em>Cator, (4 Esp. Rep. 117,) Hotham, baron, rejected such evidence, after a Yery full argument, and much reflection. (See also the cases collected in a note at the end of this volume, Day\u2019s edition; and also Macferson <em>v. </em>Thoytes, Peak. Cas. 20.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-12\">The case of Jackson ex dem. Van Dusen and others <em>v. </em>Van Dusen, (5 John. 144,) does not overrule the former decisions. This was the case of a will, where one of the .subscribing witnesses made his mark in a peculiar manner. The witness had seen the person make his mark at another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>tim\u00e9, which th\u00e9 witness then had in his possession, and it was accompanied by proof of the declaration of Ohe of the other witnesses in his lifetime, that he and S. W. had subscribed the will as witnesses. Mr. Justice Van Ness says, he does not mean to ^controvert the rule, that a comparison of hands is not competent testimony. The witness signed the initial letters of his name S. W.from the peculiar character and Structure of which, he believed them to have been made by Wheeler.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-4\">In Morewood <em>v. </em>Wood, (14 East, 328;) evidence of comparison of hand writing was*admitted upon the ground that ho better evidence could be obtained, as the person whose hand writing was proved had been long since dead; but ho objection was made to the testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">\u00edn Titford <em>v. </em>KnOtt, (2 John. Cas. 211,) Kent, justice, says, \u201cif the witness has no previous knowledge of the hand, he cannot then be permitted to debid\u00e9 it in court from a comparison of hands.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">Many of the cases reported, which at first would seem to be in favor of admitting such evidence, are in fact against it; such as proving ancient writings by witnesses who have become acquainted with the manner of a person\u2019s sighing his name by*insp\u00e9ctihg other ancient writings, which bear the same signature, and which have been treated and regularly preserved as authentic documents. (Norris\u2019 Peake, 155.) Such proof is not a comparison of hand writing. But the person has gained a knowledge of the general character of the hand, by having frequently s\u00e9en the hand writing which is genuine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-7\">The lease from Yost to Barnes was sufficiently proved. \u2022 The certificate states that Yost and Barnes acknowledged to the witness, \u201c that they did sign, seal and deliver the within instrument as their voluntary act and deed, &amp;c., and that this deponent subscribed his name thereto a\u00a7 a witness, at the' same time; all which is satisfactory evidence to me of the due execution of said instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-9\">It is a very common way of becoming a subscribing witness to a d\u00e9ed. The parties sign, and call upon a person within hearing to step ih and witness it. This was prob\u00e1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>bly done here. At any rate, if the officer was satisfied of the due execution, the court will not look any further. He is the person who interrogates the witness; and after hearing the particulars in ^relation to the execution, he reduces the testimony to form. (Jackson <em>v. </em>Livingston, 6 John. 157.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-9\">Hugenin subscribed his name as a witness, and the court will intend, that it was done at the time of the execution of the lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-10\">As to the objection, that the certificate of judge Stevens on the deed from Yost to Jerome was not duly authenticated ; the judge was a counsellor at law, and took the acknowledgment under his power as a judge of the supreme court at chambers. In such case, a certificate of the clerk is not necessary; and this was held expressly in Jackson <em>v. </em>Chapin, (5 Cowen, 485.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-11\">As to the charge of the judge, the counsel referred to Smith <em>v. </em>Lorillard, (10 John. 355.)</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b98-21\"> But see post 113, n. 1.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUIp\">(after stating the case.) The most important question arises upon the admissibility of the deed from Barnes to Fowler.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">The first objection to this deed is, that it was not proved to have been filed, nor deposited, nor registered according to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">One answer is, that a non-compliance with the act in this case, does not affect the rights of the grantee or his assigns. The statute relied upon, indeed, directs that all deeds theretofore executed, &amp;c. should be deposited ; and if not, they should be adjudged fraudulent and void against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees for valuable consideration ; but not against the grantor and his heirs. The lessors of the plaintiff, in whom any title is pretended, are the children and heirs at law of the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">But another answer, perhaps, may be given, which is, that there is, <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the deed was deposited according to the acts of 1794. It was found in the office where it should be, if it was deposited. It was proved, before the time limited for depositing, and ^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>marked, \u201c <em>Registered April </em>29, 1795.\u201d To this there is no signature, but being in the clerk\u2019s office of Cayuga county, without explanation, and not being recorded, the presumption being in favor of a legal performance of duty by public officers, the deed must have come from the clerk of Albany, through Herkimer and Onondaga. *(See the acts concerning these deeds collected, 1 R. L. 209 to 218.) In neither of the latter offices could the registry have been made. ' None was required by law; but in Albany it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">I think, therefore, the memorandum on the back was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the deposit having been made on the 29th of April, 1795, which was in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The next objection to this deed is, that the proof was defective. The law in force when this deed was executed and proved, was the act of the 26th of February, 1788. By that act, no deed could be recorded without an acknowledgment or due proof by\" one of the subscribing witnesses. That act does not prescribe the form nor the substance of the certificate of the officer taking the acknowledgment or proof; but merely says that a certificate of the acknowledgment or proof should be endorsed upon the deed. By the same act, a deed duly proved and recorded, or the record thereof, might be read in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The act of 1813 required that the certificate of the officer taking the proof should contain the names of the witnesses and their testimony; and the act of 1820 prohibits the reading in evidence of any deed for lands in the military tract, unless acknowledged or proved according to the act of 1813. If the statute of 1820 were to receive a literal construction, this objection must be fatal. <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> But in the case of Jackson <em>v. </em>How, (19 John. 80,) this court, after a critical examination of these several acts, decided that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>only operation of the act of 1820, taken in connection with, the acf of 1814, is to prevent the reading in evidence of an <em>unrecorded </em>deed, although it may have been ackowledged in conformity with the existing laws ; but which the party has, neglected to have recorded in due season. This deed from; Barnes to Fowler, having been proved according to existing laws, and duly recorded, is not embraced in the meaning of the, act of 182Q, and was therefore properly read in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">The next objection is to the deed from Tost to Jerome. It is said there should have been a certificate of the county clerk, that L. F. Stephens was first judge of Seneca, county, although he was a counsellor, &amp;c, This point has been decided. * Where the pro.of or acknowledgment is. taken before a judge of this court, or a commissioner to, perform certain duties of a judge of this court, no. certificate from the county clerk is necessary. The first judge of a court of common pleas being a counsellor of this court, is a commissioner <em>ex officio; </em>and therefore nP certificate is necessary. (5 Cowen, 485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The deed from Barnes to Fowler b.eing properly in evidence, and showing a title out of fhe lessors, they had a right to show that the, deed was a forgery by proper testimony and they contended that Barnes\u2019 account hook was proper for that service, by way of comparison of hand writ-, ing. The rule is settled in England, and I believe, in this state,, that comparison of hands by <em>juxtaposition </em>of two writings, in order to ascertain whether both were written by the same person, is inadmissible <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> (1 Stark. Ev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>654, and 1 Phil. Ev. 438, and the cases there cited.) In some of our sister states the rule is otherwise. <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">In Titford <em>v. </em>Knott, (2 John. Cas. 211,) Kent, justice, says it is usual forwitnesses to prove hand writing from previous knowledge of the hand, derived from having seen the person write, or from authentic papers received in the course of business. If the witness has no previous knowledge of the hand, he cannot then be permitted to decide it in court from a comparison of hands. The same rule is admitted in Jackson <em>v. </em>Van Duzen, (5 John. 155,) and where a different practice has obtained with us, I presume it will be found that the comparison, either by witnesses or by the jury, has been by consent. The reason given for this rule, that the jury may not be able to read, is not satisfactory, and at the present day not well founded in fact, A more satisfactory reason is that' the specimens produced may be selected for the purpose; and another, that if permitted, these specimens may be contested and examined by others, and thus collateral evidence might be introduced to an inconvenient length, and in the end might not be conducive to justice. The book, therefore, was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">There is one other point which it is proper to notice. The certificate of acknowledgment upon the lease from Yost to *Barnes is said to be defective, because the witness does not state that he saw the lease executed. The parties acknowledged it in his presence, and he subscribed it as a witness. The witness must prove the execution of the instrument. Is not that done by an acknowledgment from the parties, and an attestation by the witness ?</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>A deed takes effect from the delivery; and if the parties choose to sign their names alone, and then call witnesses before whom they acknowledge the instrument, that is a good execution. <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> And should some time intervene, (years, if you please,) I can see no difference. It is a re-delivery of the deed which then, at least becomes effectual. This evidence will be good and sufficient to prove the deed in a court of law, and therefore is sufficient before the judge or commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The question of genuineness of the deed was before the jury, upon all the legal evidence on both sides, and they decided in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">The doctrine advanced by the judge in his charge, becomes altogether immaterial. Were the question one of adverse possession, then I apprehend the possession must be continued by an unbroken chain, where there has been a succession of tenants. That was not the question here ; and I am inclined to think the judge correct, that such a possession as was shown was entitled to some weight in fortifying the title of Fowler and those claiming under him. But whether that be so or not, his deed was legally proved, and there was no sufficient evidence to disprove it calculated to shake the finding of the jury. The motion for a new trial must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">New trial denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">END OF MAY TERM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b115-9\"> Since January 1, 1830, the former laws of New York, relative to the proof, acknowledgment, and records of deeds &amp;c. are entirely obsolete, as regards conveyances since that time, still they are often drawn in question, when conveyances acknowledged, proved and recorded under them, are sought to be given in evidence.
