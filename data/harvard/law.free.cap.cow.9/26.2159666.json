The docket of the. -justice was produced, and was in-these .words.: \u201c -William W. Mumford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>v. </em>Archelaus G. Smith.

Judgment for Mumford, the plaintiff below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-13\">S. <em>Boughton, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay\">The judgment, \u25a0 as proved by the justice and the docket, was for <em>costs; </em>not <em>damages and costs, </em>as averred in the declaration. Here is a variance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-15\">The third plea is a good bar. An action on a judgment lay at the common law\u2019before execution; but even there it- was discountenanced. (Biddleson <em>v. </em>Whitel, 1 Bl. Rep. 507. Simpson <em>v. </em>Stone, 2 id. 785.) There the debt was <em>unjustly detained, </em>in the words of the declaration, which is synonymous with <em>unlawfully detained. </em>But the statute, (sess. 47, clr. 238, \u00a7 14,) makes it lawful, under the circumstances disclosed in the plea, to detain the debt. No execution could issue short of 90 days. The legislature intend 1 ed to give the debtor time, without the enormous expense of an immediate suit in the court of record. It makes the debt in nature of one presently due, but payable at a future day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL1\">But the declaration is bad. It does not give the justice jurisdiction of the cause and person, and indeed shows that he rendered judgment for a sum beyond his jurisdiction. No plaint is shown to have been levied or suit commenced; no summoning, apprehending, appearance, confession or hearing of the defendant. (Com. Dig. Pleader, (E. 18,)- and *the authorities there cited.) Sellers <em>v. </em>Lawrence, Willes, 416, Ladbroke <em>v. </em>James, id. 201. 1 Chit. PI. 335. Service <em>v. </em>Hermanee, 1 John. 92. <em>Peeblesv. </em>Kittle, 2 id. 365. Kilburn <em>v. </em>Woodworth, 5 id. 41, and the cases there cited by the court. Pawling <em>v. </em>Bird, 13 id. 206, and the cases there cited. Bowman <em>v. </em>Russ, 6 Cowen, 236.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The jurisdiction of the justice is limited to <em>$50. </em>Here is a recovery as-debt, and damages of more.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-4\"><em>F. Whittlesey, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxJ\">The judgment was proved to have been rendered as set forth in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration; and there was no variance. (3 John. 429. 11 id. 166. 12 id. 296.) The minutes of the justice need not contain a fuE history of the cause. It is enough if the prominent facts appear. The demurrer admits not only these facts, but every inference that a jury might draw from them. As to the objection that the docket proves <em>costs </em>merely, not <em>damages, </em>we say the words <em>damages and costs </em>as here used in declaring, signify <em>costs </em>only. (10 Co. Rep. 115, and the cases there cited. Fitch <em>v. </em>The People, 16 John. 141.) The forms of judgment by confession on penal bonds in this court, confirm that view; and if correct, there is no variance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-7\">The common law, it is admitted, allows debt on judgment immediately. The statute does not take away that right. (Hale <em>v. </em>Angel, 20 John. 342.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-8\">As to the declaration, a <em>recuperavit </em>alone is sufficient, not only in declaring on judgment in courts of record, but inferior courts. (1 Wils. 316. Com. Dig. Pleader, (2 W. 12,) and cases there cited. 1 Chit. Pl. 354, 5, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">If we are correct in the meaning of the words <em>damages and costs, </em>then the justice had jurisdiction of the amount.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-10\"><em>Curia, </em>per Woodworth, J.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB\">As to the declaration, enough is set out to give the court jurisdiction; provided the construction of the allegation touching the amount of of the judgment is, that no more was recovered than 50 dollars besides <em>costs. </em>Justices of the peace have jurisdiction in such cases ; and this concise mode of declaring is sufficient. <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> It is approved in a variety of cases. (1 Chit. Pl. 354. 1 Wils. 316. 1 John. 92. 2 id. 365.)</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b27-11\"> Stiles <em>v. </em>Stewart, 12 Wen. 473.

The docket showed there, was a judgment for $50 debt' and 93 cents costs. The allegation in the1 declaration <em>for his damages sustained as well as costs, </em>is in the usual form where costs only have accrued. So are the entries in'the books of practice.
