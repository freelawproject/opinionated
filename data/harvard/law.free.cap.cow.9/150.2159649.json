Here notice was first given for the fourth term.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">But, under the circumstances of the case, had the motion been made in season, we would allow an opportunity to amend, as it appears the assumpsit clause in the fourth count was in the draft of the declaration, and in the <em>nisi prius </em>record.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The questions on the case <em>arq, first, </em>as to the variance. Though the first three counts are not drawn as artificially as they might have been, yet I incline to the opinion expressed by the judge at the trial, that the evidence supports them all. I think it more particularly applicable to the third.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The judge was right in refusing the nonsuit; and I know of no practice compelling the plaintiff to elect, on the trial, * which of his counts he will apply the evidence to in this action. Where there are several counts in the declaration, and one bad, upon a general verdict, judgment will be arrested unless the verdict can be amended by the judge\u2019s notes, so as to apply it to the good counts; and it is not too late, on a motion in arrest of judgment, for the plaintiff to move for such amendment.

(Bull. N. P. 139. 4 B. &amp; P. 355.) I think, therefore, the judge erred in instructing the jury to find a verdict on the common count.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">A new trial should be granted; the costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">New trial granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\"> Burhans <em>v. </em>Libbits, 1 How.
