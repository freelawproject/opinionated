The declaration was by the plaintiffs, as executors of S.

B. Wheeler assigned the note declared upon to E. &amp; S. - V * ' - P, Gilbert, a\u00a7 collateral security for a judgment obtained by the Gilberts in the supreme court, for $338 58, on the 6th of December, 1823, against the estate of the testator; the money, when received on the note, to b.e applied as payment on the judgment. That this suit was commenced for the sole benefit -of the Gilberts ; and that the defendant had notice of the. assignment on the day of its being made,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-6\">Geppral demurrer and joinder.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-8\"><em>E. Williams, in </em>support of the demurrer.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI7\">It is not denied that this court will notice and protect the interests of an assignee or <em>cestui que </em>trustbut he must be the <em>cestui que tiust </em>of the whole subject matter., (Prescott <em>v. </em>Hull, 17 John. 284.) One of the two executors could not dispose of the property in the note due to his testator in any other way than by collecting it, and applying the avails to the payment of a debt *due from the estate. He has no power to assign for any special purpose. This was not, therefore, and could not be a sale or assignment of the note within the meaning of the cases. The act was void. But at most it is \u00e1 mere pledge; and the court never have gone so far as to protect the mere, mortgagee of a chose in action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-9\">A. <em>Vanderpool, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO\">The assignment to the. Gilberts was valid. There cannot be a doubt that one of the executors had power to assign the note. The argument which would\" defeat the assignment would equally defeat the release. But the right is clear as to both. (Bac. Abr. Executors and Administrators, (D.) and the cases there cited.) The act of one executor is the act of\" both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-10\">The assignees, then had, an authority coupled with an interest. (Canfield <em>v. </em>Monger, 12 John. 346.) There cam not b.e any distinction between persons acting in their oxyn right, and executors, The, latter may compound or arrange debts due from their testator in any way, with the assets in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>th\u00e9ir hands. They may do everything necessary to effect the settlement of claim against them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aof\">It follows that the rel\u00e9ase was void, as being after assignment and notice.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b35-9\"><em>Curia, </em>per Woodworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnI\">It appears, to be w\u00e9ll settled,-that if \u00e1 mail appoint several executors, \"th\u00e9y ar\u00e9 \u00e9ste\u00e9m\u00e9d inl\u00e1w as but onepersonrepresenting the testator; and that acts done by any one of them which relate to the delivery, gift, sale or rele\u00e1s\u00e9 \u00f3f th\u00e9 testator\u2019s goods, ar\u00e9 deemed the acts of all. <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> Thus a term of years pass\u00e9s by the assignment of one ; <footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> and if \u00f3ne rel\u00e9ases \u00e1 debt, it is good, and binds the rest. <footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> (Bac. Abr. Executors and and Administrators, (D.) and th\u00e9 cases th\u00e9r\u00e9 cited.) It was therefore competent for the executor to assign the note; and such assignment was valid so f\u00e1r as respected the general power of the executor, if it cannot be supported, it must be for some other cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">The note was assigned as a collateral security, for the purpose of being collected and applied to the satisfaction of the judgment. The Gilberts had an authority coupled with an interest, which the executor could not divest them of, without paying the judgment to which the note was to be applied. <footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> (Canfield <em>v. </em>Monger, 12 John. 346.)</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">In Prescott v. Hull, (17 John. 292,) the doctrine is laid down, that to defeat the attempt of the assignor to discharge the debt, it- must b\u00e9 \u00e1v\u00e9red by th\u00e9 replication, that the debt was \u00e1ssign\u00e9d for a full and valuable consideration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>expressly avers the latter fact; and as to the consideration, -t wag to gecure anfi discharge the judgment as far as the note would produce that effect. It cannot be doubted that here is a good consideration to support the assignment. The Gilberts could not acquire an interest, if there was not a good consideration to rest on. The case of Canfield <em>v. </em>Monger, was this : A. delivered a note to B. to receive the amount and apply it to the payment of a note from A. to B. This was held to be an equitable assignment, and to .vest an authority and interest in B. and. that the suit is prosecuted for the benefit of th~ assignee. I think this has been done. The replication</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">If this view of the case be correct, the executor could not, by a subsequent release, affect the interest of the Gilberts. Such release, after the assignment and notice, was a nullity. (Littlefield <em>v. </em>Story, 3 John. 426.)</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The demurrer to the replication is not well taken, and the plaintiff is, therefore, entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b35-12\"> Bogart <em>v. </em>Hertell, 4 Hill, 492.
