The agent of Glover (the lessor of the plaintiff) requested one Mason to become obligated to Tallman for the note which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Crarath signed with Noah Parsons ; and Mason paid the note, which was $500.

Kellogg\u2019s object was, to secure a debt due to Glover, (the lessor of the plaintiff,) from Noah Parsons. It was understood that Jared Parsons had bid off the premises on an execution from Noah \"Parsons, but that Crarath had a title to them. It was considered that the note to Tallman was an incumbrance on the premises ; and if Kellogg could take up the note; \"Glover (the lessor of the plaintiff) was to have a mortgage from Jared Parsons for the amount of his debt against Noah Parsons.\" Allen, who drew the second deed, testified that Jared Parsons was not present at the time; and that he, the witness', did not communicate to him the fact \"that there was another d\u00e9ed, until after the execution arid delivery of the mortgage.1 When tie made the communication, Kellogg was not present.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-4\">Kellogg testified that on ttie 27th of June, 1818, Noah Parsons becanie indebted to Glover, (the- lessor of the plaintiff,) in $481 66; that he came to Courtland county as the agent of Glover, to secure his demand ; Noah Parsons agreed to secure it, arid informed him that Jared Parsons owned the property in'consequence of a \"purchase made at sheriff\u2019s sale; that Crarath had not conveyed the property to 'Jared, because he was liable on the note to Tallxrian, but that he would convey it on being'indemnified against the not\u00e9 ; Kellogg procured Mason to secure this note, and Allen then discharged Crarath from it; whereupon Crarath executed the second deed to Jared Parsons, and tie executed the mortgage to Glover, (the lessor of the plaintiff;) that Noah Parsons never informed him (Kellogg) that Crarath had given a\" deed \"to Noah Parsons, nor did Kellogg know of - that deed, until \u25a0 the mortgage was given and record\u00e9d, but he understood the premises were paid for by Noah Parsons, and had been sold on the old\u00e9st judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>against him; Kellogg did not know of the judgment of th\u00ab Marvins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-9\">The defendant gave in evidence a judgment of the Court-land C.

N.o actual personal notice can be pretended ; nor was there any notice to his mortgagor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-12\">B.ut suppose, for the sake of the argument, that the lessor of the plaintiff and his mortgagor acted with full notice; Obed Crarath, when he gave the deed to Noah Parsons, had no title; and the title which he afterwards acquired did not enure to the benefit of Noah Parsons, his grantee. The first title which 0bed Crarath had was under the partition deed. The deed from him to. N. Parsons contained no warranty pf title; it must be taken to have been a mere quit-claim, and, as su,ch, it is well settled, could never operate to carry a previous title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-13\">Again: the deed to. Noah Parsons was. surrendered to the grantor, Obed Crarath ; and though this act wpuld not pass back the title, yet it amounts.to the same thing as to the grantee.

This existed. Notice to the agent is notice to the principal. (Jackson <em>v. </em>Sharp, 9 John. 163.) Allen, the attorney employed by Kellogg to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the second deed from Obed Crarath to Jared Parsons, knew, at the time he obtained it, that Crarath had before given a deed to Noah Parsons. This is notice, both to Jared Parsons and to the lessor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b15-4\">Kellogg,</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">the agent of the lessor of the plaintiff, had knowledge of circumstances enough to put him upon his enquiry as *to Noah Parson\u2019s title to the premises. If he was ignorant of the fact that Noah Parsons had a deed from Crarath, it must have been because he was careful not to know it. He knew the premises had been paid for by Noah Parsons, and understood that they had been sold on the oldest execution against him. How should all this happen, if Noah Parsons had no title ? He knew that Crarath was to give the deed to Jared Parsons, without receiving any equivalent, and that Jared Parsons should at once mortgage the premises, to secure Noah Parsons\u2019 debt. How could all this take place, unless Noah Parsons-was really the owner ? The note signed by Crarath, as the surety of Noah Parsons, to Tallman, was understood by Allen and Kellogg to be an incumbrance, and to get rid of this circumstance, they procured Mason as a substitute for Crarath. Was not all this sufficient to excite Kellogg\u2019s suspicion ? to have opened his eyes, if he had not purposely winked so hard as not to see any difficulty in the way of securing Glover\u2019s demand? Allen does not swear that when he communicated the fact of the previous deed to Jared Parsons, which was after the mortgage given, that this was news to Jared. He had known of Noah Parsons\u2019 claim. He must have known it, for he had himself become the purchaser of his (N. P.\u2019s) right at sheriff\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">The fact that Obed Crarath purchased the premises in question from the commissioners in partition in 1819, does not prove that he had no title, or a defective one in 1816, Whatever advantage Crarath derived under this purchase, enured to the benefit of Noah Parsons, his former guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">Glover (the lessor of the plaintiff) is not a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, within the meaning of the 4th section of the act con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>cerning deeds.. (1 R. L. 370.) He.gave1 no credit-to any. one. He. created no new debt in'consideration of taking ' the mortgage. - He.took it on an -old debt, paying nothing. whatever for the -mortgage. It was no payment or extin* guishment of the former, debt; but merely- a - collateral security ; and if not-paid, Glover- may prosecute' Noah\u2019 Parsons on the original consideration of-the debt. (Cumming <em>v. </em>Hackley, 8 John. 202. Green <em>v. </em>Hart, 1 John. 580.) This.mortgage, is a mere security. *of a pre-existing debt. (Jackson v. Willard, 4 John. 42, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<author id=\"b16-9\"><em>Curia, </em>per Woodworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASM\">Here is no- evidence1 that' Obed Crarath, when he conveyed-to Noah Parsons,- in\" 1816,-had any.-title. It stated-that-he gave, a \u00a1deed. This, of' itself, is not sufficient -to warrant- a: .presumption' of title-: neither does the. fact that Noah Parsons paid-him'a consideration, afford any.-additional support. These acts may; have-been performed under a-belief that title was-acquired,when in reality none-passed. They.-fall.short ill making, out,; <em>prima facie, </em>competent evidence-that Obed Crarath had any .interest in the-land, - If we -examine the rest of - the,testimony, the presumption appears !to be- strong that the title-of the premises was acquired by the deed fromthecommissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-10\">It. appeared -that- Samuel Crarath - died-'-in possession; <em>which-is,-prima facie,- </em>.evidence of seisin,<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> Commissioners were-appointed -to make partition .among, his heirs.\u2019 Who they'were\" is-not-stated. It does-not - even-appear from.'the case; that..Obed Crarath,- although of the sain\u00e9 name, was an heir. For aught that \"appears, he may have-been a stranger. It-is -enough,-however,-to say .that-the only evidence \u00a1of title in-him is -derived- from the commis-' sinners\u2019.deed,.executed in March, 1819.--'</p>\n<p id=\"Az5\">It is argued by,the-.counsel-for-the-defendant,-that this\u201d deed enured to the benefit of-. Crarath\u2019s guarantee- in-the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>deed of 1816. Here also another difficulty lies'in the' defendant\u2019s Way;'' We afe left'entirely in'the dark', wh\u00e9ther this deed was a mere quit-claim, dr contained a covenant of warranty. It may have been either.' The defendant, therefore, has not disclosed matter sufficient upon which\" to raise either the technical doctrine of estoppel, or to \"make the conveyance enure to\" the hench\u00ed of N\u00f3\u00e1h Parsons and his assigns. , . , ,,</p>\n<p id=\"b17-4\">In McCracken <em>v. </em>Wright, (14 John. 194,) it was held that by a quit-claim deed no title not <em>in esse </em>at the time would pass : <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> though' when\" there was\"a'warranty, it; would operate .as ah estoppel,.for avoiding circuity of action. The doctrine is laid down iti Co. Lit. sec. 446, and p. 265, a. b., that by a rel\u00e9ase\" no right passeth but the right which the releaser hath *at th\u00e9 time of the rel\u00e9ase made;' as if the son release to the disseisor the right which he hath or may have, without clause of warranty; afterthe death of his father, the\u2019 son may enter\" against hi\u2019s own release, b\u00e9cause he had no right at all at the tim\u00e9 of the release made, th\u00e9 right being at the tim\u00e9 in the father.\" (Jackson <em>v. </em>Hubble, 1 Cowen, 616, S.P.)</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">It follows, if this view be correct, that the s\u00e9cond deed given by Obed Crarath may be set up by the grantee deriv-\" ing title under it; and that it cannot be urged in support of the supposed title of th\u00e9 grantee under the first deed', for the reason that the defendant has not shown affirmatively' that there was a warranty: The question of estoppel, therefore, does not apply on the facts before\" us.'</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">But if, for the sake of argument, it be conceded that the. title passed by the deed of 1816, then, inasmuch as that deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>has never been recorded, is the plaintiff affected by notice? There is certainly no express notice ; although, perhaps, in a proper case, the facts might be sufficient to put the party on inquiry. If there was notice, it was given to the agent The. lessor of the plaintiff does not appear to havq.been personally acquainted with the circumstances attending the giving of the mortgage, or the time it was given. Kellogg was the agent of the lessor of the plaintiff for the purpose of obtaining security for his debt against Noah Parsons. It was represented to him that the title was in Obed Crarath, that Noah Parsons had paid for the land, and held a bond for a deed, .and that Jared Parsons was equitably entitled to the land by reason of a purchase made by him at a sheriff\u2019s sale under a judgment against Noah Parsons, entered in 1819. As to this purchase, it may be here observed that the title of Noah Parsons, if he had any, was subject to the lien of Marvin\u2019s judgment in 1817, and was afterwards transferred to them by the sheriff\u2019s deed, 1824. In truth, Jared Parsons, in 1820, when this arrangement took place for securing the debt of the lessor of the plaintiff, had no estate or title whatever, unless the commissioners\u2019deed of 1819 to Obed Crarath-operated so as to enure to the benefit of Noah Parsons, the grantee in. the deed of 1816 ; and if it did so operate, then indeed Jared Parsons might have acquired a title liable to be *defeated by a sale under the Marvins\u2019 judgment, which subsequently took place. Upon the supposition that the first deed was rendered valid by the execution of the commissioners\u2019 deed to Obed Crarath, still it was an unrecorded deed ; and I perceive no objection in such a cas\u00e9 to Jared Parsons or any other persons, for valuable consideration and without notice, accepting a conveyance from Noah Parsons, in whom upon this principle, the title was vested. But here it is evident the parties acted under a misapprehension of the state of this title, provided it be conceded that the commissioners\u2019 deed to Obed Crarath operated as a confirmation of the deed previously given to Noah Parsons; for in that case Noah Parsons-was the person to .convey; and had he executed the deed to Jared Parsons, and the latter executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the mortgage to the plaintiff, then this question would be presented: If a judgment be rendered against A., who, in judgment of law, is, at the time, seised by virtue of a conveyance not recorded, and afterwards the land is sold under the judgment, and a conveyance executed, can that title be defeated by a purchaser who obtains a deed from A. subsequent to the judgment, but before a sale under it ? I think it cannot; because the sheriff\u2019s deed relates back to the time of the judgment; and the command of <em>the Ji. fa. </em>is to cause the money to be made of the lands whereof the debtor was seised on the day of the rendition, or at any time afterwards. If this position be correct, then it follows that the purchaser under the judgment is not called on to make out notice of the first deed. The question does not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">If, however, I am mistaken on this point, and the judgment creditor is exposed to the risk of being defeated by reason of a deed from the defendant in the judgment subsequent to its rendition, then the question of notice would become material. But here it cannot arise, because no deed was procured from Noah Parsons. As to him, his title remains as it was. He has done no act to divest it.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">It seems to me, therefore, that the doctrine of notice may be laid out of the case. Admitting that the agents of the lessor of the plaintiff, when they procured a deed from Obed Crarath to Jared Parsons, and at the time he mortgaged, *knewthat Crarath had given a deed previously to Noah Parsons, such knowledge would be immaterial on the fol lowing grounds: <em>first, </em>because if Crarath, in the first deed, merely released or quit-claimed when he had no title, which it appears he had not, then nothing passed; and the lessor of the plaintiff or Jared Parsons was justified in accepting a deed. They were not bound to notice a conveyance altogether inoperative. If, on the other hand, the first conveyance of Crarath was confirmed by the commissioners\u2019 deed to him, then the land became bound by Marvins\u2019 judgment; and Crarath had nothing to convey, whether there was notice or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">If this cause had turned on the point whether the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>gage was made upon good and, valuable consideration, I ' think there is <em>no </em>cause to question it on that gpoupd. A debt against .Noah ^Parsons, .assumed ,by-J|red \u00a1Parsons, was undoubtedly, a suffiQjent( consideration. ..The result of.my opinion is, th.at, on.the\u00a1fpcts.staf e&amp;.in the case, the plaintiff is,entitled to judgipent. My .opinion .rests on this ground : that Crarath having conveyed in 1,816, and it not appearing .that he then.had.any title, or that the deed was.wjth,warranty,.nothing passed; .and.consequently there was .nothing .upon which the lien of \u00a1the Marvins\u2019 \u25a0judgment could attach ; and that Crarath, .after lie obtained <em>f \u2018 </em>'2 \u2022 <em>\u00bb;'\u25a0 </em>ft \u00ab \u2019 V\" <em>\u2018 . </em>\u00a1 ,r, \u201e \u25a0 . i .. title by the commissioners\u2019 deed, was at liberty .to . convey that title,to any purchaser .or mortgagee .for .yaluq^le consideration. The deed to Jared Parsons, and his mortgage to the lessor of the plaintiff entitled him to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">But as it is more .than probable .that material .facts .are not before us.; particularly as (tjip ,attentiqnfqf \u00a1the pqrtjes does not .appear to haye been dirqqted .to phe question whether .Ohed Crarath had .any title in 1816, .and what was the form of the deed .or conveyance by him .then executed, upon ffe ascertainment of yvhichiaqts the pause may assume a different aspeqt, I thipk the ends .of justice require .that a new trig! be granted, .with posts to.abide \u00a1the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-10\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b16-13\"> <em>Per </em>Savage, Ch.
