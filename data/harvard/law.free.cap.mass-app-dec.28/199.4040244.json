L. (Ter. Ed.) c. <em>246, </em>\u00a77, as amended, relating thereto, in that the writ is dated October 18, 1962, is returnable on November <em>26, </em>1962, and therefore does not conform with the requirement of the statute that \"(a) trustee writ issued by a district court shall be returnable not more than thirty days after the date thereof . . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9z\">The case was reported because the defendant .claims to be aggrieved by the denial of its motion to dismiss and the refusal by the judge to allow its requests for rulings numbered five and six.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The report states that it contains all the evidence material to the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The writ by which the action was brought was properly served on the defendant. The trial judge found \u201cif valid service has been made upon the defendant, as it appears here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>on the writ, the plaintiff is not precluded from proceeding against the defendant himself.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b207-7\">Paul William Garber, of Boston, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The effect of noncompliance with the provisions of \u00a77 of c. 246 is to make the attachment on the trustee void but the validity of the writ and the action itself is not affected insofar as the defendant is concerned. In effect the writ becomes a common writ. The refusal <em>of </em>the trial judge to allow the motion to dismiss was correct. G. L. c. 246, \u00a79. <em>Phelan v. Atlantic Nat. Bank, </em>301 Mass. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">There was no error in the refusal to allow defendant\u2019s request for rulings numbered five and six. <em>The report is dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
