McKenzie, in the hands of Beatrice P. Weeks, Executrix, under the will of Sarah E. McKenzie. The defendant\u2019s answer sets up defenses of: (i) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>general denial; (2) statute of frauds; and (3) statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>At the trial there was evidence tending to show that </em>the plaintiff is a public school teacher and a sister to the defendant and to the deceased, Sarah E. McKenzie, and is a resident of Norfolk, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In <em>August of </em>1955 the plaintiff visited the deceased, Sarah E. McKenzie, in Boston. The deceased at the time owned a house at 19 Savin Street, Roxbury, Massachusetts, where she resided. There was a mortgage on this house running to the Charlestown Savings Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The deceased told the plaintiff of her financial condition and asked the plaintiff to help her. The plaintiff agreed, and further agreed to assume the mortgage payments to the Charlestown Savings Bank. Thereafter, mortgage payments were made to the bank by the plaintiff in the total amount of $1,094.71.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">In <em>December of </em>1956 the deceased, who was then ill, went to Norfolk, Virginia to stay with the plaintiff, and the plaintiff paid $337.22 for transportation of the personal property of the deceased from Boston to Virginia. Sarah E. McKenzie died in Norfolk, Virginia, on <em>August </em>11, 1958. Subsequently, the plaintiff took out administration in Virginia, and was appointed administratrix of the estate of Sarah E. McKenzie in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The cost of the funeral of the deceased was $1,070, and the plaintiff, as administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>trix withdrew from the account of the deceased at the Boston Five Cent Savings Bank the sum of $731.71, which amount was paid by the plaintiff towards the funeral bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Subsequent to the plaintiff\u2019s being appointed administratrix in Virginia, the will of Sarah E. McKenzie was discovered, and said will probated in Suffolk Probate Court, Boston, Mass. The plaintiff was named co-executrix under the will with the defendant. The will was allowed on <em>October </em>1, 1959, and prior thereto, the plaintiff declined to act as co-executrix therein and the necessary papers relating to her declination were executed by her and filed in Suffolk Probate Court. The bond of the executrix, Beatrice P. Weeks, was examined and approved by the Probate Court on <em>October </em>8, 1959. It is to be noted that the date of the writ in the instant action, was <em>April </em>25, i960, but neither the plaintiff nor the defendant offered the date of the writ in evidence, nor was any question raised as to said date at the trial. The defendant was the sole remaining executrix under the will. In <em>February of </em>1959 the defendant moved into said premises located at 19 Savin Street and still is an occupant thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">At the close of the trial and before final arguments, the defendant made the following requests for rulings, and the court\u2019s disposition thereon follow:</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u201c1.

The court is warranted in finding for the defendant. <em>Allowed. Warranted, but not required.\u201d </em>\u201cThe court made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">\u201cI find as a fact that the plaintiff made expenditures for and in behalf of her. deceased sister, Sarah E. McKenzie. I find that the plaintiff made the payments with the expectation of being reimbursed therefor. I further find that the plaintiff qualified as Administratrix of the Estate of Sarah E. McKenzie in the State of Virginia, in order to obtain the proceeds of a bank account standing in the name of Sarah E. McKenzie, which proceeds amount to $731.71, and which moneys were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>paid by her on account of funeral charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">I further find that the plaintiff at no time was an administratrix of the Estate of Sarah E. McKenzie, in this Commonwealth, nor was she an Executrix, and consequently is not bound by the provisions of G. L. c. 197, \u00a76.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">I find that the plaintiff has not sustained the burden of proof by a fair preponderance of the evidence with reference to items 6 and 8 of the account annexed. I find that the payment made by the plaintiff for flowers was personal and not chargeable to the Estate of Sarah E. McKenzie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">I further find that \u201cliability\u201d for payment of a monument is not a payment therefor, and consequently the plaintiff cannot recover the amount claimed under item 8 of the account annexed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">I find for the plaintiff and assess damages in the sum of $1,627.99.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The plaintiff, with permission of the court, amended her declaration by striking out the words \u201cmoney had and received\u201d, so that the declaration would set forth a count on an account annexed.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The court found for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,627.99.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">The defendant, claiming to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s denial of requests for rulings numbered 2, 3, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 25, 26, and 29, also claims to be aggrieved by the finding for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"Agh\">Requests for rulings numbered 2 and 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>alleges that the plaintiff has not complied with G. L. c. 197, \u00a76 and therefore the court must find for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">It is the defendant\u2019s contention that the plaintiff having qualified as administratrix in Virginia under Virginia law, for the purpose of withdrawing a bank account to apply towards funeral expense, she is barred from maintaining an action of law against the estate in accordance with said statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The plaintiff had been named as a co-executrix under the will of Mrs. McKenzie, but she declined to serve as co-executrix and filed her declination before the will was allowed by the Suffolk Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">At no time, as the presiding justice pointed out in his findings, was she executrix or administratrix under Massachusetts law. G. L. c. 197, \u00a76, applies only to one appointed an administratrix or executrix in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">It is settled law that the appointment of an administrator in one state confers no power beyond the limits of that state, and does not authorize him to maintain any suit in the courts, state or national, held in any other state. <em>Goodwin v. Jones, </em>3 Mass. 513; <em>Brown v. B </em>&amp; <em>M RR., </em>283 Mass. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Since the plaintiff was never appointed an executrix or administratrix in Massachusetts, she had no opportunity or power to assert her claim against the estate as part of any accounting by the executrix in the Massachusetts Probate Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>G. L. c. 197, \u00a76 was not intended to preclude a person who was unable to recover under an accounting as a foreign executrix or administratrix from bringing an action at law against the domestic executrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The defendant in open court waived any question as to the court\u2019s denial of requests for rulings numbered 9 and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Requests for rulings numbered 12 and 13 allege the plaintiff has failed to sustain the burden of proof as to compliance with the Statue of Limitations. The defendant argues that the plaintiff did not sustain its burden of proof as to compliance with the Statute of Limitations, because at the trial the plaintiff did not formally offer in evidence the date of the writ. We have no doubt that the presiding judge was entitled to take judicial notice of the date of the writ in the case that was being tried before him. In the matter of <em>Keenan, </em>314 Mass. 544; <em>Wilson v. Calculagraph Co., </em>153 Fed. 961; <em>Assessors v. Arlington Mills, </em>320 Mass. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The denial of requests for rulings 14, 16, 17 and 18 are rendered immaterial by the court\u2019s having allowed the plaintiff leave to amend her declaration, which she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The allowance of a motion to amend a declaration is within the discretionary power of the presiding judge. As to the denying or allowing a motion to amend the writ, declaration or answer, and determining the state of the trial at which an amendment shall be allowed, see: <em>Lowrie v. Castle, </em>225 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Mass. 37, 39; <em>Norton v. Lilley, </em>214 Mass. 239; <em>Laxton v.
