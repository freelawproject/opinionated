The trial judge made a finding for the defendant and ruled on the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings on <em>June </em>20, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"AlF\">Notice thereof was sent counsel on <em>June </em>20, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">On <em>June </em>26, 1963, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial, on <em>June </em>27, 1963, they filed a claim of report and on <em>July </em>2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>1963, a draft report seeking a review on the rulings of the trial judge on the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings, his \u201capplication of the law to the facts found by\u201d him, \u201cbased on the evidence, and the general finding and decision\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">A copy of said draft report, with a copy of a letter sent the clerk of court, dated July 2, 1963, was received by the trial judge on July 5, 1963, by certified mail, the post office stamp showing the mailing date in Waltham as July 3, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">There was a hearing on said draft report on July 23, 1963, and, as stated in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief, the trial judge gave defendant\u2019s counsel leave to file certain corrections to the report and took the case under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel, without even filing a motion to dismiss the report wrote a letter, dated <em>July </em>24, 1963, to the trial judge, addressed to his own court in Ayer, in which he suggested for the first time that the draft report was not filed within the time required by District Court Rule No. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The trial judge then, without any further hearing on the matter, and on the strength of the letter of defendant\u2019s counsel, dismissed the report and made the following conclusion of facts on <em>July </em>30, 1963:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">\u201cFrom the foregoing facts I conclude as follows: in the usual course of mails the clerk\u2019s notice on June 20th of the filing of the court\u2019s findings on that date was delivered to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the following day, June 21st; that the Plaintiff\u2019s Claim of Report was seasonably filed on June 27th (Sunday being excluded in computing five days); that the plaintiff\u2019s draft report was not seasonably filed on July 2nd, the eleventh day after June 21st (Sunday being included in computing 10 days); and that the mailing to the trial justice on July 3, 1963 of copy of the letter above set-forth did not comply with Rule 28 of the Rules of District Courts under the reasoning and authority of <em>Arlington Trust Co. v. Vine, </em>289 Mass. 585; <em>George Saunders v. Shoe Lace Company, </em>293 Mass. <em>26 </em>5; <em>Wind Innersole and Counter Co., Inc. v. Geilich, </em>317 Mass. 327, 329; <em>Calcagno v. Graham, </em>313 Mass. 364, 367; <em>Day v. McLellan, 236 </em>Mass. 330, 332.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">ORDER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">On the foregoing findings it is <em>Ordered </em>that the plaintiff\u2019s draft report be, and the same hereby is, <em>Dismissed.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">On the same date the trial judge also made separate findings and rulings on the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Thereafter, on <em>August </em>5, 1963, the plaintiffs filed a second draft report whereby a review is sought on the dismissal of their first draft report. A hearing was held by the trial judge, <em>September </em>17, 1963, on said second draft report, at which time counsel for the plaintiffs informed the court that he received the judge\u2019s rulings and order of <em>June </em>20, 1963 <em>on June </em>22, 1963 and that mail from Framingham to Waltham usually takes two days, while the defendant\u2019s counsel stated that overnight de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>livery was the usual course of mail from Framingham to Waltham, and the judge so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The questions to be determined by this second report are stated by the trial judge as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u201cI hereby report to the Appellate Division for determination the plaintiff\u2019s claims of error by me as stated in their draft report, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">1. That there was error in my \u2018Ordering that the plaintiffs\u2019 draft report be dismissed\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">2. That there was error in my \u2018Dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 draft report\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">3. That there was error in my \u2018applying the law to the facts found \u2018by me\u2019 in this matter as set forth above\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">4. There was error in my \u2018Findings and Order .....regarding plaintiffs\u2019 draft report as the same are not correct in law\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">We are of the opinion that the first draft report was improperly dismissed, because the trial justice had begun a hearing thereon, and had continued said hearing to permit the defendant\u2019s counsel an opportunity to make suggestions for corrections thereof. Instead of that the defendant\u2019s counsel wrote a letter directly to the trial judge, who, on the strength of that letter, and on his own personal opinion, without any evidence as to the time the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel \u201cactually received a copy of the court\u2019s rulings and order\u201d dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 first draft report.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">Even though in the ordinary course of events a letter mailed from Framingham to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Waltham would be delivered the next day, it is also possible, and it very often happens that mail delivery is delayed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b219-6\">Harvey J. Resh, of Waltham, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b219-7\">No brief or argument for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The order dismissing the draft report filed July 2, 1963, is vacated, and further action is to be taken thereon.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
