See <em>Sandler v. Commonwealth Station Co., </em>30 N.E. Second 389. <em>The court did not allow or disallow this request but made the following notation', \"question of fact\u201d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">6. \u2014 The plaintiff\u2019s motor vehicle was damaged as a result of the negligence of the defendant, its agents, servants or employees, and therefore the plaintiff is entitled to recover. <em>The court did not allow or disallow this request but made the following notation', \"question of fact\u201d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The court made the following finding of fact: \u201cI find as a fact that the defendant was not negligent.\u201d The court found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">We cannot accept the plaintiff\u2019s argument that these requests raise questions of law rather than questions of fact. They all touch on factual issues which are part of the proof required of the plaintiff \u2014 whether the plaintiff\u2019s car was actually stolen; whether the defendant or its agents were guilty or negligence; and whether the plaintiff was damaged as a result thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">It was fundamental that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to prove negligence, and, it rarely can be ruled as a matter of law that the party having the burden of proof has sustained that burden. <em>Coleman v. NY, NH </em>&amp; <em>H RR., </em>215 Mass. 45, 47; <em>Winchester v. Missin, </em>278 Mass. 427, 428; <em>Hoffman v. Chelsea, </em>315 Mass. 54, 56; <em>Liberatore v. Framingham, </em>315 Mass. 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Obviously, the court was not obliged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>make any such findingings. They were essential elements of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b66-8\">Francis Leone, of Boston, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b66-9\">Paul D. Maggioni, of Boston, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">As the trial court has found as a matter of fact that the defendant was not negligent, this puts an end to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In view of the recent decisions in which the subject has been exhaustively treated with a full citation of cases, further citation of authority is not necessary. <em>Fibre Leather Mfg. Corp. v. Ramsey Mills, Inc., </em>329 Mass. 575, 577; <em>Norton v. Tilton, </em>325 Mass. 79, 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">There was no error. <em>Report dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
