J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AHd\">In an action of contract commenced by a trustee writ to recover for goods sold and delivered, the trustee answered that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>it was holding funds due to the defendant in the amount of $2,572.50. Shortly after the filing of the trustee\u2019s answer, Sumner Z. Kaplan filed with the court a \u201cPetition for Admission as a Party\u201d, and a motion to discharge the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><em>There was evidence that </em>on January 29, 1963, Doran Foods, Inc., loaned $16,000 to Olde Field Food Products, Inc., and took a Security Agreement which covered all the assets of said Olde Field Food Products, Inc. A financing statement of this Security Agreement was duly recorded in the appropriate recording office on February 19, 1963. Under this agreement Sumner Z. Kaplan was designated trustee as the court found \u201cto protect his client\u2019s interest\u201d. This Security Agreement purported to convey to the trustee \u201ca security interest in all the debtor\u2019s accounts, contract rights, chattel paper, instruments, inventory, and equipment \u2014 now owned and hereafter acquired in the ordinary course of business by the Debtor.\u201d Obviously the debt owed by the trustee to the Olde Field Food Products, Inc., was embraced by the Security Agreement and vested a right to same in Sumner Z. Kaplan, Trustee under the Security Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The court expressly found that the Security Agreement was given for a good and valid consideration, and that the notice of agreement was perfected and recorded prior to the time the writ in issue was served on the trustee. Under these circumstances the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>acted properly in allowing the Trustee\u2019s \u201cPetition for Admission as a Party\u201d. Equally proper was the allowance of Sumner Z. Kaplan\u2019s petition to discharge the trustee.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b120-7\">Joseph Krinsky, of Boston, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b120-8\">Harold! Katz, of Boston, for Sumner Z. Kaplan, the Intervenor.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">It is unnecessary to examine separately the requests filed by the plaintiff. It is sufficient for our purposes to note that the Security Agreement was given to secure the performance of an obligation, a type of transaction expressly excluded from the requirements of the Bulk Transfer Law, so called. G. L. c. 106, \u00a76-103 (t).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">It appears that the Trustee named in the Security Agreement complied with the legal requirement that a financing statement must be filed to perfect all security interests. G. L. c. 106, \u00a7,9-302 (1). In these circumstances the right of the Trustee, Sumner Z. Kaplan, to the debt owing from Stop and Shop, Inc. to Olde Field Food Products, Inc., is clear and distinct. The money cannot be said to be due to the 0\u2019lde Field Food Products, Inc. \u201cabsolutely and without contingency\u201d, and the court properly ruled that the trustee should be discharged. G. L. c. 246, \u00a724.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\n<em>Report dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
