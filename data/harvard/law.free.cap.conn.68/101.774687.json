An amendment (Special Acts of 1895, p. 7) empowered the city board of health to contract for the collection and removal of garbage and offal in the city, for such period of time and at such price as the board might deem best. The common council passed an ordinance which authorized the board of health to take such measures as they deemed effectual for the removal of \u201c garbage and offal,\u201d subject to certain prescribed rules and regulations. By \u00a7.2 of the ordinance, the words \u201cgarbage and offal\u201d were declared to mean \u201c only such refuse matter as accumulates in the preparation of food for the table.\u201d Subsequent sections, under which the defendant was prosecuted and convicted, provided that no one .shpuld collect and transport garbage and offal, without first having obtained a permit from the board of health, under penalty of a fine not exceeding $10 for each offense.

That the city was fully justified by its charter and the amendment of 1895, in making ordinances to regulate the collection and removal of garbage and offal; and that the ordinance in question was within the , power thus conferred.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-6\">2. That the term \u201c refuse matter \u201d as employed in the ordinance, embraced only such matter as was either in fact noxious, or as had been refused and abandoned by its owner as worthless.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-8\">3.

That it was not essential that the garbage, at the time of its transportation,- should be in fact a nuisance and detrimental to health; it was enough.if it was such \u201c refuse matter\u201d as accumulated in the preparation of food for the table.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-12\">5.

That the absence in the charter of any express authority to require licenses for the business, did not prevent the mode of regulation adopted, since the collection and removal of garbage was a business which as usually carried on was in its nature dangerous to public health, and the general police powers vested in the city by its charter, in connection with the Special Act of 1895, implied the right to limit the number of those who might pursue it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-16\"><em>7. </em>That the defendant had no absolute right to a license or permit, and therefore the trial court committed no error in excluding evidence that before he. applied for one, the board had instructed its clerk to issue no more permits to any one.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b112-18\">8.

A bylaw', which assumes to be a police regulation, but deprives a party of the use of his property without regard to the public good, under the pretense of the preservation of health, when it is manifest that such is not the object and purpose of the regulation, will be set aside as a clear and direct infringement of the right of property without any compensating advantages. The law will not allow the rights of property to be invaded under the guise of a police regulation. Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. (6th Ed.) 247, 485, 486; <em>Austin </em>v.

The validity or invalidity of the refusal to issue such a permit is not relevant to this criminal prosecution. A contract with a municipal corporation whereby the contractor shall have the exclusive right to collect, remove, or dispose of all garbage or'offal, does not tend to create a monopoly, but is consonant with a valid exercise of the police powers relative to health. <em>Smiley </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>42 Neb. 5; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Jameson, </em>28 L.

It may be thus rejected because it has little or no value for human food, or because it is decayed or unwholesome. It must in its nature be perishable; and can include little which is not liable to become decomposed or offensive, if left where it falls. The Common Council therefore had authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>regulate its disposition, in such a way as to prevent it from becoming the occasion of a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Much, however, that is of the nature of garbage and offal, and has slight value for table use, may be not unsuitable for the food of animals, for manure, or as materials for manufacture. Construing this ordinance with the strictness properly applicable to municipal legislation of a penal nature, the term \u201crefuse matter\u201d can only extend to matter which is in fact noisome, or which has been refused and rejected by the owner as worthless. Meat trimmings, potato parings, specked apples, and many other things of a like character, might be thrown aside in preparing table dishes, and yet properly utilized afterwards for other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u2022 The mode of regulation of the disposition of kitchen refuse which is contained in this ordinance seems to be one of an alternative character.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The board of health is empowered\u2019to take such measures as it may deem effectual for the removal of this refuse from the whole city or any portion of it, and to this end to employ or make contracts with one or more persons, subject to certain rules, of which the following are the leading ones: No person shall collect and transport such refuse in the city without first having obtained a permit from the board. It shall all be carried through the city in water-tight covered carts, so loaded as not to spill; each to be plainly marked' \u201c City Garbage Cart,\u201d with the name of the contractor, and. number of the cart, and of the ward, and to be used only when inspected, approved and licensed by the clerk of the board. All such refuse is to be placed by the person on whose premises it originates in suitable covered vessels, set, there in a position convenient for removal, or in some place designated by the clerk of the board, so that it \u201c may be called for by the garbage contractor of said city; provided, however, that any person may be excepted from the provisions of this section, upon obtaining a permit to that effect from the clerk of the board of health.\u201d No other matter whatever can be placed in such a vessel.- \u201c The garbage contractor or other person employed by the board of health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>shall call regularly at all dwellings, tenements, hotels, restaurants, or other buildings designated by the said board, and remove promptly and in as cleanly a manner as possible all garbage or offal that may be offered, and shall return the receptacles to the place on such premises from which the same were taken. All garbage and offal which shall be removed through said city shall be carried and deposited in such places as may be designated and approved by the board of health, and shall be disposed of in such manner as not to create a nuisance, and the covers of all carts, wagons or vessels used for the purpose of removing such garbage or offal, shall be kept tightly closed while they are being transported through the streets of the city. No deposit of garbage or offal shall be made within the limits of the city of Bridgeport, or upon any wharf, or upon any vessel lying at any wharf, except by permit from the board of health.\u201d The clerk of the board is to enter in a record book \u201c all contracts entered into, or licenses issued by authority of said board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">Under these provisions, and the authority of the Special Act of 1895, the board of health might contract with a single person to collect and remove garbage from the entire city, or with several persons to collect and remove it from as many different portions of the city. It might also make such contracts with respect to part of the city, or to certain buildings in part of the city, and leave the collection and removal of garbage from other places open to those who obtained from its clerk a proper permit, and provided proper means of transportation. By neither method of procedure would any monopoly be created, b}r which the common rights of citizenship would be infringed upon. <em>The Slaughter-House </em>Cases, 16 Wall. 36; <em>Alpers </em>v. <em>San </em>Francisco, 32 Fed. Rep. 503; <em>National Fertilizer Co. </em>v. Lambert, 48 id. 458. Nor did the absence in the charter of any express provision as to the grant of licenses to engage in this business, prevent the Common Council from resort to that mode of regulation, since it was a business which as usually carried on is in its nature dangerous to the public health, and as carried on in Bridgeport might, under the Act of February 28th, 1895, have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>been made by the board of health the subject of a public contract. Over any such occupation a strict watch must be kept, and the general police powers vested in the city by \u00a7 24 of its charter, in connection with the Act of 1895, justify the implication of a right to limit the number of those who pursue it. <em>State </em>v. Wordin, 56 Conn. 216, 226; Vandine, <em>Peti</em>tioner, 6 Pick. 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The defendant offered evidence to show that he had been for many years engaged in the business of collecting and removing garbage in Bridgeport, in carts so constructed as to satisfy the requirements of the ordinance; and that he had applied to the clerk of the board for a license or permit, and met with a refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">He also offered evidence, which was excluded, that permits had been previously issued to others; but that, before he applied, the board had instructed its clerk to issue no more to any one. This evidence was properly excluded. The board of health, having the right to limit the number of those engaged in this particular occupation, the defendant had no absolute title to a license. If the number which it had issued was unreasonably small, and if an inquiry into that subject was open to him in any proceeding, it was certainly not open in this, to which the board was not a party. He could not thus assume to take the law into his own hands, and pursue the business without a license, because a license had been wrongfully refused. His remedy, if he had any, would be to apply by mandamus to compel the board to grant him one.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The defendant offered evidence to show that all the garbage collected by him came from certain restaurants, with the proprietors of which he had contracts for its removal. This also was properly excluded. It was not claimed, and cannot be assumed that such engagements had been entered into before the adoption of the ordinance. Without inquiring whether, had the fact been otherwise, the law would have been otherwise, it is sufficient, as the case stands, to say that no contract to perform an unlawful act can justify its performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The defendant further offered evidence to prove, and claimed that it did prove, that the garbage he collected was fresh, and some of it fit for food; and there was no evidence on either side tending to show that any of this garbage \u201c was sour or putrid and for that reason dangerous to the public health.\u201d In view of this, the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury that \u201c the privilege of contracting to transport garbage is a liberty and property right, of which one cannot be deprived without due process of law;- unless the jury find that such garbage at the time of its transportation is a nuisance and detrimental to health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Such instructions were properly refused. It was a violation of the ordinance to collect and transport the kitchen refuse which was its subject, whether such of it as was being transported at the time of the act complained of was noxious or innoxious. It was enough that it was \u201c such refuse matter as accumulates in the preparation of food for the table.\u201d There is so much of this kind of matter that is offensive and dangerous to the health of the community, that all may be properly made the subject of public supervision'and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The ordinance does not extend to everything that is separated and thrown aside in the preparation of food for the table. Whatever of this description is not abandoned as worthless,, remains property which, so long as it does not constitute a nuisance, may be sold or otherwise disposed of at the will of the owner. If the evidence had shown both that the contents of the defendant\u2019s cart, while they had been rejected for table use, were not offensive, and that they were in his possession as the agent or vendee of the original owners, he might have been entitled to a verdict, for he could not then have been engaged in the business for which a license was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The Court of Common Pleas was requested but declined to instruct the jury that \u201c the board of health has no poyrer to assume in advance that garbage is or will become a nuisance and detrimental to public health, and so contract arbitrarily for its removal or prohibit its removal by purchasers thereof; that the board of health cannot prohibit the carry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ing on of a lawful business not necessarily a nuisance, and which may be conducted without injury or danger to the public health; that the Common Council has no power under the charter of the city of Bridgeport to refuse a citizen the right to exercise a lawful calling, or to prohibit his exercise of the same when not dangerous to public health or safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">There was no error in refusing these instructions. Ample authority is found in the charter and the Act of 1895 for dealing with the business of disposing of garbage and offal as one dangerous to the public health. Any occupation comes within the range of the police power which is such as to be naturally liable to create a nuisance, unless subjected to special regulations; whether it be so conducted as, in fact, to create a nuisance, or not. The prevention of nuisances is quite as important as their abatement. <em>Raymond </em>v.
