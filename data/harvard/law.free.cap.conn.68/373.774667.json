The defendant, who was charged with keeping open on Sunday a place in which \u201c certain sports known as billiards and pool \u201d had been and were carried on and allowed, filed a general demurrer to the complaint. On reservation it was <em>held </em>that the object of the statute was to compel the closing on Sunday of those places which were appropriated to the carrying on of sports or games of chance as a business; that the sport known as billiards was an ordinary subject of such a business, and that the complaint sufficiently charged an offense within the statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b383-10\">The legislation concerning Sunday reviewed.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b383-11\">[Submitted on briefs October 27th</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AEy\">decided December 1st, 1896.]</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-12\">Prosecution for keeping open on Sunday a place in which sports known as billiards and pool were carried on, brought originally to the town court of Orange and thence by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>defendant\u2019s appeal to the Criminal Court of Common Pleas for New Haven County, where the defendant demurred to the information and the court, Hotchkiss, <em>J., </em>reserved the questions of law arising thereon for the consideration and advice of this court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AF7\">\n<em>Judgment overruling demurrer advised.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-5\">The statute (General Statutes, \u00a7 3097) in pursuance of which this prosecution was brought, is as follows: \u201cEvery person who by himself, his servant, or his agent, between the hours of twelve o\u2019clock on Saturday night and twelve o\u2019clock on Sunday night next following, shall sell or expose for sale any spirituous or intoxicating liquors, or shall keep open any place of any kind or description in which spirituous and intoxicating liquors are at any time sold or exposed for sale, or are reputed to be sold or exposed for sale, or in which any sports or games of chance are at any time carried on or allowed, or are reputed to be so carried on or allowed, shall be fined not less than fifty nor more than one hundred dollars, or be imprisoned not more than six months, or both; but this section shall not apply to sales under a druggist\u2019s license.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-6\">The complaint charged that \u201c on the 31st day of May, A.

The sole contention of the State is that to keep open a place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>on Sunday where <em>sports </em>are at any time carried on and. allowed, has been made a criminal offense by \u00a7 3097 of the Gen. Stats. If this is the true construction, the Act is certainly very wide and sweeping in its effect. Almost everything that is practiced as a recreation may be called a \u201c sport,\u201d and is called such in the ordinary use of the word. The statute must be strictly construed in favor of the accused; the word \u201csports\u201d must mean either sports of all kinds, or of a particular class. If of a particular class, we must seek for that class in the language of the statute. <em>Lee Bros. Furniture Co. </em>v. Cram, 63 Conn. 434. The word \u201c chance \u201d furnishes the only suggestion that we have in that direction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-5\"><em>George M. </em>Gunn, Prosecuting Attorney, for the State.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b385-6\">Sunday statutes are remedial and to be liberally construed in respect to the mischief to be remedied. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>24 N.

Gaming and billiards and pool are the ordinary concomitants of a saloon for the sale of intoxicating liquors, and the purpose of \u00a7 3097 was to close such places, that they might not serve as a cover or excuse for the violation of other statutes relating more specifically to sale of intoxicating liquors. Under no conditions was the keeping of a gaming house or a house reputed to be such, legal (Gen. Stats. \u00a7 2559) ; and under no circumstances were any kind of sports on Sunday permitted, whether the element of chance entered in greater or less measure into their composition. See Gen. Stats. \u00a7\u00a7 1569, 1570. Whatever force marginal notes may have in determining the effect of statutes, they nowhere have effect of changing their clear and apparent meaning.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b385-7\">Hamersley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ5\">The partaking in sports or games of chance is not made an offense by \u00a7 3097 of the General Statutes, nor is it an offense by virtue of any law now in force. Formerly all games of chance were illegal; and sports or games involving a combination of skill and luck to any degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>seem to have been included under the ban. In 1650 the \u201c game of shuffle (shovel) board \u201d was specially prohibited, and \u201c any unlawful game\u201d was forbidden. In 1656 games \u201c altogether unlawful, in the very nature of them,\u201d were defined as \u201ccards, dice, tables, or any other game wherein that great and solemn ordinance of a Lott is expressly and directly abused and profaned; \u201d (1 Col. Rec. 527, 289) ; <em>i. e., </em>\u25a0inasmuch as the Word of God authorized in certain cases the ascertainment of the Divine will and the settlement of controversies by the \u201c Lott,\u201d the profanation of this ordinance to the purposes of frivolous' amusement is forbidden by the Word of God, and is therefore unlawful. The use of the lot for purposes of gain was also unlawful, unless the object were one approved by the General Court; as when, in 1753, permission was given to the trustees of the College of New Jersey to raise money by way of lotteiy for building \u201ca public house for entertaining the students\u201d (permission therefor having been repeatedly refused by the General Assembly of that Province), the General Court found the object to be \u201c for the encouragement of religion and learning,\u201d and therefore lawful and not an abuse of the ordinance. 10 Col. Rec. 217. In 1750 \u201cAn Act against Gaming\u201d <em>(i. </em>e., playing at games, the special prohibitions of gambling in its various forms came later) forbids dice, cards, tables, bowls, shuffle-board, billiards, coytes (quoits), lceils (kayle), loggets (loggats), \u201c or any other unlawful games or sport.\u201d Acts, Ed. 1754, p. 81. Common sense, however, eventually-asserted its supremacy in such matters, and legislation has ceased to stigmatize innocent amusements as criminal, and legislative discretion is no longer invoked to define those pious uses that may be potent to extract its inherent vice from gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Section 3097 does not make partaking in \u201csports or games of chance \u201d on Sunday an offense. Section 1569 retains a portion. of the early Sunday legislation, and forbids anyone to \u201cengage in any sport or recreation on Sunday.\u201d This early legislation was based not only on the duty of the State to protect its citizens from wanton insults to their religious faith, and observances, and in the enjoyment of. the peace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>and quiet to which they may be entitled on a legal holiday, but also upon the duty of the State to compel all citizens to conform to the religious tenets established by the State as binding on the conscience of all. The Sunday law was at first administered by the General Court, without special legislation, in conformity with the word of God, which was accepted as supplying, in analogy to the English common law, defects in express legislation; and the Code of 1650 only provided a special penalty for open contempt of God\u2019s Word or the ministers thereof, and neglect to attend the public ministry of the Word; directing the civil magistrates to deal with anyone who failed to observe the peace, ordinances and rules of Christ as established by law. Special provisions from time to time were enacted. The various special provisions appear in the Revision of 1750, in \u201cAn Act for the due Observation and Keeping the Sabbath, or Lord\u2019s Day; and for Preventing and Punishing Disorders and Prophaneness on the same.\u201d This Act also is in part based on the duty of the State to enforce personal piety as by law established. It requires every person on that day privately \u201c to apply themselves to duties of religion and piety,\u201d punishes those who, neglecting the public worship according to law, worship God by themselves in private houses; punishes whoever travels on that day or leaves his place of abode except to attend the public worship allowed by law, or does any business, labor or work of any kind; and punishes the use of \u201cany game, sport, play or recreation.\u201d The first break in this legislation was in 1770, when conscientious dissenters from the worship and ministry established by law, were allowed to worship by themselves without incurring the penalty for non-attendance at the State church. Since that time various changes have been made, and \u00a7 1569 contains the remnant of the original Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The prohibition on Sunday of any sport or recreation which interferes with the preservation of public peace and order, or the enjoyment of appropriate quiet and religious observance on that day, is clearly within the power of the legislature; if, however, the language used must be-con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>strued as including an exercise of the power employed prior to the adoption of the Constitution, to control private action of individuals in a matter of personal conscience, serious questions would arise. But whatever may be the scope of this section, the engaging in any sport on Sunday is not an offense under \u00a7 3097. That section is directed against the proprietor of a business who receives the public as customers in the place where he carries on a business of such a nature that its open transaction on Sunday is peculiarly liable to disturb the quiet and good order to which all citizens are by law entitled on that day; and to accomplish this object it punishes the keeping open of such a place of business more severely than the mere transaction of any secular business is punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Section 3097, so far as the offense under discussion is concerned, provides that \u201c every person who . . . between the hours of twelve o\u2019clock on Saturday night and twelve o\u2019clock on Sunday night next following, . . . shall keep open any place ... in which any sports or games of chance are at any time carried on or allowed, shall be fined not less than fifty nor more than one hundred dollars, or be imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">To \u201c keep \u201d a place, as here used, means an appropriation of the place by the person in control for the conduct of his business therein. <em>State </em>v. <em>Main, </em>31 Conn. 572, 574. This is quite evident from the language of the whole section. To \u201c keep open \u201d such a place, means providing some way of coming and going sufficient to enable any portion of the public to gather there and take part in the usual business of the place ; it does not mean opening the place solely for a proper purpose unconnected with that business. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gregory, Jr., </em>47 Conn. 276. The business intended is described as that of carrying on or allowing any sports or games of chance. The statute does not punish keeping open any place, except one in which the business described is transacted and which is kept open on Sunday; and does not punish the subject-matter of the business there transacted, - <em>i. e., </em>sports and games of chance. It is apparent that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>scope of the words \u201c sports and games of chance,\u201d is determined and made adequately definite by the provision that the sports and games of chance specified must be such as in fact are the subject of a business consisting in supplying the requisite facilities for the use of such amusements in a place kept for the transaction of that business, to which the public or some portion thereof are invited as customers. It is a matter of common knowledge that the sport of billiards is an ordinary subject of such business, and that a place kept for the transaction of that business, if kept open on Sunday, may be peculiarly liable to interfere with the lawful restrictions for securing the quiet required on that day; and, moreover, for a long period our legislation has expressly classed \u201c billiards \u201d under \u201c sports,\u201d when the word has been used in a similar connection. It is immaterial what motive induced the legislature to use this language in \u00a7 3097. \u201c Sport \u201d is a very general term, covering field sports and other means of recreation necessarily not a subject of the business described in the statute ; possibly \u201c games of chance \u201d were added to exclude any doubt as to their being covered by the more general term, or to emphasize the fact of their inclusion,\u2014 possibly because it has been an ancient legislative custom to describe amusements regulated by statute under similar circumstances, as sports or games. The language of the statute is in other respects intentionally broad, so as to provide against ingenious evasions. It is sufficient that the whole section expresses with adequate clearness the real meaning of the words used, and includes as one subject of the business specified, the sport of billiards.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The complaint in this case in charging the defendant with keeping open on Sunday a certain place known as Miller\u2019s Pavilion, in which certain sports known as billiards were carried on and allowed, charges an offense within the statute. Whether the keeping open on Sunday of a place of business for this purpose, or some other purpose that may be covered by the broad language of the statute, is of such peculiar danger to the quiet of the day as to justify its selection for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>exceptional and severe penalty, is a legislative and not a judicial question.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The Court of Common Pleas is advised to overrule the demurrer and to render appropriate final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
