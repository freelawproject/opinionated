We have fully reviewed the record and conclude that the facts found are adequately supported by the record, and that the trial court did not apply an improper rule of law. The issues regarding the underlying factual disputes were resolved properly in the trial court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision. <em>Dana Investment Corp. </em>v. <em>Schlesinger, </em>46 Conn. Sup. 527, 759 A.2d 161 (1998). Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the facts and the applicable law on those issues. It could serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>In re Karrlo K., </em>40 Conn. App. 73, 75, 668 A.2d 1353 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u201c \u2018This court does not retry the case or evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>[198 Conn. 285, 289, 503 A.2d 146 (1986)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>23 Conn. App. 426, 429, 580 A.2d 1004 (1990). \u201cRather, we must defer to the [trier of fact\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>[233 Conn. 215, 224, 658 A.2d 571 (1995)].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McClam, </em>44 Conn.

App. 199, 204, 702 A.2d 651 (1997). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>necticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 70, 699 A.2d 101 (1997).
