We agree. The defendant also claims that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction of any of the three charges. We disagree. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On January 30,1999, at about 7:30 p.m., the defendant observed a dog belonging to his neighbor, Robert Nearing, Jr., enter his yard, at which point the defendant\u2019s dog ran off to play with Nearing\u2019s dog. The defendant, who holds a valid state permit to carry a firearm and was aimed with a .40 caliber handgun, followed the dogs into Nearing\u2019s yard. Upon observing Nearing, the defendant said to him, \u201cCan you keep your fucking dog tied?\u201d The reply was, \u201cWhat\u2019s your fucking problem?\u201d Nearing also told the defendant, \u201cDrag your fucking ass. Go call the cops.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nearing then called the defendant some profane names and punched the defendant in the head. When the defendant fell to the ground, his eyeglasses were knocked off his face and a lens popped out from the frame. The defendant then rose to his feet, withdrew his loaded handgun, pointed it at Nearing\u2019s head and said, \u201cWhat do you think about this?\u201d Nearing at first stood still and then walked away to call the police. The defendant, who was forty-one years old at the time, had undergone hip replacement surgery in 1992. Nearing was substantially larger than the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">The defendant first claims that the court\u2019s jury instructions regarding self-defense were improper. The state and the defendant had filed requests to charge on self-defense. The state concedes, and we agree, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>the court\u2019s instructions were incorrect. The court improperly instructed the jury, in effect, that the act of pointing a loaded gun at another person constitutes a use of \u201cdeadly, physical force\u201d as a matter of law. The state argues that the court should not have given a self-defense instruction because \u201cthe doctrine of self-defense was inapplicable, both as a matter of law and as a matter of fact.\u201d The defendant thus, according to the state\u2019s argument, received \u201ca benefit to which he was not entitled.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Self-defense is a statutory defense pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The act of pointing a loaded handgun at another person fails to fit within the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>tory definition of \u201cdeadly physical force\u201d because it cannot \u201cbe reasonably expected to cause death or serious physical injury . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (5). In addition to characterizing improperly the defendant\u2019s act of pointing the gun, the court improperly confined the jury\u2019s self-defense inquiry to determining whether the defendant was justified in using deadly physical force, that is, whether the defendant reasonably believed that Nearing was using or about to use deadly physical force on him or was inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The state argues that pointing a loaded handgun at someone involves no application of the use of physical force required to trigger the application of the self-defense statute, \u00a7 53a-19. The state claims that \u00a7 53a-19, which provides in relevant part that \u201ca person is justified in <em>using </em>reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself\u2019; (emphasis added); requires an actual use and not merely a threat or show of force. The state further argues that although it requested a charge on self-defense, the facts did not warrant a self-defense instruction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Alternatively, the state argues that even if the defendant can be said to have \u201cused\u201d force in pointing the loaded handgun, the use of force was not at issue because none of the offenses for which the defendant was convicted contains an element that is based on the use of force. The state posits that the court\u2019s deficient instructions were harmless and do not warrant a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>The defendant\u2019s fundamental right to present a defense includes a proper instruction, if such is required, on the elements of self-defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>25 Conn. App. 456, 463, 595 A.2d 895, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 916, 597 A.2d 339 (1991). We review the charge as a whole to determine whether it presented the case to the jury so that no injustice would result. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, 225 </em>Conn. 650, 661, 626 A.2d 287 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Our review of the entire instruction leads us to conclude that it was likely to confuse or mislead the jury, thereby causing prejudice to the defendant. While we do not agree with the defendant that the improper instruction had the effect of directing a verdict for the state, in considering it from the standpoint of its probable effect on the jurors in guiding them, it was reasonably probable that they were misled. The jury understood from the instruction that the defendant had used deadly physical force by admittedly having pointed the loaded gun at Nearing. The defendant was thus greatly prejudiced, and the jurors were left with an improper knowledge of the law so as to make it almost impossible for them properly to apply the facts relevant to the charges. The jury could not fairly perform its extremely difficult task, and, therefore, a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The defendant next claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of any of the crimes with which he was charged. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">The standard for reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims is well settled in this state. \u201cWhen reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, our courts apply a two-prong test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>strued and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>45 Conn. App. 369, 375, 696 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 904, 701 A.2d 335 (1997); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 126, 646 A.2d 169 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>47 Conn. App. 205, 219, 703 A.2d 1164 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>38 Conn. App. 481, 488, 662 A.2d 799 (1995), cert. denied, 237 Conn. 902, 674 A.2d 1333 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">As to the crime of reckless endangerment in the first degree, the defendant claims that there was no evidence to show that he acted with extreme indifference to human life, that he acted recklessly or that he created a risk of serious physical injury to another person by pointing a loaded gun at Nearing. The defendant\u2019s argument lacks merit, as do his arguments dealing with the evidence supporting his conviction for threatening and for breach of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-63 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of reckless endangerment in the first degree when, with extreme indifference to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a risk of serious physical injury to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">\u201c(b) Reckless endangerment in the first degree is a class A misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b788-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of threatening when: (1) By physical threat, he intentionally places or attempts to place another person in fear of imminent serious physical injury, or (2) he threatens to commit any crime of violence with the intent to terrorize another, to cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly, or facility of public transportation, or otherwise to cause serious public inconvenience, or (3) he threatens to commit such crime in reckless disregard of the risk of causing such terror or inconvenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">\u201c(b) Threatening is a class A misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b788-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of breach of the peace when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he . . .

We recognize that a bizarre result would occur in concluding that it did not, i.e., to claim self-defense, one would actually have to make physical contact by shooting or striking another with 1he gun, rather than the obvious less violent act of merely pointing the weapon as a threat or show of force. The state argues that this inquiry is a question for the legislature, not the courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
