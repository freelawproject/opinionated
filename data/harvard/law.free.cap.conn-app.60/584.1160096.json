We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our determination of this appeal. The board is a public agency charged with overseeing the operation of the public schools in the town of Darien. Pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>to General Statutes \u00a7 10-157 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the board conducted an annual evaluation of the superintendent of schools for the 1995-96 school year. As part of the evaluation process, each board member prepared a written preliminary assessment of the superintendent\u2019s performance during the preceding school year. Those preliminary notes were utilized in preparing the final written evaluation that was shared with the superintendent during an executive session of the board. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 l-18a (e), now \u00a7 1-200 (6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At an open meeting following the evaluation, the board voted five to four to renew the superintendent\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">In a letter to the chairperson of the board, dated January 1, 1997, the defendant Walter J. Casey requested \u201ccopies of all records related to the Board of Education\u2019s evaluation of Darien\u2019s Superintendent of Schools .... This should include but not be limited to records related to interim steps in the evaluation process.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> By letter dated February 10, 1997, the board denied Casey\u2019s request because the evaluation was conducted as a confidential process pursuant to board policy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Casey appealed to the commission, alleging that the board\u2019s refusal to disclose the requested materials violated the Freedom of Information Act (act), General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 1-7 et seq., now \u00a7 1-200 et seq. A hearing was held before Clifton A. Leonhardt, who had been designated by the commission as the hearing officer for the case. On September 18,1997, the hearing officer issued a proposed final decision, which the commission adopted as its final decision on October 22, 1997. The final decision required the board to disclose all of the requested materials.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The board appealed from the commission\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. The court affirmed the commission\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal. The court upheld the commission\u2019s finding that the board lacked standing to assert the superintendent\u2019s personal privacy exemption under General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 1-19 (b), now \u00a7 1-210 (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">After the initial oral argument before this court, we ordered supplemental briefs on the following issue: When a request under the act seeks disclosure from a public agency of documents that would arguably constitute an invasion of an employee\u2019s personal privacy, is notice to the employee under General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 l-20a (b), now \u00a7 1-214 (b),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a prerequisite to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the commission\u2019s issuing an order requiring disclosure of said documents? In its supplemental brief, the board states that the superintendent did not receive notice of Casey\u2019s request or of the proceedings before the commission. The commission also acknowledges in its supplemental brief that there is no evidence that the superintendent received notice. Nevertheless, the commission asserts that <em>in this case, </em>\u201cthe close legal and administrative relationship between the superintendent and her board\u201d obviates the notice requirement of \u00a7 1-20a (b), now \u00a7 1-214 (b). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The board\u2019s initial claim is that the court improperly determined that because the superintendent failed to object to the disclosure of her evaluation, the board lacks standing to assert the personal privacy exemption under \u00a7 1-19, now \u00a7 1-210. This claim raises the disposi-tive issue of whether the superintendent received notice of Casey\u2019s request for the disclosure of her evaluation or of the proceedings before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 l-20a, now \u00a7 1-214, a public agency must provide notice to an employee whose personnel, medical or similar files have been requested if the agency reasonably believes that the disclosure of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>records would legally constitute an invasion of privacy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 l-21i (b) (1), now \u00a7 1-206 (b) (1), requires the commission to order \u201cthe public agency to notify any employee whose records are the subject of an appeal ... of the commission\u2019s proceedings and, if any such employee . . . has filed an objection under said subsection (c) [of \u00a7 1-20a, now \u00a7 1-214], the agency shall provide the required notice to such employee ... by certified mail, return receipt requested or by hand delivery with a signed receipt. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Section l-21j-32 (a), now \u00a7 1-21J-34 (a), of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept when the commission [or the presiding officer] shall otherwise direct, the commission shall give written notice of a hearing in any pending matter to all parties, to all persons who have been permitted to participate as intervenors, to all persons otherwise required by statute to be notified, and to such other persons as have filed with the commission their written request for notice of hearing in a particular matter. . . .\u201d This statutory and regulatory scheme ensures that notice of proceedings before the commission will be given to the employee whose records are at issue, even if notice was not given at the time of the initial request. We conclude, therefore, that the commission must ensure that the employee has received notice of its proceedings where the employer has failed to give the required notice pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 l-20a, now \u00a7 1-214, and 1-2 li, now \u00a7 1-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The parties concede in their respective supplemental briefs that, the superintendent did not receive the requisite notice. The board failed to comply with an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>of the commission to provide notice of the hearing to the superintendent. Furthermore, the commission found that despite the mandatory language of \u00a7 l-20a (b), now \u00a7 1-214 (b), \u201cno evidence was introduced at the hearing to show that notice was given to the superintendent . . . and ... to show that the superintendent did, in fact, object to disclosure of the evaluation records.\u201d The commission further found that \u201c[\u00a7 l-20a (b) and (c), now \u00a7 1-214 (b) and (c)] contemplated that the right to assert the invasion of personal privacy exemption was placed in the employee whose privacy is at issue and that the respondents who failed to give the statutorily required notice to the employee do not have standing to assert the exemption.\u201d Notwithstanding those findings, the commission ordered that \u201cin the absence of meeting the burden of proving an exemption, the evaluation records should be disclosed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Our Supreme Court has held that an investigative file of a sexual harassment complaint constitutes a file similar to a personnel file and, as such, may be disclosed pursuant to the act. <em>Connecticut Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse Commission </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>233 Conn. 28, 37-38, 657 A.2d 630 (1995). The court in <em>Connecticut Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse Commission </em>also held that the subject of the investigative file, in addition to the complaining individual, should be given the opportunity to show that the disclosure of the file would constitute an invasion of her privacy. After finding that the subject of the investigative file did not receive notice of the commission\u2019s proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 1-2 li (b) (1), now \u00a7 1-206 (b) (1), the court ordered the matter remanded to the commission, in part, \u201cso that proper notice and an opportunity to intervene may be given to the subject of the investigation, and for a subsequent determination as to whether release of the investigation file would constitute an invasion of the privacy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>complaining officer or the subject of the investigation.\u201d Id., 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">\u201cConnecticut courts have considered a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy and the potential for embarrassment as significant factors in determining if disclosure [of public records] would constitute an invasion of privacy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>West Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>218 Conn. 256, 263, 588 A.2d 1368 (1991). Accordingly, our Supreme Court in <em>West Hartford </em>held that retired municipal employees should be given the opportunity to show that they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their addresses, which were the subject of a request pursuant to the act, before the commission makes a disclosure determination. Id., 264-65. \u201cAfter all, it is an individual\u2019s personal privacy that \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) purports to protect.\u201d Id., 265. The superintendent of the Darien public schools, if she so desires, should be afforded no less of an opportunity to prove that the disclosure of her performance evaluation would constitute an invasion of her privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to vacate the commission\u2019s order of disclosure and to remand the case to the commission with direction that proper notice be given to the superintendent of schools and for a new hearing at which the superintendent of schools will be afforded the opportunity to prove whether the disclosure of the requested documents would cause an invasion of her personal privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\"> Walter J.
