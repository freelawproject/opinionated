See <em>Superintendent </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 453, 105 S. Ct. 2768, 86 L. Ed. 2d 356 (1985); <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 558, 94 S. Ct. 2963, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1974). Thus, when a prison inmate is threatened with a loss of statutory good time credits, the inmate must receive (1) advanced written notice of the disciplinary charges, (2) an opportunity, when consistent with institutional safety and correctional goals, to call witnesses and to present documentary evidence in his defense and (3) a written statement by the fact finder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action. See <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>supra, 563-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Due process is satisfied if the prison disciplinary board shows some evidence that supports the revocation of good time credit. See <em>Superintendent </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 472 U.S. 455. \u201cAscertaining whether this standard is satisfied does not require examination of the entire record, independent assessment of the credibility of witnesses, or weighing of the evidence. Instead, the relevant question is whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by the disciplinary board.\u201d Id., 455-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In this case, the disciplinary reports submitted against the petitioner accorded him the requisite procedural safeguards to satisfy his due process rights. Our review of the entire record leads us to conclude that the court properly reviewed the prison disciplinary board\u2019s decision that resulted in the petitioner\u2019s loss of 769 total days of statutory good time credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
