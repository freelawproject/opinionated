Wasfi, a veterinarian, appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing his administrative appeal. The defendants are the depart-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>merit of public health (department),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which brought charges against the plaintiff, and the Connecticut board of veterinary medicine (board), which revoked the plaintiffs veterinary license. The plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that the board did not violate (1) General Statutes \u00a7 4-178 (7) and principles of due process by applying its specialized knowledge to the facts of this case and (2) either its statutory authority or the plaintiffs due process rights by revoking the plaintiffs license following one incident of misconduct by the plaintiff. We disagree with these claims and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The following facts, found by the board, and procedural history are necessary to our resolution of this appeal. Prior to and during the incident giving rise to this litigation, the plaintiff held a Connecticut veterinary license. On November 28, 1992, a car struck Allison O\u2019Connell\u2019s dog. O\u2019Connell subsequently took the dog to the plaintiffs veterinary hospital for emergency treatment. After the plaintiff diagnosed and treated the dog\u2019s injuries, he informed O\u2019Connell, and his treatment notes indicate, that he diagnosed a fracture to the dog\u2019s radius and that part of the proximal surface of her olecranon bone was missing. The plaintiff also told O\u2019Connell that he repaired the tendons in the dog\u2019s leg with surgical steel wire. The plaintiff testified, and his treatment notes indicate, that he used number one and number two gauge nylon to repair lacerated tendons in the dog\u2019s leg. On the basis of its own expertise, the board found that number one or number two gauge nylon is inappropriate for the treatment of injured tendons in a dog\u2019s leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">On December 7, 1992, O\u2019Connell took the dog to Jeffrey LaCroix, a veterinarian, for further treatment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>LaCroix removed the splint and sutures that the plaintiff had applied to the dog\u2019s leg. LaCroix palpated and took X rays of the dog\u2019s leg, as well as examined X rays that the plaintiff had taken of the dog\u2019s leg. LaCroix concluded, and the board agreed, that the X rays revealed no fractures. His palpation of the dog\u2019s leg revealed that no repair had been performed to any tendons because he found a fully mobile leg joint with no evidence of scar tissue on the leg. The board also found, on the basis of its expertise, that if the plaintiff had repaired the tendons with nylon, LaCroix should easily have been able to detect the nylon when he examined the dog. LaCroix also found that the dog was weight-bearing when he examined her on December 7, 1992. He testified, and the board found, that the dog would not be weight-bearing if she had sustained a tendon repair two weeks earlier. According to LaCroix\u2019s testimony, the dog would not have been weight-bearing for at least four weeks had she sustained a lacerated tendon in her leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">After her visit to LaCroix\u2019s office with the dog, O\u2019Con-nell contacted the department. The department held a compliance conference on August 10, 1993, and, on November 19, 1993, the department submitted charges against the plaintiff to the board. The statement of charges alleged that the plaintiff did not conform to the acceptable standard of care for veterinarians because the plaintiff (1) misdiagnosed the dog\u2019s condition, (2) misrepresented the dog\u2019s condition to her owners and (3) misrepresented to the owners the treatment that he provided to the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">On December 8, 1993, the department sent a notice of hearing to the plaintiff. The board held hearings on April 6 and 27, 1994. Counsel represented the plaintiff at the administrative hearings. In addition to hearing the testimony of the plaintiff, O\u2019Connell and LaCroix, the board heard testimony from Edward A. Williams, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>a veterinarian with considerable experience treating dogs. Williams reviewed the plaintiffs treatment notes, X rays and the X rays taken by LaCroix. He testified, and the board found, that the dog did not sustain a fracture and that the plaintiff did not use surgical steel wire to treat the dog\u2019s leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Williams also testified, and the board found, that the plaintiff violated the customary standard of care required of a licensed veterinarian when he informed O\u2019Connell that the dog\u2019s leg was fractured and that he had treated it with surgical steel wire. On the basis of the testimony of LaCroix and Williams, as well as its own expertise in reviewing the X rays and treatment notes from this case, the board found that the dog had sustained no bone fractures and that the plaintiff had misdiagnosed her injuries. On the basis of O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony and LaCroix\u2019 examination, the board also found that the plaintiff had misinformed O\u2019Connell concerning the dog\u2019s injuries and the treatment that he had provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The plaintiff defended his course of treatment and testified that he likely saved the dog\u2019s life. He claimed that he did perform a tendon repair on the dog, using number one or number two gauge nylon. He denied using, or telling O\u2019Connell that he used, surgical steel wire. He argued that the type of tendon repair he performed could not be seen on X ray examination and that O\u2019Connell misunderstood his explanation of the treatment he had given the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The board concluded that the plaintiffs conduct violated General Statutes \u00a7 20-202 (2). Acting pursuant to the authority granted the board by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-17 and 20-202, the board ordered that the plaintiffs license be revoked effective forty-five days following the issuance of its decision. The plaintiff, thereafter, appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Among other claims, he alleged that the board violated his due process rights and that the record did not contain substantial evidence supporting the board\u2019s conclusions. The court dismissed the appeal. The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion for reargument on the issue of whether the board\u2019s sanction violated the plaintiffs due process rights. The court heard argument on the motion but denied the relief requested. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as they become relevant in the context of the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> governs appellate review of agency decisions. \u201c[W]e note that our review of an administrative appeal is limited. Our Supreme Court has established a firm standard that is appropriately deferential to agency decision making, yet goes beyond a mere judicial rubber stamping of an agency\u2019s decisions. . . . Courts will not substitute their judgment for that of the agency where substantial evidence exists on the record to support the agency\u2019s decision, and where the record reflects that the agency followed appropriate procedures.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Menillo </em>v. <em>Commission on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number><em>Human Rights &amp; </em>Opportunities, 47 Conn. App. 325, 331, 703 A.2d 1180 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">\u201cJudicial review of the conclusions of law reached administratively is also limited. . . . [ I]t is the well established practice ... to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cadlerock Properties Joint Venture, L.P. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>253 Conn. 661, 669, 757 A.2d 1 (2000). Our task is to review the court\u2019s decision to determine whether it comports with the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., and whether \u201cthe court reviewing the administrative agency acted unreasonably, illegally, or in abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>48 Conn. App. 599, 605, 712 A.2d 423 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The board found, on the basis of its own expertise, that number one or number two gauge nylon is too thick to be used effectively in repairing tendons in a dog\u2019s leg. The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly approved the board\u2019s finding based on specialized technical knowledge without giving timely notice to the parties that it was doing so, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 4-178 (7) and the plaintiffs due process rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The procedural rules embodied in the UAPA, applicable to the present case, satisfy the procedural safeguards mandated by the due process clause. <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>228 Conn. 651, 661, 638 A.2d 6 (1994). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>A party to an administrative hearing possesses the right to respond to evidence, cross-examine witnesses and present evidence relevant to the issues before the agency. General Statutes \u00a7 4-177c.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cDue process of law requires not only that there be due notice of the hearing but that at the hearing the parties involved have a right to produce relevant evidence, and an opportunity to know the facts on which the agency is asked to act, to cross-examine witnesses and to offer rebuttal evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 536, 525 A.2d 940 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The present dispute concerns the application of specific evidentiary rules in contested cases, namely, subsections (6), (7) and (8) of General Statutes \u00a7 4-178. General Statutes \u00a7 4-178 (6) provides that \u201cnotice may be taken of judicially cognizable facts and of generally recognized technical or scientific facts within the agency\u2019s specialized knowledge . . . .\u201d Section 4-178 (7) provides that \u201cparties shall be notified in a timely manner of any material noticed, including any agency memoranda or data, and they shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the material so noticed . . . .\u201d Agency members are prohibited from relying on nonre-cord material facts about a dispute before them, such as facts learned from first-hand investigation of case-specific details, without giving the parties before them the opportunity to rebut such evidence. See <em>Palmisano </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>27 Conn. App. 543, 548, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>608 A.2d 100 (1992). General Statutes \u00a7 4-178 (8), however, provides that \u201cthe agency\u2019s experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge may be used in the evaluation of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Administrative boards comprised of at least a majority of members expert in their field are presumed \u201ccompetent to determine the issues upon the basis of their own knowledge and experience\u201d; <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>State Dept. of Health, </em>135 Conn. 339, 350, 64 A.2d 330 (1949); and are entitled to decide the issues before them without expert testimony. See id. Our Supreme Court has noted that as long as an administrative board consists of a \u201cmajority of experts in the field involved in the case, the board may rely on its own expertise in evaluating charges against persons licensed by the board and the requisite standard of care by which to judge such cases.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jutkowitz v. Dept. of Health Services, </em>220 Conn. 86, 111, 596 A.2d 374 (1991); see also <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The legislature, therefore, distinguishes between an agency\u2019s use of nonrecord facts as proof of the specific issues in a case and the agency\u2019s use of its expertise and technical competence when evaluating evidence on issues properly before it. Our Supreme Court discussed this distinction and noted that \u201c[t]he difference between an administrative tribunal\u2019s use of non-record information included in its expert knowledge, as a substitute for evidence or notice, and its application of its background in evaluating and drawing conclusions from the evidence that is in the record, is primarily a difference of degree rather than of kind.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>211 Conn. 508, 532, 560 A.2d 403 (1989). Parties are entitled to notice of any nonrecord facts that will constitute proof in a case. In contrast, however, \u201cthe examiner\u2019s use of his experience in evaluating proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>that has been offered is not only unavoidable but, indeed, desirable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 532-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">In <em>Breiner </em>v. <em>State Dental Commission, </em>57 Conn. App. 700, 750 A.2d 1111 (2000), this court affirmed a trial court\u2019s decision declining to apply the futility exception to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. The plaintiff in <em>Breiner, </em>a dentist, was the subject of a disciplinary proceeding before the state dental commission. He claimed that he could not receive a fair hearing because board members had taken a position publicly on a policy issue related to the dispute. Relevant to our inquiry in the present case is our reasoning in <em>Breiner </em>that the position taken by the board members concerned the standards of practice rather than knowledge or a position taken on the adjudicative facts specific to that dispute. \u201cStandards of practice comment on the appropriate conduct of an entire profession, not just a particular individual. Accordingly, standards of practice . . . need not be treated as factual information contained in the record of an administrative proceeding.\u201d Id., 707. We analyze the issue before us mindful of these distinctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In the present case, the court found that the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he lacked notice that the board would use its own expertise regarding the proper gauge and type of the suture material is without merit. The court noted that after the administrative hearings, the board sent notice to the parties that it was opening the record to admit into evidence a sample of suturing material called chromic gut, also known as catgut. After the plaintiff objected, the board permitted him to present argument on the issue. At the subsequent hearing, which dealt with the issue of the suture material, the plaintiff offered the board a sample of the type of number two nylon suture material he claimed he used in his treatment of the dog. The plaintiffs attorney explained, in detail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>why the plaintiff used nylon and why it was a superior suture material for the type of procedure that the plaintiff allegedly performed. The board admitted into the record the number two gauge nylon that the plaintiff offered, and the plaintiff demonstrated for the board his technique in knotting the material. The court found that this hearing alone gave the plaintiff notice and an opportunity to address the board on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Our review of the record, as well, indicates that board members discussed with the plaintiff during the initial hearings the gauge of nylon appropriate to suture tendons in the dog\u2019s leg. During the plaintiffs questioning, the plaintiff discussed and defended his position to use number one and number two gauge nylon. A veterinarian on the board shared his experience using number two nylon to repair tendons, noting that it could be considered \u201crope,\u201d and stated that he used it while treating cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Despite the plaintiffs arguments, the record supports the court\u2019s reasoning that the plaintiff had notice that the board was considering the propriety of the plaintiffs alleged use of number one or number two gauge nylon. The department\u2019s statement of charges put the plaintiff on notice that the board would investigate his deviation from the standard of care when he misdiagnosed and misrepresented the dog\u2019s injuries and when he misrepresented the treatment of those injuries. A central issue in this dispute focused on whether the plaintiff misrepresented the treatment he performed; resolving this issue required the board to determine if the plaintiff sutured tendons in the dog\u2019s leg. His testimony that he sutured tendons with number two nylon and that number two nylon was the proper material to use on the dog\u2019s injuries on November 28,1992, and his demonstration before the board showing how he used the material were properly before the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>The composition of the board, as well as \u00a7 4-178 (8), put the plaintiff on notice that the board would use its own expertise when determining whether the plaintiffs alleged acts conformed to the standard of care. The board is comprised, in part, of practitioners of veterinary medicine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This composition alone provides notice that board members will bring their specialized knowledge to bear on the issues and evidence properly before them. The board did not import nonrecord proof about this case into its deliberations. Rather, after hearing the plaintiffs testimony about the suturing that he allegedly performed, the board applied its practical experience regarding the appropriateness of the suturing material that the plaintiff claims to have used. After hearing the plaintiffs testimony that he used nylon to repair the tendons in the dog\u2019s leg, the board, without needing expert testimony and on the basis of its own experience, was competent to determine whether the plaintiffs choice of suturing material complied with professional standards of care. See <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 666; <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 593, 590 A.2d 447 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>The plaintiff cites <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>27 Conn. App. 346, 606 A.2d 716 (1992), for the proposition that the board was prohibited from relying on its own expertise without giving notice to the plaintiff that it would do so. In <em>Marshall, </em>a hearing officer improperly relied on his own expertise or judicial notice without giving notice to the parties, in violation of \u00a7 4-178 (7). Id., 352-53. That case is distinguishable from the present case because, unlike the facts here, the agency officer in that case reached his decision by relying only on proof of the specific blood alcohol content of the plaintiff in that dispute, which was clearly outside of his professional expertise and not part of the record. The plaintiffs reliance on <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>180 Conn. 421, 429 A.2d 910 (1980), is also misplaced. The issue in that case was whether \u201ccommissioners who have not been shown to possess expertise in [the area of a complex pollution issue] may rely on their own knowledge, <em>without more, </em>in deciding to deny a license to conduct a regulated activity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 427. The court in <em>Feinson </em>found that the record lacked sufficient reliable evidence to sustain the commission\u2019s action. Id. In contrast, the experts on the board in this case had the authority to apply their professional experience to the facts and testimony before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Even if we were to conclude that the board violated \u00a7 4-178, we conclude that the board\u2019s finding on this specific issue nonetheless constituted harmless error under the circumstances of this case. The board made numerous findings, apart from finding that the plaintiffs choice of number one or number two gauge nylon was, in its experience, inappropriate, to support the conclusion that the plaintiff misdiagnosed and misrepresented the dog\u2019s injuries. The critical finding underlying the board\u2019s decision occurred when the board believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>LaCroix\u2019s testimony that \u201cno repair had been done\u201d and that \u201ca dog would not be weight-bearing on a limb that had a tendon repair two weeks earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The plaintiff contends that the board should have given him notice \u201cthat it would consider the appropriateness of the gauge of the suturing material used in the treatment of the dog.\u201d The plaintiff argues that if he had been given such notice, he \u201ccould have presented expert evidence concerning the gauge of the material as well.\u201d We are not persuaded that the additional testimony would have had any bearing on the board\u2019s critical finding that the plaintiff did not perform any tendon repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The plaintiff next argues that the board\u2019s revocation of his license to practice veterinary medicine based on \u201ca single charge of unskillfulness\u201d violates his rights to substantive due process. The plaintiff essentially argues that this penalty is disproportionate \u201cin light of the nature of the claimed dereliction, the equivocal evidence in the record supporting the charges, the complete recovery of the dog and the hardship to [the plaintiff].\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Under state law, a licensed veterinarian may not have his or her license revoked except for cause. The plaintiff, therefore, had a constitutionally protected property interest in keeping his license. See <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>236 Conn. 421, 437-38, 673 A.2d 514 (1996). \u201c[A] licensed physician has a right and estate in his profession of which he cannot be deprived without due process of law. . . . Cases are legion holding, in one way or another, that the right of a licentiate to practice his profession is a property right . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>49 Conn. App. 669, 679, 716 A.2d 127 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">To the extent that the plaintiff challenges the relevant statutes that govern the disciplinary action in this dispute, namely, \u00a7\u00a7 20-202 and 19a-17, we evaluate the issue under a well established standard. \u201cConstitutional attacks on the rationality of economic or social welfare legislation must rebut the presumption of constitutionality that attaches to such legislation. [T]he burden is on one complaining of a due process violation to establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Education Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Tirozzi, </em>210 Conn. 286, 299, 554 A.2d 1065 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Once the board finds any of the enumerated causes listed in \u00a7 20-202, it may take disciplinary action as set forth in \u00a7 19a-17, the section governing professions under the jurisdiction of the department of public health. General Statutes \u00a7 20-202 (2) permits the board to take action pursuant to \u00a7 19a-17 when there is \u201cproof that the holder of [a veterinary] license . . . has become unfit or incompetent or has been guilty of cruelty, unskillfulness or negligence towards animals and birds . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17 (1) allows for the revocation of a practitioner\u2019s license or permit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After finding that the plaintiff violated \u00a7 20-202 (2), the board revoked his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">We conclude that it is neither arbitrary nor irrational for the legislature to permit the board to take disciplinary action against practitioners whom it finds to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>acted negligently or unskillfully. The legislature certainly may protect the public interest by ensuring that licensed veterinarians adhere to professional standards of care. It is rational to allow the board, comprised in part of professionals, to protect the quality of the profession and the care given to animals by adjudicating alleged instances of unskillfulness or misconduct by licensed practitioners. Likewise, permitting the board to assess the appropriate penalty does not violate substantive due process. The legislature could have reasoned that board members who are familiar with the standards of the profession and the unique facts of each case that come before them are in the best position to levy an appropriate penalty against fellow practitioners. Also, the fact that the legislature delegated the power to revoke a professional\u2019s license following just one instance of misconduct is rationally related to the interests of punishing transgressors and preventing future harm to the animals under the care of such practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">We next consider whether the board abused its discretion in its application of \u00a7\u00a7 20-202 and 19a-17. As a preliminary matter, it is necessary to set forth our well established standard of review. \u201c \u2018If the penalty meted out is within the limits prescribed by law, the matter lies within the exercise of the [agency\u2019s] discretion and cannot be successfully challenged unless the discretion has been abused.\u2019 <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>141 Conn. 218, 230, 104 A.2d 890 (1954). Sentencing is an inherently fact bound inquiry. In an administrative appeal, a reviewing \u2018court can do no more, on the factual questions presented, than to examine the record to determine whether the ultimate findings were supported, as the statute requires, by substantial evidence.\u2019 <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>191 Conn. 384, 409, 465 A.2d 308 (1983).\u201d <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>supra, 228 Conn. 677-78. In other words, \u201c[o]ur ultimate duty is to determine, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>254 Conn. 333, 343, 757 A.2d 561 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Section 19a-17 permits the board, after finding good cause, to take any of the available disciplinary actions, which vary in severity, enumerated in that section. The record contains substantial evidence supporting the department\u2019s charges against the plaintiff that he violated \u00a7 20-202 (2). The issue is whether the board abused its discretion by revoking the plaintiff\u2019s license under \u00a7 19a-17 (1) because of that incident. The plaintiff argues that his license was revoked for \u201ca single instance of claimed unskillfulness.\u201d Given the board\u2019s findings that the plaintiff misrepresented that he repaired tendons in the dog\u2019s leg, misrepresented that he used surgical steel wire in those repairs, misdiagnosed a fractured radius and misdiagnosed an injury to the olecranon, we cannot conclude that the plaintiff has been punished for a single act.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">In any event, the statute does not state that the penalty of revocation applies only to individuals who commit multiple acts of misconduct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are bound to read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>and interpret statutes as they are written. <em>Mack </em>v. <em>Lavalley, </em>55 Conn. App. 150, 166, 738 A.2d 718, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 928, 742 A.2d 363 (1999). To read the statute as preventing the board from revoking a practitioner\u2019s license following one serious incident of misconduct until other acts of misconduct occurred would be inconsistent with the policies the statute was designed to implement. See <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>247 Conn. 442, 455, 724 A.2d 481 (1999). When the legislature has deemed it necessary to impose such limitations on agency decision making, it does so expressly. The agency is not bound to explain its decision to impose one penalty as opposed to the other available penalties set forth in \u00a7 19a-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">In several instances, our Supreme Court has upheld the revocation of a professional license based on one instance of misconduct. In one case, the state board of nursing examiners revoked a registered nurse\u2019s license after it found that she converted a drug to her own use. <em>Leib </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners for Nursing, </em>177 Conn. 78, 81, 411 A.2d 42 (1979). In <em>Gibson v. Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>supra, 141 Conn. 220-21, a physician\u2019s license was revoked because of several acts of misconduct during the course of treatment of one patient. Furthermore, the court in <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>State Dept. of Health, </em>supra, 135 Conn. 355, held that the medical examining board\u2019s choice of appropriate discipline was not an abuse of discretion, when the board revoked a physician\u2019s license after it found that he had performed an operation in an unprofessional maimer.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The plaintiff argues that we should review the board\u2019s action in accordance with the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Pell </em>v. <em>Board of Education of Union Free School District No. 1, </em>313 N.E.2d 321, 34 N.Y.2d 222, 356 N.Y.S.2d 833 (1974). That decision, however, involved \u201conly disciplinary sanctions imposed internally in various administrative agencies and . . . not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>. . . discipline imposed upon regulated persons or entities outside an administrative agency.\u201d Id., 331. Our task is not to second-guess the agency\u2019s choice of sanction. We look to whether evidence existed that gave the agency the discretion to impose the penalty of revocation. Our statutes dictate that matters under an agency\u2019s discretionary review must not be \u201carbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (6). While these terms are necessarily vague, they also represent the authority that our General Assembly has vested in administrative agencies. As we are prohibited from reading into statutes provisions that are not clearly stated; see <em>Morales </em>v. <em>Pentec, Inc., </em>57 Conn. App. 419, 429, 749 A.2d 47 (2000); we will not restrict the deference we are statutorily bound to give administrative decisions in the absence of statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">Mindful of the board\u2019s purpose of insuring \u201cproper veterinary care and the protection of the public health, considering the convenience and welfare of the animals being treated\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 20-196 (a); we cannot conclude that the board exceeded its authority or abused its discretion in revoking the plaintiffs license. In the analogous context of reviewing a board of education\u2019s exercise of discretion in terminating a teacher\u2019s contract following one incident of misconduct, our Supreme Court affirmed the board\u2019s decision, noting that \u201c[wjhether termination is justifiable on the basis of a single incident is a qualitative not quantitative analysis; one serious incident can suffice.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>252 Conn. 753, 771, 749 A.2d 1173 (2000). In the present case, members of the board found that the plaintiff performed below the standard of care in his profession, misdiagnosed injuries and deliberately misrepresented to an owner the treatment that he provided to the owner\u2019s animal. The board\u2019s punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>does not appear to rest on any one particular finding, but on the cumulative effect of all of the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The plaintiffs argument that his misconduct did not seriously injure the dog misses the point. The board was free to find, after having the benefit of questioning the plaintiff at length, that the plaintiffs failure properly to diagnose or to treat the dog\u2019s injuries demonstrated a risk that he would perform below the standard of care in the future. The board may have reasoned, as well, that misrepresenting to the dog\u2019s owner the services that he performed was not a simple oversight, but the type of conduct that could harm other pet owners in the future. On the evidence presented, the board could conclude that the plaintiffs conduct betrayed the trust that is reposed in him as a licensed veterinarian and compromised the integrity of his profession. The legislature vested in the board the power to evaluate the competency of veterinarians in this state and to adjudicate complaints and impose proper sanctions when warranted. The board found the plaintiffs conduct to deviate from the standard of care to such an extent that it warranted the revocation of his license. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude as a matter of law that the board\u2019s action was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-7\"> On July 1, 1995, the department of public health and addiction services became known as the department of public health.
