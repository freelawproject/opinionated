We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">The court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the record disclose the following facts and procedural history. The defendants are married and self-employed. After several business reversals, they applied for and received state assistance. In February, 1997, the state seized business records from the defendants\u2019 home pursuant to a search warrant. After reviewing the records, the state accused the defendants of concealing income and assets when they applied for state aid. On March 25,1997, the defendants were arrested in connection with the defrauding of a public community. The state charged each defendant with one count of larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 and one count of conspiracy to commit larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-122.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>On July 8, 1998, the defendants entered guilty pleas under the <em>Alford, </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the plea canvass, the defendants agreed that they had sufficient time to talk to their respective counsel and were satisfied with the advice that counsel provided. Prior to sentencing, the defendants filed identical motions to vacate their guilty pleas, claiming, inter alia, that their pleas were a result of ineffective assistance of counsel. At the hearing on the motions to vacate, the defendants presented only their own testimony. They did not call their trial attorneys or the forensic financial consultant who their trial counsel had retained. The court denied their motions to vacate and thereafter sentenced each defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The defendants first claim that the court improperly denied their motions to vacate their guilty pleas because their counsel were ineffective when they failed to conduct a proper forensic investigation, thereby violating the defendants\u2019 rights to effective assistance of counsel under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Our standard of review of the court\u2019s denial of a motion to vacate a guilty plea is limited to a determination of whether, by such denial, the court abused its discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rothenberg, </em>195 Conn. 253, 264, 487 A.2d 545 (1985); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>8 Conn. App. 517, 524, 513 A.2d 744, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 810, 516 A.2d 886 (1986). In making that determination, we must assess the merit of the defendants\u2019 claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">In <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the United States Supreme Court adopted a two part standard for evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to which a defendant must show (1) that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) that defense counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>234 Conn. 139, 154, 662 A.2d 718 (1995); see also <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>57 Conn. App. 651, 664-65, 751 A.2d 398, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 918, 759 A.2d 1024 (2000). To prevail, a defendant must satisfy both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Quintana </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>55 Conn. App. 426, 445, 739 A.2d 701, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 904, 743 A.2d 614 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Here, the court determined that the defendants failed to meet the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. We agree. The defendants failed to show that their counsels\u2019 representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness or that counsels\u2019 conduct was deficient with regard to the forensic investigation. The court found and concluded in its memorandum of decision that \u201c[a] forensic financial consultant was retained by defense counsel. The consultant examined financial documents that the state had disclosed to the defendants and provided defense counsel with an analysis of the state\u2019s claims.\u201d We conclude that there is evidence to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>the court\u2019s finding that there was no deficient performance; therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendants\u2019 motions. Because the defendants failed to prove deficient performance, we need not consider the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. See <em>Foreshow </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>48 Conn. App. 122, 128, 708 A.2d 600, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 935, 717 A.2d 232 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">We next turn to the defendants\u2019 additional claims that their counsel (1) did not prepare for trial, (2) first advised the defendants that their trial was going forward just before the commencement of the trial, thereby depriving them of time to review and consider their options, and (3) without any factual basis, counseled the defendants that a trial would be infected by racism because of pretrial publicity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We decline to review these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-10,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it is the appellant\u2019s responsibility to provide an adequate record for review. That responsibility includes moving for articulation when the trial court has failed to state the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>of a decision; <em>Gerber &amp; Hurley, Inc. </em>v. <em>CCC Corp., </em>36 Conn. App. 539, 543, 651 A.2d 1302 (1995); the legal basis of a ruling is unclear; <em>Leverty &amp; Hurley Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>192 Conn. 377, 379, 471 A.2d 958 (1984); or the court has overlooked a matter. <em>Wolk </em>v. <em>Wolk, </em>191 Conn. 328, 335 n.1, 464 A.2d 780 (1983). The court made no specific findings regarding these three additional claims, and the defendants failed to seek an articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We will not review these claims without a basis for ascertaining why the court made no specific findings as to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-9\"> We treat the appeals as one appeal because the facts of each case, and the defendants\u2019 briefs and claims are identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b865-8\"> <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 35-39, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), permits a criminal defendant to plead guilty without admitting that he committed the crime in order to take advantage of a plea bargain and to avoid tire risk of conviction after a trial and possibly a more severe sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b865-9\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">Article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut also guarantees the right to effective assistance of counsel and provides in relevant part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself and by counsel . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b867-9\"> At oral argument before us, the defendants also claimed that they should prevail because (1) the state did not present evidence to contradict their testimony, (2) the court did not expressly state that it disbelieved their testimony and (3) the court improperly \u201cignored\u201d some of their claims. Those claims were not briefed and, therefore, axe not entitled to review. See <em>In re Adelina G., </em>56 Conn. App. 40, 42, 740 A.2d 920 (1999) (issue regarding dispositional phase raised during oral arguments not briefed and, therefore, not entitled to review); see also <em>Shew </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>245 Conn. 149, 166 n.20, 714 A.2d 664 (1998) (issue not briefed not entitled to review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b867-13\"> Practice Book \u00a7 61-10 provides: \u201cIt is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review.
