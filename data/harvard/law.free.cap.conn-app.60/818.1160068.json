The defendant has appealed from the judgment of dissolution, claiming that the trial court abused its discretion in its financial and property award and in ordering the defendant to pay $10,000 toward the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">\u201cThe well settled standard of review in domestic relations cases is that this court will not disturb trial court orders unless the trial court has abused its legal discretion or its findings have no reasonable basis in the facts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>... As has often been explained, the foundation for this standard is that the trial court is in a clearly advantageous position to assess the personal factors significant to a domestic relations case, such as demeanor and attitude of the parlies at the hearing. ... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>244 Conn. 158, 174-75, 708 A.2d 949 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, \u201cthe unquestioned rule is that great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>244 Conn. 523, 534, 710 A.2d 757 (1998). \u201c[W]e do not review the evidence to determine whether a conclusion different from the one reached could have been reached.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>46 Conn. App. 87, 90-91, 699 A.2d 1029 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In reaching its decision in the present case, the court properly considered the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 (c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 46b-82<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 46b-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>62,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the applicable case law and the evidence presented by the parties. Our review of the record, transcripts and briefs fails to disclose any abuse of discretion. The court\u2019s conclusions were in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c) provides: \u201cIn fixing the nature and value of the property, if any, to be assigned, the court, after hearing the witnesses, if any, of each party, except as provided in subsection (a) of section 46b-51, shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the annulment, dissolution of the marriage or legal separation, the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities and needs of each of the parties and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income.
