We affirm the .judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the issues raised in this appeal. On November 17, 1998, the plaintiff was arrested in Colchester for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The police officers transported the plaintiff to the Colches-ter state police barracks where they advised him of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number><em>Miranda? </em>rights, read him an implied consent advisory and gave him the opportunity to contact an attorney. Thereafter, the plaintiff agreed to submit to a breath test. The arresting officer explained the test to the plaintiff, specifying that he was required to take a deep breath and form a tight seal around the mouthpiece. The plaintiff failed to make a tight seal, took short breaths and released only short bursts of air into the machine. As a result of the plaintiffs actions, the allotted time on the machine expired, which prevented the officer from obtaining a sufficient sample for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Subsequently, the commissioner suspended the plaintiffs license to operate a motor vehicle for a period of one year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff requested and received an administrative hearing in which the commissioner, acting through his hearing officer, upheld the suspension. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, which dismissed the appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The plaintiff contends that there was not substantial evidence in the record of his refusal to take the test. The state argues that although the plaintiff orally agreed to take a breath test, his subsequent conduct amounted to a refusal. Refusal to take a breath test can occur through conduct as well as an expressed refusal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbeil, </em>41 Conn. App. 7, 19, 674 A.2d 454, cert. granted on other grounds, 237 Conn. 919, 676 A.2d 1374 (1996) (appeal dismissed as moot because of death of defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">In <em>Bialowas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>44 Conn. App. 702, 714-15, 692 A.2d 834 (1997), this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>held that \u201cwhere it is undisputed that the motorist submitted to the chemical alcohol test, the fact that he failed to provide an adequate breath sample does not automatically constitute refusal within the meaning of \u00a7 14-227b. Such refusal must be supported by substantial evidence.\u201d The gravamen of the holding in <em>Bialowas </em>is that, without more, an officer\u2019s conclusory statement that an operator has failed to provide an adequate breath sample and has, therefore, refused, does not constitute substantial evidence. In <em>Bialowas, </em>the officer failed to furnish supporting evidence for his conclusion that the plaintiff in that case had refused to take the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">In the present case, however, the court found that \u201c[the plaintiff] was instructed to blow into the intoxi-lizer forming a tight seal around the mouthpiece, but continually failed to do so. He was also instructed to take an initial deep breath prior to blowing into the machine, but made no attempt to do so. [He was] observed taking short breaths and released very little air into the machine on each attempt he made. He then began to release short bursts of air into it, instead of continuous breath and the allotted time expired.\u201d The court also noted that the evidence before the hearing officer contained the police officer\u2019s observations that the plaintiffs chest and stomach did not rise or fall or exhibit any other indication of breathing and that no air was being expelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In the present case, as contrasted with the naked conclusion of the police officer in <em>Bialowas, </em>the officer furnished supporting details. Factual determinations of the commissioner must be upheld if there is substantial evidence in the record to support such a finding. <em>O\u2019Rourke </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>33 Conn. App. 501, 506-507, 636 A.2d 409, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 909, 642 A.2d 1205 (1994). \u201cAn administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>can be reasonably inferred. . . . Such a standard of review allows less room for judicial scrutiny than does the weight of the evidence rule or the clearly erroneous rule. ... In determining whether an administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence, a court must defer to . . . the agency\u2019s right to believe or disbelieve the evidence presented by any witness, even an expert, in whole or in part.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>48 Conn. App. 391, 400, 710 A.2d 807, cert. denied, 245 Conn. 917, 717 A.2d 234 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Whether the plaintiffs actions constituted a refusal to submit to the test presented a question of fact, and, therefore, the trial court\u2019s review was limited to determining whether the hearing officer\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Altschul </em>v. <em>Salinas, </em>53 Conn. App. 391, 398, 730 A.2d 1171 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner and must affirm the commissioner\u2019s decision unless it is \u201cclearly erroneous in view of the rehable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the present case, the court properly concluded that substantial evidence existed to support the commissioner\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The plaintiff also claims that he was denied due process of law because, when he was testifying, the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>officer asked him if he had ever taken a breath test before. The record shows that the plaintiff did not object to the question or the answer given. Accordingly, the plaintiff waived any objection he may have had to the question or answer. His failure to make a proper objection at the administrative hearing precludes him from raising the issue on appeal. See <em>Finkenstein </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>192 Conn. 104, 114, 470 A.2d 1196 (1984).
