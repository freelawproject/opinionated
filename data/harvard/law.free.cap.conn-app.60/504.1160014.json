J.</author>\n<p id=\"A35n\">The defendant Joseph Savino appeals from the judgment of the trial court sustaining the appeal of the plaintiffs, Holly Lauver and Jean-Claude Doucet,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the decision of the defendant planning and zoning commission of the town of Canterbury (commission) granting Savino a special exception permit (permit). On appeal, Savino claims that the court improperly (1) concluded that notice of the commission\u2019s May 9, 1996 public hearing was invalid due to a clerical error in his April 3, 1996 application (original application) for the permit, (2) concluded that a claim of automatic approval cannot be raised in an administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>tive appeal and (3) voided the permit rather than remanding Savino\u2019s May 7, 1996 application (amended application) for a new hearing. We agree with Savino\u2019s third claim and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. On April 13, 1996, Savino applied for a permit, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g), to excavate sand and gravel from a portion of almost twenty-three acres of real property that he owns. The property lies in the adjacent towns of Scotland and Canterbury with 8.99 acres being located in Scotland and 13.89 acres in Canterbury. The excavation site is in Canterbury, but access to the site is over an existing driveway that traverses the land of others in Scotland. The commission granted the permit on August 8,1996. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court, claiming that when the commission approved the permit, it acted illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion. The court concluded that notice of the hearing on the amended application was defective and, in sustaining the appeal, voided the commission\u2019s action with respect to the permit. Savino appealed to this court. Additional pertinent facts will be set forth in the discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Savino\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly determined that notice of the commission\u2019s May 9,1996 public hearing was invalid due to a clerical error in his original application.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. Savino\u2019s original application, filed on April 3, 1996, identified the excavation site as being located in Scotland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At a preliminary meeting, the commission indicated that \u201ca better description of the land involved and map and lot numbers should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>be added to the application,\u201d but caused the required notices for a public hearing on the original application that was to be held on May 9, 1996, to be published. At the commission\u2019s public hearing held on May 9,1996, the original application was not even on the agenda.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In response to the directive for a better description of the land involved, Savino filed an amended application on May 7, 1996. The commission caused notice of the amended application to be published on May 31 and June 11, 1996, for a public hearing to be held on June 13, 1996. The commission continued the June 13 hearing to June 27 and July 9, 1996, and approved the amended application on August 8, 1996. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The court sustained the appeal because it determined that the amended application was an application different from the original one, that it required its own notice and that notice of the public hearing for the amended application was defective, as it did not comply with \u00a7 8-3 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 8-3 (a) requires that notice of a hearing be published twice, the first not more than fifteen nor less than ten days before the hearing and the second not less than two days before the hearing. When the time requirements for notice are computed, the terminal days are excluded, <em>Lunt </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>150 Conn. 532, 536, 191 A.2d 553 (1963). The trial court found that because the second notice of the hearing on the amended application was given on June 11, 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>it was not given two days before the June 13, 1996 public hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court, therefore, concluded that the commission\u2019s action approving the amended application was void because notice was not given in accord with \u00a7 8-3 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">On appeal before us, Savino argues that the commission continued the hearing on his original application from May 9 to June 13, 1996, and that a separate notice was not necessary to consider his amended application. Savino also argues that the public was not misled by his original application because if interested parties had gone to the commission\u2019s office and reviewed the application and map, they would have seen that the excavation site was in Canterbury, not Scotland. Further, he claims that the public could not have been confused because the commission can make decisions only about land situated in Canterbury, not Scotland. He also asserts that the plaintiff has raised form over substance because hundreds of individuals turned out at the public hearing and a substantial effort was made to oppose the granting of the permit. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The questions before this court are whether the trial court properly concluded that the original application and the amended application were separate and distinct and therefore required separate legal notice, and whether the court correctly concluded that the commission\u2019s granting of the permit was illegal for want of proper notice. See <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>233 Conn. 198, 205-206, 658 A.2d 559 (1995); <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 146, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>152, 543 A.2d 1339 (1988); <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>31 Conn. App. 270, 273, 624 A.2d 909 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u201cThe scope of review of a trial court\u2019s factual decision on appeal is limited to a determination of whether it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings. . . . Conclusions are not erroneous unless they violate law, logic or reason or are inconsistent with the subordinate facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>R &amp; R Pool &amp; Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>43 Conn. App. 563, 567, 684 A.2d 1207 (1996). \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jago-Ford </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>34 Conn. App. 402, 407, 642 A.2d 14 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In this case, the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the description of the subject property in the amended application was different from the description in the original application. Furthermore, the original application was not even on the amended agenda of the May 9, 1996 hearing so there could have been no continuance because no action was taken by the commission. The court\u2019s findings therefore are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">\u201cThe failure to give statutory notice to the general public is a subject matter jurisdictional defect and it cannot be waived nor can jurisdiction be conferred by consent of the applicant. <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, 220 </em>Conn. 455, 461-62, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). \u2018Strict compliance with statutory mandates regarding notice to the public is necessary\u2019; <em>Koskoff </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>[27 Conn. App. 443, 447, 607 A.2d 1146, cert. granted, 222 Conn. 912, 608 A.2d 695 (1992) (appeal withdrawn November 18, 1992)]; and \u2018[f]ailure to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>proper notice constitutes a jurisdictional defect.\u2019 <em>Slagle </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>144 Conn. 690, 693, 137 A.2d 542 (1957); see also <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>174 Conn. 488, 491, 391 A.2d 146 (1978).\u201d <em>Center Shops of East Granby, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>52 Conn. App. 763, 774, 727 A.2d 807 (1999), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 253 Conn. 183, 749 A.2d 1185 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">As to Savino\u2019s claim that the court elevated form over substance, \u201c[z]oning commissions are required to provide adequate published notice of a public hearing to be held on an application or request for a special permit or special exception. . . . Specifically, this court has held that the purpose behind the notice requirement of \u00a7 8-3 is fairly and sufficiently to apprise those who may be affected by the proposed action of the nature and character of the proposed action so as to enable them to prepare intelligently for the hearing.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nazarko </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>50 Conn. App. 517, 519, 717 A.2d 853, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 941, 723 A.2d 318 (1998); see also <em>Delfino </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>30 Conn. App. 454, 461, 620 A.2d 836 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u201cA defect in the content of the notice cannot be cured by proof that some members of the public received actual notice, or appeared at the hearing. <em>Cocivi </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>20 Conn. App. 705, 708, 570 A.2d 226, cert. denied, 214 Conn. 808, 573 A.2d 319 (1990) . Before this court can conclude that any action taken by the board is valid, the notice provision must be complied with fully. <em>Slagle </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>[supra, 144 Conn. 693].\u201d <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Board, </em>25 Conn. App. 164, 168, 593 A.2d 975 (1991) .</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Although <em>Peters </em>concerned General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (c), this court noted in <em>Peters </em>that the notice provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>sions in \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 and 22a-42a (c) were similar and that the same standards applied. Id., 167-68. As we did in <em>Peters, </em>we reject the argument that the notice was sufficient because the public knew about the application and could have gone to the commission\u2019s office to look at the map of the subject property. \u201c[W]e are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the general public should have cross-referenced the application number with city hall records, or that earlier newspaper articles had connected the property to [the applicant for the permit]. The statute does not call for cumulative notice, nor does it ask that the general public employ the skills of a research librarian to determine where the subject property is located. The act of giving statutory notice is much too important to be done by way of informal, unofficial or chancy cross-referencing.\u201d Id., 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We therefore conclude that the court properly determined that the May 9, 1996 public hearing was not for the same application as was the subject of the June 13, 1996 public hearing, and, therefore, separate legal notices were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Savino\u2019s second claim is that the court improperly concluded that a claim of automatic approval cannot be raised in an administrative appeal. We affirm the court\u2019s refusal to find that the application for the permit was automatically approved, but for a different reason. See <em>Stapleton </em>v. <em>Lombardo, </em>151 Conn. 414, 417, 198 A.2d 697 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The following facts are relevant to this claim. Savino applied for approval of the site plan, as well as the permit. Pursuant to \u00a7 8-3 (g),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> if a commission fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>act on a site plan within the time specified by General Statutes \u00a7 8-7d,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the site plan is automatically approved. Savino claimed before the trial court that because the commission failed to approve his site plan within the time specified by \u00a7 8-7d, he was entitled by default to approval of both the site plan and the permit. Savino argued before this court that although the trial court sustained the plaintiffs appeal, the permit should have been approved because the commission\u2019s failure to give notice in a timely manner resulted in its failure to act within the limits of \u00a7 8-7d.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">A claim similar to the one raised by Savino was recently decided in <em>Center Shops of East Granby, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>253 Conn. 183, 749 A.2d 1185 (2000).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Center Shops of East Granby, Inc., </em>our Supreme Court answered \u201cno\u201d to the question of \u201cwhether a site plan is inseparably entwined with an application for a special permit to which it is related, thereby ensuring that . . . \u00a7\u00a78-3 and 8-7d, which provide for automatic approval of site plan applications, would apply equally to the submission of a site plan and to its related special permit.\u201d Id., 184. In <em>Center Shops of East Granby, Inc., </em>the commission failed more than once to provide proper notice of a public hearing to consider the applicants\u2019 requests for a special exception permit and approval of site plans. After the applicants failed to agree to further extensions of time, the commission denied the application for a special permit and approval of an accompanying site plan and denied a separate application for approval of a revised site plan. The applicants filed a writ of mandamus seeking approval of their applications because the commission failed to give proper notice of the public hearing and because the commission failed to render a decision on the site plans in a timely fashion. The applicants alleged that the purported hearings on the applications were nullities and that the statutory violations resulted in automatic approval of both applications. After distinguishing several cases, notably, <em>SSM Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 331, 559 A.2d 196 (1989), our Supreme Court concluded that \u201cwhen a site plan is separable from its accompanying documents and the special permit application is for a use not permitted as of right, the provisions of \u00a7 8-3 (g) are not applicable and the time constraints specified in \u00a7 8-7d do not control.\u201d <em>Center Shops of East Granby, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The court in <em>Center Shops of East Granby, Inc., </em>noted that, generally, applications for site plans are separate from applications for special permits. In the absence of facts showing that the special permit application is for a permitted use for which no hearing is required and that the special permit application is integral to and virtually indistinguishable from the site plan application, \u201cand unless otherwise set forth in the relevant town regulations, the special permit and the site plan are not inseparable and, therefore, do not meld into a single entity warranting [application of the statutory provisions regarding automatic approval].\u201d Id., 191. \u201cA specially permitted use enjoys a unique status in a town\u2019s planning and zoning scheme because it generally is not restricted to a particular zoning district. The basic rationale for the special permit [is] . . . that while certain [specially permitted] land uses may be generally compatible with the uses permitted as of right in particular zoning districts, their nature is such that their precise location and mode of operation must be regulated because of the topography, traffic problems, neighboring uses, etc., of the site. Common specially permitted uses, for example, are hospitals, churches and schools in residential zones. These uses are not as intrusive as commercial uses would be, yet they do generate parking and traffic problems that, if not properly planned for, might undermine the residential character of the neighborhood. If authorized only upon the granting of a special permit which may be issued after the [zoning] board is satisfied that parking and traffic problems have been satisfactorily worked out, land usage in the community can be more flexibly arranged than if schools, churches and similar uses had to be allowed anywhere within a particular zoning district, or not at all.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 191-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u201cWhere, as here, the special permit application necessarily must contain a site plan, that fact, by itself, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>not trigger automatic approval of either the special permit or its accompanying site plan, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 8-3 (g) and 8-7d, when the commission does not meet the time limits set forth in \u00a7 8-3c (b).\u201d Id., 194. Accordingly we affirm the court\u2019s conclusion that automatic approval was not an appropriate remedy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Savino\u2019s third claim is that the court improperly voided his permit rather than remanding his amended application to the commission for proper notice and a rehearing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The commission improperly published notice of Sav-ino\u2019s amended application for the June 11, 1996 public hearing. The applicant should not have been penalized for the commission\u2019s failure to give proper notice of the public hearing on the matter. See <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>223 Conn. 171, 178-79, 610 A.2d 1301 (1992). The matter should be remanded to the commission so that it may give proper notice and conduct a public hearing to consider Savino\u2019s amended application.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to remand the matter to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-10\"> The court determined that the plaintiff Jean-Claude Doucet was not aggrieved and dismissed the appeal as to him. In this opinion, we refer to the plaintiff Holly Lauver as the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\"> The parties have referred to this inaccuracy as a clerical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cSuch zoning commission shall provide for the manner in which regulations under section 8-2 and the boundaries of zoning districts shall be respectively established or changed.

He attempts to <em>associate </em>the amended application <em>with </em>the original application <em>to claim that notice was proper </em>because notice of the original application for the May 9, 1996 public hearing <em>would have been proper, </em>had that application been on the agenda.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe zoning regulations may require that a site plan be filed with the commission or other municipal agency or official to aid in determining the conformity of a proposed building, use or structure with specific provisions of such regulations.
