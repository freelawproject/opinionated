En route, the defendant drove the emergency vehicle with its emergency lights on and its siren in use. The dispositive issue is whether, without a finding that the defendant was driving at an unsafe speed or recklessly, he can be held criminally liable pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-232<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 14-235<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for swerving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>briefly into the lane of oncoming traffic across the double yellow line on the road. Contrary to the conclusion of the trial court, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case, General Statutes \u00a7 14-283 (b) (4)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> shields <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the defendant from criminal liability. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Before the trial, the state withdrew a count charging the defendant with reckless driving in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the trial, the court acquitted him of two other charges: (1) traveling unreasonably fast in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-218a<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (2) illegal operation of an emergency vehicle in violation of \u00a7 14-283 (b). See footnote 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">After a court trial, the defendant was convicted of having committed two infractions: (1) improper passing in violation of \u00a7 14-232 and (2) improper driving on the left side of the highway on a curve in violation of \u00a7 14-235. The court declined the defendant\u2019s request to articulate its reason for enforcing \u00a7\u00a7 14-232 and 14-235 despite the provisions of \u00a7 14-283 (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The relevant facts are largely undisputed. The court\u2019s oral decision<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the record establish that, on July 9, 1998, in Shelton, the defendant operated his emergency vehicle with its siren and lights on. On his way to the fire emergency, in order to pass a motorcycle, he crossed the double yellow center line while he was entering a curve on the road at a place where his line of sight was partially obscured. In so doing, he forced Sara Cayer, a driver in the oncoming lane, to pull off to the side of the road, to her distress, but without physical injury to her, her passenger or her vehicle. Although Cayer had heard the defendant\u2019s siren earlier, she had decided at that time not to pull her vehicle over but to be on the alert. When, upon seeing the defendant\u2019s vehicle, she did pull over, the defendant\u2019s vehicle was some 350 to 400 feet away.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">On the basis of these facts, the court concluded that the defendant was guilty of violating \u00a7\u00a7 14-232 and 14-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>235 because he had operated his vehicle without due regard for the safety of others. Even in the absence of actual injury to person or property, the court found that the defendant could not safely assume that his siren would give a sufficiently timely warning to other traffic to avoid any possible hazard. The court assigned no significance to Cayer\u2019s testimony that the siren was in fact audible at an earlier time and that she chose not to pull her vehicle over at that time, despite the terms of General Statutes \u00a7 14-283 (e). See footnote 3. Furthermore, the court expressly declined to rule on the defendant\u2019s assertion that the operator of an emergency vehicle may disregard statutes such as \u00a7\u00a7 14-232 and 14-235, which govern the direction of movement. General Statutes \u00a7 14-283 (b) (4); see footnote 3. Viewing the evidence as a whole, the court found that the defendant was driving unsafely because he had created a risk of injury to persons or property. The court ordered the defendant to pay fines totalling $150.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">On appeal, the defendant\u2019s principal claim is that his conviction must be set aside because \u00a7 14-283 (b) (4) provides him immunity from criminal liability for violating \u00a7\u00a7 14-232 and 14-235.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The parties agree that the manner in which the defendant drove his emergency vehicle implicated the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 14-232 and 14-235. Neither side disputes that these statutes govern \u201cdirection of movement or turning in specific directions\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 14-283 (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The state, however, disputes the defendant\u2019s claim that the immunity conferred by \u00a7 14-283 (b) (4) governs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>here. It claims that \u00a7 14-283 (b) (4) is to be read together with General Statutes \u00a7 14-283 (d), so as to require the conclusion that safety concerns override the immunity conferred by the prior clause. Specifically, although \u00a7 14-283 (b) (4) permits the operator of an emergency vehicle, with lights flashing and siren on, to \u201cdisregard statutes, ordinances or regulations governing direction of movement or turning in specific directions,\u201d \u00a7 14-283 (d) requires such an operator \u201cto drive with due regard for the safety of all persons and property.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is also noteworthy that General Statutes \u00a7 14-283 (b) (3) allows the operator to \u201cexceed . . . speed limits ... as long as he does not endanger life or property by so doing . . . .\u201d Finally, none of the immunity provisions contained in \u00a7 14-283 confers express authority on such an operator to drive in violation of statutes to which \u00a7 14-283 (b) does not address itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Section 14-283 is not a model of the draftsman\u2019s art. It is axiomatic that, in adjudicating a question of statutory construction, we seek to ascertain the intent of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>254 Conn. 107, 121, 756 A.2d 1250 (2000). In pursuit of this inquiry, we read a statute in its entirety and, in so doing, presumptively give greater weight to specific provisions governing the subject matter than to general language of the same statute that might otherwise be controlling. <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 641, 652, 631 A.2d 252 (1993); <em>Hollenbeck </em>v. <em>St. Mark the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number><em>Evangelist Corp., </em>29 Conn. App. 618, 624, 616 A.2d 1170 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Applying these maxims of statutory construction to \u00a7 14-283, we conclude that we must focus our attention on subsection (b), which includes specific provisions granting immunity to operators of emergency vehicles under some circumstances. If subsection (b) were subject to override by subsection (d), the inclusion of safety conditions in the immunity granted by subsection (b) (3) would be superfluous. See footnote 3. We construe statutes, however, so as to give effect to all of their provisions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>237 Conn. 613, 621, 678 A.2d 473 (1996); <em>Skakel </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>54 Conn. App. 663, 673, 738 A.2d 170 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Within subsection (b) of \u00a7 14-283, only some, but not all, clauses expressly require the operator of an emergency vehicle to take account of safety concerns. See footnote 3. Section 14-283 (b) (3) requires such an officer, if he speeds, not to \u201cendanger life or property.\u201d Subsection (b) (4) of \u00a7 14-283 contains no such language. It is logical to conclude that this omission was intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The state argues that this logical construction of subsection (b) must be rejected because it would allow the operator of an emergency vehicle to claim immunity even if he were driving recklessly. That is not so. Driving recklessly is governed not by \u00a7 14-283 (b), but by \u00a7 14-222. As noted previously, the state ultimately chose not to charge the defendant with having violated that statute. Further, as the defendant aptly observes, \u00a7 14-283 (b) also does not immunize the operator of an emergency vehicle from criminal liability for violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-215 (operating a motor vehicle while license under suspension), 14-222a (negligent homicide with a motor vehicle), 14-227a (operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>drags) or 14-228 (leaving motor vehicle without setting brake).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">We are not persuaded to engraft onto \u00a7 14-283 (b) (4) language that it does not contain. The legislature manifestly had safety concerns in mind when enacting \u00a7 14-283. We have no reason to assume that its failure expressly to include such concerns in \u00a7 14-283 (b) (4) was inadvertent. We are especially reluctant to rewrite statutory language in a case in which the evidentiary basis for the defendant\u2019s conviction fails to establish any actual injury to person or property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-232 provides in relevant part: \u201cExcept as provided in sections 14-233 and 14-234, (1) the driver of a vehicle overtaking another vehicle proceeding in the same direction shall pass to the left thereof at a safe distance and shall not again drive to the right side of the highway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle .... No vehicle shall be driven to the left side of the center of the highway in overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction unless the left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient distance ahead to permit such overtaking and passing to be completely made without interfering with the safe operation of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction or any vehicle overtaken.

Under such circumstances, in criminal as well as in civil cases, this court may decline to undertake substantive review. <em>Mikolinski </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>55 Conn. App. 691, 698, 740 A.2d 885 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 922, 747 A.2d 518 (2000). This court, however, has the discretion to consider an appeal on its merits despite this procedural irregularity if the transcript contains a \u201csufficiently detailed and concise statement of the trial court\u2019s findings.\u201d Id.; see <em>aliso Emerald Ridge Property Owners Assn. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>54 Conn. App. 6, 8, 732 A.2d 804 (1999); see generally C. Tait <em>&amp; </em>E. Prescott, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (3d Ed. 2000) \u00a7 5.4, p. 203-204.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In this case, we exercise our discretion to proceed without a signed transcript of the opinion of the trial court. This case does not turn on a significant disagreement about the lads. The dispositive issue is one of statutory construction. It is undisputed that the trial court, although asked to articulate its ruling on this issue, declined to do so. To allow the defendant\u2019s conviction to stand not only would require him to pay fines and applicable court costs, but also would leave him with unwarranted collateral consequences, such as the obligal ion to disclose his criminal record in applications for employment or licenses. We note, finally, that although the state\u2019s brief, in a footnote, called our attention to the defendant\u2019s failure to provide the required signed transcript, the state has not argued that his appeal should be denied on that ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"> The defendant derives these numbers from testimony and exhibits at trial.
