On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) denied his application because the award was untimely issued and (2) failed to rule on his alternative grounds for vacating the award. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. The plaintiff formerly was employed by the defendant as a prosecutor and was a member of the prosecutor\u2019s bargaining unit, Connecticut Prosecutors, Local 1437, Council 4, AFS-CME (union). The union and the defendant were parties to a collective bargaining agreement (agreement) covering the period from July 1, 1994, to June 30, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">On May 9,1995, the defendant terminated the plaintiff from employment as a result of his \u201cconduct, including alleged stalking and harassing of . . . two women.\u201d In accordance with the agreement, the union filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>grievance on behalf of the plaintiff regarding his discharge from employment with the defendant. In accordance with the agreement, the union and the defendant submitted the grievance to arbitration with an unrestricted submission as follows: \u201cDid the [defendant] have just cause to discharge [the plaintiff]? If not, what shall be the remedy, consistent with the contract and the parties\u2019 agreement concerning the tolling of liability in this matter?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Subsequently, hearings were held before arbitrator Louis Pittocco (arbitrator).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the first arbitration hearing on October 30, 1996, the plaintiff signed a waiver of union representation and proceeded pro se. At the November 5, 1996 hearing, an issue arose with respect to the admissibility of evidence. The parties agreed to present briefs to the arbitrator regarding that issue postmarked December 10, 1996, which deadline subsequently was extended to January 3, 1997. After briefs were presented, the arbitrator issued a ruling allowing the admission of the disputed evidence on January 14, 1997.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>At the last hearing on May 1, 1997, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>agreed to submit posthearing briefs to the arbitrator postmarked May 30, 1997, which date was later extended by mutual agreement to June 6, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">In a letter dated July 2,1997, the arbitrator gave notice that he was unable to complete the arbitration award by July 6, 1997, and indicated that he would be postmarking the award by July 11, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">At the evidentiary hearing held later before the court, the arbitrator testified that he did not receive any objections from the parties with respect to his July 2, 1997 letter. The arbitrator also testified that in light of his experience, he assumed that in the absence of an objection, his request for the extension had been granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">On July 7, 1997, attorney Anne H. Littlefield, counsel for the defendant, contacted the plaintiff concerning the July 2, 1997 letter. The plaintiff was noncommittal and stated that he needed more time to do \u201cresearch\u201d before he responded to Littlefield\u2019s suggestion of a joint agreement for an extension of time. The plaintiff testified that when he called Littlefield\u2019s office later in the day, he left a message with a secretary that he was unable to enter into a joint agreement. Littlefield testified that the only message she received was that the plaintiff would respond separately to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">In a letter dated July 7, 1997, attorney Saranne P. Murray, also counsel for the defendant, responded to the arbitrator\u2019s July 7, 1997 letter. In her letter, Murray informed the arbitrator that the defendant consented to an extension of the deadline for filing the award until July 11, 1997. Moreover, Murray advised the arbitrator that the union\u2019s agent, Joel Schweidel, had indicated in a telephone conversation that although he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>sure if the union had standing due to the plaintiffs pro se status, the union had no objection to the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Subsequent to receiving Murray\u2019s July 7, 1997 letter, the plaintiff did not call or write the arbitrator. Instead, the plaintiff spoke to Schweidel and specifically instructed him to write a letter to the arbitrator. Although Schweidel wrote a letter dated July 11, 1997, that letter failed to state the plaintiffs alleged position that he already considered the award to be void. Instead, the letter merely informed the arbitrator that \u201cthe union cannot take a position on the extension of the deadline for filing your decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">On July 10, 1997, the arbitrator issued his award with a cover letter dated July 11, 1997. The arbitrator found that the defendant had just cause to discharge the plaintiff and therefore denied the grievance. The arbitrator\u2019s decision stated in relevant part: \u201cWith regard to the allegations of illegal and unethical conduct through harassment and stalking . . . the arbitrator finds that these actions on [the plaintiffs] part were deplorable and unacceptable for a prosecutor. . . . [T]here was sufficient proof to sustain his discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">On August 5, 1997, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff filed an application to vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>award. The plaintiff also filed a motion to present additional evidence seeking to introduce numerous facts and exhibits regarding his application to vacate the award. The evidence that the plaintiff sought to admit included material concerning the arbitrator\u2019s admission of evidence at the arbitration hearing that had been suppressed in connection with the plaintiffs criminal prosecution, as well as the arbitrator\u2019s decision to exclude other evidence proffered by the plaintiff. The court, <em>Devlin, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs motion in part and denied it in part, stating that \u201c[t]he parties shall be permitted to offer evidence on the question of whether the arbitrator\u2019s decision was untimely issued. The motion is otherwise denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">On October 20, 1998, an evidentiary hearing limited to the issue of timeliness was held. On February 19, 1999, the court, <em>Hon. Mary R. Hennessey, </em>judge trial referee, issued its decision denying the plaintiffs application to vacate the award. The court found that the union remained a party to the arbitration process and, therefore, \u201cunder the agreement it had the authority to grant the extension of time requested by the arbitrator.\u201d The court found that because the defendant and the union had agreed to the extension of time, the award was timely. The court further found that even if the award was untimely, the plaintiff had waived any objection to its untimeliness through his actions. The plaintiff thereafter filed this appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the court improperly determined that the arbitration award was timely issued. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">\u201c[ W]here the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In deciding the plaintiffs application to vacate the arbitration award, the court made the following additional findings of fact. The court found that although the plaintiff declared his intention to proceed pro se in the arbitration, the union remained a party in the matter before the arbitrator. The court recognized that the agreement at issue here was between the \u201cState of Connecticut, acting by and through the Connecticut Division of Criminal Justice . . . and Connecticut Prosecutors, Local 1437, AFSCME Council <em>4 ... .\u201d </em>Although the plaintiff waived union representation so he could argue pro se, this action did not remove the union from being a party to the arbitration. In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded, therefore, that \u201cunder the agreement [the union] had the authority to grant the extension of time requested by the arbitrator. The arbitrator cannot be put in the position of having to determine whether under the agreement the union can or cannot give consent to the request for an extension of time when the [plaintiff] elects to represent himself in the proceedings. The arbitrator has the right to rely on the language of the agreement, which specifies \u2018parties\u2019 as being the ones who must jointly agree to an extension of time. In this case, there was joint agreement between the [defendant] and the union for the extension of time until July 11, 1997. The award issued on July 11, 1997, <em>[was] within the extension of time agreed to and was therefore timely.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>On the whole record, the conclusions challenged here are legally and logically correct, and the facts set out in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision find ample support in the evidence. We therefore cannot conclude that the court\u2019s factual findings or conclusions are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Although the facts set out in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision find ample support in the evidence, we must still analyze whether the arbitration award violated \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). In addition to the limitations on this court\u2019s review of the trial court\u2019s factual findings, our \u201c[j judicial review of arbitral decisions is narrowly confined. When the parties agree to arbitration and establish the authority of the arbitrator through the terms of their submission, the extent of our judicial review of the award is delineated by the scope of the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 185, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). When the scope of the submission is unrestricted, the resulting award is not subject to de novo review even for errors of law so long as the award conforms to the submission. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>211 Conn. 7, 14, 557 A.2d 1236 (1989); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>208 Conn. 411, 415-16, 544 A.2d 186 (1988). Because we favor arbitration as a means of settling private disputes, we undertake judicial review of arbitration awards in a manner designed to minimize interference with an efficient and economical system of alternative dispute resolution. <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Police Local, No. </em>1361, 187 Conn. 228, 230, 445 A.2d 322 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Connecticut Employees Union Independent, </em>184 Conn. 578, 579, 440 A.2d 229 (1981). <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 4-5, 612 A.2d 742 (1992). Where the submission does not otherwise state, the arbitrators are empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>the construction placed upon the facts or the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous. Courts will not review the evidence nor, where the submission is unrestricted, will they review the arbitrators\u2019 decision of the legal questions involved. <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>191 Conn. 336, 340-41, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">\u201cOne of the principal reasons for this deference is that the scope of our review is expressly limited by \u00a7 52-418; <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 184, </em>237 Conn. 114, 118, 676 A.2d 825 (1996); and, sometimes, by the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 5 ([t]he authority of an arbitrator to adjudicate the controversy is limited only if the agreement contains express language restricting the breadth of issues, reserving explicit rights, or conditioning the award on court review). We have stated on numerous occasions that arbitration is a creature of contract [whereby the parties themselves, by agreement, define the powers of the arbitrators]. See, e.g., <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 185; <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>203 Conn. 133, 145, 523 A.2d 1271 (1987); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local </em>287, 195 Conn. 266, 269, 487 A.2d 553 (1985). Therefore, it is the arbitrator\u2019s judgment that was bargained for and contracted for by the parties, and we do not substitute our own judgment merely because our interpretation of the agreement or contract at issue might differ from that of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">\u201cThese well established principles governing consensual arbitration are subject to certain exceptions. Even in the case of an unrestricted submission, we have, however, recognized three grounds for vacating an award: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute; <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>[supra, 191 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>344]; (2) the award violates clear public policy; <em>Watertown Police Union Local 541 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>210 Conn. 333, 339, 555 A.2d 406 (1989); or (3) the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>[189 Conn. 16, 22-23, 453 A.2d 1158 (1983)]. <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 6.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, AFL-CIO, Local 998, </em>248 Conn. 108, 114-16, 728 A.2d 1063 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">\u201c[A]n award that manifests an egregious or patently irrational application of the law is an award that should be set aside pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) because the arbitrator has exceeded [his] powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made. We emphasize, however, that the manifest disregard of the law ground for vacating an arbitration award is narrow and should be reserved for circumstances of an arbitrator\u2019s extraordinary lack of fidelity to established legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">\u201cSo delimited, the principle of vacating an award because of a manifest disregard of the law is an important safeguard of the integrity of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms. Judicial approval of arbitration decisions that so egregiously depart from established law that they border on the irrational would undermine society\u2019s confidence in the legitimacy of the arbitration process. . . . Furthermore, although the discretion conferred on the arbitrator by the contracting parties is exceedingly broad, modem contract principles of good faith and fair dealing recognize that even contractual discretion must be exercised for purposes reasonably within the contemplation of the contracting parties. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">\u201cIn <em>Garrity, </em>we adopted the test enunciated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>in interpreting the federal equivalent of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). . . . The test consists of the following three elements, all of which must be satisfied in order for a court to vacate an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitration panel manifestly disregarded the law: (1) the error was obvious and capable of being readily and instantly perceived by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator; (2) the arbitration panel appreciated the existence of a clearly governing legal principle but decided to ignore it; and (3) the governing law alleged to have been ignored by the arbitration panel is well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Saturn Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Premier Roofing Co., </em>238 Conn. 293, 304-305, 680 A.2d 1274 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">The crux of the plaintiffs claim is that the arbitrator exceeded his authority within the meaning of \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) because the award was issued in an untimely manner under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Moreover, the plaintiff contends that he expressly waived union representation and, therefore, the union was not a party to the arbitration. Thus, the plaintiff argues that the union had no right to grant permission to extend the time limit for the issuance of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Because we have already determined that the award was timely since the proper parties consented to the time extension, the plaintiff has no further basis to challenge the award due to the unrestricted nature of the agreement. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 52-418 was not violated by the arbitrator\u2019s decision. The terms of the award are clear, and the award conforms to the issues submitted. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court in denying the application to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly failed to rule on his alternative grounds for vacating the arbitration award.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">After the court denied the plaintiffs application to vacate the award, the plaintiff filed a motion for articulation concerning that decision. Although the court previously had ruled that the case would proceed only with regard to the issue of timeliness, the plaintiff asked the court to \u201carticulate its consideration and decision thereof\u2019 with respect to the grounds he had proffered for vacating the award other than timeliness. The court denied that request, ruling that \u201cthe only issue before this court was the issue of timeliness, which this court addressed fully in its decision.\u201d The plaintiff failed to perfect the record by filing a motion for review with this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Our rules provide a procedure for clarifying the record when rulings of the trial court are unclear. Practice Book \u00a7 66-7; <em>Buchetto </em>v. <em>Haggquist, </em>17 Conn. App. 544, 548, 554 A.2d 763, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 808, 559 A.2d 1141 (1989). Our rules provide a procedure for reviewing the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s response to a motion for articulation. Practice Book \u00a7 66-7. \u201cWhen a party is dissatisfied with the trial court\u2019s response to a motion for articulation, he [or she] may, and indeed under appropriate circumstances he [or she] must, seek immediate appeal ... to this court via a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>One 1993 Black Kenworth Truck, </em>41 Conn. App. 779, 789, 679 A.2d 13 (1996), quoting <em>Buchetto </em>v. <em>Haggquist, </em>supra, 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">\u201cEven if we assume the validity of this claim, proper utilization of the motion for articulation [and the motion for review] serves to dispel any such ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>190 Conn. 491, 494, 460 A.2d 1302 (1983). The burden of securing an adequate record for appellate review of an issue presented on a cross appeal rests with the cross appellant. <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Niles, </em>9 Conn. App. 240, 249, 518 A.2d 932 (1986). <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Schieffer, </em>35 Conn. App. 31, 45, 645 A.2d 549 (1994). Because it is the [cross] appellant\u2019s responsibility to provide this court with an adequate record for review . . . we will not remand a case to correct a deficiency the [cross] appellant should have remedied. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>One 1993 Black Kenworth Truck, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 789; <em>Buchetto </em>v. <em>Haggquist, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 549; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 494.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wellington Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Redding Group, Inc., </em>49 Conn. App. 152, 180, 714 A.2d 21, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 905, 720 A.2d 516 (1998).
