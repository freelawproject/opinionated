J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atx\">The defendant, Michael Person, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>(a) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court (1) improperly instructed the jury on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, thereby creating the reasonable possibility that the jury was misled, and (2) abused its discretion by failing to order an examination of him pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 17a-566.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The relevant facts pertaining to the defendant\u2019s arrest were set out by our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Person, </em>236 Conn. 342, 673 A.2d 463 (1996).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe defendant and [the victim, Leshea Pouncey] had been romantically involved and had planned to marry. Pouncey, however, terminated their engagement, after which she commenced a relationship with Donald Moody. The defendant testified that on May 19, 1991, he had forcefully entered Pouncey\u2019s apartment while she was away in order to recover his personal belongings. While the defendant was in the rear bedroom gathering his possessions, Pouncey returned home with her child. The defendant further testified that after speaking on the telephone, Pouncey had confronted him in the bedroom with a can of Mace in one hand and two knives in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>the other. According to the defendant, Pouncey had instigated a struggle by spraying Mace in his eyes. In the course of the struggle, the defendant stabbed Pouncey. The defendant then fled the apartment and later surrendered himself at the New Haven police station.\u201d Id., 346. The defendant confessed to killing the victim. At trial, the defendant asserted the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54a.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance because it failed to explain that when considering the defendant\u2019s \u201csituation,\u201d the jury should take into account testimony regarding his mental illness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">As a preliminary matter, we address the state\u2019s assertion that we should decline to review this claim because it was not properly preserved for appeal. \u201cTo preserve a challenge to the jury charge, the defendant must make a written request to charge, or take exception to the jury instructions when they are given by the trial court. . . . This court is not bound to review claims of instructional error if the party raising the claim neither submitted a written request to charge, nor excepted to the charge given by the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 852 [now \u00a7 42-16]. The purpose of [Practice Book \u00a7 42-16] is to alert the court to any claims of error while there is still an opportunity for correction in order to avoid the economic waste and increased court congestion caused by unnecessary retrials.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Faria, </em>254 Conn. 613, 632, 758 A.2d 348 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Although the defendant submitted proposed jury instructions, his proposal did not contain a request to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>elucidate the word \u201csituation. \u201d The defendant requested that the court emphasize the testimony regarding his mental state to underscore the subjective element of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a result, the defendant\u2019s exception did not specifically refer to an explanation of the term \u201csituation.\u201d Nevertheless, the court has \u201can obligation to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>justice and to be vigilant and vigorous in protecting individuals.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sirimanochanh, </em>224 Conn. 656, 665, 620 A.2d 761 (1993). Indeed, although this court is not bound to do so, it will review the defendant\u2019s claim despite his technical noncompliance with the rules of practice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>59 Conn. App. 771, 781, 758 A.2d 400 (2000). The requirement that a party distinctly state the matter to which it objects serves the purpose of alerting the court to any claims of error while there is still an opportunity for correction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Deptula, </em>31 Conn. App. 140, 146, 623 A.2d 525 (1993), appeal dismissed, 228 Conn. 852, 635 A.2d 812 (1994). The defendant\u2019s \u201csituation\u201d and mental state raise an issue that falls within the subjective-objective portion of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. Thus, although the defendant\u2019s exception<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> could have been more specific, it put the court on sufficient notice that the instructions might contain deficiencies and thereby satisfies the purpose of Practice Book \u00a7 42-16. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant properly preserved the present claim for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s standard of review regarding claims of improper jury instruction is well established. \u201c[A] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Faria, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 634. \u201cAs long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury ... we will not view the instructions as improper.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">Here, the defendant claims that the charge, viewed as a whole, may have misled the jury in analyzing the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>The court provided the jury with comprehensive instructions regarding the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The defendant submitted preliminary and final requests to charge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the proposed charges, the defendant requested that the court instruct the jury that it should consider the defendant\u2019s mental illness as part of the reasonable explanation or excuse for his extreme emotional disturbance. That is not required under <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 588 A.2d 127 (1991), or <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 622 A.2d 519 (1993). In those cases, in which the defendants presented evidence of mental illness, our Supreme Court held that jury instructions, precisely like the ones here, properly explained the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">We conclude, therefore, that despite the court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s proposed charges, the instructions that the court gave accurately explained the law, and it was not reasonably possible that the charge, when considered as a whole, misled the jury. Although the word \u201csituation\u201d may not usually mean mental illness, \u201c[j]ury instructions must be read as a whole and . . . are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . [A]n error in the [charge] requires reversal only if, in the context of the whole instruction, there is a reasonable possibility that the juiy was misled in reaching its verdict.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>54 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>732, 740, 738 A.2d 674, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 913, 739 A.2d 1250 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Indeed, although the defense raises a novel argument, we respectfully disagree with the assertion that the term \u201csituation,\u201d without further elucidation, mighthave misled the jury into thinking that it could not consider the evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental state. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 4-5, 411 A.2d 3 (1979), the seminal case on the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, our Supreme Court found the language of our murder statute to be identical to that of New York Penal Law \u00a7 125.25 (1) (a). We agree with the following language in <em>People </em>v. <em>Casassa, </em>49 N.Y.2d 668, 680, 404 N.E.2d 1310, 427 N.Y.S.2d 769, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 842, 101 S. Ct. 122, 66 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1980): \u201c[W]e believe that what the Legislature intended in enacting the statute was to allow the finder of fact the discretionary power to mitigate the penalty when presented with a situation which, under the circumstances, appears to them to have caused an understandable weakness in one of their fellows. Perhaps the chief virtue of the statute is that it allows such discretion without engaging in a detailed explanation of individual circumstances in which the statute would apply, thus avoiding the \u2018mystifying cloud of words\u2019 which Mr. Justice Cardozo abhorred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\u201cSituation,\u201d as it is used in this case, is not a term of limitation, but a term that allows all of the facts brought forth to be considered. Because the court properly instructed the jury as to the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance and the jury concluded that the defendant was guilty of murder, we find no basis for reversal of the judgment on the ground that the court did not give a jury instruction that explained the word \u201csituation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that there was no reasonable possibility that the jury misunderstood the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>instructions regarding the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance and, therefore, those instructions could not have misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly failed to order an examination of him pursuant to \u00a7 17a-566. It is well settled that \u201c[t]his court will not review issues of law that are raised for the first time on appeal. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>33 Conn. App. 184, 190, 634 A.2d 1193 (1993), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 232 Conn. 707, 657 A.2d 585 (1995). This court has repeatedly held that it \u201cwill not consider claimed errors on the part of the trial court unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised at trial and was ruled upon and decided by the court adversely to the appellant\u2019s claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 52, 57, 597 A.2d 839, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 902, 600 A.2d 1029 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>46 Conn. App. 661, 682-84, 701 A.2d 663, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 940, 702 A.2d 645 (1997), this court specifically held that the defendant\u2019s failure to initiate action seeking a presentence psychiatric examination precluded review of the claim on appeal. Moreover, the defendant has not asked for review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We decline, therefore, to review this claim, as the defendant has failed to invoke a principle that entitles him to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extr eme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-107 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of criminal trespass in the first degree when ...

You will recall that one of the elements of the crime of murder is that the person intended to cause the death of another. Extreme emotional disturbance does not negate, does not wipe out, that intent. Rather, it serves to explain the circumstances leading to the formation of that intent. Its purpose is to permit the defendant to show that his actions were caused by a mental infirmity not rising to the level of insanity, and that he is less culpable, less blameworthy because his intentional acts were caused by extreme emotional disturbance. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-10\">\u201cThird, that he had an extreme emotional reaction to that stress as a result of which there was a loss of self-control, and his reason was overborne by intense feelings, such as passion, anger, distress, grief, excessive agitation or similar emotions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-11\">\u201cYou should give consideration to whether the intensity of these feelings was such that the defendant\u2019s usual intellectual controls failed and that his normal rational thinking no longer prevailed at the time of the act.
