We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The following facts before the trial court were undisputed. The defendants Scott Clark, Amy Kertesz and Michael Gates, all police officers of the town and members of the defendant Ridgefield Police Union, requested the performance evaluations of nonunion town employees. In response to the request for the evaluations, the town notified the individual employees, sixteen of whom filed timely objections to the disclosure of the evaluations. The town then refused to provide the records,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and those requesting the records filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>an appeal with the commission. The commission, after hearing the matter, ordered the town to provide the defendants with a copy of the personnel evaluations of the nonunion employees as requested. The plaintiffs appealed from the ruling of the commission to the trial court, which dismissed the appeal finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the disclosure of the contents of the appraisals would be \u201chighly offensive to a reasonable person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The plaintiffs have appealed from the court\u2019s judgment upholding the disclosure, claiming that the court improperly concluded that the disclosure of the requested personnel evaluation records would not constitute an invasion of privacy within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The Freedom of Information Act \u201cmakes disclosure of public records the statutory norm.\u201d <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 430, 518 A.2d 49 (1986). Section 1-210 (b) (2) provides an exception that prohibits the disclosure of \u201cpersonnel or medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of personal privacy.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2). \u201cThe standard that determines whether a claim of exemption qualifies as \u2018an invasion of privacy\u2019 under \u00a7 1-19 (b) (2) [the predecessor to \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2)] is the test set forth in <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>[228 Conn. 158, 635 A.2d 783 (1993)].\u201d <em>Dept. of Public Safety </em>v. <em>Freedom </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>of Information Commission, </em>242 Conn. 79, 84, 698 A.2d 803 (1997). The invasion of personal privacy exception of \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2) \u201cprecludes disclosure . . . only when the information sought by a request does not pertain to legitimate matters of public concern and is highly offensive to a reasonable person.\u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The court found that the plaintiffs demonstrated that the evaluations were conducted in confidential circumstances that made them \u201cnot legitimate subjects of public interest.\u201d As to the remaining criteria for the exemption, that is, whether the disclosure would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to show that the disclosure of the information within the evaluations would be highly offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The plaintiffs claim on appeal that despite the fact that the evaluations contain nothing of a \u201cscandalous, embarrassing or humiliating nature,\u201d they contain the customary give and take common to such evaluations given in confidence, and a breach of that confidence is highly objectionable to them. To support their position, the plaintiffs cite <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 585 A.2d 96 (1991), in which our Supreme Court determined that the disclosure of internal personnel evaluations of a state\u2019s attorney would constitute an invasion of privacy. In <em>Chairman, </em>the court based its decision in part on the fact that the disclosure of the evaluations \u201cwould carry significant potential for embarrassment\u201d; id., 199-200; as the evaluations described \u201csuch personal matters as the plaintiffs \u2018aptitude, attitude, basic competence . . . trustworthiness, ethics, [and] interpersonal relationships ....\u2019\u201d Id., 199.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>In the present case, the plaintiffs have not put forth any evidence to establish that the disclosure of the evaluations would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. See <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 175. Indeed, the plaintiffs concede that nothing in the evaluations is embarrassing or humiliating. The plaintiffs have not met their burden under the statute and, therefore, they may not prevent disclosure of the requested evaluations by virtue of the exemption contained in \u00a7 1-210 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> In addition to 1he named plaintiff, 1he first selectman of the town of Ridgefield, sixteen employees of the town were granted intervenor status by the defendant freedom of information commission.

Nothing herein shall require an agency to withhold from disclosure the contents of personnel or medical files and similar files <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>when it does not reasonably believe that such disclosure would legally constitute an invasion of personal privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">\u201c(c) A public agency which has provided notice under subsection (b) of this section shall disclose the records requested unless it receives a written</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">objection from the employee concerned or the employee\u2019s collective bargaining representative . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b92-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-210 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cNothing in the Freedom of Information Act shall be construed to require disclosure of . . .
