The defendant resided with the victims, D and J, and their mother for approximately eight years prior to his arrest, during which time the defendant often looked after D and J while their mother was at work. D was bom in September, 1980, and J was bom in February, 1978. The defendant was bom in April, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">For a period of almost six years, from October, 1990, to March, 1996, the defendant sexually assaulted D and J on numerous occasions. Both victims feared the defendant and what he might do to them if they told anyone about the abuse. On one occasion, the defendant threatened D by holding a knife to her neck and telling her that he would kill her if she told anyone about the abuse. At the time of this incident, D was twelve years old. The defendant also threatened J by using a weapon if she refused to have sex with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">When D was fourteen years old, she told her mother that she was being sexually abused by the defendant. Although the victims\u2019 mother confronted the defendant with the allegations, which he denied, the victims\u2019 mother did not report or otherwise pursue the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>tions. The defendant continued to sexually abuse D and J.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In March, 1996, D told a school friend about an incident in which the defendant performed oral sex on her. Upon the urging of her friend, D reported the incident to a school counselor. D told the counselor that both she and her sister were being sexually abused by the defendant. When the school counselor questioned J, she admitted that she too was being sexually abused by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">D and J were taken to the hospital for physical examinations. Thereafter, both D and J spoke with an investigator from the department of children and families. D and J also gave statements to police from the Waterbury police department in which they alleged that they had been sexually abused by the defendant. The defendant was charged with the sexual abuse of D and J and, after a jury trial, was convicted of ten counts of sexual assault in the first degree and four counts of risk of injury to a child. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly permitted J\u2019s fiance to sit next to her throughout her testimony. The defendant argues that the court should have held an evidentiary hearing at which the state was required to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such an arrangement was necessary. The defendant further argues that the fiance\u2019s presence impermissibly bolstered the witness\u2019 credibility. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">At trial, J was called as a witness. Upon entering the foyer of the courtroom, she broke down and cried, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d J refused to proceed into the courtroom to testify. The court thereafter excused the jury and took a recess. The state then made a motion to the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>seeking special accommodations for J\u2019s testimony. Although the court did not hold an evidentiary hearing, as the defendant requested, the court heard the parties\u2019 respective arguments on the state\u2019s motion. The court thereafter granted the state\u2019s request to allow J\u2019s fiance to sit outside the witness box and next to J during her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The defendant argues that the court was required to hold an evidentiary hearing in which the state had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that J required special accommodations. The defendant argues that the state\u2019s failure to prove such a necessity by clear and convincing evidence, coupled with the court\u2019s decision allowing J\u2019s fiance to sit next to her during her testimony, violated his constitutional right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">It is important to note that the defendant recognizes that General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is inapplicable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>present situation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant claims, however, that the statute and the case law interpreting the statute are helpful in analyzing the present matter. The defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Menzies, </em>26 Conn. App. 674, 603 A.2d 419, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 924, 608 A.2d 690 (1992), in support of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In <em>Jarzbek, </em>the defendant was charged with risk of injury to or impairing the morals of a child and sexual assault in the fourth degree. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 684. The state sought permission of the trial court to take the testimony of the minor victim by videotape outside the physical presence of the defendant. Id., 685. The court granted the state permission, and the videotaped testimony was entered into evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">On appeal, the defendant claimed that the court\u2019s order concerning the videotaped testimony violated his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him and to be present at trial. Id., 689. Our Supreme Court held that \u201ca trial court must determine, at an evidentiary hearing, whether the state has demonstrated a compelling need for excluding the defendant from the witness room during the videotaping of a minor victim\u2019s testimony. In order to satisfy its burden of proving compelling need, the state must show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>minor victim would be so intimidated, or otherwise inhibited, by the physical presence of the defendant that the trustworthiness of the victim\u2019s testimony would be seriously called into question. Furthermore, the state bears the burden of proving such compelling need by clear and convincing evidence. . . . Although the trial court may consider the well-being of the witness as a significant factor in its analysis, the state cannot prove need simply by demonstrating that the victim would suffer some harm if forced to testify in the presence of the accused. We reiterate that, in light of the constitutional right of confrontation at stake here, the primary focus of the trial court\u2019s inquiry must be on the reliability of the minor victim\u2019s testimony, not on the injury that the victim may suffer by testifying in the presence of the accused.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 704-705.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">In the present case, unlike in <em>Jarzbek, </em>the defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him, face to face, was not impaired by the special arrangements allowed by the court, nor was his right to cross-examine the witness impaired in any way. The defendant remained in the courtroom throughout the two days of J\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, we find the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Jarz-bek </em>misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Menzies </em>is slightly more compelling, but still unavailing. In <em>Menzies, </em>the state filed a motion for special procedures pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g (b); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Menzies, </em>26 Conn. App. 686; to which the defendant objected. The defendant specifically objected to the state\u2019s request that the witness\u2019 guardian ad litem be allowed to sit next to the child witness during her testimony on the ground that the guardian\u2019s presence enhanced the credibility of and heightened the sympathy for the witness. Id., 691. The trial court granted the state\u2019s request after holding an evidentiary hearing in which the court found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>state had sustained its burden by clear and convincing evidence. Id., 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Notwithstanding that the trial court held an eviden-tiary hearing, we did not conclude in <em>Menzies </em>that subsection (b) of \u00a7 54-86g requires one. We stated: \u201cAlthough the <em>Jarzbek </em>court concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 54-86g (a) requires that there be an eviden-tiary hearing prior to the court\u2019s adoption of the procedures outlined therein, no such similar requirement has yet been adopted with respect to the procedures outlined in subsection (b). Because the parties have not raised the issue of whether subsection (b) requires an evidentiary hearing, and because a full evidentiary hearing was conducted here, we need not address that question.\u201d Id., 689 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">As previously noted, \u00a7 54-86g is inapplicable to the present case. We therefore need not decide whether \u00a7 54-86g (b) also requires an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Menzies </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The defendant further argues that the presence of J\u2019s fiance impermissibly bolstered the witness\u2019 credibility. We disagree. The court\u2019s decision to allow J\u2019s fiance to sit outside the witness box and next to her during her testimony falls well within the court\u2019s broad discretion to ensure a fair trial and to administer justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">\u201cThe function of the court in a criminal trial is to conduct a fair and impartial proceeding.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jupin, </em>26 Conn. App. 331, 348, 602 A.2d 12, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 914, 603 A.2d 404 (1992). \u201cA trial judge in a criminal case may take all steps reasonably necessary lor the orderly progress of the trial. . . . When the rights of those other than the parties are implicated, [t]he trial judge has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>responsibility for safeguarding both the rights of the accused and the interests of the public in the administration of criminal justice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 349. Moreover, \u201c[t]he [ability] of a witness [to testify reliably] is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court and its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear case of abuse or of some error in law;\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Brandon W., </em>56 Conn. App. 418, 426, 747 A.2d 526 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The evidence adequately supports the court\u2019s decision to allow J\u2019s fiance to be seated next to the witness during her testimony. The court based its decision on testimony concerning J\u2019s mental capacity<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the court\u2019s own observations of J\u2019s distress and anxiety about testifying.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Implicit in the court\u2019s decision is the finding that J required the accommodation in order to provide testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Moreover, the court\u2019s cautionary instructions to the jury and to J\u2019s fiance limited the possibility that the presence of the fiance would bolster J\u2019s testimony. The court ordered J\u2019s fiance to refrain from communicating with J in any way while she testified. The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>instructed the juiy to disregard the fiance\u2019s presence and not to take any inference whatsoever from his presence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Presented with these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the presence of J\u2019s fiance bolstered J\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, the court\u2019s decision was not an abuse of its broad discretion to ensure a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly permitted J to sit back in the witness chair, out of view of the defendant, during her testimony. We conclude that the record is inadequate for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">It is incumbent upon the appellant to take the necessary steps to provide an adequate record for appellate review. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>Walton </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>223 Conn. 155, 164-65, 612 A.2d 1153 (1992). \u201cOur role is not to guess at possibilities, but to review claims based on a complete factual record developed by a trial court. . . . Without the necessary factual and legal conclusions furnished by the trial court . . . any decision made by us respecting [the defendant\u2019s claims] would be entirely speculative.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chase Manhattan Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>48 Conn. App. 605, 608-609, 710 A.2d 190 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">At trial, the defendant did not make an offer of proof as to whether he could see the witness from where he was seated. During the court\u2019s consideration of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the witness would be allowed to testify under special circumstances, defense counsel indicated that the witness needed to move forward in order for him to see her. The court asked defense counsel to move and position himself so that he could see the witness. Defense counsel did so and then remarked that the defendant should also have the right to view the witness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defense counsel did not make, however, an offer of proof concerning the defendant\u2019s inability to see the witness. Defense counsel\u2019s inability to see the witness and his subsequent acquiesce to move to see her do not translate into the defendant\u2019s inability to see the witness. Further, the witness testified over a period of two days, and, during that time, the defendant made no objection claiming that he could not see the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The defendant\u2019s failure to make an offer of proof at trial or to file a motion for rectification of the record to reflect that his view of the witness was obstructed results in a record that is inadequate for our review. Accordingly, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Lastly, the defendant claims that the court improperly admitted constancy of accusation evidence. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201cThe constancy of accusation doctrine is an exception to the hearsay rule and has existed in Connecticut since 1830.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>55 Conn. App. 630, 646, 739 A.2d 751 (1999), cert. granted on other grounds, 252 Conn. 931, 746 A.2d 794 (2000). \u201cIt is well settled that the doctrine of constancy of accusation does not violate an accused\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation ... or due process.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cansler, </em>54 Conn. App. 819, 824, 738 A.2d 1095 (1999). \u201cThe doctrine originally was premised on the arguably inaccurate premise that, if a woman had been sexually assaulted, it would be natural for her to confide in others.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Orhan, </em>52 Conn. App. 231, 238, 726 A.2d 629 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\u201cIn determining whether to permit [constancy of accusation] testimony, the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice to the defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 239. \u201c[Constancy of accusation evidence is not admissible unless the victim has testified, and is subject to cross-examination, concerning the crime and the identity of the person or persons to whom the victim has reported the crime . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 293, 677 A.2d 917 (1996); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Lindstrom, </em>46 Conn. App. 810, 816, 702 A.2d 410, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 947, 704 A.2d 802 (1997). \u201c[W]hether evidence is admissible under the constancy of accusation doctrine is an evidentiary question that will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Orhan, </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">At trial, the state offered certain statements made by the victims to others that the defendant had sexually assaulted them. Those statements were admitted, and the court gave the jury specific instructions that the evidence was \u201cadmitted solely to corroborate or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>corroborate the complainant\u2019s testimony in court; to be considered by you only in determining the weight and credibility you will accord their testimony given here in this courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The defendant claims that the constancy of accusation evidence was improperly admitted because the testimony did not satisfy the \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d standard set forth in <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980). The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Roberts </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In <em>Roberts, </em>the United States Supreme Court clarified that the confrontation clause ordinarily envisions \u201ca personal examination and cross-examination of the witness, in which the accused has an opportunity, not only of testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief. <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>[156 U.S. 237, 242-43, 15 S. Ct. 337, 39 L. Ed. 409 (1895)]. These means of testing accuracy are so important that the absence of proper confrontation at trial calls into question the ultimate integrity of the fact-finding process. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973), quoting <em>Berger </em>v. <em>California, </em>393 U.S. 314, 315, 89 S. Ct. 540, 21 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1969).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>supra, 448 U.S. 63-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The <em>Roberts </em>court announced a two part test for determining whether former testimony may be admitted without infringing on a criminal defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. \u201cThat test requires (1) demonstration that the witness is unavailable to testify at trial, and (2) adequate indicia of reliability of the previous testimony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 248, 645 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>999 (1994). The \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d analysis, therefore, arises only when a witness is unavailable to testify. In the present case, J was available to testify. In fact, she testified at trial for two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The defendant further claims that the constancy of accusation evidence was more prejudicial than probative because \u201c[t]he jury utilized such statements of proof of the facts at issue, and not just merely as corroborative of the complaining party.\u201d Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s claim, the court specifically instructed the jury that the evidence was to be used only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony. The defendant does not offer any evidence that the jury utilized the statements in any way other than instructed and we will not assume any such misuse. The defendant has failed to show that a substantial prejudice or injustice has resulted from the constancy of accusation evidence. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the constancy of accusation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person, or (2) engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is under thirteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who (1) wilfully or unlawfully causes or permits any child under the age of sixteen years to be placed in such a situation that the life or limb of such child is endangered, the health of such child is likely to be injured or 1he morals of such child are likely to be impaired, or does any act likely to impair the health or morals of any such child, or (2) has contact with the intimate parts, as defined in section 53a-65, of a child under the age of sixteen years or subjects a child under the age of sixteen years of age to contact with the intimate parts of such person, in a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child . . . shall be guilty of a class G felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-12\">Section 53-21 was amended during the period of the defendant\u2019s allegedly criminal actions, adding subdivision (2) effective October 1, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\"> Although the defendant also contends that \u201cthe court erred by admitting medical records without redacting certain statements contained therein,\u201d he has not briefed the issue. \u201cWhere an issue is merely mentioned, but not briefed beyond a bare assertion of the claim, it is deemed to have been waived.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; MacLean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 344 n.11, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996).
