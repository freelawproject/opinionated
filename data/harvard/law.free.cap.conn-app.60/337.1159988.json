In appeal No. 18815 (pension appeal), the defendant, Joel Sachs, claims that the trial court improperly construed the property award provisions of the parties\u2019 dissolution agreement to allow the plaintiff, Sandra Sachs, one third of the defendant\u2019s future pension benefits that are attributable solely to the defendant\u2019s work after the date of the dissolution. The challenged future pension benefits are one third of all postdissolution deposits made to the defendant\u2019s retirement plans and the earnings thereon. In appeal No. 19255 (attorney\u2019s fees appeal), the defendant claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>that the trial court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff to defend this appeal. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of these appeals. On April 13, 1983, the parties executed a separation agreement (agreement) that the trial court incorporated by reference into the dissolution decree. The parties subsequently filed a series of postjudgment motions seeking to clarify whether the parties intended to divide the defendant\u2019s future pension benefits accruing after the court rendered the judgment dissolving the marriage. The defendant filed a motion for order pursuant to paragraph three<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the agreement, seeking the entry of a proposed qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) that would have excluded from the agreement all annual contributions made by his employer for his work postdissolution. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel the defendant to draft a QDRO requiring the defendant to pay to the plaintiff one third of his present and future pension benefits in accordance with the agreement that was incorporated into the dissolution decree. The court, after a hearing, ruled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the defendant\u2019s QDRO did not comply with the April 13, 1983 dissolution judgment. It further ordered the defendant to submit to the plaintiff \u201cappropriate [QDRO\u2019s] transferring to the plaintiff one third of his present and future interest in the [pension plan]. Said transfer to include contributions to both plans from date of judgment (4/13/83) to date of retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The facts relevant to the attorney\u2019s fees appeal are as follows. The plaintiff moved for attorney\u2019s fees to defend the present appeal, requesting a total of $15,000. The plaintiff\u2019s appellate counsel required a $10,000 retainer, and her trial counsel required a $5000 retainer to consult on the appeal. The court found that \u201cthe defendant was evasive [about] disclosing his financial status, that he has in excess of one million dollars in liquid assets and continues to earn an annual income of approximately $210,000.\u201d The court also found that the plaintiff had recently inherited some money, but that it would be significantly diminished after distribution to beneficiaries and after payment for the administration of the estate. Also, the court found that the plaintiff was unemployed. The court ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs appellate counsel the sum of $7500.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">In the pension appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly construed the parties\u2019 dissolution agreement as providing that the plaintiff was entitled to one third of the defendant\u2019s pension benefits that were attributable solely to his work performance after the date of the dissolution. Specifically, the defendant claims that (1) the court\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the intent of the parties, as expressed in paragraphs three and twenty of the agreement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to limit all property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>awards to that which the court could have ordered pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) regardless of the intent of the parties, \u00a7 46b-81 does not authorize the court to award the challenged future pension benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u201cThe agreement of the parties executed at the time of the dissolution was incorporated into the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>and is a contract of the parties. <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>250 Conn. 226, 235, 737 A.2d 383 (1999); <em>Greenburg </em>v. <em>Greenburg, </em>26 Conn. App. 591, 595, 602 A.2d 1056 (1992). The construction of a contract to ascertain the intent of the parties presents a question of law when the contract or agreement is unambiguous within the four comers of the instrument. <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>supra, 235. \u2018[T]he constmction of a written contract is a question of law for the court. \u2019 <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Housing Authority, </em>208 Conn. 161, 179, 544 A.2d 1185 (1988); <em>Sacharko </em>v. <em>Center Equities Ltd. Partnership, </em>2 Conn. App. 439, 445, 479 A.2d 1219 (1984). The scope of review in such cases is plenary. <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Occhionero, </em>239 Conn. 199, 205, 681 A.2d 306 (1996); <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>54 Conn. App. 11, 16, 734 A.2d 571, cert. granted on other grounds, 251 Conn. 919, 742 A.2d 358 (1999). Because our review is plenary, involving a question of law, our standard for review is not the clearly erroneous standard used to review questions of fact found by a trial court. Our review of the parties\u2019 agreement is plenary . . . .\u201d <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>56 Conn. App. 459, 470, 743 A.2d 1135, cert. granted on other grounds, 253 Conn. 910, 754 A.2d 160 (2000) (appeal withdrawn September 27, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Notwithstanding the plain language of paragraph three of the agreement, the defendant insists on a tortured reading of paragraph twenty of the agreement to support his claim that the parties intended their agreement to be subject to the statutory limitations provided under \u00a7 46b-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The defendant\u2019s basic premise is that the court could not, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81, order that postdissolution contributions to the pension plan be allocated to the parties in the manner that they have done so by agreement. He asserts that implicit in the clause that requires court approval of the agreement is the understanding that the court will limit any property award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>to that which the court could have ordered pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81. We conclude that the court properly construed the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Paragraph twenty does not make any express reference to \u00a7 46b-81. There is, therefore, no reason to review the distribution of the pension benefits under the agreement pursuant to the authority provided by \u00a7 46b-81 for the distribution of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Paragraph twenty of the agreement, by its plain language, indicates that the agreement will become effective only upon approval after submission to the court pursuant to \u00a7 46b-66. Nowhere does the agreement specifically reference \u00a7 46b-81. Furthermore, paragraph twenty states that \u201c[i]f approved by the Court, this agreement is to be taken as the parties\u2019 full expression of the manner in which they would like to have their property and other assets and problems resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The court interpreted the agreement provision that defined the distribution of the defendant\u2019s pension benefits by looking at the plain language of the agreement. \u201cThe interpretation of the agreement is a search for the intent of the parties. . . . This intent must be determined from the language of the instrument and not from any intention either of the parties may have secretly entertained. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>43 Conn. App. 844, 848, 685 A.2d 1153 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Several key phrases in the language of paragraph three of the agreement provide clear and unambiguous evidence of the parties intent. First, the language that states that \u201c [t]he husband has accrued and will continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>to accrue pension and retirement benefits,\u201d indicates that the agreement covers both the present and <em>future </em>accrual of benefits. Second, the agreement states that \u201c[i]t is the intention of the parties that <em>such benefits </em>shall be divided between the Husband and Wife . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this second statement, there was no attempt to distinguish between future and past accruals for direction at the time of the division of the benefits. Third, the agreement further directs the husband to \u201ctake all necessaiy steps, prepare and execute all necessary documents to have one third (1/3) of his vested interest in said benefits <em>present and future </em>transferred to the Wife . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language again refers to future benefits without any attempt to indicate that future contributions are intended to be treated differently. Finally, the agreement refers to the wife\u2019s share, and provides that one third of <em>\u201call </em>benefits whether lump sum or periodic payable to the Husband . . . shall be paid and payable directly to the Wife . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language again fails to make any distinction between present and future contributions of the husband, and more directly indicates an intention to divide <em>all </em>of the benefits in the proportions stated in the agreement. The defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly construed the agreement is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The defendant also makes the claim that the court could not have awarded the future pension benefits pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81 because such benefits are not marital property, and, therefore, the court had no power to do so pursuant to the agreement of the parties. Even if we assume, without deciding, that the challenged benefits are not marital property, the defendant cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">In 1983, the defendant joined with the plaintiff in requesting the dissolution court to approve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>agreement as fair and equitable and to incorporate it into the dissolution decree. He now asks us to hold that the agreement is unenforceable. \u201cThis situation is in the nature of induced error. Actions that are induced by a party ordinarily cannot be grounds for error. . . . A defendant can present a claim of relief from induced error only upon a showing that the error violated his constitutional rights.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>39 Conn. App. 242, 251, 665 A.2d 611, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 924, 925, 666 A.2d 1186, 1187 (1995); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanks, </em>39 Conn App. 333, 344, 665 A.2d 102, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 926, 666 A.2d 1187 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Youdin, </em>38 Conn. App. 85, 94, 659 A.2d 728, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 920, 661 A.2d 100 (1995). Because no constitutional violation is claimed here, review of this claim is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s initial claim that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the challenged aspect of the agreement is no longer viable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During the pendency of these appeals, our Supreme Court decided <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999), clarifying the distinction between a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and its authority to act pursuant to a statute. \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 46b-l (c)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides the Superior Court with plenary and general subject matter jurisdiction over legal disputes in family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>relations matters . . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 729. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 provides the court with jurisdiction to incorporate a separation agreement into its order or decree if upon review it finds the agreement fair and equitable under the circumstances. Furthermore, \u00a7 46b-81 provides the court with jurisdiction to divide the parties\u2019 property. Therefore, the trial court, pursuant to these statutes, had jurisdiction over the claim in this case. Our question is, therefore, whether the court acted within its statutory authority under these statutes in its decision to order the defendant, pursuant to the agreement, to submit a QDRO \u201ctransferring to the plaintiff one third of his present and future interest in the [pension plan].\u201d Although it is axiomatic that parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court by agreement, appellate review of a court\u2019s statutory authority can be precluded, pursuant to the induced error doctrine, where a party to an agreement in the trial court seeks to avoid that agreement, in a situation where the agreement does not violate a constitutional right or public policy. As the defendant concedes, the court has subject matter jurisdiction over property awards in marital dissolution cases and thus had jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">In the attorney\u2019s fees appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff to defend the appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Buttressing its decision to award $7500 to the plaintiff to defend the appeal, the court found the following facts. \u201cThe evidence at trial indicates that the defendant was evasive around disclosing his financial status, that he has in excess of one million dollars in liquid assets and continues to earn an annual income of approximately $210,000. The plaintiff recently inherited some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>money but this will be significantly diminished after distribution among the beneficiaries and moneys used for the administration of the estate. Additionally the plaintiff is unemployed.\u201d Furthermore, the court specifically indicated that it considered the evidence and General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u201cCourts ordinarily award counsel fees in divorce cases so that a party . . . may not be deprived of [his or] her rights because of lack of funds. . . . Where, because of other orders, both parties are financially able to pay their own counsel fees they should be permitted to do so. . . . <em>Koizim </em>v. <em>Koizim, </em>181 Conn. 492, 501, 435 A.2d 1030 (1980). An exception to the rule announced in <em>Koizim </em>is that an award of attorney\u2019s fees is justified even where both parties are financially able to pay their own fees if the failure to make an award would undermine its prior financial orders .... <em>Eslami </em>v. <em>Eslami, </em>218 Conn. 801, 820, 591 A.2d 411 (1991). Whether to allow counsel fees [under \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82], and if so in what amount, calls for the exercise of judicial discretion. . . . <em>Holley </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>[194 Conn. 25, 33-34, 478 A.2d 1000 (1984)]. An abuse of discretion in granting counsel fees will be found only if [an appellate court] determines that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>could not reasonably have concluded as it did. <em>Unkelbach </em>v. <em>McNary, </em>244 Conn. 350, 374, 710 A.2d 717 (1998), quoting <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Bieluch, </em>32 Conn. App. 537, 544, 629 A.2d 1175, cert. denied, 228 Conn. 910, 635 A.2d 1229 (1993).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bornemann </em>v. <em>Bornemann, </em>245 Conn. 508, 543, 752 A.2d 978 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The defendant first claims that the court\u2019s prior denial of attorney\u2019s fees to litigate trial court motions acts as a bar to future claims for attorney\u2019s fees. The defendant relies on our decision in <em>Durkin </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>43 Conn. App. 659, 685 A.2d 344 (1996), for this proposition. In <em>Durkin, </em>we stated that \u201c[i]f an award of attorney\u2019s fees was sought in the underlying proceeding from which the appeal is being taken, the ruling on that earlier application may substantially control the result on the later application for attorney\u2019s fees on appeal. A. Rutkin, E. Effron &amp; K. Hogan, 8 Connecticut Practice Series: Family Law and Practice (1991) \u00a7 44.12, p. 285.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Durkin </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>supra, 664. In <em>Durkin, </em>the claim was that the court deprived the defendant of a meaningful hearing on attorney\u2019s fees because the defendant was unable to cross-examine the plaintiff on her financial affidavit because she was out of the country at the time of the hearing. We held that the defendant had a sufficient opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiff at an earlier hearing on the same financial affidavit and thus that the court properly relied on a previous hearing in awarding counsel fees to the plaintiff. Id. The factual situation in <em>Durkin </em>and its holding are therefore not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Furthermore, <em>Durkin </em>does not preclude future awards of attorney\u2019s fees once a trial court in a prior proceeding rules that no attorney\u2019s fees are warranted at that time. This is evident by our choice of the words, <em>\u201cmay </em>substantially control.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Such language is not mandatory. The trial court could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>have concluded, therefore, that because the plaintiff was being forced to defend another appeal to enforce its prior judgment, an award of attorney\u2019s fees was necessary to prevent the undermining of its previous financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The defendant next claims that the plaintiffs attempts to introduce evidence to inform the court of the reasonableness of the fees bear on the trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees in this case. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 governs orders for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees and provides in relevant part that \u201cthe court may order either spouse ... to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other in accordance with their respective financial abilities and the criteria set forth in section 46b-82.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The defendant claims that his due process rights were violated because the plaintiff\u2019s motion sought $10,000 for her appellate attorney\u2019s fees, but the trial court allowed her to testify that her attorney estimated the fees for the appeal to be \u201cin the range of about twenty-five thousand\u2014[dollars].\u201d The defendant\u2019s objection to this testimony as hearsay was overruled. This argument is factually flawed. First, the motion for attorney\u2019s fees sought $15,000 to defend the appeal. That the plaintiff testified that her anticipated cost of appeal would exceed the requested $15,000 is of no moment. The defendant, by the stated relief sought in the motion, was on notice that he faced a liability of only $15,000. Fiirthermore, the court awarded only $7500 in attorney\u2019s fees. We fail, therefore, to see how the defendant\u2019s due process rights could have been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The defendant also claims that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to award attorney\u2019s fees because the plaintiff had already paid the $10,000 retainer to her appellate counsel, and therefore the plaintiff was actually seeking a reimbursement. Because attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>fees may be awarded even where both parties are financially able to pay their own fees; <em>Eslami </em>v. Eslami, supra, 218 Conn. 820; we find that the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\"> Paragraph three of the agreement provides: \u201cThe Husband has accrued and will continue to accrue pension and retirement benefits from Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. It is the intention of the parties that such benefits shall be divided between the Husband and Wife sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3%) percent to the Husband thirty-three and one-third (33 1/3%) percent to the Wife. The Husband represents that said benefits are payable to him upon his attaining age sixty-five and that he shall forthwith take all necessary steps, prepare and execute all necessary documents to have one third (1/3) of his vested interest in said benefits present and future transferred to the Wife to be hers absolutely and forever it being understood that one third (1/3) of all benefits whether lump sum or periodic payable to the Husband upon his attaining the age of sixty-five shall be paid and payable directly to the Wife and the Wife agrees to pay the tax consequent on said one third (1/3). It is further understood and agreed that the Husband shall not in any way impair by hypothecating, borrowing against, anticipating or otherwise the benefits accrued or accruing in such pension plan. Such benefits as are payable upon the death of an insured under such plan shall be payable one third (1/3) to the Wife.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b366-9\"> Paragraph three is fully set out in footnote 1. Paragraph twenty, entitled \u201cCOURT APPROVAL AND MODIFICATION,\u201d provides: \u201cPursuant to the provisions of Sections 46b-66 and 46b-86 of the Connecticut General Statutes, this Agreement shall be submitted to the Court having jurisdiction of any action for dissolution which may be brought by either party and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Agreement shall be effective only if approved by the Court and incorporated into the decree of dissolution.
