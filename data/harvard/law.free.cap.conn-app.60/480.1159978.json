On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied his motion for a speedy trial dated July 24, 1998, as being premature, (2) abused its discretion in deeming his letter to the court dated September 2, 1998, a new motion for a speedy trial and (3) abused its discretion in failing to rule on his motion to dismiss filed on September 30, 1998. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">The following facts are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. The defendant was arrested on February 21, 1997, by Enfield police pursuant to a warrant on charges arising from his sale of narcotics to an undercover state police trooper on October 10, 1996. On February 24, 1997, the state filed an information charging the defendant with, inter alia, the sale of narcotics pursuant to \u00a7 21a-277 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Thereafter, the defendant was held, in lieu of bond, as a pretrial detainee, from February 24, 1997, to April 29, 1997, when he was released on a nonsurety bond with a random drug testing condition. On July 24,1997, the defendant was placed in an alternative incarceration center because of noncompliance with the conditions of his release. In September, 1997, the defendant was placed in another alternative incarceration center, but tested positive for drug use and was arrested twice. The court subsequently reinstated the original surety bond, and the defendant was returned to the lockup as a pretrial detainee held in lieu of bond on October 23, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Approximately nine months later, on July 24, 1998, the defendant filed a motion for a speedy trial. After a hearing on July 31, 1998, the court denied the motion as premature.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, on September 2, 1998, the defendant mailed a pro se letter to the court, which indicated that the letter was to serve as his official notification that he intended to sue the state for illegally detaining him and requested his immediate release. The court, despite the defendant\u2019s emphatic protestations, interpreted the September 2,1998 letter as a new motion for a speedy trial, granted the request and determined that the defendant\u2019s trial must begin within thirty days of September 8, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">On September 30, 1998, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss after the court failed to grant his July 24, 1998 motion for a speedy trial. The court, however, took no action on the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">On October 6, 1998, the defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere conditioned on his right to appeal from the court\u2019s implicit denial of his motion to dismiss in which he alleged a violation of his right to a speedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>trial. The defendant received a sentence of five years, execution suspended, and five years probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The defendant first claims that the couit improperly failed to grant his July 24, 1998 motion for a speedy trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He claims that because he was incarcerated in lieu of bond for more than nine months before he filed the motion, the court improperly relied on Practice Book \u00a7 43-39 (c) and (d) in denying the motion as premature. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 43-39 (c) provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided herein and in Section 43-40, the trial of a defendant charged with a criminal offense on or after July 1, 1985, shall commence within twelve months from the filing of the information or from the date of the arrest, whichever is later.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 43-39 (d) provides: \u201cThe trial of such defendant shall commence within eight months from the filing of the information or from the date of the arrest, whichever is later, if the following conditions are met: (1) the defendant has been continuously incarcerated in a correctional institution of this state pending trial for such offense; and (2) the defendant is not subject to the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The defendant claims that the court should have relied on the eight month provision under Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u00a7 43-39 (d). The plain language of the applicable sections, however, demonstrate otherwise. As the state correctly points out in its brief, the court should have relied on the eight month provision under Practice Book \u00a7 43-39 (d) <em>only if the </em>defendant had been <em>continuously incarcerated </em>from February 24, 1997, the date the state filed an information charging the defendant, until July 24, 1998, the date the defendant filed his motion for a speedy trial. As the previously stated facts demonstrate, the defendant, who had been held as a pretrial detainee in lieu of bond beginning February 24, 1997, was <em>released </em>on bond with conditions on April 29,1997. The defendant\u2019s bond was then reinstated on October 23, 1997, because he had violated the conditions of his release. Thereafter, the defendant was .held in lieu of bond through the date that he filed the motion for a speedy trial. The result is that while the defendant was ultimately incarcerated in lieu of bond for more than nine months, he had not been <em>continuously incarcerated from the date of the filing of the information. </em>The court, therefore, properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a speedy trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion in deeming his pro se letter to the court dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>September 2, 1998, as a new motion for a speedy trial and granting the motion rather than considering it to be a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">As an initial consideration, we note that the defendant incorrectly claims that this court\u2019s standard of review is to consider whether the trial court abused its discretion. The appropriate standard of review, however, is whether the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous and whether the letter, as a matter of law, constituted a motion for a speedy trial by satisfying the minimum requirements for such a motion. See <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>51 Conn. App. 77, 82 n.7, 720 A.2d 264 (1998), citing <em>In re Michael A., </em>47 Conn. App. 105, 109, 703 A.2d 1146 (1997). We conclude that the court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 41-6 provides in relevant part: \u201cPretrial motions shall be written and served in accordance with Sections 10-12 through 10-17 unless, for good cause shown, the judicial authority shall grant permission to make an oral pretrial motion. Every written motion shall include a statement of the factual and legal or other basis therefor, shall state whether the same or a similar motion was previously filed and ruled upon, and shall have annexed to it a proper order. ...\u201d Our review of the motion reveals that the defendant failed (1) to provide any factual basis, (2) to state whether the same or a similar motion was previously filed and ruled on, and (3) to attach a proper order. Because the defendant failed to satisfy the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 41-6, the court did not improperly fail to deem the defendant\u2019s letter a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Furthermore, even if the court should have considered the letter as a motion to dismiss, that error would be harmless. Practice Book \u00a7 43-41 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the defendant is not brought to trial within the applicable time limit set forth in Sections 43-39 and 43-40, and, absent good cause shown, a trial is not commenced within thirty days of the filing of a motion for speedy trial by the defendant at any time after such time limit has passed, the information shall be dismissed with prejudice, on motion of the defendant filed after the expiration of such thirty day period. ...\u201d Because the defendant\u2019s July 24, 1998 motion for a speedy trial had been denied, a motion to dismiss would have been premature and necessarily would have been denied. The defendant, therefore, suffered no harm in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The defendant claims finally that the court abused its discretion in failing to rule on his September 30, 1998 motion to dismiss. Because the record reveals that the court implicitly ruled on the motion, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The defendant\u2019s actions demonstrate that he acknowledged that his motion to dismiss had been implicitly denied. First, one week after the defendant filed his September 30, 1998 motion to dismiss, he entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a. Section 54-94a provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen a defendant, prior to the commencement of trial, enters a plea of nolo contendere conditional on the right to take an appeal from the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s . . . motion to dismiss, the defendant after the imposition of sentence may file an appeal within the time prescribed by law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The issue to be considered in such an appeal shall be limited to whether it was proper for the court to have denied the motion to suppress or the motion to dismiss. ...\u201d Because the defendant entered his plea pursuant to \u00a7 54-94a, which authorizes an appeal from a denial of a motion to dismiss, the defendant obviously believed that the court had implicitly denied his motion. Moreover, because the court accepted the defendant\u2019s conditional plea and sentenced him, it necessarily found that his motion to dismiss had been denied. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ober, </em>24 Conn. App. 347 n.l, 351, 588 A.2d 1080, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 909, 593 A.2d 134, 135, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 915, 112 S. Ct. 319, 116 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\"> The defendant also was charged with possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a), possession of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (d), sale of narcotics within 1500 feet of a school in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b), conspiracy to sell narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 21a-277 (a), and sale of narcotics by a person who is not drug-dependent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b). These charges were nolled pursuant to the defendant\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> The court made no findings concerning excludable time periods at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b509-9\"> The defendant states in his brief that his rights to a speedy trial under the sixth amendment to the United Slates constitution and article first, 8 8, of the constitution of Connecticut were violated by the court\u2019s action. Because he fails, however, to provide any substantive argument in support of this claim, we deem it to be abandoned. See <em>In re Shane P., </em>58 Conn. App. 234, 243-44, 753 A.2d 409 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b509-10\">A recitation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-82c is not germane to our discussion as the defendant was a pretrial detainee and not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in a correctional institu\u00ed ion and, therefore, as both parties properly concede in their briefs, was not subject to \u00a7 54-82c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\"> In any event, the defendant was not relying on Practice Book \u00a7 43-39 (c), which provides in relevant part that the \u201ctrial of a defendant charged with a criminal offense on or after July 1, 1985, shall commence within twelve months from the filing of the information or from the date of the arrest, whichever is later. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The defendant does correctly point out that the court improperly failed to make an excludable time computation in determining the time within which a trial must commence. Because, however, the defendant claimed only that the court improperly failed to rely on the eight month provision, he has waived any claim that it applied the twelve month provision incorrectly. It is well established that an appellate court is under no obligation to consider a claim that was not distinctly raised at the trial level. <em>Salmon </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health &amp; Addiction Services, </em>58 Conn. App. 642, 662, 754 A.2d 828 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> The defendant\u2019s letter states in relevant part: \u201cMy illegal detention began on August 31,1998, in direct violation of Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m. This is my official notification that I intend to pursue a legal course of adion against all parties affiliated with this illegal detention, and I am hereby requesting my immediate release.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\"> Moreover, as the state correctly points out, the defendant also failed to comply with the service requirement for a motion to dismiss. Because we already have determined that the court did not improperly fail to deem the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>letter a motion to dismiss due to the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 41-6, a discussion of the service requirements would be mere surplusage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
