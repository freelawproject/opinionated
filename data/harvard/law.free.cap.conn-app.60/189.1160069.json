On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court (1) lacked jurisdiction to open and modify the judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a because the defendant did not file his motion within four months following the date on which the judgment was rendered, (2) even if it had jurisdiction, improperly determined that the award of household support was not legally enforceable and (3) improperly considered the defendant\u2019s pro se status in terminating the award. We conclude that the plaintiff failed to preserve the first claim for appellate review. We agree with her second claim, reverse the judgment of the trial court on that ground and therefore do not reach the third claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The relevant facts are as follows. The court dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage on September 25, 1996, after an uncontested hearing in which only the plaintiff was represented by counsel. The final dissolution decree incorporated the terms of a written separation agreement, negotiated by the parties but drafted by the plaintiffs attorney, concerning alimony, disposition of property and the custody, care, education, visitation, maintenance and support of the three minor children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The agreement provided, inter aha, that the plaintiff would receive 80 percent or more of the parties\u2019 assets, including the marital home, that the children would reside with the plaintiff, subject to reasonable visitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>by the defendant, and that the defendant would pay to the plaintiff child support in the amount of $345 per week in accordance with state child support guidelines. Paragraph seven of the separation agreement, entitled \u201cHousehold Support to Wife,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> further states that there would be no award of periodic alimony to either party and required the defendant to contribute $260 per week toward the plaintiff\u2019s household expenses for a period of five years. The order was nonmodifiable as to duration or amount, and was nontaxable to the plaintiff and nondeductible by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The parties operated under the terms of the judgment until July, 1997, when the defendant was laid off by his employer. His average annual earnings had been $65,000 to $70,000 at the time of the dissolution, but his new job paid $15 hourly, which meant that he earned approximately one-half of his prior income. As a result of his changed employment, the defendant advised the plaintiff that he was reducing his $605 weekly obligation of combined child ($345) and household ($260) support to $376 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In October, 1997, the plaintiff served the defendant with a contempt citation, seeking the difference between the court-ordered $605 weekly financial obligation and the defendant\u2019s weekly payment of $376. The defendant responded by filing a motion for modification in November, 1997, claiming a substantial change of circumstances and questioning the meaning of paragraph seven. In his motion, the defendant claimed that the $260 per week in household support was, in effect, a form of child support and, when considered from that perspective, his weekly support obligation of $605 deviated more than 15 percent above the child support guidelines. He therefore requested that the court (1) clarify that the award of household support was intended to be additional child support, and (2) modify and reduce his financial obligation to a total of $376 per week. Thereafter, a two day hearing was conducted, with both parties testifying as to their respective understandings of paragraph seven.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">On December 18, 1997, the court rendered judgment from the bench, granting the defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court stated that it found the provisions in paragraph seven \u201ccontradictory and confusing,\u201d and never before had encountered such provisions in a separation agreement. The court concluded that the disputed household support could not be considered alimony, which the parties had expressly waived, and could not be considered a property settlement, since the dissolution decree had allocated most, if not all, of the parties\u2019 assets to the plaintiff. The court also stated that the pro se defendant might not have understood the meaning of the phrase \u201cnonmodifiable as to duration and amount.\u201d The court further stated that \u201c[t]he transcript of the final hearing revealed ... an inadequate canvass of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the defendant and also lax description of the terms of the agreement itself.\u201d The court finally stated that \u201c[t]he agreement ... is void of any section which would indicate that the defendant was given an opportunity to have it reviewed by counsel prior to signing it, which is a provision which I certainly included in any separation agreement I ever drafted with a pro se. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u201cI think the drafter [plaintiff] will have to bear the burden in this case for not assuring this court; that the defendant understood the implications that the plaintiff would like this court to believe the defendant understood.\u201d The court then determined that paragraph seven, as incorporated into the judgment of dissolution, was not legally enforceable due to its ambiguity, ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff an arrearage of $5,476.28 and, with the plaintiffs concurrence, reduced the defendant\u2019s child support obligation to $270 per week. This appeal of the court\u2019s determination that the household support provision was not legally enforceable followed. The plaintiff subsequently requested, and this court ordered, that the trial court articulate its decision to modify the judgment of dissolution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the court lacked jurisdiction to open and modify the judgment of dissolution because the defendant\u2019s motion was filed more than four months after the decree was entered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>defendant failed to raise the issue of timeliness in the trial court, we are not bound to review this claim. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Karl &amp; Gelb, P.C., </em>252 Conn. 153, 170, 745 A.2d 178 (2000). We note, nonetheless, that this argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law and <em>except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, </em>a civil judgment . . . may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) See Practice Book \u00a7 17-4. Under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a), the trial court retains continuing jurisdiction, except where precluded by the decree, to modify orders concerning alimony or support. <em>Bunche </em>v. <em>Bunche, </em>180 Conn. 285, 288, 429 A.2d 874 (1980); <em>Croke </em>v. <em>Croke, </em>4 Conn. App. 663, 664, 496 A.2d 235 (1985). When a decree contains language precluding modification, a trial court, under its continuing jurisdiction, has the power to determine whether the preclusive language in the decree should be enforced. See <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 730, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999). Accordingly, in this case, because the trial court possessed continuing jurisdiction, the court was not constrained by the four month limit of \u00a7 52-212a.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The plaintiff next claims that the court improperly terminated the award of household support on the ground that it was not legally enforceable. She contends that paragraph seven clearly and unambiguously pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>vides that the award of household support is \u201cnonmodi-fiable as to duration and amount,\u201d and that agreements precluding modification of alimony and support are permissible under \u00a7 46b-86 (a). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Our analysis begins with a discussion of the appropriate standard of review. In a marriage dissolution action, an agreement of the parties executed at the time of the dissolution and incoiporated into the judgment is a contract of the parties. <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>56 Conn. App. 459, 470, 743 A.2d 1135, cert. granted on other grounds, 253 Conn. 910, 754 A.2d 160 (2000) (appeal withdrawn September 27, 2000). \u201cThe construction of a contract to ascertain the intent of the parties presents a question of law when the contract or agreement is unambiguous within the four comers of the instrument. . . . The scope of review in such cases is plenary.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cUnless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification, </em>any final order for the periodic payment of permanent alimony or support . . . may at any time thereafter be . . . modified by said court upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">We recently considered the nonmodification provision of \u00a7 46b-86 (a) in <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 471, and determined that \u201c[sjection 46b-86 (a) clearly permits a dissolution court to make nonmodi-fiable . . . awards. . . . When a provision in a divorce decree that precludes or restricts a later court\u2019s power to modify financial orders is clear and unambiguous . . . that provision will be upheld. ... A party to a contract is entitled to rely on its provisions as the final interpretation of that party\u2019s rights and duties.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>In the present case, the nonmodification provision in the order for household support is clear, unambiguous and \u201cwithin the four comers of the instrument.\u201d Id., 470. We therefore conclude that the provision is enforceable as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The defendant does not address the contractual nature of the nonmodification provision, but chooses to interpret the plaintiffs claim as a challenge to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, namely, that the order of household support does not fit within the definition of either child support, alimony or an assignment of property and, due to its inherent ambiguity, is not legally enforceable. He contends that appellate review of findings of fact is limited solely to whether the court\u2019s conclusion was reasonable and that the court in the present case reasonably could have reached the conclusion that it did. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Even if the defendant were correct in asserting that the plaintiff is challenging the court\u2019s findings of fact as to the nature of the support obligation, the issue is moot because the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay household expenses is legally enforceable regardless of how it is characterized.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">We interpreted \u00a7 46b-86 (a) as applied to child support orders in <em>Amodio, </em>where the primary issue on appeal was \u201cwhether General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) precludes modification of the amount of child support awarded at the time of a judgment of dissolution of marriage in accordance with a written agreement of the parties that precluded such modification, which agreement was incorporated by reference into the judgment of dissolution.\u201d <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>supra, 56 Conn. App. 460. There, as here, the support award was substantially more than the amount recommended by the statutory guidelines, and the plaintiff appealed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the trial court\u2019s order of a downward modification. Id., 464.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We determined in <em>Amodio </em>that modification of the child support award was precluded pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 (a) because child support in an amount deemed appropriate was agreed upon by the parties, reduced to writing and approved by the court rendering the judgment of dissolution. Id., 472. The parties\u2019 agreement also clearly and unambiguously precluded a downward modification of the award, despite the fact that the award exceeded the statutory guidelines by more than 15 percent. Id. Moreover, we noted that the defendant did not appeal from the original judgment and stated that the plaintiff was entitled to have the benefit of the bargain that the parties had made. Id., 473. We accordingly concluded that the trial court failed to give effect to the parties\u2019 agreement and improperly reduced the child support order. Id., 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Our reasoning in <em>Amodio </em>is applicable here. Even if the award of household support to the plaintiff is considered child support, the defendant\u2019s argument must fail pursuant to \u00a7 46b-86 (a) because the parties agreed to the award prior to its inclusion in the judgment of dissolution, and the plain language of paragraph seven clearly and unambiguously states that the award is nonmodifiable as to duration and amount. The fact that the combined award of household and child support exceeds the statutory guidelines for child support is immaterial, as it was in <em>Amodio. </em>Furthermore, the defendant indicated during the original dissolution hearing in 1996 that he understood the agreement,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>he never appealed from the original judgment. Other considerations that favor our strict interpretation of the norunodification provision in this case include the plaintiffs agreement to a reduction in the weekly child support payment from $345 to $270 and the fact that the plaintiff waived her right to alimony purportedly because the defendant agreed to provide her with household support.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The defendant argues that the ruling in <em>Amodio </em>is not relevant in the present case because, unlike the situation in Amodio, the court found mutual mistake as to the parties\u2019 understanding of paragraph seven, the language of paragraph seven was ambiguous, the plaintiff did not comply with conditions precedent to the payments, the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances changed substantially to his detriment and the court did not adequately canvass the defendant. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">It is true that the parties expressed different interpretations during the December, 1997 hearing as to whether the award of household support should be characterized as alimony or child support. At that time, the court also found that the defendant may have misunderstood the meaning of the term \u201cnonmodifiable as to duration and amount.\u201d It made no similar finding, however, as to the plaintiff. Accordingly, the court did not make a finding of mutual mistake regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>meaning of the nonmodification provision, as the defendant suggests. In addition, the language of paragraph seven was clear and unambiguous insofar as nonmodifi-cation is concerned. The fact that there may have been unfulfilled conditions precedent to the defendant\u2019s payments, that the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances may have changed or that there may have been an inadequate canvass of the defendant at the hearing prior to the original judgment has no bearing whatsoever on the question, raised here and in <em>Amodio, </em>of whether a clear and unambiguous nonmodification provision in a judgment of dissolution precludes modification of a support order as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Paragraph seven also would be legally enforceable as an award of alimony or property. Section 46b-86 (a) \u201c \u2018clearly permits a trial court to make periodic awards of alimony nonmodifiable\u2019 <em>Wichman </em>v. <em>Wichman, </em>49 Conn. App. 529, 535, 714 A.2d 1274, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 910, 719 A.2d 906 (1998); lump sum alimony is a final judgment not modifiable by the court even if there is a change in circumstances; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>249 Conn. 265, 276, 752 A.2d 1023 (1999); and it is well established that the assignment of property is nonmodifiable. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>57 Conn. App. 528, 533, 752 A.2d 1113 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Accordingly, the award of household support is enforceable as a matter of law, regardless of how it may have been characterized by the defendant or the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The plaintiff finally claims that the court improperly considered the pro se status of the defendant in terminating the provision for household support. In light of our conclusion in part II of this opinion that paragraph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>seven is legally enforceable, we need not consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\"> The judgment states: \u201cThe parties hereto have submitted a written agreement dated September 25, 1996, concerning the custody, care, education, visitation, maintenance, support of their minor children, alimony, and the disposition of their property, which agreement the court finds to be fair and equitable, and which agreement has been approved and made part of the court file.\u201d All provisions in the agreement relating to custody and visitation, child support, health insurance, household support to wife, pension and investments, tax exemptions, life insurance, family residence, bank accounts and cofiege tuition were repeated nearly verbatim in the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> All future references to paragraph seven are to its terms as incorporated into the judgment of dissolution, unless otherwise noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Paragraph seven states: \u201cEach party waives and relinquishes any claim to periodic alimony from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">\u201cThe husband shall contribute the sum of two hundred sixty dollars ($260.00) per week toward the wife\u2019s household expenses for a period of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">\u201cThis agreement is made in contemplation of the serious illness of the parties\u2019 minor child and the need for the wife to be available to him, and the impediment, thereafter, to her gainful employment.

Finding the concept of personal jurisdiction inapplicable as well, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he better construction of the statute is to characterize it as a limitation on the trial court\u2019s general authority to grant relief from a judgment . . . .\u201d Id., 102.
