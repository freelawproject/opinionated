On November 18, 1983, in the judicial district of New Haven, the petitioner was convicted of two counts in one informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>tion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for which he received an effective sentence of thirty-five years imprisonment, to run concurrently with the New London sentence. On November 29, 1984, in the judicial district of Hartford, the petitioner pleaded guilty to two counts in two informations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for which he received an effective sentence of seventeen years imprisonment, to run concurrently with the New Haven sentence and consecutive to the New London sentence. In all, the petitioner\u2019s total effective sentence was forty-five years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner claimed that he was denied the light to effective trial counsel because his total effective sentence of forty-five years for the New London, New Haven and Hartford convictions was not in accordance with his plea agreement in the Hartford prosecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court denied the petition on the ground that at the sentencing hearing in the Hartford case, \u201c[b]oth attorneys [the assistant state\u2019s attorney and the petitioner\u2019s counsel] acknowledged on the record in the presence of the petitioner that such sentence was the goal of the plea bargain.\u201d The petitioner thereafter moved for certification to appeal from the court\u2019s judgment pursuant to \u00a7 52-470 (b), which the court denied \u201cas wholly frivolous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. ... If the petitioner succeeds in sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>mounting that hurdle, the petitioner must also demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">On the basis of our review of the record and briefs, we conclude that the petitioner failed to sustain his burden of persuasion that the habeas court\u2019s denial of his petition for certification to appeal was a clear abuse of discretion or that an injustice has been committed. The petitioner further failed to make a substantial showing that he was denied a state or federal constitutional right.
