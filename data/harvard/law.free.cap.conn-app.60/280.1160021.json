Richter, appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendered following the granting of the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant Danbury Hospital (hospital).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court, in granting the motion as to the fifth and seventh counts of the fifth amended complaint, improperly concluded that a genuine issue of material fact does not exist. We reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The record reveals the following undisputed facts. The defendant William B. Goldstein has maintained a contractual relationship with the hospital since 1968. Under the terms of the contract, Goldstein agreed to become the chief of radiological services and the director of the radiological department of the hospital. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>contract charged Goldstein with the responsibility for the selection of all department of radiology personnel, including medical, technical, secretarial and nontechnical personnel. It provided that the technical, nontechnical and secretarial personnel would be employees of the hospital. The contract stated that Goldstein and his associates \u201cshall be and at all times are acting and performing as independent contractors as physicians practicing their profession of medicine and specializing in radiological diagnosis and treatment.\u201d Further, the contract provides that Goldstein \u201cmay enter into a separate contract with each of your associate radiologists and may pay them directly. In each case you will fully inform the Administrator of the arrangements that you have made with each associate.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The contract also provided that Goldstein operate the department in accordance with the ethical and professional standards of the American Medical Association and the American College of Radiology. There was no specific provision in the contract indicating that the contract was exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The plaintiff is a duly licensed physician and a board certified radiologist. In May, 1973, Goldstein, on behalf of the defendant Danbury Radiological Associates, P.C. (Radiological Associates), entered into an employment contract with the plaintiff. In conjunction with and as a requirement of his employment with Radiological Associates, the plaintiff applied to the hospital for appointment to its medical staff and for privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">After completing the application process, the plaintiff was appointed to the medical staff and granted \u201cin-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>house\u201d privileges<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at the hospital. As part of the application process, the plaintiff acknowledged that he had \u201creceived and read the Medical Staff and Hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Bylaws, and Rules and Regulations, and agreed to be bound by them if granted membership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">On July 9,1991, the board of directors of Radiological Associates voted to terminate the plaintiffs employment with Radiological Associates \u201cwithout cause.\u201d It is undisputed that the plaintiffs termination was not on the basis of professional competence. In accordance with the terms of his contract with Radiological Associates, the plaintiff was given a ninety day notice of termination. The plaintiff sought a meeting with the president of the hospital, Gerard D. Robilotti, and was advised that because Robilotti construed the hospital\u2019s contract with Goldstein to be exclusive, the hospital would be unable to develop a separate relationship with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">On August 9, 1991, the plaintiff, through his counsel, advised the hospital that the impairment of his privileges without a hearing was a violation of the hospital\u2019s bylaws. No response was forthcoming. On August 21, 1991, Goldstein ordered the plaintiff to leave the hospital and told him not to return. This was within the ninety day notice of termination period under the Radiological Associates employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">On September 3, 1992, the plaintiff submitted his biennial request for \u201cin-house\u201d privileges to the hospital. This was the same category of privileges that he had maintained for the previous eighteen years when he was employed by Radiological Associates. Goldstein, as chairman of the department of radiology, recommended to the executive committee that the plaintiff be granted \u201cprivate office\u201d privileges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The executive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>committee approved the recommendation on October 20, 1992. The executive committee\u2019s recommendation was forwarded to the hospital\u2019s board of directors, which failed to take any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">An action was commenced by the plaintiff in eight counts. Counts four, five and seven are directed against the hospital.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Count four alleges that the hospital engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. Count five alleges that the hospital breached its contract with the plaintiff by not allowing him to exercise the privileges granted to him to use the facilities and equipment. Count seven alleges that the hospital breached its contract with the plaintiff when it failed to grant him a hearing on his termination or reduction in privileges as provided for under the fair hearing plan provisions of the bylaws. The hospital filed a motion for summary judgment, which was opposed by the plaintiff. After oral argument, the court in a written memorandum of decision granted the hospital\u2019s motion as to counts four, five and seven. The plaintiff claims that the court improperly granted the motion with respect to counts five and seven because issues of material fact exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u201cThe standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is well established. [W]e must decide whether the trial court erred in determining that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sherwood </em>v. <em>Danbury Hospital, </em>252 Conn. 193, 201, 746 A.2d 730 (2000). \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The test is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts. . . . <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>248 Conn. 419, 424, 727 A.2d 1276 (1999).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hoskins </em>v. <em>Titan Value Equities Group, Inc., </em>252 Conn. 789, 792, 749 A.2d 1144 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On appeal, the scope of our review of the granting of a motion for summary judgment is plenary. <em>Doucette </em>v. <em>Pomes, </em>247 Conn. 442, 453, 724 A.2d 481 (1999). \u201cIn seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of fact.\u201d <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980). \u201cAlthough the party seeking summary judgment has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any material fact ... a party opposing summary judgment must substantiate its adverse claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 202, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We conclude that the hospital has failed to sustain its burden of demonstrating that there are no material facts in dispute and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We begin by reviewing the bylaws of the hospital in light of the claims made by the parties. In count five of the fifth amended complaint, the plaintiff claims that he entered into a contractual arrangement with the hospital whereby he agreed to abide by the bylaws and rules and regulations of the hospital, and that the hospital agreed to allow the plaintiff the use of the hospital facilities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He further alleges that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>was denied access to those facilities in breach of the agreement. The plaintiff alleges in count seven that the hospital breached the agreement when it failed to afford him a hearing under the fair hearing plan. The hospital counters by claiming that the granting of privileges does not create a contract between the hospital and the plaintiff and, therefore, absent a contract there can be no breach.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, the hospital argues that if a contract exists, then its terms are conditioned on the plaintiffs continued employment by Radiological Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Norwalk Hospital, </em>211 Conn. 51, 52, 557 A.2d 1249 (1989), the plaintiff physician brought an action against Norwalk Hospital, alleging breach of contract and antitrust violations. The action arose out of the alleged illegal refusal of the defendants to reappoint the plaintiff to the medical staff of the hospital. Id. The Supreme Court found that the bylaws, in and of themselves, did not constitute an enforceable contract. Id., 59. The court further stated: \u201cAn examination of the hospital\u2019s medical staff bylaws discloses that the hospital clearly intended that membership on its medical staff was a \u2018privilege\u2019 that it might or might not extend to a physician. It can hardly be said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>hospital must extend the privileges to every physician who seeks them. Once this hospital, however, has agreed to extend privileges to a physician, the hospital has changed its position with reference to that physician. By agreeing to extend privileges to the plaintiff physician, the hospital has then done something it was not already bound to do. . . . In granting privileges, this hospital extended to the plaintiff those benefits to his medical practice that are to be gained by the use of the hospital, including its facilities and admissions to the hospital.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 62-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">In <em>Gianetti, </em>the Supreme Court further stated: \u201cWhatever else the granting of staff privileges may connote, it is clear . . . that it [at least] involves a delegation by the hospital [to the physician] of authority to make decisions on utilizations of its facilities. ... In return for that, the plaintiff agreed to abide by its medical staff bylaws. Therefore, the requisite contractual mutuality was then present. . . . This agreement was supported by valid consideration. . . . The hospital changed its position by granting medical staff privileges and the plaintiff physician has likewise changed his position in doing something he was not previously bound to do, i.e., to abide by the hospital medical staff bylaws. Therefore, there is a contractual relationship between the hospital and the plaintiff.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u201cThe existence of a contract is a question of fact to be determined by the trier on the basis of all the evidence. ... To form a valid and binding contract in Connecticut, there must be a mutual understanding of the terms that are definite and certain between the parties. ... To constitute an offer and acceptance sufficient to create an enforceable contract, each must be found to have been based on an identical understanding by the parties.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>L &amp; R Realty </em>v. <em>Connecticut National </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Bank, </em>53 Conn. App. 524, 534, 732 A.2d 181, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 901, 734 A.2d 984 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In this case, the hospital denies the existence of any contract. It claims that the plaintiffs contract is with Radiological Associates. The plaintiff claims, however, that he has a contract with Radiological Associates and with the hospital. In offering the hospital bylaws and his application for privileges, the plaintiff adequately has demonstrated that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a contract exists between him and the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The hospital further argues that it is entitled to summary judgment even if a contractual relationship exists because it could not, as a matter of law, grant access to the facility and equipment due to the alleged exchisive nature of its relationship with Goldstein.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, the hospital argues that the plaintiffs right to use its facilities and equipment was conditioned on his continued employment by Radiological Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">We also note that whether the contractual arrangement between Goldstein and the hospital is an exclusive arrangement is, under the circumstances of this case, a factual issue. The hospital offers, in support of its claim of exclusivity, the 1968 contract between Goldstein and the hospital as well as the affidavit of the president of the hospital. The plaintiff offers in opposition to this claim the 1968 contract, his observations of the actual practices employed by the hospital and the American College of Radiology policy on exclusive contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\u201cAlthough ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact; <em>Gurliacci </em>v. Mayer, 218 Conn. 531, 567, 590 A.2d 914 (1991); <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 199, 520 A.2d 208 (1987); [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law. <em>Thompson &amp; Peck, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harbor Marine Contracting Corp., </em>203 Conn. 123, 131, 523 A.2d 1266 (1987). . . . <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 716, 740, 643 A.2d 1226 (1994).\u201d <em>Bank of Boston Connecticut </em>v. <em>Scott Real Estate, Inc., </em>40 Conn. App. 616, 621, 673 A.2d 558, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 912, 675 A.2d 884 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The contract between Goldstein and the hospital contains no definitive language indicating an exclusive arrangement. Thus, the intent of the parties to the contract is a question of fact in need of determination by the trier of fact. Factors that may enter into the trier\u2019s consideration of the intent of the agreement may be the parties\u2019 agreement that the department of radiology would be run \u201cin accordance with the ethical and professional standards of the American Medical Association and the American College of Radiology.\u201d The plaintiff presented, in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, the American College of Radiology policy on exclusive arrangements between hospitals and individual doctors or groups. The policy appears to prohibit the type of arrangement that the hospital claims the 1968 agreement created. This weighs against the hospital\u2019s claim that the agreement is exclusive. Additional facts may include whether others who are not members of Radiological Associates have access to the radiology facilities and equipment. The hospital and the plaintiff disagree over whether other departments or physicians have such access. The plaintiffs affidavit dated October 30, 1996, in opposition to the motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>for summary judgment specifically alleges facts in support of his contention that Goldstein (or Radiological Associates) is not the sole provider of radiology services.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The hospital also argues, in the alternative, that the plaintiffs contract with the hospital was conditioned on his continued association with Radiological Associates. This, however, also is in dispute. The plaintiff claims to have been unaware of any of the terms of the Goldstein contract, including the alleged exclusive nature of the contract. Additionally, the hospital bylaws provide for a mechanism to qualify any privileges granted. See footnote 3. The documents offered, in support of or in opposition to the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment, do not indicate that the privileges granted the plaintiff had any qualification attached. Thus, whether there was any such understanding is a factual issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Furthermore, the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit clearly establishes that he was denied use of the facilities and equipment by Goldstein and the hospital after he was notified that Radiological Associates was terminating his employment. The plaintiff has raised an issue of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>with respect to whether the denial of the use of the equipment constitutes a breach of contract.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In count seven of the fifth amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the hospital breached its contract with him by refusing to grant him a hearing under the fair hearing plan provisions of the hospital bylaws. The court found that because the language of the bylaws regarding the fair hearing plan \u201cclearly and unambiguously requires a hearing only for matters bearing on professional competency and conduct, the hospital was not required to provide [the plaintiff] with a hearing.\u201d In granting summary judgment, the court found that there existed no issue of material fact with respect to professional competence and conduct. We disagree that there are no issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The hospital bylaws provide that whenever there is an adverse recommendation, there is a right to a hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> An adverse action is defined in the bylaws as a recommendation that would adversely affect a practitioner\u2019s appointment or privileges at the hospital. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>fair hearing plan was incorporated into the bylaws of the hospital as appendix I. The fair hearing plan provides for a hearing whenever \u201ca practitioner\u2019s appointment, status, or clinical privileges\u201d are adversely affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">A subsequent section of the fair hearing plan provides that the hearing provided for in the bylaws is to \u201cresolve, on an intraprofessional basis, matters bearing on professional competence and conduct. . . .\u201d The hospital argues that since there was no dispute about the level of professional competence of the plaintiff, there was no requirement that a hearing be held, as the issues at the hearing are limited to \u201cprofessional competence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit in opposition to the motions for summary judgment, however, claims that he was released by Radiological Associates because of Goldstein\u2019s belief that he was not cooperative.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Whether the plaintiff\u2019s conduct<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was appropriate is a question of fact. It is a material fact because, if proven, it may amount to \u201cconduct\u201d that entitles the plaintiff to a healing prior to discharge. We conclude that there are material issues of fact that preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded with direction to deny the hospital\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to counts five and seven, and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\"> In addition to the hospital, the defendants are William B. Goldstein and Danbury Radiological Associates, P.C. (Radiological Associates). Goldstein and Radiological Associates filed motions for summary judgment as to the counts in the plaintiffs fifth amended complaint that were directed to them. The court granted in part the motions for summary judgment. Thus, there still are pending counts in the trial court with respect to Goldstein and Radiological Associates. The hospital is, therefore, the only defendant to this action on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\"> This contract was between Goldstein and the hospital, and there was no evidence that it has ever been assigned by Goldstein to any other entity. At some later time, Goldstein formed Danbury Radiological Associates, P.C., which was the vehicle by which he retained associates to work at the hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-4\"> Article III, \u00a7 (B), of the hospital bylaws states in relevant part,: \u201c1.

The hospital argues in its brief that \u201c[h]aving never had a contract with Danbury Hospital, [the plaintiffs] entire case depends upon his assumption of a material fact which does not appear as evidence; namely, that the term \u2018privileges' when used in any hospital\u2019s bylaws becomes a legal term of art which \u2018necessarily\u2019 imposes a right of access and use of hospital departments for physicians.\u201d It appears, therefore, that the hospital does not concede that a contract exists with the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b315-8\"> We also note that we are not deciding by implication whether an exclusive contract between Goldstein and the hospital would provide the hospital with a valid defense to the breach of contract claim brought by the plaintiff.
