On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly (1) failed to conclude that they were denied due process of law by the zoning enforcement officer and the defendant, (2) failed to sustain their appeal when the cease and desist order was illegal, unauthorized and an abuse of discretion, (3) failed to determine that the court\u2019s decision in a companion site plan case made the plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent site plan application unnecessary and moot, (4) concluded that the defendant\u2019s decision was adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>supported by the record, (5) failed to consider whether the defendant\u2019s assigned grounds for sustaining the cease and desist order were pertinent to the considerations that the defendant and the court were required to apply and (6) failed to conclude that the defendant\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary and illegal. The plaintiffs also claim that the court\u2019s decision in the companion site plan case precluded the defendant under the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judi-cata from claiming that the plaintiffs were violating the terms of the variance. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. The plaintiffs own property located at 975 Ethan Allen Highway in Ridgefield (property). The property is located in a B-2 zone in which retail uses are not permitted under the Ridgefield zoning regulations. In July, 1990, a tenant of the property at the time, Richard Amatulli, doing business as Classics of Ridgefield, obtained site plan approval to conduct a wholesale oriental rug operation on the property, a permitted use in the zone. On November 5,1990, the defendant granted Amatulli\u2019s application for a variance to conduct retail sales on the property (Amatulli variance). The defendant limited the variance with the following language: \u201cThis action permits wholesale and retail sales to be conducted from the [property], unrestricted as to type of customer or hours of operation, but restricted as to the products to be sold. Such wholesale and retail sales shall be limited to oriental rugs, fine furniture and art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In 1993, the then owners of the property, Diane Green, Alvin G. Farans and Neil Farans, applied for a variance to remove the restrictions and to allow full retail use of the property. The application was denied by the defendant on June 21, 1993, and no appeal was taken therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>On July 2, 1993, the owners, through their attorney, Melvin J. Silverman, and on behalf of their new tenant, R &amp; R Pool, filed an application for site plan approval with the Ridgefield planning director proposing the use of the property for \u201cwarehouse, office and retail sale of fine outdoor furniture.\u201d In a letter, which was part of the application, Silverman stated that the owners wanted to \u201clease the premises to a seller of fine furniture [R &amp; R Pool], albeit of the type which is used generally out of doors.\u201d By letter dated September 24, 1993, the planning director informed Silverman that the application was denied and stated three reasons for such denial: \u201c(1) The business you are planning to operate, with the merchandise you are planning to sell, is not the \u2018fine furniture\u2019 contemplated by the Zoning Board of Appeals in its decision on Nov. 5, 1990, in appeal no. 90-099 [the Amatulli variance]; (2) the business you are proposing to operate, with the merchandise you are proposing to sell, was specifically denied a variance to do so by the Zoning Board of Appeals at its June 21, 1993 meeting of appeal no. 93-014 . . . and (3) retail sales is not a permitted use in a B-2 Zone.\u201d The owners and R &amp; R Pool appealed to the defendant (site plan case), and the defendant sustained the planning director\u2019s decision by way of a memorandum of decision dated February 14, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The memorandum of decision contained several reasons for the denial. The reasons relevant to this appeal follow. \u201cThe Planning Director was correct in his determination that the proposed use for the premises was not in accordance with the variance previously granted [the Amatulli variance],</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u201cThe variance in question was granted in order to allow the use of the property for the sale of oriental rugs and fine furniture. A variance was needed because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>retail sales are not allowed in the zone in question</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u201cWhile \u2018fine furniture\u2019 was not specifically described, the variance would be read in its entirety as having an inherent unity of decision. The applicant for that variance presented his request as a unitary operation with the sale of furniture as an adjunct to the sale of oriental rugs and of the same quality as would often involve the services of an interior decorator. The appellant in the matter now before the board seeks to have the meaning of the term \u2018fine furniture\u2019 used to include mass produced, outdoor furniture, arguing that it is in fact \u2018fine furniture.\u2019 This is not the kind of product that was presented to the board when the variance was requested, and it is not the kind of product that was considered by the board when the variance was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u201cThe kinds of product that were considered were ones that, like oriental rugs, are not stock items, are made by hand, and if they do not deteriorate physically, are expected to appreciate in value with the passage of time. Outdoor furniture simply does not fit this definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">On February 24, 1994, the owners and R &amp; R Pool appealed to the Superior Court alleging that the defendant\u2019s decision was arbitrary, illegal and an abuse of discretion. The court dismissed the action for lack of standing on the ground that R &amp; R Pool was not the applicant for the site plan approval. The owners and R &amp; R Pool appealed to this court following our grant of certification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>R &amp; R Pool &amp; Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>43 Conn. App. 563, 574, 684 A.2d 1207 (1996), this court reversed the trial court as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>its determination regarding standing and remanded the case for a determination of the merits. On remand, the court, <em>Stodolink, J., </em>sustained the appeal of the owners and R &amp; R Pool.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In so doing, the court found, inter alia, that the record contained \u201cno factual evidence to support the board\u2019s conclusion that the . . . furniture is not the \u2018fine furniture\u2019 contemplated by the [Ama-tulli] variance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">During the pendency of the site plan case in Superior Court, the plaintiffs, on July 27, 1995, applied to the planning director for site plan approval for the \u201cretail and wholesale sales of oriental mgs, fine furniture and ait.\u201d An accompanying statement of proposed use explained that \u201c[t]he property will be used in accordance with the [Amatulli variance]\u201d and that the furniture to be sold would be \u201cof good quality and the higher-end products. It will be the type of quality of fine furniture which is sold in the better furniture stores in the United States. None of the furniture will be of the plastic type which is generally found in discount stores.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Pursuant to the planning director\u2019s request for clarification of the use, Raymond Ross, the attorney for the plaintiffs, by letter dated August 15, 1995, stated that \u201cR &amp; R [Pool] will have the same limited retail sales of \u2018oriental rugs, fine furniture and art\u2019 which were previously sold by [Amatulli] under the terms of the [Amatulli] variance. The furniture will be of similar kind and nature to that which was sold by [Amatulli] and falls within the terms of the variance. The products will be of the high-end quality, well styled and upscale products which were previously sold. The products will be customarily used by consumers in such rooms of a home as a den or a dining room. The sale of these furniture items are often made with the assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>an interior decorator or designer. . . . There will be no plastic furniture, no mass produced assembly line type of furniture, and no athletic equipment such as swingsets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">On August 23, 1995, the planning director issued site plan approval to the plaintiffs subject to the condition that \u201cthe limited retail sales will be exactly as permitted and described in the grant of [the Amatulli variance] and further defined in [the defendant\u2019s February 14, 1994 memorandum of decision sustaining the planning director\u2019s denial of the application for site plan approval in the site plan case].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In September, 1995, the plaintiffs began retail sales of furniture on the property. On December 29, 1995, the Ridgefield zoning enforcement officer issued a cease and desist order to the plaintiffs ordering that they remedy or discontinue (1) conducting retail sales in a B-2 zone, (2) retail sales not allowed under the Amatulli variance and (3) retail sales not presented during the site plan process and sales that specifically violate the conditions of the plaintiffs\u2019 site plan approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On January 5, 1996, the plaintiffs appealed the cease and desist order to the defendant. On April 29, 1996, after a hearing, the defendant sustained the decision of the zoning enforcement officer to issue the cease and desist order. The relevant portions of the defendant\u2019s memorandum of decision follow. \u201cThe applicant applied for Site Plan Approval for one use, and after receiving it, he put the property to another use. . . . Much has been made of the words \u2018fine furniture,\u2019 but such analysis by the applicant is based on wrenching the words from the context in which they were originally used. When the decision [on the-Amatulh variance] was made in November, 1990 . . . the phrase \u2018oriental rugs, fine furniture and art\u2019 was used because it had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>specific meaning when taken as a whole. The type of merchandise offered for sale at this location is to be hand crafted, one-of-a-kind, and expected to appreciate in value over the years. The outdoor furniture . . . offered for sale at [the property] does not meet the aforementioned criteria. . . . [T]he variance as it now exists was never intended to support the use of the property for the sale of \u2018fine furniture\u2019 as its primary use.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u201cThe sole purpose for which the property can be used at retail is the sale of \u2018oriental rugs, fine furniture and art\u2019 when such use is an adjunct to the use of the property as a wholesale location. There is no question that the property had had a number of uses over the years, but there has never been a variance in place that would allow the use of the property as a retail store when such use is not as [an] accessory and part-time use to a wholesale operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">On May 2,1996, the plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court from the decision of the defendant sustaining the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s cease and desist order. The court, <em>Stodolink, J., </em>heard the appeal contemporaneously with the appeal in the site plan case. As we have set forth, the court sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal in the site plan case. In a memorandum of decision dated on the same day as the memorandum of decision in the site plan case, the court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the defendant\u2019s decision sustaining the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s issuance of the cease and desist order.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The plaintiffs argued to the court that the defendant\u2019s decision was arbitrary and illegal in that (1) the Amatulli variance runs with the land and the defendant may not modify it, (2) the term \u201cfine furniture\u201d is vague and involves a matter of personal taste, (3) the plaintiffs were denied substantive due process because they were not informed which items were not \u201cfine furniture\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>(4) the defendant\u2019s decision does not coincide with its discussion on the matter. The court noted that the defendant cited three reasons for its decision, that its standard of review is whether the defendant\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is reasonably supported by the record and that if the record reasonably supports any of the reasons, then the court must dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s first reason, that the plaintiffs \u201capplied for site plan approval for one use, and after receiving it, [they] put the property to another use,\u201d was reasonably supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The court cited the \u201cassurance\u201d made by Ross during the application process that there would \u201cbe no plastic furniture, no mass produced assembly line type of furniture, and no athletic equipment such as swingsets\u201d sold on the property. In light of this \u201cassurance,\u201d the court also noted the presence in the record of \u201cnine photographs of chairs and other furniture that appear to be \u2018mass produced assembly line furniture.\u2019 \u201d The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s first reason was reasonably supported by the record and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. On January 13, 1999, this court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification to appeal and this appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">We begin by examining the court\u2019s decision in the site plan case to determine how it bears on the disposition of this appeal. In its memorandum of decision in the site plan case, the court noted that the defendant\u2019s fourth reason for denying the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the denial of their original site plan application was that the plaintiffs\u2019 furniture was not the \u201cfine furniture\u201d envisioned by the defendant when it had granted the Amatulli variance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In concluding that the defendant\u2019s fourth reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>was arbitrary and unreasonable, the court made the following relevant findings. \u201cThe transcript [of the hearing on the Amatulli variance] is twenty-two pages long, but \u2018fine furniture\u2019 was mentioned expressly only once. . . . Virtually all of the discussion focused on Ama-tulli\u2019s oriental rug business.\u201d \u201cThe record does not demonstrate that the [defendant] offered any definitions, or any ascertainable guidelines or standards, upon which a subsequent owner or lessor of the subject property could have reasonably relied upon when selling furniture from the property.\u201d \u201c[T]he [defendant] never defined the term \u2018fine furniture\u2019 when it granted Ama-tulli the variance. [The court finds that the defendant\u2019s] statement that the plaintiffs\u2019 furniture was not the \u2018kind of product that was presented to the [defendant] when the variance was requested, and is not the kind of product that was considered by the [defendant] when the variance was granted,\u2019 to be misleading. The record reflects that Amatulli presented nothing pertaining to furniture during his hearing, and that [the defendant] focused almost exclusively on Amatulli\u2019s oriental rugs.\u201d \u201cThe record indicates that the [defendant] relied on its own subjective beliefs in its determination that the plaintiffs\u2019 furniture did not comport with the variance.\u201d \u201c[T]he record reflects that the town\u2019s regulations do not define the term \u2018fine furniture.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We conclude that these findings and the court\u2019s conclusion make clear that the court determined that the Amatulli variance could not be construed to limit the kind of furniture sold on the property. The defendant did not appeal from the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u201cCollateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, prohibits the relitigation of an issue when that issue was actually litigated and necessarily determined in a prior action. . . . For an issue to be subject to collateral estoppel, it must have been fully and fairly litigated in the first action. It also must have been actually decided and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>decision must have been necessary to the judgment. . . . Furthermore, [t]o invoke collateral estoppel the issues sought to be litigated in the new proceeding must be identical to those considered in the prior proceeding. . . . <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Andresakis, </em>52 Conn. App. 454, 460-61, 726 A.2d 1170, cert. denied, 248 Conn. 922, 733 A.2d 845 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u201cAn issue is actually litigated if it is properly raised in the pleadings or otherwise, submitted for determination, and in fact determined. ... 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments \u00a7 27, comment (d) (1982). An issue is necessarily determined if, in the absence of a determination of the issue, the judgment could not have been validly rendered. F. James &amp; G. Hazard, Civil Procedure (3d Ed. 1985) \u00a7 11.19. If an issue has been determined, but the judgment is not dependent upon the determination of the issue, the parties may relitigate the issue in a subsequent action. Findings on nonessential issues usually have the characteristics of dicta. . . . <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>[248 Conn. 364, 374, 727 A.2d 1245 (1999)]. . . . <em>Pitchell </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>55 Conn. App. 571, 577-78, 739 A.2d 726 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">\u201cThe common-law doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, embodies a judicial policy in favor of judicial economy, the stability of former judgments and finality. . . . Collateral estoppel means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit. . . . <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Stonington Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>250 Conn. 443, 460-61, 736 A.2d 811 (1999). Collateral estoppel . . . presents a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Linden Condominium Assn., Inc. v.McKenna, </em>247 Conn. 575, 596, 726 A.2d 502 (1999) .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ancona </em>v. <em>Manafort Bros., Inc., </em>56 Conn. App. 701, 706-707, 746 A.2d 184, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 953, 749 A.2d 1202 (2000) .</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>We conclude that the court\u2019s determination with respect to the scope of the term \u201cfine furniture\u201d as it appears on the Amatulli variance is to be given preclu-sive effect in this action and, as such, directs our review of the court\u2019s contemporaneous decision concerning the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s issuance of the cease and desist order. Each of the elements of collateral estoppel is satisfied here. The issue of what constitutes \u201cfine furniture\u201d was part and parcel of both actions. The record reveals that the plaintiff and the defendant were both parties to the site plan case. The defendant had the opportunity to litigate the issue regarding \u201cfine furniture\u201d before the Superior Court, a court of competent jurisdiction, and that the court\u2019s judgment is now final. Finally, as is shown by the court\u2019s comprehensive memorandum of decision, the court\u2019s decision in the site plan case regarding the issue of \u201cfine furniture\u201d was necessary to its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The defendant\u2019s failure to appeal from the judgment in the site plan case compels the result that in this appeal, \u201cfine furniture,\u201d as it appears in the Amatulli variance, does not mean something \u201cfiner\u201d than ordinary furniture. It light of this, we turn to our review of the decision that is the subject of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u201cIn reviewing the actions of a zoning board of appeals we note that such a board is endowed with a liberal discretion, and its [actions are] subject to review by the courts only to determine whether [they were] unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal. . . . The burden of proof to demonstrate that the board acted improperly is upon the party seeking to overturn the board\u2019s decision. . . . In an appeal from the decision of a zoning board, we therefore review the record to determine whether there is factual support for the board\u2019s decision, not for the contentions of the applicant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Francini </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>228 Conn. 785, 791, 639 A.2d 519 (1994). If \u201ca zoning author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ity has stated the reasons for its actions, the reviewing court ought to examine the assigned grounds to determine whether they are reasonably supported by the record and pertinent to the considerations the authority was required to apply pursuant to the zoning regulations.\u201d <em>Beit Havurah </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>177 Conn. 440, 444-45, 418 A.2d 82 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">As the court noted, the defendant stated three reasons for sustaining the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s issuance of the cease and desist order. We will address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The defendant\u2019s first stated reason is that the plaintiffs \u201capplied for site plan approval for one use, and after receiving it, [they] put the property to another use.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 site plan application described the intended use as the \u201c[s]ame use as [the] variance granted to [Amatulli]\u201d and, further, \u201cretail and wholesale sales of oriental rugs, fine furniture and art.\u201d The planning director granted the application with four conditions, only one being relevant here, which was that \u201cthe limited retail sales will be exactly as permitted and described in the [defendant\u2019s grant of the Amatulli variance] and further defined in [the defendant\u2019s memorandum of decision in the site plan case sustaining the planning director\u2019s denial of the site plan application].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The Amatulli variance allows for the wholesale and retail sales of \u201coriental rugs, fine furniture and art.\u201d The trial court held in the site plan case that the words \u201cfine furniture,\u201d as they appear in the Amatulli variance, do not limit the kind of furniture sold on the property, and, therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 sale of furniture on the property is not in derogation of the description contained in the Amatulli variance and cannot be the basis for the cease and desist order. As to the defendant\u2019s memorandum of decision in the site plan case, the portion thereof pertaining to the scope of the phrase \u201cfine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>furniture\u201d was determined by the Superior Court to be nonlimiting as to the furniture sold. The court\u2019s decision was not challenged and has preclusive effect in this appeal. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s discussion of \u201cfine furniture\u201d in its memorandum of decision cannot be the basis for the cease and desist order here.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">After receiving the site plan application, the planning director requested that Ross clarify the use. Ross responded by letter, stating, inter alia, that \u201c[t]here will be no plastic furniture, no mass produced assembly line type of furniture and no athletic equipment such as swingsets\u201d sold on the property. This language is the gravamen of the defendant\u2019s first reason. We hold that these subsequent representations by Ross do not limit the plaintiffs\u2019 use of the property. \u201cA site plan may be modified or denied only if it fails to comply with requirements already set forth in the zoning . . . regulations.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g). General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 (b) provides in relevant part that a \u201cvariance . . . shall run with the land . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs were entitled to the rights of the Amatulli variance, the exercise of which they applied for. These rights include the retail sales of furniture. The planning director was required by law to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 application insofar as it requested the use of the property consistent with the Amatulli variance, and the postapplication language of Ross cannot limit the rights of the plaintiffs. We, therefore, cannot accept the defendant\u2019s first stated reason as having adequate support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The defendant\u2019s second reason is that the \u201ccurrent use of the property does not conform to the [Amatulli variance].\u201d As we have shown, the plaintiffs\u2019 use with respect to the retail sale of furniture does conform with the Amatulli variance as it has come to be defined, and the defendant\u2019s contrary assertion cannot find support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>The defendant\u2019s third and final stated reason attempts to define \u201cf\u00edne furniture\u201d and states that the furniture sold, for which the plaintiffs were given the cease and desist order, does not fit its definition. Again, it is the court\u2019s definition of f\u00edne furniture that guides us here and, on the basis of that definition, the plaintiffs were not acting contrary to their rights under the Amatulli variance in selling the furniture in question.
