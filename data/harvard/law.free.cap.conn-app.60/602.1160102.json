The defendant claims that (1) the court improperly admitted hearsay evidence and (2) the evidence presented was insufficient to support his conviction of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree and attempt to commit larceny in the second degree. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On Sunday, May 12, 1996, Sidney Collier, a member of the New Haven police department, was working in uniform on an extra duty security assignment at an open field flea market on Ella Grasso Boulevard in New Haven. At approximately 3:25 p.m., a vendor approached Collier and directed him to a disturbance. As Collier neared the scene, he observed the victim, Tywan Grier, on the ground. The victim was on his back with his hands, palms up, beside his head. The defendant was kneeling over him, holding a chrome gun in his right hand, pointed about twelve inches from the victim\u2019s face. Collier saw the defendant pat the victim\u2019s front pants pockets and attempt to put his hand in those pockets. As Collier drew his service weapon, the defendant got up and ran. Collier pursued the defendant for more than one block before subduing him. The defendant still possessed the handgun, which was capable of being fired and had a live round of ammunition in its chamber. The defendant also had a gold chain with a medallion and two separate bundles of money. The victim, who was still very nervous, arrived at the scene of the arrest. At that time, he identified the gold chain with the medallion as being his property. The victim\u2019s identification of his property took place within two to three and one-half minutes after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The defendant claims that the court violated his fundamental right to a fair trial under both the confronta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>tion and due process clauses of the United States and Connecticut constitutions. He claims violations of the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He claims that the court improperly admitted Collier\u2019s testimony as to the victim\u2019s identification of his property under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule. He argues that since the victim was available to testify and the state failed to call him, Collier\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted under the spontaneous utterance exception. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Because the admissibility of evidence under a well established exception to the hearsay rule is not a constitutional issue, as the defendant presents it, we will analyze it as an evidentiary issue. \u201cOur standard of review regarding challenges to atrial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is that these rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>50 Conn. App. 312, 330-31, 718 A.2d 457 (1998), aff'd, 254 Conn. 88, 755 A.2d 202 (2000). \u201cIt is a well established principle of law that the trial court may exercise its discretion with regard to evidentiary rulings, and the trial court\u2019s rulings will not be disturbed on appellate review absent abuse of that discretion. . . . Sound discretion, by definition, means a discretion that is not exercised arbitrarily or wilfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law .... And [it] requires a knowledge and understanding of the material circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>surrounding the matter .... In our review of these discretionary determinations, we make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Hutt, </em>50 Conn. App. 439, 445, 718 A.2d 969, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 939, 723 A.2d 320 (1998). \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him. <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Karp, </em>243 Conn. 495, 506, 706 A.2d 1 (1998).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Hutt, </em>supra, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim fails for two reasons. We conclude that the court properly admitted the evidence, but even if we assume arguendo that the evidence was improper, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Connecticut recognizes the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Haritos, </em>100 Conn. 476, 124 A. 44 (1924). A court may allow into evidence otherwise inadmissible statements to prove the truth of the matter asserted, if \u201c(1) the declaration follows some startling occurrence, (2) the declaration refers to the occurrence, (3) the declarant observed the occurrence, and (4) the declaration is made under circumstances that negate the opportunity for delibera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>tion and fabrication by the declarant. . . . The overarching consideration governing these requirements is whether the statements were made before reasoned reflection had taken place.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>58 Conn. App. 524, 530, 754 A.2d 200 (2000). \u201cThe excited utterance exception rests on the view that such assertions, made in reaction to a startling event, are trustworthy and void of self-interest.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>46 Conn. App. 131, 141, 698 A.2d 908 (1997). The time that transpired between the occurrence and the statement is merely a factor to be weighed along with any other material facts in the circumstances surrounding the statement in determining whether it was spontaneous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stange, </em>212 Conn. 612, 618, 563 A.2d 681 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In the present case, the victim uttered the challenged statement concerning the ownership of the item found in the defendant\u2019s possession while the victim was still under the stress of just having had a gun pointed at his head as he lay on the ground during an attempt to commit robbery. The statement was made within a few minutes of that \u201cstartling event.\u201d It would have been reasonable for the court to conclude that the trauma sustained by the victim occurred under circumstances that sufficiently negated the opportunity for deliberation and fabrication. We therefore conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statement into evidence under the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">We also conclude that even if the statement should not have been admitted into evidence, its admission was nonetheless harmless under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Admission of a statement that is either irrelevant or impermissible hearsay is not a constitutional error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>250 Conn. 611, 662, 737 A.2d 404 (1999), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>529 U.S. 1060, 120 S. Ct. 1568, 146 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2000). The court made an evidentiary ruling, not constitutional in nature, which requires the defendant on appeal to establish harmfulness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>55 Conn. App. 706, 710, 740 A.2d 450 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 920, 744 A.2d 438, cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1136, 120 S. Ct. 2019, 146 L. Ed. 2d 966 (2000). The defendant must show that it is more probable than not that the court\u2019s ruling affected the result of the trial; see <em>State </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>242 Conn. 318, 329, 699 A.2d 911 (1997); or that the prejudice resulting from the impropriety was so substantial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict. <em>See State v. Askew, </em>245 Conn. 351, 371-72, 716 A.2d 36 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The defendant was acquitted of the charges of robbery in the first degree and larceny in the second degree. He was convicted of the crimes of attempt to commit robbery and attempt to commit larceny. The state was not required, under either of the attempt charges, to prove that the defendant actually took the chain from the victim. Consequently, the victim\u2019s statement was irrelevant to the defendant\u2019s conviction of those charges and, therefore, he suffered no harm because of the statement\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The defendant next claims that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element of the crimes of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree and attempt to commit larceny in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">\u201cWhen reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims, we employ a two part analysis. First, we construe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>226 Conn. 20, 31, 627 A.2d 862 (1993). Second, we determine whether, from that evidence and all the reasonable inferences which it yields, a [trier of fact] could reasonably have concluded that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>30 Conn. App. 232, 238, 619 A.2d 1151, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 915, 623 A.2d 1025 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>supra, 31.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>50 Conn. App. 591, 604, 718 A.2d 497, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 939, 723 A.2d 319 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1058, 119 S. Ct. 1373, 143 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\u201c \u2018[ I]n viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, the jury is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with innocence.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 646 A.2d 169 (1994). \u2018On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u2019 Id., 134.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>50 Conn. App. 467, 473, 718 A.2d 985, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 942, 723 A.2d 319 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The defendant in his principal brief argues that \u201c[n]o evidence introduced at trial established that the conduct between Grier and the defendant constituted attempt to commit robbery and attempt to commit larceny.\u201d He claims that the victim\u2019s statement was insufficient to prove the elements of the crimes, and that \u201c[t]he state failed to use its key material witness in this case\u201d so that the \u201ccircumstances surrounding the event\u201d could never be tested by cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The jury reasonably could have found, on the basis of the evidence presented and the reasonable inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>drawn therefrom, that the defendant, while holding the victim on the ground, pointed a loaded handgun at the victim\u2019s head and attempted to take property from the victim\u2019s front pockets. Collier\u2019s testimony, which was based on his observations, was sufficient to establish the necessary elements of the crimes without the need of the victim\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Caballero, </em>49 Conn. App. 486, 492-93, 714 A.2d 1254, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 924, 719 A.2d 1170 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\"> The record discloses that the name Richard Lomax is an alias and that the defendant\u2019s name is McMillian Wright.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ...
