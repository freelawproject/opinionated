LARSON, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">On January 15, 2009, Plaintiffs Standard Drywall, Inc. (\u201cSDI\u201d), the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters (\u201cthe Regional Council\u201d), and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (\u201cthe UBC\u201d) (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) filed this action against the Operative Plasterers\u2019 and Cement Masons\u2019 International Association, Local 200, AFL-CIO (\u201cLocal 200\u201d) and Operative Plasterers\u2019 and Cement Masons\u2019 International Association of the United States and Canada, AFL-CIO (\u201cOPCMIA\u201d). A First Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) was subsequently filed on January 29, 2009. The FAC seeks to vacate the January 22, 2009, award (\u201cthe arbitration award\u201d) of arbitrator Paul Greenberg, rendered under the AFL-CIO Plan for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes in the Construction Industry (\u201cthe Plan\u201d). FAC1F1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">On March 5, 2009, Defendants filed a counterclaim seeking confirmation and enforcement of the arbitration award. On April 2, 2009, Defendants filed the instant motion seeking a stay of the instant proceedings pending the resolution of unfair labor practice proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board (\u201cNLRB\u201d) and subsequent review by any federal appellate courts. On April 21, 2009, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, which is currently set for hearing on June 8, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">The Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without oral argument, L.R. 7-15, and DENIES the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-10\">The parties are involved in a jurisdictional dispute over certain plastering work SDI is performing and scheduled to perform on two public works projects for the Los Angeles Unified School District (\u201cthe projects\u201d). FAC \u00b6 12. The work has been and currently is being performed by SDI\u2019s Regional Council-represented employees on both projects. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 14, 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-11\">A. Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-12\">In 2006, Local 200, SDI, and the Regional Council were involved in a NLRB Section 10(k) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(k)) proceeding, adjudicating a jurisdictional dispute between the Regional Council and Local 200 regarding plastering work performed on certain public works projects in Southern California. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. The NLRB ruled that the Regional Council-represented employees were entitled to perform the work. FAC \u00b6 17, discussing <em>Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters (Standard Drywall, Inc.), </em>Case No. 21-CD-658, 348 N.L.R.B. 1250 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-13\">In January 2009, Local 200, through OPCMIA, commenced arbitral proceedings under the Plan against UBC and SDI, seeking a reassignment of plastering work on the projects from the Regional Council represented employees to Local 200-rep-resented employees. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 22, 25. SDI and UBC objected to the proceedings, and alleged and continue to allege they are not parties to any agreements that required them to submit the dispute to the Plan. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-14\">On January 22, after hearing the dispute, arbitrator Greenberg ordered that SDI assign the plastering work on the projects to workers represented by OPC-MIA. FAC \u00b6 27; Attachment A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-15\">Plaintiffs argue that the arbitration award is \u201cnull and void, unenforceable, illegal and violates public policy.\u201d FAC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>\u00b6 30. First, Plaintiffs dispute the authority of the arbitrator, as they claim they were under no obligation to submit the dispute to the Plan. Second, Plaintiffs argue the arbitration award is conflict with the NLRB\u2019s 2006 decision, and thus unenforceable and preempted by the supremacy doctrine applicable to NLRB section 10(k) awards and the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Plaintiffs argue that preclude enforcement of the arbitration award, as it is preempted by federal law. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30. They also argue the arbitration award undermines the finality of the NLRB\u2019s determination. FAC \u00b6 29. Third, Plaintiffs argue the arbitrator exceeded his powers by failing to provide the Regional Council-represented employees with adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard before determining their rights. FAC \u00b6 30. Accordingly, Plaintiffs request the Court vacate the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">B. Defendants\u2019 Counterclaim</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-6\">Defendants argue that the projects are generally subject to the LAUSD Project Stabilization Agreement (\u201cPSA\u201d), a master project labor agreement negotiated between LAUSD and the Los Ange-les/Orange County Building and Construction Trades Council (\u201cBuilding and Construction Trades Council\u201d) and signatory unions. Counter-Cl. \u00b6 8. As signatories to the PSA, Defendants argue that Local 200 and the Regional Council are both subject to its terms, including Section 8.2, which requires all jurisdictional disputes between unions party to the PSA be resolved in accordance with the Plan. Counter-Cl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18-19. Defendants also contend that SDI is subject to the terms of the PSA, including Section 8.1, which requires contractors bound by the PSA to make work assignments in accordance with the Plan, as it submitted Letters of Assent in association with the projects at issue. Counter-Cl. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">Defendants allege the Arbitrator\u2019s decision was based on a correct interpretation of the PSA, the Plan, and the Letters of Assent. Counter-Cl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-28. They note that neither UBC nor SDI have appealed the arbitration in accordance with the procedures specified in the Plan. Counter-Cl. \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-8\">Defendants seek confirmation of the arbitration award and enforcement of its terms, by ordering an accounting of all hours of work covered by the award, that all out-of-work Local 200 employees in the relevant time period \u201cbe made whole\u201d, and all attorney fees, costs, and expenses incurred in this suit be reimbursed. Counter-Cl. \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-9\">C. The Pending NLRB Proceedings and the Earlier Preliminary Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-10\">The 2006 NLRB decision explicitly refused to determine whether the parties before it were bound by the PSA. 348 NLRB at 1253. That decision is now under review as part of the NLRB\u2019s determination of unfair labor practice (\u201cULP\u201d) charges brought by SDI against OPCMIA and Local 200, alleging a violation of Section 8(b)(4)(ii)(D) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4)(ii)(D). NLRB Case Nos. 21-CD-659, 21-CD-660, 21-CD-661 and 21-CD-673 (\u201cThe 2008 NLRB cases\u201d). Those ULP proceedings were the subject of a September 30, 2008, order of this Court in <em>Small v. Operative Plasterers &amp; Cement Masons Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, Local 200 AFL-CIO, </em>No. 08-CV-01039-SGL (Dkt. Nos. 27, 33). In that case, the Court granted a preliminary injunction under Section 10(i) of the NLRA at the request of the Regional Director of the NLRB, enjoining Local 200 from pursuing certain California state lawsuits that had the potential to conflict with the 2006 NLRB decision. That injunction was subsequently modified by the Court on November 17, 2008. <em>(Small </em>Dkt. No. 54.) The initial injunction was affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>and the modifications reversed by the Ninth Circuit on March 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">On February 27, 2009, Defendants\u2019 counsel informed Plaintiffs that they intended to seek a stay of the instant action to preserve the status quo pending the NLRB\u2019s resolution of the 2008 NLRB cases and any subsequent appellate review. More Decl. \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">The parties agree that the arbitration award will not be enforceable if the 2006 NLRB 10(k) award is upheld by the NLRB and/or any reviewing court of appeals. Opp\u2019n at 7; Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Stay (\u201cDefs. Mem.\u201d) at 20. <em>See also Sea-Land Service, Inc., (Pac. Div.) v. Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Locals 13, 63, &amp; 94, </em>939 F.2d 866, 872-73 (9th Cir.1991). They dispute, however, whether the NLRB\u2019s 2006 10(k) award alone has this effect, or whether the 10(k) award is only enforceable in a final order, to which Defendants have the opportunity to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">Defendants argue that they are entitled to judicial review of the NLRB\u2019s 10(k) decision, and that enforcing the 2006 Order, and thus vacating the arbitration award, at this point would deprive them of that right. Plaintiffs oppose a stay largely because of Defendants\u2019 position that SDI would potentially continue to accrue damages for non-compliance with the arbitration award while the action was stayed, and Defendants\u2019 indication that they intend to continue to pursue other complaints under the Plan against SDI even if the action is stayed. Opp\u2019n at 2; Bennett Deck \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">The relationship between a 10(k) award and a board ruling on the underlying unfair labor practice has been explained by the Ninth Circuit as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-9\">Unfair labor practice charges brought under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) of the Act are handled in a way quite different from all other charges that may be brought under the Act.... When a charge is brought under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D), the Regional Director conducts an investigation and, if appropriate, issues a notice of hearing. The hearing is to be within 10 days of the initial filing of charges. If the parties fail to reach a voluntary resolution of the dispute, a non-adversary hearing is held. The purpose of this hearing is simply to assemble a full record of the relevant facts. The hearing officer makes no recommendation as to resolution of the dispute. The record thus assembled is transmitted to the Board, which either \u201cdetermines the dispute\u201d by issuing a \u00a7 10(k) award-an assignment of the disputed work to one of the contending unions-or ends the proceedings by determining that no jurisdictional dispute exists within the meaning of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D).... In the event that the Board determines that a jurisdictional dispute does exist, and makes a work award under \u00a7 10(k), the pressure on the parties to settle the dispute intensifies. If they comply with the work award, the Board dismisses the charges. If the losing union refuses to comply (by continuing to strike or threaten to strike), the Board issues a complaint and the prosecution of the \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D) charge goes forward against that union. A final Board decision on that complaint is then appealable under \u00a7 10(f) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1152-12\"><em>Foley-Wismer &amp; Becker v. NLRB, </em>682 F.2d 770, 772 (9th Cir.1982) (en banc). The Supreme Court has held that a 10(k) decision is not a final disposition, in that \u201cThe Board does not order anybody to do anything at the conclusion of a \u00a7 10(k) proceeding.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp., Communications Equip. &amp; Sys. Div. v. Local 134, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, AFL-CIO, </em>419 U.S. 428, 443, 95 S.Ct. 600, 42 L.Ed.2d 558 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>There is little case law addressing the issue of whether a stay is appropriate in a case such as this one. It is clear that a court is to stay proceedings to compel, vacate, or enforce the results of arbitration while 10(k) proceedings are pending. In <em>Sheet Metal Workers Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, Local Union No. 36 v. Murphy Construction Co., </em>191 F.3d 909, 910-911 (8th Cir.1999), the Eighth Circuit held that a motion to compel arbitration should be stayed while 10(k) proceedings are under way. The court noted, \u201cGiven that the district court will be unable to enforce the arbitration award to Local 36 in the face of a contrary NLRB decision, we conclude in this instance that \u2018Appropriate deference to the jurisdiction and expertise of the [NLRB] ... requirefd] a stay of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 911, <em>quoting Northern Calif. Dish Council of Hod Carriers, Bldg. &amp; Constr. Laborers v. Opinski, </em>673 F.2d 1074, 1075 (9th Cir.1982). In <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. (Pacific Div.) v. Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union Locals 13, 63, &amp; 94, </em>939 F.2d 866, 868 (9th Cir.1991), the district court had stayed an action to vacate an arbitration award pending the results of a 10(k) proceeding. <em>See also Altounian Builders Inc. v. Int\u2019l Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craft Workers, Local No. 20, AFL-CIO, </em>228 F.Supp.2d 915, 917 (N.D.Ill.2002) (granting stay of proceedings to enforce arbitration award pending 10(k) proceedings, noting it \u201cis correct that a stay is not required in these circumstances. However, in order to avoid needless backtracking or wasteful discovery, it is advisable.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">But once the 10(k) proceedings have been completed, even though the 10(k) award is not an appealable final disposition, several cases unanimously suggest it is that award, not any subsequent final 8(b)(4)(D) decision, that trumps a contrary arbitral decision. This issue was explicitly addressed by the Sixth Circuit in <em>Int\u2019l Union, United Auto., Aerospace &amp; Ag. Implement Workers (UAW) v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>619 F.2d 580 (6th Cir.1980). There, the court affirmed a district court determination \u201cthat the \u00a7 10(k) determination must be treated as final for the purpose of establishing its precedence over the arbitrator\u2019s award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582. The court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-7\">Any other conclusion would lead to the anomalous result of allowing the losing party in the 10(k) proceeding to prevent the employer from reaping the full benefit of that proceeding, since review of the 10(k) decision can be had only if the losing union commits an unfair labor practice an event entirely within the control of the losing union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-8\">619 F.2d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-9\">This holding was explicitly adopted by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Advance Cast Stone Co. v. Bridge, Structural &amp; Reinforcing Iron Local Union No. 1, </em>376 F.3d 734, 740 n. 5 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201cAlthough a \u00a7 10(k) decision is not a final determination that the union violated \u00a7 8(b)(4)(D), it certainly is controlling for purposes of deciding its effect on and relationship to an arbitrator\u2019s award.... \u201d). <em>See also Building Trades Employers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Marchell, </em>No. 08 Civ. 4564, 2008 WL 2421634 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 13, 2008) (\u201cthe fact that [in the 10(k) proceeding itself] the NLRB will not issue a formal order granting the work to Local 1 or Local 3 is of little moment.\u201d); <em>Holt Cargo Systems, Inc. v. Local 1242, Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>No. CIV.A. 84-5831, 1986 WL 6743, at *2 (E.D.Pa. June 13, 1986) (adopting <em>Rockwell </em>and holding that lack of final order following 10(k) award was not bar to entering summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">\u201cThe decision whether to stay court proceedings pending a decision by the NLRB is committed to the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Sheet Metal Workers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number><em>Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, Local No. 162 v. Jason Mfg., Inc., </em>900 F.2d 1392, 1400 (9th Cir.1990). Since the authorities are unanimous that it is the 10(k) award itself, not subsequent appealable unfair labor practice decisions, that have preclusive effects on the enforcement of contrary arbitral awards, a stay here is inappropriate. Accordingly, the motion to stay is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
