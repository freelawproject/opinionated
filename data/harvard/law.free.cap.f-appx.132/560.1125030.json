The district court denied certain sentencing enhancements urged by the government, including a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Q1.2 enhancement based on the emission of asbestos into the environment and a \u00a7 3B1.2 enhancement for Ho\u2019s status as a leader or organizer of activity involving five or more persons or that was otherwise extensive. The district court sentenced Ho to two months of community confinement and six months of home confinement, and declined to rule on Ho\u2019s motion for downward departure because Ho\u2019s ultimate sentence did not include imprisonment. We affirmed the conviction but reversed and remanded for resentencing, holding that the government had carried its burden of proof on the \u00a7 2Q1.2 enhancement and that the district court had erred in its interpretation of the term \u201cotherwise extensive.\u201d <em>United States v. Ho, </em>311 F.3d 589, 610-11 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">On remand, Ho renewed his motion for downward departure. The district court stated that, although it believed a departure was warranted, it was without authority to grant one because it was limited on remand to the issues decided by this court\u2019s mandate in the first appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-15\">The district court erred in concluding that it did not have the authority to reconsider Ho\u2019s motion for downward departure on remand. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 321 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we vacate Ho\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>87 F.3d 121, 125 (5th Cir.1996). We express no opinion regarding the merits of Ho\u2019s motion for downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-16\">We deny Ho\u2019s motion to remand as moot. Because we have decided this matter based on the downward departure issue, we do not reach Ho\u2019s additional claim that his sentence is invalid in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-18\">VACATED AND REMANDED; MOTION TO REMAND DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
