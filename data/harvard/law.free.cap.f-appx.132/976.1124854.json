Ramos pled guilty to the charges pursuant to a bargained-for plea agreement. Counsel for Ramos has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, after careful review of the record, he cannot raise any meritorious issues and that the appeal is wholly frivolous. We are satisfied that counsel has fulfilled his <em>Anders </em>obligations, and we agree that the appeal is frivolous. We therefore grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Ramos is precluded from bringing an appeal due to a waiver contained in his plea agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Ramos agreed to waive all direct appeals except in the case that his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum or the sentencing judge erroneously departed upward from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range. The sentencing court reviewed this provision with Ramos thoroughly during the Rule 11 colloquy. \u2018Waivers of appeals, if entered into knowingly and voluntarily, are valid, unless they work a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 563 (3d Cir.2001). Ramos\u2019 only argument for why the waiver of appeal should not be enforced is that the scope and value of his assistance to Federal prosecutors warranted a further downward departure, and therefore to uphold the sentence without review would work a miscarriage of justice. Insofar as this argument fails to present a non-frivolous claim on the merits, it does not provide grounds for avoiding the waiver of appeal. <em>See United States v. Parker, </em>902 F.2d 221, 222 (3d Cir.1990) (\u201cThe circumstances in which a defendant may appeal a sentence ... do not include situations in which a defendant is seeking an enhanced downward departure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">Ramos also contends that he is entitled to resentencing as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Our court has joined four other courts of appeals in holding that \u201cwhere a criminal defendant has voluntarily and knowingly entered into a plea agreement in which he or she waives the right to appeal, the defendant is not entitled to resentencing in light of <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Lockett, </em>406 F.3d 207, 214 (3d Cir.2005). Ramos agreed to a sentence governed by the <em>pre-Booker </em>sentencing regime, and is not entitled to the benefit of subsequent favorable legal developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence. Defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
