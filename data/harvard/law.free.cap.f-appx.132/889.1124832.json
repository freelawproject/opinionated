In her petition, Zhang argues that (1) the IJ erred in not crediting Zhang\u2019s claims that she had been compelled to undergo an abortion and threatened with forcible insertion of an IUD device; and (2) the IJ made various errors in holding against Zhang her failure to produce corroborating documents and testimony by her husband in support of her claim. Familiarity with the facts and procedural history is assumed. We deny Zhang\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Where the BIA has adopted the reasoning of the IJ or affirmed without opinion, we may review the IJ opinion directly. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the IJ\u2019s factual findings regarding eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>See Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir. 2004). Under this standard, such findings are \u201c \u2018conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>at 73 n. 7 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), and noting that the statute codifies the substantial evidence standard of review). We accord \u201cparticular deference\u201d to the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">In concluding that Zhang was not credible, the IJ pointed to Zhang\u2019s failure to produce an abortion certificate, fine receipt, hospital records, or any reliable documentary evidence tending to show that she had in fact received an abortion or had been otherwise persecuted under China\u2019s family planning laws. It was well within the IJ\u2019s discretion to determine, based on her observation of Zhang\u2019s demeanor during testimony, the lack of persuasive corroborating evidence, and the IJ\u2019s own experience adjudicating similar claims, that Zhang had not sufficiently proven her claim of persecution or given convincing reasons for her failure to produce corroborating documents. Regardless of the circumstances surrounding the asylum claim of Zhang\u2019s husband and his failure to appear at Zhang\u2019s hearing, it is clear from the IJ\u2019s decision that she discredited Zhang\u2019s testimony \u201cin and of itself,\u201d and that her decision to do so was adequately substantiated by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">We have carefully considered Zhang\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED and the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
