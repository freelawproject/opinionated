Because Appellants have failed to demonstrate their entitlement to intervene as of right or permissively under Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial and DISMISS the appeal.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b540-21\">The entire history of this case is set forth at length by the district court and need not be repeated here. <em>See Graham v. Evangeline Parish School Bd., </em>223 F.R.D. 407, 410-32 (W.D.La.2004). In sum, from the inception of the case in 1965 until well into the 1990s, Evangeline Parish complied unenthusiastically and half-heartedly with federal desegregation decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-22\">In September 1996, the case was assigned to Judge Tucker L. Melancon, who began a series of meetings with the parties regarding persisting compliance problems cited in Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>reports. Joint consent decrees were entered in 1997 and 1998. By May 2001, the Government requested a status conference to resolve the parties\u2019 contentious and strained relations. With the permission of the School Board, its Acting Superintendent, the school district\u2019s central office staff, the school district\u2019s fourteen principals, and the United States, the district court began conducting individual meetings with the parties and with individual School Board members regarding compliance issues. Another joint superseding consent decree followed, mandating, inter alia: (1) racial diversification of the school district\u2019s supervisory personnel; (2) affirmative action-based faculty hiring and assignment; (3) increased school desegregation; (4) attendance zone modifications; (5) restrained transfer requirements; (6) semiannual reports; (7) quarterly meetings; (8) amelioration of disparate facilities and resource distribution; (9) establishment of a biracial committee to act in furtherance of unitary status; and (10) development of a constitutionally compliant desegregation plan by the Superintendent, his appointed committee, the DOJ, and existing parties. It seems, from the court\u2019s own account, that many of the provisions of the 2001 decree were included at its \u201cinsist[enee],\u201d and under the threat of even greater superintendence by the court. <em>See Graham, </em>223 F.R.D. at 429 (alluding to the decision of another federal judge, years earlier, to significantly reduce the number of schools within a neighboring parish several weeks before the school term).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">At an open school board meeting in February 2003, a school district representative publicly disclosed that a compliance plan was in development. In May 2003, James K. Guillory and others founded an Evangeline Parish chapter of the National Association for Neighborhood Schools (\u201cNANS\u201d). NANS\u2019s stated mission was to end race-based and socioeconomic-based school assignments and restore the neighborhood school concept. In late 2003, the members of NANS became aware that the Superintendent was drafting a desegregation plan. On September 18, 2003, NANS, in coordination with the named Appellants (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d), filed a motion to intervene in this case. The United States opposed Appellants\u2019 motion, while the School Board did not take a position other than to maintain that it could adequately represent the interests of the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">When Appellants served the school district with public information requests, pursuant to Louisiana Rev. Stat. \u00a7 44:1, <em>et seq., </em>for information related to the development of the plan, they were refused. Sometime after issuing the 2001 decree, the district court had instituted a \u201cgag order\u201d that precluded the school administrators who were formulating the reorganization plan from publicly disclosing any information about the plan before its presentation to the School Board. This order was the basis for the denial of Appellants\u2019 requests. The administrators were even forbidden to discuss the plan with School Board members. After receiving information that a member of the committee was leaking information about the consolidation plan, the district court conducted an on-the-record meeting with each administrator individually to address the leak and reiterate the seriousness and consequences of breaching the gag order. The district court invoked the possibility of perjury if false statements were made during the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In late 2003, the committee of school administrators completed a draft compliance plan, which called for consolidation and reorganization of the school district (\u201cconsolidation plan\u201d or \u201cplan\u201d), which serves approximately 6,300 students. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>consolidation plan involves, at the high school level, the closure of three of the seven district schools, re-zoning of the four remaining schools, creation of a visual and performing arts academy at Pine Prairie High, and creation of a medical science regents program at Ville Platte High. The plan\u2019s consolidation and re-zoning measures are intended to address facility and resource distribution problems, and broaden the curricular and extra-curricular opportunities available to the Parish\u2019s student population. The consolidation plan would result in only slight changes in the racial composition of the four remaining high schools, while diversity at the remaining schools would be enhanced through strategically located arts and regents programs. The consolidation plan is also designed to maintain the \u201ccultural integrity\u201d of the Parish\u2019s neighborhoods and the ability of most students to attend a school within a reasonable distance from their homes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In January 2004, the DOJ and <em>Graham </em>plaintiffs approved the plan, and the Superintendent submitted the plan to the School Board. In less than two weeks, the School Board conducted six public meetings to introduce the consolidation plan to the community and invite public comment. Certain of the Appellants and members of NANS attended each meeting. In February, the School Board rejected the plan by a vote of seven-to-six. By order, the district court asked the United States (as well as the other parties) to submit another reorganization plan in a short period of time. Before that could occur, the School Board voted, eight-to-five, in favor of the proposed plan. Two Board members, Bobby W. Deshotel and John D. Landreneau, changed their votes from \u201cno\u201d to \u201cyes.\u201d The School Board moved the district court for authorization to implement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>the plan in time for the 2004-05 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">At hearings conducted on March 15 and 16, 2004, the district court considered Appellants\u2019 motion to intervene. On March 25, 2004, the district court authorized implementation of the consolidation plan,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the next day denied Appellants\u2019 motion to intervene. Appellants timely noticed their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW AND JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 24(a)(2) (intervention as of right) motion, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Saldano v. Roach, </em>368 F.3d 545, 550 (5th Cir.2004). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 24(b) (permissive intervention) motion for clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Tex. E. Transmission Corp., </em>923 F.2d 410, 416 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">We have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to intervene as of right. Our appellate jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s denial of permissive intervention <em>Trans Chem. Ltd. v. China Nat\u2019l Mach. Import and Export Corp., </em>332 F.3d 815, 821 (5th Cir.2003)(citing <em>Edwards v. City of Houston, </em>78 F.3d 983, 992 (5th cir.1996)), is provisional. <em>Id. </em>at 821-22. If we affirm the district court, we must dismiss this case for want of jurisdiction because proper denial of a motion for permissive intervention does not constitute a final, appealable decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">1. <em>Rule 24(a)(2) </em>\u2014 Intervention <em>as of Right</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">Pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2), a movant may intervene as of right when: (1) the motion to intervene is timely; (2) the movant has an interest related to the transaction that forms the basis of the controversy in the case; (3) the disposition of the case has the potential to impair or impede the movant\u2019s ability to protect its interest; and (4) the existing parties do not adequately represent the movant\u2019s interest. <em>Saldano, </em>363 F.3d at 551 (citing <em>Doe v. Glickman, </em>256 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2001)). In the absence of any of these elements, intervention as of right must be denied. <em>United States v. Franklin Parish Sch. Bd., </em>47 F.3d 755, 758 (5th Cir.1995). This Circuit has held that an \u201cinterest\u201d for Rule 24(a)(2) purposes must be \u201cdirect, substantial, [and] legally protectable ...[,] one which the substantive law recognizes as belonging to or being owned by the applicant.\u201d <em>Saldano, </em>363 F.3d at 551 (internal citations omitted). As to the fourth prong, an intervenor need only show that \u201cthe representation of his interest by the existing parties \u2018may be\u2019 inadequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Appellants\u2019 motion to intervene as of right. Appellants have failed to present a legally cognizable interest that would be impeded or impaired by the consolidation plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to their pleadings, Appellants seek intervention in order to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-16\">oppose[ ][ ] the \u201cconsolidation\u201d of schools, the mandatory assignment of students ... because of their race, ... and [] the use of tax monies for that purpose when ... such action is unnecessary and may be ... in violation of the equal protection, due process and other rights of applicants and their children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-17\">preserve the rights of parents to enroll their children in ... the public school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>nearest their home and to preserve the identity and traditions of their local communities, neighborhoods, towns and villages \u2014 the heart of which is the public school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">establish that the Evangeline Parish School system is in law and in fact unitary (or at the very least, partially unitary) and that the school system is entitled to be released from ... court supervision....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The district court correctly held that \u201c[a]n interest in maintaining local community schools, without a showing that consolidation would hamper the avowed goal of eliminating the vestiges of past discrimination, fails to constitute a legally cognizable interest in a school desegregation case.\u201d <em>See Graham, </em>223 F.R.D. at 432 (citing <em>Perry, </em>567 F.2d at 279-80) (concerns about school location are \u201cunrelated to desegregation and the establishment of a unitary school system\u201d for purposes of intervention); <em>see also Franklin Parish, </em>47 F.3d at 757, n. 1 (noting that the parent group \u201csensibly abandoned its challenge to ... the school board\u2019s determination of the number and location of schools in the parish\u201d). Appellants\u2019 neighborhood school interest, while vital to them and their children personally, is not legally cognizable for Rule 24(a)(2) purposes. As in <em>Perry, </em>the instant Appellants do not challenge the plan as a deficient implementation of the standing desegregation orders and 2001 decree. Rather, they challenge it as an undesirable and unnecessary commitment of resources, given their view, discussed <em>infra, </em>that the school system is unitary. However, Appellants\u2019 policy views of a school board-approved plan are insufficient to establish interest. <em>Perry, </em>567 F.2d at 279-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Next, Appellants have failed to show that the pending consolidation plan is an impediment to any of their other asserted interests. Contrary to Appellees\u2019 contention, Appellants <em>do </em>have a legally cognizable \u201cinterest in a desegregated school system,\u201d which necessarily encompasses their specifically asserted interest in unitary status. <em>Perry, </em>567 F.2d at 279. Thus, although Appellants do not have a right to intervene to challenge school board policy, they may have a basis to challenge the proposed plan that adversely affects achievement of unitary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Appellants contend that any further court-ordered plans are constitutionally impermissible because the district is in fact desegregated and should be declared unitary. Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Franklin Parish, swpra, </em>Appellants here assert present \u201cinjury\u201d from court-ordered racial assignments of students pursuant to the reorganization plan. But their assertion overlooks the history of the case, which, until the close of the last century, exhibited the Parish\u2019s insouciance, at best, toward desegregation orders. <em>See also Davis, </em>721 F.2d at 1441 (rejecting intervention where \u201cthe parents are not seeking to challenge deficiencies in the implementation of desegregation orders .... [but] oppose such implementation\u201d). Moreover, the consolidation barely affects existing racial balances in the remaining schools, <em>see </em>n. 1 <em>supra, </em>but seeks to encourage further voluntary desegregation with magnet programs. Appellants have not shown how attending a school (Ville Platte High) with a pre-consolidated population of 692 students and a 27%/73% ratio of white to black students is more constitutionally suspect than attending the post-consolidated Ville Platte High, with 904 students and a 29%/70% white to black racial makeup.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Because we have concluded that Appellants\u2019 interests are legally insufficient under Rule 24(a)(2), we need not dwell on whether the existing parties adequately represented Appellants\u2019 interests. Were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>we to do so, the record would be clouded by the district court\u2019s heavy-handed case management style. This aspect of the case is not controlled by <em>Franklin Parish, </em>where would-be intervenors offered \u201cno evidence\u201d that the school board was not representative of its constituency or had a motivation or interest different from that of appellants. 47 F.3d at 758. We do not denigrate the School Board. Appellants testified repeatedly, however, and without objection or substantial contradiction, that the Board members to whom they spoke <em>(i.e., </em>most of the members) voiced serious doubts about the reorganization plan but felt compelled to vote for it out of concern that failure to pass the plan would evoke, as the district judge warned, a much more radical plan from the DOJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">It might not be unreasonable for laymen to believe that the Board Members\u2019 concern about further court proceedings led to a temptation to subservience before the court and perhaps even the forfeiture of their independent judgment of the best direction for the Parish\u2019s schools. The recent case history supports that concern. The court ordered the reorganization plan to be formulated by a select group of school administrators, while the Board members were not allowed to participate. A strict gag order cloaked the plan in secrecy. Negotiations among the committee, the DOJ, and the <em>Graham </em>plaintiffs led to those groups\u2019 agreement on the plan before the Board was allowed to see it. The Board was put on the spot by being required to publicize and consider the plan, which took seven months to formulate, in less than one month. The district judge spoke personally to the two critical Board members between the time of their first negative votes and their later affirmative votes for the plan. At the intervention hearing, the judge questioned those two Board members at some length to explain the non-nefarious circumstances of the calls.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The tone and length of the court\u2019s opinion on this intervention order, and the candid recitation of the court\u2019s repeated meetings with the parties, suggest personal involvement in the case that approaches more of an administrative than a judicial role.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The test for adequacy of representation by existing parties is whether the party exhibits \u201cadversity of interest, collusion, or non-feasance.\u201d <em>Franklin Parish, </em>47 F.3d at 757. While the adequacy of the School Board\u2019s representation is presumed, <em>id., </em>the burden of showing inadequacy is not stringent. The record developed here could create a perception, whether justified or not, that the Board forfeited its role to the district court. As previously stated, we need not decide the adequacy question here. We caution the court, however, to limit itself to traditional judicial decision-making rather than school administration, and to refrain from day-to-day management of its decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">II. <em>Rule 24(b) </em>\u2014 Permissive <em>Intervention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Rule 24(b) provides for permissive intervention when: (I) the motion is timely; (2) a statute of the United States confers a conditional right to intervene; or (3) the movants\u2019 \u201cclaim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b); <em>Trans Chem. Ltd. </em>at 822 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b)(2)). The district court\u2019s Rule 24(b) determination is \u201cwholly discretionary.\u201d <em>Kneeland v. Nat\u2019l Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>806 F.2d 1285, 1289 (5th Cir.1987). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Thus, \u201ceven [where] there is common question of law or fact, or the requirements of 24(b) are otherwise satisfied,\u201d a district court may deny permissive intervention if such would \u201cunduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of . the original parties.\u201d <em>Kneeland, </em>806 F.2d at 1289. Denials of permissive intervention are only subject to reversal if extraordinary circumstances so require. <em>Trans Chem. Ltd., </em>332 F.3d at 822. We see no extraordinary circumstances here, so the court\u2019s decision will be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">For the foregoing reasons we AFFIRM the district court, and DISMISS this case for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
