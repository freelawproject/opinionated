We deny both petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-21\">Wang Choi cannot show prejudice because the BIA indicated that it would have denied her application for adjustment of status as a matter of discretion based on her prostitution conviction. This conviction is a valid basis for denying relief. <em>In re Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N.

Immigration Judges may still deny motions to reopen if they determine that ... adjustment would be denied in any event, either on statutory grounds or in the exercise of discretion.\u201d); <em>In re Michel, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1101, 1105 (BIA 1998) (\u201cWhile not a statutory bar in this case, an alien\u2019s criminal conviction may properly be a factor to be considered in the exercise of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b750-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
