The district court imposed a guideline sentence of 210 months for the drug offenses and a concurrent 120-month sentence for the firearm offense. The court also imposed an identical alternative sentence under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004), treating the guidelines as advisory only, pursuant to this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051,160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-24\">Daniels appeals his sentence, contending that the judicially enhanced guideline sentence was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He has also moved to suspend briefing, vacate the sentence, and remand his case for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005), on the ground that the alternative sentence was imposed without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the benefit of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes. </em>We conclude that, because the alternative discretionary sentence was identical to the sentence imposed under the federal sentencing guidelines as they existed at that time, any error in the imposition of the sentence was harmless. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769. Therefore, we deny the motion to remand for resentencing, and we affirm the sentence. Because this case was fully briefed when Daniels\u2019 motion was filed, we deny his request to suspend briefing as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
