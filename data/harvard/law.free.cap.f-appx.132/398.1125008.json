We review this decision of the BIA for abuse of discretion, <em>see, e.g., Mardones v. McElroy, </em>197 F.3d 619, 624 (2d Cir.1999), and will not disturb that decision unless we determine that the BIA \u201chas acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner,\u201d <em>Zhao v. United States Dept. of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">We have reviewed Jodelka\u2019s arguments, and the Certified Administrative Record (\u201cCAR\u201d), and we hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion. First, the BIA explained in its October 10, 2003, decision that Jodelka\u2019s motion to reopen his deportation proceedings was received over three years later than is required by statute. <em>See </em>CAR at 2; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Jodelka does not dispute that he missed the filing deadline for his motion, and we hold in the circumstances presented that the BIA was neither \u201carbitrary\u201d nor \u201ccapricious\u201d in denying Jodelka\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Second, before this Court, Jodelka argues that even if he missed the applicable filing deadline for his motion, he is entitled to \u201cequitable tolling\u201d of the limitations period. To support his argument, Jodelka argues that he missed the filing deadline only because at least three lawyers provided him with inadequate representation at various stages of his deportation proceedings. Nevertheless, we hold on this record that his failure to file his motion for <em>over three years </em>beyond the applicable, 90-day, limitations period is shy of the \u201creasonable diligence\u201d required from him who seeks equitable tolling. <em>See Iavorski v. United States INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 134 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201c[EJquitable tolling requires a party to pass with reasonable diligence though the period it seeks to have tolled.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). We have previously held that a petitioner\u2019s failure to stay abreast of his counsel\u2019s performance with respect to deportation proceedings for a two-year period may constitute a lack of diligence for purposes of an equitable tolling inquiry, <em>id. </em>(denying equitable tolling, despite the petitioner\u2019s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, and holding that \u201cit is reasonable to assume that [the petitioner] should have known that he had been a victim of ineffective assistance of counsel well before the end of the two-year period he seeks to toll\u201d), and we conclude the same today with respect to Jodelka.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">We have considered all of Jodelka\u2019s arguments, and we find each of them to be without merit. Accordingly, the petition for review is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
