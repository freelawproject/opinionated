He filed a petition for habeas corpus in the district court claiming, as relevant here, that his conviction should be overturned because the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney altered the indictment submitted to Arizona for his extradition. Specifically, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney crossed out the description of the underlying crime for which he failed to surrender himself, which she had incorrectly listed as \u201cburglary,\u201d and corrected it to read \u201ctheft.\u201d The district court denied the petition, concluding under <em>Frisbie v. Collins, </em>342 U.S. 519, 522, 72 S.Ct. 509, 96 L.Ed. 541, (1952), and <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>957 F.2d 465, 470 (7th Cir.1992), that the manner of extradition was irrelevant to the power of the requesting state to convict Weilburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-23\">The Supreme Court has upheld this principle for over 100 years. <em>See Frisbie, </em>342 U.S. at 522, 72 S.Ct. 509; and <em>Ker v. Illinois, </em>119 U.S. 436, 441, 445, 7 S.Ct. 225, 30 L.Ed. 421 (1886) (collectively the <em>\u201cKer-Frisbie </em>doctrine\u201d). Weilburg\u2019s only argument on appeal is that the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s actions were so egregious that we should carve out an exception to the <em>Ker-Frisbie </em>doctrine as the Second Circuit did in <em>United States v. Toscanino, </em>500 F.2d 267, 275 (2d Cir.1974) (creating exception to the <em>Ker-Frisbie </em>doctrine where appellant was tortured and interrogated for seventeen days). However, we have already rejected that approach, and have declined to create any exceptions to the doctrine. <em>See Mitchell, </em>957 F.2d at 470; <em>Matta-Ballesteros v. Henman, </em>896 F.2d 255, 263 (7th Cir.1990) (declining to create exception where petitioner was tortured). We see no reason here to part with this longstanding precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
