The district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to section 1132(g)(2) of Title 29. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. 1132(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Because we agree with Judge Buchwald that the plaintiffs had \u201cprovided the Court with billing records that are sufficiently detailed to allow the Court to identify the substance as well as the amount of work performed,\u201d <em>Trustees of Eastern States Health and Welfare Fund v. Crystal Art Corp., </em>No. 00 Civ. 0887, 2004 WL 1118245, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 2004), we see no abuse of discretion either in Judge Buchwald\u2019s decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees on the basis of the record before her, or in her decision to deny the defendants\u2019 request for additional discovery. <em>See Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (noting that the party seeking attorneys\u2019 fees must present \u201cbilling time records in a manner that will enable a reviewing court to identify [the time spent on] distinct claims\u201d). Additionally, we see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees associated with the related arbitration and NLRB proceedings, given that those proceedings occurred after this action had been filed and while this action had been stayed. <em>See Trustees of Eastern States Health and Welfare Fund, </em>2004 WL 1118245, at *5 (\u201cIt would be contrary to the plain language of Section 1132(g)(2) to hold that defendants could avoid liability for costs and fees merely by securing a stay of the applicable district court action pending resolution of related proceedings ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
