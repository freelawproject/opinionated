DVA, </em>No. 04-1201 (Vet.App. Dec. 2, 2004) reflects that the judgment dismissing Locklear\u2019s appeal was entered on December 2, 2004. The list further reflects that Locklear filed her notice of appeal on March 4, 2005, more than 60 days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-19\">Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B) requires that a notice of appeal be filed within 60 days after entry of judgment. Locklear does not dispute that her appeal is untimely. Instead, she requests an extension of time for filing her appeal. However, pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 26(b)(1), the court cannot extend the time for filing a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-20\">The time limits of Rule 4 are jurisdictional. <em>See Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (\u201cIt is well settled that the requirement of a timely notice of appeal is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019 \u2019\u2019(citation omitted)). Thus, Locklear\u2019s failure to file timely a notice of appeal may not be waived. <em>See Christianson v. Colt Operating Indus. Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 818, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988) (court may not extend its jurisdiction where none exists); <em>Placeway Constr. Corp. v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 726, 728 (Fed.Cir.1983). Because Locklear did not timely file a notice of appeal, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-21\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b398-22\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>(1) Locklear\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
