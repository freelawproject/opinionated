Gonzales is substituted for his predecessor, John Ashcroft, as Attorney General of the United States, pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b212-16\"> This panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.

Ashcroft, </em>322 F.3d 1166 (9th Cir.2003). At the time the BIA set Park\u2019s voluntary departure period, the controlling law was set out in <em>Contreras-Aragon v. INS, </em>852 F.2d 1088 (9th Cir.1988) (en banc). We therefore remand so that the Board can \u201cconsider whether, in light of the fact that <em>Contreras-Aragon </em>was still on the books, [Park\u2019s] period for voluntary departure should commence at a later time.\u201d <em>Zazueta-Carrillo, </em>322 F.3d at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in streamlining Park\u2019s appeal because the IJ did not err, and the BIA would not have abused its discretion if it concluded that the issue presented here-whether a student violated the terms of her status by failing to attend school-is insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-24\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision that Park violated the terms of her nonimmigrant student status because the unrebutted evidence indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Park did not attend the International College for English Studies (\u201cInternational College\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The IJ did not inappropriately shift the burden of proof to Park. She merely noted that Park had not submitted any evidence to contradict the clear unequivocal evidence that she failed to attend International College.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">There is no support in the record for Park\u2019s claim that the IJ was biased against her. Despite Park\u2019s failure to have her uncle testify, and the IJ\u2019s suspicions concerning Park\u2019s activities at the Hostess Bar, the IJ specifically noted that her suspicions were unproven and granted voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Park waived her argument that the INS seized her without probable cause because she only listed this issue in the \u201cIssues Presented\u201d section of her brief and never again referred to it. <em>Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cIssues raised in a brief that are not supported by argument are deemed abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">For the foregoing reasons, Park\u2019s petition challenging the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen is remanded to the BIA, and Park\u2019s petition challenging the BIA\u2019s decision on the merits is denied. We also deny Park\u2019s \u201cMotion for Declaratory Relief or for Nunc Pro Tunc Stay of Voluntary Departure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Petition for Review No. 03-72409 is REMANDED; Petition for Review No. 02-74060 is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b212-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
