Finding no error, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-22\">Because the parties are familiar with the relevant facts, we need only discuss them summarily. At all relevant times, Jeffrey Kline owned Tri-Valley Pharmacy (\u201cTriValley\u201d), which consisted of three pharmacy stores in Pennsylvania. On or about July 2, 2001, Tri-Valley hired Kehres, a 56-year old female, as a pharmacist. Kehres worked primarily at the Tremont store, but spent time at all three stores. Kehres testified that about one week after she was hired, she witnessed two other employees engaging in inappropriate physical contact while working at the same pharmacy as Kehres. On February 22, 2002, Kline terminated Kehres\u2019 employment, providing two reasons for her discharge: (1) she failed to follow Tri-Valley\u2019s \u201cgive and owe\u201d policy for partially filling prescriptions when there was an insufficient amount of medication in stock; and (2) she failed to follow proper procedures related to Pennsylvania\u2019s PACE prescription benefits program by giving discounted medication to a client who was ineligible for benefits. After Kehres was fired, Forrest Jewel, a sixty-six or sixty-seven-year old male, replaced Kehres as the full-time pharmacist at the Tremont <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>Store, and Gene Fisher, a fifty-four or fifty-five-year old male, replaced Jewel as the full-time pharmacist at another TriValley store.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">After properly exhausting administrative remedies, Kehres brought this action alleging sex and age discrimination, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq, </em>the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq, </em>and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\u201cPHRA\u201d), 43 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 951 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">The case proceeded to trial on the merits, which was conducted as a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) bench trial on a stipulated documentary record. After the trial, the District Court found that Kehres\u2019 Title VII claim failed as she did not introduce sufficient evidence to establish that male employees were treated more favorably than she was. The court next found that because Kehres failed to introduce evidence of a causal link between her alleged complaint to Kline about her co-workers behavior at the pharmacy and her termination, her retaliation claim lacks merit. The District Court found that Kehres\u2019 ADEA claim lacks merit as her replacement was not sufficiently younger to create an inference of age discrimination. In addition, the District Court rejected Kehres\u2019 testimony about the \u201cgive and owe\u201d policy, and credited Klines\u2019 testimony about this policy as well as Klines\u2019 testimony about the impact of failing to follow proper procedures for the PACE prescription benefits program. Thus, the court found that Tri-Valley articulated two legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating Kehres. Finally, the District Court found that even if Kehres met her initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, she did not persuade the trier of fact that TriValley intentionally discriminated against her. Accordingly, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-8\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. In an appeal from a Rule 52(a) bench trial, we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law, and we review its factual conclusions for clear error. <em>Kosiba v. Merck &amp; Co., </em>384 F.3d 58, 64 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">After a careful review of the record, we discern no error in the District Court\u2019s judgment. Kehres contends that the District Court erred in finding that she was replaced by an older pharmacist. <em>See </em>Br. at 2, 6. The record reflects, however, that Jewel, who was sixty-six or sixty-seven-years old, replaced Kehres as the full-time pharmacist at the Tremont Store, and Fisher, who was fifty-four or fifty-five years old, replaced Jewel as the full-time pharmacist at another Tri-Valley store. Even crediting Kehres\u2019 argument that Fisher, and not Jewel, actually replaced Kehres at the Tremont Store, a one to two-year age difference is insufficient to create an inference of age discrimination. <em>See Gray v. York Newspapers, Inc., </em>957 F.2d 1070, 1087-88 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">Kehres also contends that she acted competently and professionally in providing Tri-Valley\u2019s client with discounted PACE medication, despite the fact that the client was not eligible for PACE benefits. <em>See </em>Br. at 3-5. This contention, however, militates against a finding of sex and age discrimination. In fact, it supports TriValley\u2019s argument that it terminated Kehres for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">Kehres further contends that the administrative and state-court proceedings for her unemployment claim violated due process. <em>See </em>Br. at 7-10. This claim, however, was not raised in her complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>Thus, it is not properly before this Court. <em>See Lloyd v. Hovensa, LLC., </em>369 F.3d 263, 272-73 (3d Cir.2004). In any event, we note that after Kehres filed an unemployment benefits claim, she was given a hearing. At the hearing, she was represented by counsel, testified before a referee, and had the opportunity to present evidence. Kehres\u2019 disagreement with the facts found by the referee does not render the process inadequate. In addition, the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review reviewed the referee\u2019s decision. Finally, Kehres\u2019 claims were subsequently reviewed in state court. Under the circumstances, Kehres was not denied due process. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">We have fully considered all of the arguments raised by Kehres on appeal, and find that they lack merit and warrant no further discussion. For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
