Talbott pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine. In the written plea agreement, Talbott agreed that he \u201cshould be held responsible beyond a reasonable doubt for at least 1.5 kilograms but less than 5 kilograms of a substance containing methamphetamine.\u201d In the agreement, Talbott also admitted \u201cthat he possessed a firearm in connection with the felony offense ... and that such conduct qualifie[d] him for a two level upward adjustment to his base offense level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-27\">Talbott now appeals his sentence arguing that his sentence violates his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because the sentence is based on facts not admitted by him or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree. <em>Blakely </em>states that when a defendant pleads guilty, the Government is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements if the defendant stipulates to the relevant facts. <em>Id. </em>at 2541. Because Talbott was sentenced based solely on facts he admitted as part of his guilty plea, <em>Blakely </em>is not implicated. <em>United States v. Lucca, </em>377 F.3d 927, 934 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-29\">Talbott acknowledges that a defendant may waive his Sixth Amendment right to a jury determination of facts, but contends he did not validly waive the right because he signed his plea agreement before <em>Blakely </em>clarified the right. At the time of Talbott\u2019s plea agreement, however, defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>dants could argue the Sixth Amendment and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), required a jury to find facts used to enhance a sentence. Talbott did not do so, and instead chose to plead guilty in exchange for the Government\u2019s agreement to drop some of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Besides, in the district court, Talbott raised no sentencing issue under <em>Blakely </em>or <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), so any review would be for plain error. <em>United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 549 (8th2005). To establish plain error, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that but for the error, he would have received a more favorable sentence. <em>Id. </em>At 552. Talbott has not tried to make this showing. Thus, there is no plain error under <em>Booker. </em>In any event, we are satisfied Talbott\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Talbott\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
