Chapman, </em>208 F.3d 940, 942 (11th Cir.2000). A court may dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim only where it appears beyond a doubt that a <em>pro se </em>litigant can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief. <em>See Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1280 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">To state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege that he was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of state law. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Municipal corporations are liable under \u00a7 1983 only in the event a constitutional tort resulted from an official policy or custom. <em>Monell v. Department of Social Serv., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2037-38, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). A plaintiff claiming a conspiracy under \u00a7 1983 must make particularized allegations that a conspiracy exists. <em>See GJR Investments, Inc. v. County of Escambia, </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1370 (11th Cir.1998). Vague and conclusory allegations suggesting a \u00a7 1983 conspiracy are insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. <em>Fullman v. Graddick, </em>739 F.2d 553, 556-57 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">To state a claim for a private \u00a7 1985 conspiracy, a plaintiff must allege: (1) a conspiracy; (2) for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; (3) an act in furtherance of the conspiracy; and (4) that a person is either injured in his person or property or deprived of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States. <em>Denney v. City of Albany, </em>247 F.3d 1172, 1190 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">Upon thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">In his complaint, Hansel asserted that, because notice of prohibited parking was not provided, he was deprived of his property without due process of law and of the equal protection of the law, when All Gone Towing towed his truck. On the face of the complaint, Hansel does not state a \u00a7 1983 deprivation claim against Pinellas County because he concedes that All Gone Towing, <em>not </em>Pinellas County, effected the towing of his truck and the alleged deprivation of his civil rights. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Moreover, to the extent Hansel alleges that Pinellas County deprived him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of his civil rights, Hansel claims only that (1) Pinellas County authorized towing rates and \u201ctook kickbacks,\u201d and (2) if he is entitled to discovery, he could determine whether or not it\u2019s the policy of Pinellas County to \u201cprey on truck drivers.\u201d He does not point to facts indicating that Pinellas County has implemented an unconstitutional policy or practice designed to deprive truck drivers of their civil rights and, accordingly, municipal liability will not attach. <em>See Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. at 2037-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Hansel also fails to state a claim against Pinellas County for conspiracy to interfere with civil rights under either \u00a7 1983 or \u00a7 1985. Hansel, in making these claims, alleges only that he is \u201can apparent victim of \u2018shakedown\u2019 racket operated by [All Gone Towing and Pinellas County]\u201d and that All Gone Towing and Pinellas County \u201cparticipated in a civil conspiracy to regularly engage in depriving ... truckers of their property, due process of law, and the equal protection of the law.\u201d Simply put, such conclusory allegations, with no factual support, are insufficient to state a claim. <em>See Fullman, </em>739 F.2d at 556-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hansel\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-12\">. We GRANT Hansel\u2019s Motion for leave to file his Reply Brief out of time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-18\">. Hansel does not challenge the dismissal as to All Gone Towing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
