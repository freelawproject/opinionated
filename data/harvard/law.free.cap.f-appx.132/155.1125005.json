Genesis filed a motion to stay the action pending arbitration or, alternatively, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>dismiss, pursuant to an arbitration clause in Semcken\u2019s employment contract. The district court granted Genesis\u2019s motion, and Semcken appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We find the arbitration clause enforceable and affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal. Semcken failed to show the lack of a meaningful opportunity to negotiate the inclusion of the arbitration clause in his employment contract, and therefore cannot demonstrate procedural unconscionability through oppression. <em>See Abramson v. Juniper Networks, Inc., </em>115 Cal.App.4th 638, 9 Cal.Rptr.3d 422, 435-36 (Ct.App.2004). Because both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be present for a court to invalidate an agreement as unconscionable, <em>see Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Servs., Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 83, 99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745, 6 P.3d 669, 690 (2000), we need not reach the issue of substantive unconscionability, <em>see Nagrampa v. Mailcoups Inc., </em>401 F.3d 1024, 1030 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In addition, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Semcken\u2019s request for discovery, as the court could reasonably have concluded that Semcken had already enjoyed a \u201creasonable opportunity to present evidence\u201d under California Civil Code \u00a7 1670.5(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\">. There was also no error in not accepting Semcken\u2019s argument that Genesis had no right to initiate the arbitration process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
