R.App. P. 34(a)(2)(c); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-28\">This is a <em>pro se </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 prisoner appeal. Defendant pled guilty to violation of probation. He was sentenced to twelve months and one day in prison plus a four-year term of supervised release. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Subsequently, Defendant filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct this sentence with the district court for the District of Colorado. In his motion, Defendant alleged (1) his conviction on his predicate offense was not final, (2) his sentence was illegal, (3) his rights were violated by federal authorities pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 5, and (4) his probation officer\u2019s statements in the presentence report prejudiced him because they deliberately misled the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\">The district court, in a detailed opinion, denied Defendant\u2019s motion finding no merit to any of his claims. The district court declined to grant Defendant a certificate of appealability. Defendant has renewed his request for a certificate of appealability with this court. The issues he raises on appeal are identical to those brought before the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Defendant must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To do so, Defendant must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were \u2018adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">We have carefully reviewed Defendant\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Defendant\u2019s filing raises an issue which meets our standards for the grant of a certificate of appealability. For substantially the same reasons as set forth by the district court in its July 30, 2004 Order, we cannot say \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">We DENY Defendant\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal. Defendant\u2019s motion to appeal <em>informa pauperis </em>is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\"> As an additional matter, Defendant raises a constitutional challenge to Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-18-412.5 and Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-18-405(l)(a). However, we decline to exercise our discretion to consider this issue because Defendant failed to raise it below. <em>In re Walker, </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
