He petitioned for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction and that several procedural errors in the administrative hearing on the charges required reversal of his conviction. The district court denied Pardo\u2019s petition, concluding that there had been sufficient evidence to convict him and that his hearing comported with due process. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">The charges against Pardo stem from a letter he wrote in March 2000 that was intercepted by prison officials before it left the Hill Correctional Center mailroom. Pardo, who was known to prison officials to be a member of the Latin Kings gang, had addressed the letter to Keith Welch, who frequently visited another known Latin Kings member at Centraba Correctional Center. In the letter, Pardo asked Welch to let Centraba inmate \u201cSal,\u201d the institutional leader of the Latin Kings, know that Centraba inmate \u201cPito\u201d was a \u201cchoa\u201d (a Spanish word for \u201cinformant\u201d). After reading this letter, a prison investigator interviewed Pardo, who admitted writing the letter. Pardo stated that he believed that \u201cPito\u201d had made negative statements about him, causing him to be transferred between prisons, and that, had he been aware of the situation earlier, he would have \u201ctaken care of it\u201d himself. Concluding that Pardo\u2019s letter could have incited gang-related violence at Centraba, the investigator wrote a disciplinary report charging him with security threat group activity, attempted dangerous communications, and abuse of privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Following Pardo\u2019s transfer from Hill to Lawrence Correctional Center that same month, a prison adjustment committee at Lawrence held a hearing on the report. The committee reviewed the report, talked to the investigator who drafted it, and read the letter that served as the basis for the charges. Pardo also addressed the committee, admitting that he wrote the letter but denying that he intended for anyone to be harmed by it. According to Pardo, the investigator had \u201caltered the facts\u201d disclosed in their interview; Pardo said he neither knew which inmates were gang leaders nor attributed his transfer to an informant. The committee, however, concluded that Pardo was guilty of abusing mail privileges and engaging in gang activity, and based this decision on Pardo\u2019s admission that he wrote the letter, which included \u201cobvious references to Latin King security threat group activities,\u201d an officer\u2019s observation that Pardo had attempted to send the letter, and the shakedown slip documenting the letter\u2019s confiscation. The committee dismissed the dangerous communications charge against Pardo, stating simply that it was \u201cnot substantiated in the body of the report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">Pardo filed a grievance requesting that the disciplinary report be expunged and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>his privileges reinstated, and pursued it unsuccessfully through the Illinois Department of Corrections. He then filed a petition for mandamus or habeas corpus in Illinois state court, arguing that the disciplinary committee had violated his due process rights. Specifically, he argued that the notice he received of the hearing was inadequate because it did not contain the names of witnesses, the committee\u2019s decision was not supported by some evidence, the decision failed to explain why the committee had discredited his testimony, and the hearing violated prison rules governing prisoners who have recently been transferred between facilities. The state trial court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed, and the Illinois Supreme Court denied leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In July 2008 Pardo filed a habeas petition in federal court, reasserting the due process arguments he raised in state court. The district court denied Pardo\u2019s petition, holding that due process did not require that the prison inform him of the names of witnesses in advance, and that the letter and Pardo\u2019s admission that he sent it constituted \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the conviction. The court also noted that Par-do could not show that the testimony allegedly discredited by the committee would have exonerated him. The rest of Pardo\u2019s claims, the court stated, relied on state law and thus were not proper subjects of a federal habeas action.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">On appeal Pardo argues that the district court erred when it determined that his conviction was supported by \u201csome evidence.\u201d He asserts that the disciplinary committee simply \u201ccopied the wording of the disciplinary report\u201d without considering any evidence against him. But the evidence before a disciplinary committee need not prove a prisoner\u2019s guilt beyond all doubt; due process is satisfied so long as there is \u201csome evidence.\u201d <em>Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454-55, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985); <em>Biggie v. Cotton, </em>344 F.3d 674, 677 (7th Cir.2003). And Pardo is mistaken in asserting that the committee did not consider \u201cany\u201d evidence, because the committee\u2019s ruling clearly stated that it was in part \u201cbased on the observation of the reporting employee ... [and] the admission of inmate Pardo that he did write the letter.\u201d These statements alone constitute sufficient evidence to support Pardo\u2019s conviction. <em>See Moffat v. Broyles, </em>288 F.3d 978, 981 (7th Cir.2002). Additionally, the committee had Pardo\u2019s actual letter before it to support its conclusion that the document included gang-related content. <em>See Sylvester v. Hanks, </em>140 F.3d 713, 714-15 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Pardo next argues that the district court erred in concluding that the hearing notice he received satisfied due process. He argues that he should have been informed of both the witnesses against him and certain unspecified \u201cconfidential information\u201d that he says was presented at his hearing. But the sort of notice that due process requires for prisoners in disciplinary cases includes only that information needed to prepare a defense, namely the rule allegedly violated and a summary of the facts underlying the charge. <em>Northern v. Hanks, </em>326 F.3d 909, 910-911 (7th Cir.2003). Pardo does not dispute that he received all of this information, and nothing more was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Pardo further asserts that the district court erroneously concluded that the disciplinary committee\u2019s written decision was adequate to satisfy due process. He argues that the decision was insufficient because the committee did not explain why it rejected his testimony that he knew nothing about gang activity. But the state courts rejected Pardo\u2019s argument based solely on the procedural ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>he had not specifically alleged what exonerating testimony he believed the state had ignored, thus running afoul of the state\u2019s requirement that he set forth all material facts necessary to support his claim. This constitutes an adequate and independent state ground barring our analysis of Pardo\u2019s due process claim. <em>Franklin v. Gilmore, </em>188 F.3d 877, 881 (7th Cir.1999). And regardless, due process simply requires that a disciplinary committee articulate \u201ca written statement ... as to the evidence relied upon and the reasons for the disciplinary action taken.\u201d <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 563, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); <em>Moffat, </em>288 F.3d at 981. The committee\u2019s written statement here specified the evidence it relied upon \u2014 testimony from Pardo and a guard, and the letter itself \u2014 and explained that this evidence demonstrated Pardo\u2019s attempt to use mail facilities to coordinate gang activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Finally, Pardo argues that the district court erred when it rejected his claim that his hearing violated prison rules governing prisoners who have recently been transferred between facilities. He claims that the hearing he received at Lawrence should have been more like the hearing he would have received had he been allowed to stay at Hill Correctional Center. But Pardo only argues that the hearing violated the Department of Corrections\u2019s institutional hearing rules, and violations of state law cannot be the basis for federal habeas corpus relief. <em>Dellinger v. Bowen, </em>301 F.3d 758, 764 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
