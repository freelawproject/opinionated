R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Robert Marks appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court granted Mr. Marks a certificate of appealability on the question of whether his trial counsel was ineffective for not challenging the circumstances under which officers searched Mr. Marks\u2019 truck. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">As stated by the district court, this case is governed by the provisions of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). <em>See Penry v. Johnson, </em>532 U.S. 782, 792, 121 S.Ct. 1910, 150 L.Ed.2d 9 (2001). The Kansas state courts adjudicated Mr. Marks\u2019 claim on its merits, so, under AEDPA, we may only grant a writ of habeas corpus if the decision (1) \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or (2) \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). \u2018When applying these deferential AEDPA standards, we review the district court\u2019s legal analysis of the state court decision de novo.\u201d <em>Saiz v. Ortiz, </em>392 F.3d 1166, 1176 (10th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]e focus on the result of the state court decision, not its reasoning.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 arguments, the district court record, the state court record, and the applicable law, we cannot conclude that the decision of the Kansas Court of Appeals was contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s order dated July 28, 2004.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b790-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
