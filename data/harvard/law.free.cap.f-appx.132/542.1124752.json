All three defendants moved to suppress the cocaine that was seized from the Chevrolet Suburban in which they were traveling, and, after a single suppression hearing before the magistrate judge, the district court denied the motions. The district court sentenced Garcia-Campos to 120 months in prison, Nancy Campos to 51 months in prison, and Macedo-Campos to 121 months in prison. Each was also sentenced to five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">Pursuant to their conditional pleas, all three defendants challenge the denial of their motions to suppress. In those motions, the defendants had argued that the initial stop of the Suburban had violated their Fourth Amendment rights and that the state trooper who stopped them had unconstitutionally extended his questioning beyond what was necessary to dispel his original reason for stopping them. At that time, they did not explicitly challenge the voluntariness of Macedo-Campos\u2019s subsequent consent to a search of his Suburban, except for a contention by Nancy Campos that the allegedly illegal seizure \u201ctaints the alleged voluntariness of the consent to search.\u201d In their appellate briefs, the defendants no longer argue that the initial stop was invalid. With slight variations in their contentions, they all argue that the duration of the detention unconstitutionally exceeded the reason for the stop and, for the first time on appeal, they speeifical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>ly contend that Macedo-Campos\u2019s consent was obtained involuntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The suppression-hearing evidence, which consisted primarily of the testimony of Louisiana state trooper Sergeant Don Campbell and a videotape of the traffic stop, may be summarized as follows: Sergeant Campbell pulled over Macedo-Campos\u2019s Suburban on the afternoon of November 15, 2003, after he observed it cross over the center-line and \u201cfog line\u201d several times, while traveling on eastbound Interstate 20 in northwestern Louisiana. The parties agree that this stop was valid. Macedo-Campos was driving, GareiaCampos was in the front passenger seat, and Nancy Campos was sitting in a rear seat. After Campbell summoned MacedoCampos to the rear of the Suburban, Macedo-Campos \u201cfumbled around\u201d while looking for his driver\u2019s license. The license was from California although the Suburban had Texas license plates; Mace-do-Campos explained that he had only recently moved from California to Houston and had not yet had time to get a new driver\u2019s license. Macedo-Campos showed Sergeant Campbell his \u201cbad\u201d right rear tire, which he said was causing the Suburban to \u201cdrift\u201d out of its lane. Campbell believed at that time that Macedo-Campos\u2019s explanation of this problem \u201cma[d]e sense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Sergeant Campbell continued to question Macedo-Campos, based on his concern that the defendants should replace the tire soon. He thought that MacedoCampos was \u201cextremely nervous.\u201d Mace-do-Campos told him that they were traveling to Mississippi, but when asked where in Mississippi, Macedo-Campos \u201cstammered around\u201d before answering \u201cMississippi City,\u201d a town that Campbell did not believe to exist. (The town of Mississippi City was annexed by the city of Gulfport, Mississippi in 1965.) Campbell\u2019s suspicions having been raised, he went to the passenger\u2019s side window to speak with Garcia-Campos, apparently the best English speaker in the group. Garcia-Campos told him that they were traveling to see friends and relatives in Mississippi, but he could not name the town to which they were traveling and stated that he did not have the friends\u2019 and relatives\u2019 phone number. Macedo-Campos did not have such a phone number, either. Sergeant Campbell took the defendants\u2019 identification cards to his patrol unit and ran a criminal-background check, which turned up nothing. Nonetheless, while in the car, he called in a back-up patrol unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Campbell emerged from his patrol unit approximately 10 minutes later and told Macedo-Campos that he needed to get the bad tire repaired, but he did not issue a traffic citation. He simultaneously returned to Macedo-Campos the defendants\u2019 identification cards. Seconds later, Campbell told Macedo-Campos, \u201cI\u2019m still confused about what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and asked him whether he had any weapons or drugs in the Suburban. When Macedo-Campos said \u201cno,\u201d Campbell asked him for consent to search the Suburban, to which MacedoCampos appeared to agree. Campbell had also brought from his patrol unit a Spanish-language consent-to-search form, which he gave to Macedo-Campos. MacedoCampos looked over the form for one or two minutes, and, after asking Campbell one question about it, signed the form. Approximately one minute after he signed the form, the back-up trooper arrived. Campbell\u2019s ensuing search of the Suburban led to the discovery, of 16 bundles of cocaine weighing approximately 22 pounds, hidden in a compartment under the vehicle\u2019s rear-most seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">\u201cThe standard of review for a motion to suppress based on live testimony at a suppression hearing is to accept the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous or influenced by an incorrect view of the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Outlaw, </em>319 F.3d 701, 704 (5th Cir.2003) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), \u201cpolice officers may stop and briefly detain an individual for investigative purposes if they have reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Goodson v. City of Corpus Christi, </em>202 F.3d 730, 736 (5th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868). Under <em>Terry\u2019s </em>two-pronged test, \u201c[cjourts first examine whether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and then inquire whether the officer\u2019s subsequent actions were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc) (citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 19-20, 88 S.Ct. 1868). \u201c \u2018Reasonable suspicion must be supported by particular and articulable facts, which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant an intrusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goodson, </em>202 F.3d at 736 (citation omitted). \u201cAs a general matter, the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.\u201d <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). In the instant appeal, it is not disputed that Campbell had a specific, articulable basis for stopping the Suburban. <em>See Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Under the second <em>Terry </em>prong, the issue is whether an officer\u2019s actions after legitimately stopping the vehicle were reasonably related either to the circumstances that justified the stop or to dispelling his reasonable suspicion developed during the stop. <em>See Brigham, </em>382 F.3d at 507. \u201cThis is because a detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop, unless further reasonable suspicion, supported by articulable facts, emerges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Dortch, </em>199 F.3d 193, 200 (5th Cir.1999)); <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983). In a valid traffic stop, an officer may request a driver\u2019s license, insurance papers, vehicle registration, run a computer check thereon, and issue a citation. <em>United States v. Shabazz, </em>993 F.2d 431, 437 (1993). Moreover, the court has \u201c \u2018rejected] any notion that a police officer\u2019s questioning [of a detainee during a traffic stop], <em>even on a subject unrelated to the purpose of a stop, </em>is itself a Fourth Amendment violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brigham, </em>382 F.3d at 508 (quoting <em>Shabazz, </em>993 F.2d at 436) (emphasis in original). This is because \u201c \u2018detention, not questioning, is the evil at which <em>Terry\u2019s </em>second prong is aimed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shabazz, </em>993 F.3d at 436). Questioning during a valid stop may involve a \u201cgraduated response to emerging facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The defendants rely heavily on several decisions in which this court has held that the seizure of drugs from vehicles should have been suppressed and in which the searches began as valid traffic stops and involved both a computerized check of the subject\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration and detention of the subjects beyond the time necessary to dispel suspicion of wrongdoing. For one reason or another, these <em>decisions </em>\u2014 United <em>States v. Santiago, </em>310 F.3d 336 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Valadez, </em>267 F.3d 395 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>234 F.3d 234 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Dortch, supra </em>\u2014 are distinguishable from the instant case. This is mainly because Campbell\u2019s questions to the defendants were at least arguably related to a legitimate concern that they replace or repair the Suburban\u2019s bad tire and because the <em>Terry </em>stop was not completed until the criminal-background <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>check was finished and Campbell returned the identification cards to Macedo-Campos.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Even if Sergeant Campbell had unconstitutionally extended the traffic stop for a moment after dispelling his suspicions about Macedo-Campos\u2019s erratic driving, a subsequent consent \u201cmay, but does not necessarily, dissipate the taint of a [prior] fourth amendment violation.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>234 F.3d at 242 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In such a case, the admissibility of the challenged evidence turns on a two-pronged inquiry: \u201c1) whether the consent was voluntarily given; and 2) whether the consent was an independent act of free will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201c \u2018The first prong focuses on coercion, the second on causal connection with the constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201c \u2018In order to satisfy the consent exception, the government must establish that consent to search was freely and voluntarily given and that the individual who gave consent had authority to do so\u2019 and \u2018must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that consent was voluntary and effective.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and footnote omitted). This court looks to six factors in reviewing the voluntariness of a consent to search: \u201c1) the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s custodial status; 2) the presence of coercive police procedures; 3) the extent and level of the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the police; 4) the defendant\u2019s awareness of his right to refuse consent; 5) the defendant\u2019s education and intelligence; and 6) the defendant\u2019s belief that no incriminating evidence will be found.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>234 F.3d at 242 (citing <em>Shabazz, </em>993 F.2d at 438). No single factor is dispositive. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Only after the suppression hearing have the defendants raised explicit arguments concerning the voluntariness of MacedoCampos\u2019s consent. Prior to that time, they contended only that the consent was vitiated by the Fourth Amendment violation that allegedly occurred prior that time. This court reviews any arguments not raised before a district court at a suppression hearing for plain error. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>273 F.3d 629, 632-33 (5th Cir.2001). To establish plain error, a defendant must show that (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain, that is, \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc). If all three elements are satisfied, the reviewing court has discretion to correct the error if it affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Because the defendants failed to place the consent issue squarely before the magistrate judge prior to the hearing on their motions to suppress, it is unsurprising that little, if any, evidence regarding the six factors relevant to that issue was presented by either the Government or defendants at the hearing. The evidence that was presented showed that Sergeant Campbell was quite hectoring in questioning the defendants, but does not reflect \u201ccoercive police procedures.\u201d <em>See Jones, </em>234 F.3d at 242. The evidence also indicated that Macedo-Campos\u2019s comprehension of the English language \u2014 and of Campbell\u2019s questions \u2014 was not very good. Nonetheless, Macedo-Campos appears to have taken his time reading the Spanish-language consent-to-search form, and he then signed the form. He has not suggested that he could not read the form. No specific evidence regarding his education or intelligence was presented. As the Government argues, Campbell was not required to inform Macedo-Campos of his right to refuse to consent. <em>See Ohio v. Robinette, </em>519 U.S. 33, 40, 117 S.Ct. 417, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>136 L.Ed.2d 347 (1996). Given the inadequacy of the suppression-hearing evidence and the fact that this inadequacy may be ascribed largely to the defendants\u2019 failure to squarely argue the consent issue in their suppression motions, the defendants have shown no \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d error as to the district court\u2019s conclusion that Macedo-Campos\u2019s consent to the search was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Because the defendants have not established that the district court erred in denying their motions to suppress, the convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b575-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
