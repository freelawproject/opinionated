Ashworth\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-24\">On January 10, 2003, Ashworth pleaded guilty to one count of lewd molestation. Pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement, a second charge of lewd molestation was dismissed. He was sentenced to a thirteen-year term of imprisonment. Ash-worth did not seek to withdraw his guilty plea and he did not file a direct appeal. He did, however, file a state post-conviction application on November 3, 2003. Ashworth asserted several ineffective assistance of counsel claims in addition to a claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to accept his plea because it did not hold a preliminary hearing after a charge was added to the information. The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>district court denied Ashworth\u2019s post-conviction application, relying on Oklahoma\u2019s procedural default rule. <em>See </em>Okla Stat. tit. 22, \u00a7 1086. The denial of post-conviction relief was affirmed by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Ashworth filed the instant \u00a7 2254 petition on February 12, 2004, raising the same ineffective assistance and jurisdictional claims raised in his state post-conviction application. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge who prepared a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) recommending that Ashworth\u2019s petition be denied. The R <em>&amp; </em>R first addressed Ash-worth\u2019s assertion that a jurisdictional claim cannot be subject to procedural default. It concluded, however, that the right to a prehminary hearing on an amended information can be waived by the failure to object. <em>See Norton v. State, </em>43 P.3d 404, 408 (Okla.Crim.App.2002). Thus, despite Ashworth\u2019s assertions, his claim did not implicate the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction and it was procedurally defaulted. The R &amp; R further concluded that Ashworth had failed to show cause and prejudice to excuse the default and had also failed to demonstrate that the failure to review the merits of the defaulted claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>See Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 622, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). The R &amp; R then concluded that federal review of Ashworth\u2019s ineffective assistance claims was not barred by the procedural default. Although it reviewed the claims, it determined that they lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Ashworth filed timely objections to the R &amp; R and argued, in part, that he was not given an adequate opportunity to argue the merits of his ineffective assistance claims. The district court considered Ash-worth\u2019s expanded arguments but concluded that the ineffective assistance claims lacked merit. Accordingly, the court denied Ashworth\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">This court cannot grant Ashworth a COA unless he can demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Ashworth has carried his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Ashworth is not required to demonstrate that his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA. He must, however, \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">This court has reviewed Ashworth\u2019s application for a COA and appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El </em>and concludes that Ashworth is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Ashworth\u2019s claims is not reasonably subject to debate and the claims are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, Ashworth has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d and is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">This court denies Ashworth\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
