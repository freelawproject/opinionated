In his habeas petition, Dontas challenges the calculation of his good conduct time (\u201cGCT\u201d) by the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d). According to the BOP, Dontas is eligible under the applicable statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b), to earn up to 682 days of GCT with a resulting projected release date of December 13, 2013. Dontas, however, argues that the BOP\u2019s calculation of his GCT deprives him of the amount to which he is entitled by statute (i.e., 784 days of GCT). Dontas asserts that \u00a7 3624(b) allows him to earn up to 54 days per year of the term of sentence imposed, not 54 days per year of time actually served as the BOP\u2019s calculation provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">This Court recently issued an opinion concluding that the BOP\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3624(b) is reasonable, and thus entitled to deference. <em>See O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 174 (3d Cir.2005), <em>citing Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Stiver v. Meko, </em>130 F.3d 574, 577 (3dCir.l997). We concluded that \u201cthe BOP\u2019s interpretation comports with the language of the statute, effectuates the statutory design, establishes a \u2018fair prorating scheme,\u2019 enables inmates to calculate the time they must serve with reasonable certainty, and prevents certain inmates from earning GCT for time during which they were not incarcerated.\u201d <em>Id., citing Pacheco-Camacho v. Hood, </em>272 F.3d 1266, 1270-71 (9th Cir.2001). We further rejected, as meritless, the argument raised by Dontas that the District Court should have applied the rule of lenity and resolved the statute\u2019s ambiguity in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">Accordingly, because it clearly appeal\u2019s that no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court denying Dontas\u2019 petition pursuant to Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
