We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. In his own asylum hearing, Didar Singh, the husband and father, gave testimony that contradicted that of the Sainis in nearly every material respect. We are not able to say \u201cthat no reasonable factfinder could find that [they were] not credible.\u201d <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">The Sainis contend that the IJ violated their due process rights by considering the testimony of Didar Singh, as described in the IJ\u2019s decision in his asylum ease, at all. We disagree on two independent grounds. First, the Sainis themselves submitted the decision into evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(4)(B) (requiring that aliens be allowed \u201ca reasonable opportunity ... to cross-examine witnesses <em>presented by the Government\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Second, the Sainis alone, not the government, had any knowledge of Didar Singh\u2019s whereabouts or any ability to request his attendance at their asylum hearing. <em>See Saidane v. I.N.S., </em>129 F.3d 1063, 1065 (9th Cir.1997) (hearsay evidence allowable in an immigration case if \u201cadmission was fundamentally fair\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b765-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
