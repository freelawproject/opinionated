Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Wren v. United States, </em>- U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1868, 161 L.Ed.2d 715 (2005). We previously affirmed Wren\u2019s conviction. <em>United States v. Wren, </em>126 Fed.Appx. 462 (2004). After reconsideration, we affirm Wren\u2019s sentence and reinstate our previous opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>The decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>does not change our resolution of this appeal. In Wren\u2019s initial brief to this Court, Wren did not make any argument about the <em>Apprendi/Blakely </em>line of cases. Instead, Wren first presented an argument regarding the Sentencing Guidelines in his petition for writ of certiorari. Nothing in <em>Booker </em>or the remand order of the Supreme Court \u201crequires or suggests that we are obligated to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us ... [or] treat the case as though the [Booker] issue had been timely raised in this Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262 (11th Cir.2005). We therefore, \u201capply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1262-63, and conclude that Ware abandoned any arguments he may have under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">After reconsideration, we again affirm and reinstate our previous opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">OPINION REINSTATED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
