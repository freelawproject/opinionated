We do, however, elect to comment on two points raised in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">In her petition for rehearing, Hammond argues that <em>Istre v. Apfel, </em>208 F.3d 517 (5th Cir.2000), stands for the proposition that the good cause requirement applies only to cases brought under sentence (6) of \u00a7 405(g), in which new evidence is presented for the first time in the district court. Although that happens to be the procedural posture of this case, we do not read the important holding of the opinion in that way. Instead, <em>Istre </em>holds that there are no permissible bases for remand other than under sentences (4) and (6) of \u00a7 405(g). The district court did not remand here, so <em>Istre </em>is inapplicable. In other words, <em>Istre </em>concerned the circumstances under which a case <em>may </em>be remanded, not the circumstances under which it <em>must </em>be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Also in her petition for rehearing, Hammond argues that \u201cnew evidence submitted to the Appeals Council justifies reversal.\u201d Hammond indeed introduces evidence that would have been material, <em>had the date of the hearing been later. </em>We, however, cannot deem evidence material insofar as it details the alleged worsening of a claimant\u2019s condition after the date of the hearing. This is not to say that we cannot consider <em>any </em>evidence post-dating a hearing, but that medical evidence must shed light on the severity of a claimant\u2019s medical condition <em>before </em>the hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
