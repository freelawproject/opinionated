We conclude that the District Court\u2019s decision was proper, and, therefore, will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-19\">In July 2004 Beddini filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 <em>&amp; </em>1986. She alleged that Honorable Thomas H. Dilts, Presiding Judge, Superior Court of Somerset County, New Jersey, violated her Fourteenth Amendment rights when he ruled on her motions in her family law case. Judge Dilts filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (2) and (6), which was granted by the District Court. Beddini timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-20\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We may dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-21\">The District Court granted the motion to dismiss and concluded that Judge Dilts was absolutely immune from suit. We agree. Judge Dilts acted in his judicial capacity when ruling on the motions at issue. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). Beddini\u2019s claim that Judge Dilts conspired with others or acted maliciously does not alter the application of judicial immunity to this case. <em>See Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 554, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); <em>see, e.g., Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 26-27, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-22\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss Beddini\u2019s appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
