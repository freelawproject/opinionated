The district court sentenced Daniel to seventy months imprisonment and four years of supervised release. Daniel appeals her sentence on two grounds. She first asserts that the district court erred by denying her motion to compel the government to file a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure due to her substantial assistance. Also, citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Daniel contends that the district court erred by enhancing her sentence based on facts that were neither found by a jury nor admitted by her using mandatory guidelines. Because the error of the district court under <em>Booker </em>was not harmless, we vacate Daniel\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b359-19\">Without the benefit of a plea agreement, Daniel pleaded guilty to both drug counts against her. During the plea colloquy, Daniel indicated that she had chosen not to enter the plea agreement proposed by the government because she did not want to waive her right to appeal the drug quantity found by the district court. Daniel did, however, sign and file in open court a document entitled \u201cFactual Resume\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>which she \u201cagree\u00ae and stipulate\u00ae that the Government can prove [the] facts [contained in the factual resume] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The bulk of that document recounts Daniel\u2019s involvement in a drug conspiracy involving several other people including her brother. It ends with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-4\">The parties agree that the Court will determine the drug amount for which the defendant is responsible at the sentencing hearing and that the Government can prove [a] drug amount beyond a reasonable doubt of greater than 50 grams of methamphetamine. The Government contends that the defendant is accountable for from 1.5 to 5 kilograms of methamphetamine as relevant conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">During the plea colloquy, Daniel stated that she agreed with the information contained in the factual resume, with two exceptions: (1) the drug quantities mentioned to the extent they exceed the minimum statutory amounts referred to in the indictment and (2) the purity of the methamphetamine to the extent that the factual resume held her responsible for \u201cice\u201d methamphetamine, a more pure version of methamphetamine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also during the plea colloquy, Daniel acknowledged that the provision in the factual resume where the parties agreed to have the district court determine the drug quantity acted as a waiver of any <em>\u201cApprendi </em>argument with regard to the drug amount.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">During Daniel\u2019s sentencing hearing, which took place before the Supreme Court handed down its decision in <em>Booker, </em>she argued that <em>Blakely </em>effectively invalidated the federal sentencing guidelines. Though recognizing that <em>Blakely </em>had cast doubt on the continuing viability of the federal sentencing guidelines, the district court nonetheless rejected Daniel\u2019s argument and chose to apply the guidelines as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">At the close of the sentencing hearing, the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Daniel was responsible for 221.13 grams of methamphetamine, 2.5 grams of ecstasy, and 31 grams of \u201cice.\u201d With a marijuana equivalency of 1,063.25 kilograms, the district court determined that Daniel\u2019s base offense level was 32. <em>See </em>U.S.S.C. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4). After applying a two-level decrease under the guidelines safety-valve provision and a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, the court set Daniel\u2019s adjusted offense level at 27. With an offense level of 27 and criminal history category of I, the guidelines produced a sentencing range of 70 to 87 months imprisonment. The district court sentenced Daniel to 70 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">Daniel makes two arguments on appeal. She first contends that the district court erred when it denied her motion to compel the government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a departure based on her substantial assistance. Daniel next argues that the district court erred under <em>Booker </em>when it enhanced her sentence based on facts that were neither found by a jury nor admitted by her using mandatory guidelines. We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-12\">\n<em>A Motion to Compel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">Daniel concedes that she never entered into a formal written agreement un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>der which the government would file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion if she provided substantial assistance. Nonetheless, she argues that in several conversations with law enforcement personnel she was promised that, if she cooperated, the government would recommend a sentence below the guidelines range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Daniel argues that the assistance she provided to the government was substantial and that the government breached its agreement with her by not filing a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The cooperation that Daniel asserts she provided includes: (1) testifying about her brother\u2019s drug activities; (2) providing information to the government about a Anna Marsh, a drug dealer, and conducting two controlled buys with Marsh; (3) preparing to testify against Marsh and Ryan Palmer, another drug dealer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">As we stated in <em>United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825 (11th Cir.2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the government has \u201ca power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u201d <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). In <em>Wade, </em>the Supreme Court limited the free exercise of that power only to the extent that the government cannot exercise that power, or fail to exercise that power, for an unconstitutional motive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 831. That means that \u201cjudicial review is appropriate when there is an allegation and a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation, such as race or religion.\u201d <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1502-03 (11th Cir.1993) (emphasis omitted). Daniel did not allege there was an unconstitutional motive behind the government\u2019s refusal to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a result, the district court committed no error in refusing to compel the government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">\n<em>B. Booker Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">Under <em>Booker, </em>there are two kinds of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory. \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005). In addition, \u201c[a]s a result of Booker\u2019s remedial holding, <em>Booker </em>error exists when the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). Daniel contends that the district court committed both constitutional and statutory error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-15\">Although an argument can be made the Daniel waived her right to appeal any constitutional error, we need not address that issue. It is clear that Daniel did not waive her right to appeal the <em>Booker </em>statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>error. By sentencing Daniel under a mandatory guidelines scheme, the district court committed statutory error under <em>Booker. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Because Daniel preserved her <em>Booker </em>objection, we review for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 190 (11th Cir.2005). As we stated in <em>Mathenia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">A non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1290 (marks and citations omitted). The government failed to meet its burden of showing that the <em>Booker </em>statutory error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The district court did not say that it would have given the same sentence regardless of whether the guidelines were mandatory or advisory. The district court, instead, stated that \u201cthe sentence imposed addresses the seriousness of the offense and the sentencing objectives of punishment, deterrence, and incapacitation.\u201d That statement does little to inform our judgment about what the district court would have done had it treated the guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory. The district court may very well have found that a lower sentence would also address the same concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The comment of the district court that \u201cif the guidelines are determined to be unconstitutional, we\u2019ll probably be back here for a resentencing in some form or fashion, or there will be some potential adjustment that will need to be made as a result of ... any decision that would undermine the guidelines as we know them today\u201d suggests that the district court might be amenable to imposing a different sentence under an advisory guidelines regime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any event, the government has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating \u201cwith fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1290. We find, therefore, that the <em>Booker </em>statutory error committed by the district court was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">For the foregoing reasons, Daniel\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing in accord with the <em>Booker </em>decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\">. During the sentencing hearing, Daniel changed her position somewhat. She stated that her only objection to the drugs discussed in the PSR was to the purity of the drugs, not the quantity. According to Daniel, \"there is no objection before the Court as to the findings of the Probation Office as to the quantity-\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\">. Even if we accepted Daniel\u2019s contention that there was a verbal accord, we agree with the government\u2019s argument that it, like most agreements, would have vested the final decision of whether to file a substantial assistance motion in the government's sole discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\">. Her testimony against Marsh and Palmer was unnecessary because they both pleaded guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b361-16\">. The district court conjectured that the government probably would have filed a substantial assistance motion had Daniel not been caught using illegal drugs after being put on conditional release pending the resolution of this case. If that were the motive, it is not an unconstitutional one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\">. On remand, the district court must calculate the proper Guideline range, which includes again making findings regarding the quantity and quality of the methamphetamine possessed by Daniel or adopting the previous findings, and then the district court must apply that Guideline range in an advisory manner. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
