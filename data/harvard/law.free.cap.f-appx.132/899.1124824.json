Garvan Murtha, of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b932-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Sukhdev Singh, <em>pro se, </em>appeals the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019s (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmance of the decision of an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), and relief pursuant to Article III of the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). The parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">We first consider whether this Court has jurisdiction to review the BIA decision as it pertains to Singh\u2019s wife and children. Although the petition for review clearly named Singh as petitioner, it did not mention Singh\u2019s wife or children by name. Jurisdiction as to Singh is clear. As to his wife and children, we note that this Court may take \u201chypothetical jurisdiction\u201d over a case and reach the merits where the jurisdictional question does not involve constitutional issues. <em>See Fama v. Comm\u2019r Corr. Servs., </em>235 F.3d 804, 816 (2d Cir.2000). Here, the jurisdictional question is statutory, as it involves review of an agency determination. Furthermore, as discussed below, the petitioners at issue are not entitled to relief whether we decline or accept jurisdiction over them. Thus, hypothetical jurisdiction is proper in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">In reviewing a BIA decision where, as here, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, \u201cit is appropriate ... to review the decision of the IJ directly.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">We review the IJ\u2019s factual findings regarding eligibility for withholding of removal and asylum under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, <em>see id. </em>at 306-07, upholding them where they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We accord \u201cparticular deference\u201d to the IJ\u2019s determinations surrounding credibility. <em>See Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997)). When reviewing credibility findings, courts \u201clook to see if the IJ has provided \u2018specific, cogent\u2019 reasons for the adverse credibility finding and whether those reasons bear a \u2018legitimate nexus\u2019 to the finding.\u201d <em>Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004) (internal citations omitted). Where the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is based on specific examples in the record of inconsistent statements by the asylum applicant about matters material to his claim of persecution, or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters, a reviewing court will generally not be able to conclude that a reasonable adjudicator was compelled to find otherwise. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">Under this highly deferential standard of review, we find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence. Singh\u2019s testimony regarding his alleged arrests and beatings at the hands of the Punjab police was inconsistent, changing from four incidents to two incidents. Further, the documentary evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>dence provided by Singh contradicts his testimony regarding the number of times he was allegedly beaten and tortured, and, indeed, in the present appeal, Singh claims to have been tortured only two times. Additionally, as the IJ found, there is evidence to support the conclusion that Singh was not in India during one of the incidents alleged to have occurred in 1997 and 1998, including Singh\u2019s own testimony that he was living in Dubai from 1994 to 1999 and the lack of any stamp in his passport which would indicate entry into India at that time. Furthermore, there are inconsistencies in Singh\u2019s descriptions of the torture that took place. For example, in one account of the 1993 incident, Singh testified that he was stripped naked and his legs forced open until he lost consciousness. Later, that account changed to being beaten by batons and a big stick. Further, the amount of bribe money paid by Singh\u2019s father differed between his testimony and his asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Because the adverse credibility findings were based upon \u201cinconsistent statements, contradictory evidence, and inherently improbable testimony,\u201d the IJ found Singh to lack credibility on the relevant issues of his past persecution and his well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Diallo v. I.N.S., </em>232 F.3d 279, 287-88 (2d Cir.2000). Therefore, because the IJ\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence, we decline to overturn that determination on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the BIA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
