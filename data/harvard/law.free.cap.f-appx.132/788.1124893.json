The conviction rested, in part, on incriminating statements McKenzie made to an arresting officer before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>McKenzie was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. On appeal, he alleges that the use of those statements at trial violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">On 5 February 2003, officers with the Alexander City Police Department in Alexander, Alabama executed a search warrant at McKenzie\u2019s residence. The warrant authorized a search for illegal drugs. Even though McKenzie was on electronic monitoring, he was not at home when officers arrived at his home. McKenzie\u2019s parents allowed the officers to enter and permitted them to search what was allegedly McKenzie\u2019s room. During the search, the officers discovered ammunition, marijuana and some cocaine residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">One hour after the search began, McKenzie approached the house through the back yard. An officer saw McKenzie and placed him under arrest for failure to pay child support. The parties agree that the arresting officer did not read McKenzie his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After being arrested, McKenzie continually talked to the officers, often in an abusive manner. In fact, the officers requested that McKenzie stop talking on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">Officer Turner testified at McKenzie\u2019s trial to the conversation at issue. The conversation occurred at McKenzie\u2019s house, after his arrest, but before he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-9\">Q.: \u201cDid [McKenzie] make any statements to you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-10\">A.: \u201cI asked him where he was at.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-11\">Q.: \u201cAnd what did he reply?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-12\">A.: \u201cHe advised, \u2018you police, you figure it out.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-13\">Q.: \u201cWhat other statements did he make to you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-14\">A.: \u201cI advised him that we found some marijuana and some cocaine, and he told me that he smoked marijuana and did I ever think he was a user or did I just figure he was a dealer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-15\">Q.: \u201cDid he say anything else to you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-16\">A.: \u201c \u2018Go mess with the folks on the lake. That\u2019s where all the real dope is.\u2019 He said if they called him right now and tested him, he would \u2018blow the machine up.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-17\">Q.: \u201cWhat did you take that to mean?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-18\">A.: \u201cThat he would be positive for narcotics at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-19\">Based in part on this testimony, a jury convicted McKenzie for possession of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. 844(a). McKenzie now appeals that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-20\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b821-21\">We must determine whether McKenzie was interrogated in the constitutional sense, and whether the statements he made to Officer Turner were voluntary. These questions present mixed ones of law and fact. On review, we may substitute our \u201cindependent judgment after a review of the entire record.\u201d <em>Cannady v. Dugger, </em>931 F.2d 752, 754 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-22\">The Supreme Court has said that the Fifth Amendment prohibits an officer from interrogating an arrestee without reading that arrestee his so-called <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). This rule extends to the functional equivalent of an interrogation. <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). But, voluntary statements- \u2014 even those made without a <em>Miranda </em>reading \u2014 are admissible. <em>Miranda, </em>86 S.Ct. at 1630. Thus, if Officer Turner\u2019s statements were part of an interrogation or its functional equivalent, then it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>error to admit them unless McKenzie made them voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">We decide that Officer Turner did not interrogate McKenzie in the constitutional sense. About drugs, Officer Turner merely stated what was discovered in McKenzie\u2019s room; he did not ask McKenzie questions about the seized contraband. McKenzie\u2019s appeal, therefore, rests on whether the conversation was the functional equivalent of an interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The Supreme Court defined \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d as \u201cany words or actions on the part of police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>100 S.Ct. at 1689-90. The focus of the inquiry is the perception of the suspect, not the intent of the police. <em>Arizona v. Mauro, </em>481 U.S. 520, 107 S.Ct. 1931, 1935, 95 L.Ed.2d 458 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">This Court has also considered whether a seizure involved an \u201cunusual degree of force\u201d to determine whether police partook in the functional equivalent of interrogation. <em>United States v. Glerir-Archila, </em>677 F.2d 809, 815 (11th Cir.1982). And, we previously said that a \u201cpolice arrest or seizure [is not, by itself] so coercive [as to] transform a situation into one of functional interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. See also United States v. Genao, </em>281 F.3d 305, 311 (1st Cir.2002) (concluding officer\u2019s statement: \u2018We\u2019ve got a problem here,\u201d did not constitute the functional equivalence of interrogation).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the conversation at issue was not the functional equivalent of an interrogation. We are not persuaded that Officer Turner should have known that by informing McKenzie of what officers found in McKenzie\u2019s room would illicit the response it did. In addition, the police did not use an unusual degree of force, or psychological tricks like those mentioned in <em>Innis.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We also believe the statement was voluntary. <em>See Genao, </em>281 F.3d at 311. That McKenzie continually talked with officers after being arrested and that he did so after being warned, though not with official <em>Miranda </em>language, to be quiet is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">Accordingly, the conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-9\">. <em>Innis </em>cited examples of coached witnesses in lineups, minimizing the moral seriousness of an offense, blaming the victim and reverse lineups as psychological \u201cploys\u201d used by the police to obtain incriminating statements. 100 S.Ct. at 1689.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
