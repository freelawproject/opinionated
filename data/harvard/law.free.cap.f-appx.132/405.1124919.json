Appellee has filed a motion for summary affirmance, which will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-21\">Harris is currently serving a 188-month sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey. Harris filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the District Court challenging the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (\u201cBOP\u201d) interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1), which governs the award of good time credits to prisoners. The District Court rejected his arguments and dismissed his petition. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. See <em>Bakhtriger v. Elwood, </em>360 F.3d 414, 417 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-22\">Section 3624(b)(1) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-23\">[A] prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner\u2019s life, may receive credit towards the service of the prisoner\u2019s sentence, beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment, beginning at the end of the first year of the term ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1). The BOP interprets this statute to allow fifty-four days of \u201cgood time\u201d credit for each year served by the prisoner. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 523.20. The BOP\u2019s formula for calculating good time credit accounts for the fact that the prisoner\u2019s sentence is incrementally shortened as good time credit is awarded each year. <em>See White v. Scibana, </em>390 F.3d 997 at 1000-1001 (7th Cir.2004) (explaining the BOP\u2019s formula).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Harris contends that the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP\u2019s) interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) is contrary to Congressional intent because the phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d in the statute unambiguously refers to the term imposed rather than time served. As a result of the BOP\u2019s incorrect interpretation of this statute, Harris argues, he is being deprived of good time credit to which he is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We have recently held that the phrase \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d in this statute is ambiguous and that the BOP\u2019s interpretation is reasonable. <em>See O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 174 (3d Cir.2005). Therefore, we defer to the BOP\u2019s interpretation, as required under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Harris\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our decision in <em>O\u2019Donald. </em>Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Harris\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
