Smith, then the City\u2019s police chief, assaulted and injured Dr. Ulfe while off-duty and in retaliation for Dr. Ulfe\u2019s sexual relationship with Smith\u2019s then-wife. Dr. Ulfe also appeals the November 24, 2003 order of the district court, granting partial summary judgment for Smith on Dr. Ulfe\u2019s claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and remanding the state law claim for assault and battery to the Jefferson (Kentucky) Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>Cockrel v. Shelby County Sch. Disk, </em>270 F.3d 1036, 1048 (6th Cir.2001). Summary judgment must be granted if the pleadings and evidence \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A dispute over a material fact is only a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d if a reasonable jury could find for the nonmoving party on that issue. <em>Cockrel, </em>270 F.3d at 1048 (citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). In reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, this Court must view all the facts and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-22\">Following our extensive review of the record, all applicable law, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. Because issuing a full opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>summary judgment orders on the basis of the district court\u2019s memorandum opinions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
