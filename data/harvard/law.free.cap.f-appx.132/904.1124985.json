Where the BIA affirms without opinion, we may review the IJ\u2019s opinion directly. <em>See Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, underlying proceedings, and specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-20\">Petitioner You\u2019s claims for relief stem from his wife\u2019s alleged forced abortion. If a petitioner\u2019s wife has undergone a forced sterilization or abortion he is presumptively entitled to asylum and withholding of removal relief unless the government rebuts this presumption through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>a showing of changed circumstances. <em>See In re C-Y-Z-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 915, 918-19, 1997 WL 353222 (BIA 1997); <em>Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 148 (2d Cir.2003). The IJ, however, made an adverse credibility determination that was fatal to all three of petitioner You\u2019s claims of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">We review an IJ\u2019s factual findings, including credibility determinations, under a substantial evidence standard. <em>See Abankwah v. INS, </em>185 F.3d 18, 22-23 (2d Cir.1999). In this case, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which relied principally on significant discrepancies between petitioner You\u2019s airport interview and later testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">In <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft </em>out several factors for ensuring reliability of airport interview testimony. 357 F.3d 169, 179-80 (2d Cir.2004). For instance, airport testimony is more likely reliable when (1) the record of the interview is a verbatim account; (2) the interviewers elicit details regarding petitioner\u2019s asylum claim; (3) petitioner is not reluctant to testify due to his or her previous experiences with coercive interrogation measures; and (4) petitioner\u2019s answers suggest that he or she understood the translation of the interview questions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">We have carefully reviewed the circumstances surrounding the airport interview, and, fully taking into consideration the <em>Ramsameachire </em>factors, rule that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was proper. <em>See id. </em>For instance, the record of petitioner You\u2019s airport interview was a verbatim transcript and indicated that the interviewer elicited details and asked follow-up questions. Furthermore, although petitioner You argued that the translation was disturbed because it was telephonic, there is no indication in the transcript that petitioner misunderstood any of the questions or that the translation was otherwise deficient. We therefore hold that the IJ\u2019s denials of asylum and withholding of removal were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">We do not have jurisdiction to consider petitioner You\u2019s CAT claim because it was unexhausted due to petitioner\u2019s failure to raise it to the BIA. <em>See Cervantes-Ascencio v. INS, </em>326 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is denied and petitioner You\u2019s motion for stay of removal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
