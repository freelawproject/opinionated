We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">We defer to the factual findings of the BIA and IJ if they are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>See Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004). Pursuant to this standard, we may reverse \u201conly if \u2018no reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find\u2019 that petitioner suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution or torture.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 177 (2d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000)). <em>See also Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73 n. 7 (factual findings are \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary\u201d). Thus, the scope of our review is \u201cexceedingly narrow\u201d and we are particularly deferential to an IJ\u2019s determination as to a petitioner\u2019s credibility. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The government concedes that the BIA\u2019s brief decision in this case contains a number of factual errors; for example, the BIA decision incorrectly identifies several allegations actually raised in Wang\u2019s first application for asylum as being raised in her second application. While these errors are troubling, the BIA\u2019s ultimate decision is supported by substantial evidence. The BIA affirmed on the grounds that \u201cthe record supports the Immigration Judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding,\u201d and we find that a reasonable fact-finder would not be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See, e.g., Gao v. Attorney General, </em>400 F.3d 963 (2d Cir.2005). As the IJ noted, Wang (1) previously submitted a false asylum application, prepared and signed by another person, for the purposes of obtaining employment authorization, (2) presented inconsistent testimony as to the gender of her first child, (3) failed to submit authenticated documentation, which is of particular concern, given the State Department profile suggesting that similar documents are subject to \u201cwidespread fraud and fabrication,\u201d and (4) failed to provide a copy of her sterilization receipt, despite Wang\u2019s testimony that she had placed the receipt in a safe deposit box and that \u201cshe always kept it with [her].\u201d Because a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to conclude otherwise, and because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination, we uphold the denial of Wang\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">We have considered all of the petitioner\u2019s other claims and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the BIA is hereby AFFIRMED and Wang\u2019s petition for review is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
