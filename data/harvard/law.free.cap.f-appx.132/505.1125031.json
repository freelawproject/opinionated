Ingram appeals his sentence following his guilty plea to one count of mail fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Ingram argues that the district court erred in finding that the loss amount attributable to him for sentencing and restitution purposes was approximately $12,500,000. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court has held that the application and interpretation of the guidelines continue be reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358-59 (5th Cir.2005). When the parties have agreed that factual findings are reviewed for clear error, we also have \u201cassume[d] without deciding that clear error is the proper standard post <em>-Booker.\u201d United States v. Infante, </em>404 F.3d 376, 393-94 n. 14, (5th Cir.2005). Prior to <em>Booker, </em>the parties in the instant case also agreed that factual findings should be reviewed for clear error. Therefore, we \u201cassume without deciding\u201d that the clear error standard applies. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Randall, </em>157 F.3d 328, 330 (5th Cir.1998) (loss amount under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 reviewed for clear error). The propriety of a particular award of restitution is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Hughey, </em>147 F.3d 423, 436 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">The district court did not clearly err in attributing fraud committed by Ingram\u2019s co-defendant to him or abuse its discretion in its restitution award. Ingram admits that he knew approximately 60% of the submitted invoices were fraudulent. Despite Ingram\u2019s assertion that he could not determine whether the other invoices were fraudulent because he was unqualified for his job, given that the scale of the fraud was so great, the district court\u2019s finding that the full amount of the fraud was reasonably foreseeable to him was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">Ingram also argues that the district court clearly erred by imposing a two-level enhancement for the use of \u201csophisticated means.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(6)(C). Although the basic principles of the scheme were simple, Ingram and Brooks used sophisticated means to carry out their scheme, to shield it from scrutiny, and to disguise the source of their gains. The district court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Ingrain also argues that the district court erred by denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Our standard of review is highly deferential, and we will \u201caffirm a sentencing court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 unless it is \u2018without foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>174 F.3d 515, 525 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s decision was not \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d Although Ingram entered a timely guilty plea and provided extensive information to the Government, the district court found that he had tried to minimize the amount of money he received and his awareness of the scope of the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Ingram also argues that his sentence must be vacated pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He concedes that this issue was not raised below and that plain error review applies. Neither party has addressed the effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Booker, </em>which held that <em>Blakely </em>was applicable to the federal sentencing guidelines. 125 S.Ct. at 746. We conclude that, following <em>Booker, </em>Ingram has demonstrated \u201cerror\u201d that was \u201cplain\u201d because the district court made findings not admitted or proven to a jury that resulted in an enhanced sentence. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.2005). However, because the district court sentenced Ingram to the statutory maximum (and indicated it would have imposed an even higher sentence but for the statutory maximum), we conclude that Ingram can not demonstrate that the district court \u201cwould have reached a significantly different result\u201d under an advisory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 520-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
