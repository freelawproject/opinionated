Cabrera-Ruiz asserts the district court erred in (1) enhancing his sentence based on facts not alleged in the indictment or found by the jury, and (2) determining his state court conviction for delivery of cannabis was an aggravated felony. The Government cross-appeals, contending the district court erred in determining Cabrera-Ruiz\u2019s prior drug trafficking conviction was the only prior conviction that could be used to support a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l). We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">A. <em>Enhancement Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Cabrera-Ruiz asserts his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated, pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), when the district court enhanced his sentence based on facts neither charged in the indictment nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Because Cabrera-Ruiz argued in his objections to the PSI and at sentencing that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely, </em>he raised a timely constitutional objection and is entitled to preserved error review. <em>See United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2001). We review preserved constitutional errors de novo, but \u201cwill reverse only for harmful error.\u201d <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250, 1272 (11th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">1. <em>Statutory Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for illegal reentry if a defendant was deported subsequent to being convicted of an aggravated felony. On the other hand, a defendant who was not deported subsequent to being convicted of an aggravated felony, and who does not satisfy any of the other requirements justifying an enhanced penalty under \u00a7 1326(b), is subject to a maximum of two years\u2019 imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Cabrera-Ruiz argues his prior aggravated felony conviction, which subjected him to the enhanced sentence of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), was neither alleged in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, thus violating the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">The Supreme Court determined an indictment in an illegal reentry case does not have to allege a defendant\u2019s prior aggravated felony conviction for a court to impose an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 1326(b). <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1232-33, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Here, the indictment charged Cabrera-Ruiz with illegal reentry after deportation, without alleging the fact he previously had been deported following a conviction for an aggravated felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the indictment does not have to allege a defendant\u2019s prior aggravated-felony conviction for a court to impose an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not err when it imposed a statutory sentence above the two-year statutory maximum sentence for \u00a7 1326(a) offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">2. <em>Guidelines Enhancement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Further, Cabrera-Ruiz claims the court violated his constitutional rights by sentencing him under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) because the conviction the court relied on in imposing this enhancement was neither alleged in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) provides \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States after \u2014 a conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less,\u201d the base offense level is increased 12 levels. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">Subsequent to the parties filing their briefs in this appeal, the Supreme Court concluded its holding in <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 755, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In discussing this holding, however, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Accordingly, insofar as the district court\u2019s enhancement of Cabrera-Ruiz\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) merely involved a determination that Cabrera-Ruiz had prior convictions, the enhancement did not implicate <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>or <em>Booker, </em>as those cases exempt prior convictions from the types of facts that must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order to support a sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">There is a potential <em>Booker </em>error in this case, however, because the district court sentenced Cabrera-Ruiz under a mandatory Guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Skelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (2005) (\u201c[T]he Supreme Court has now excised the mandatory nature of the Guidelines in <em>Booker. </em>Thus, we conclude it was <em>Booker </em>error for the district court to sentence Shelton under a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d). Because this case is being vacated and remanded for resentencing on another issue, however, we do not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">B. <em>Aggravated Felony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Cabrera-Ruiz next contends the district court erred in determining his conviction for delivery of cannabis was an aggravated felony. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Simon, </em>168 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.l999).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">A defendant who was removed subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony is subject to a 20-year statutory maximum sentence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The Code states an aggravated felony means \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). We have stated a state felony drug offense could qualify as an aggravated felony even though that same offense would not be a felony under the federal drug statutes. <em>Simon, </em>168 F.3d at 1272. The Florida Supreme Court has stated delivery of cannabis is a third degree felony under Florida law. <em>See Parker v. Florida, </em>406 So.2d 1089, 1091 (Fla.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Cabrera-Ruiz was convicted of a state court drug trafficking felony, delivery of cannabis, and that conviction can qualify as an aggravated felony even though it is not an aggravated felony under federal law. <em>See Simon, </em>168 F.3d at 1272; <em>Parker, </em>406 So.2d at 1091. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining his conviction was an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">C. <em>Government\u2019s Cross Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">The Government contends the district court erred in determining the conviction used to support the application of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) was the only prior conviction that could be used to support an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b). Section 1326(b)(2) provides an alien whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony shall not be imprisoned for more than 20 years. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes, in relevant part, a drug trafficking offense, or a crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment was at least one year. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), (F).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a base offense level of 8 for a conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>under \u00a7 1326(a). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The Guidelines further provide if the defendant was previously deported after a conviction for a felony that is \u201ca drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months,\u201d or \u201ca crime of violence,\u201d the offense level should be increased by 16 levels, and \u201ca conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less,\u201d the offense level should be increased by 12 levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), (ii), (B). The Application Notes define a crime of violence, in relevant part, as aggravated assault, and define a drug trafficking offense as \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii),(iv)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">As discussed above, Cabrera-Ruiz\u2019s conviction for delivery of cannabis is an aggra-. vated felony for purposes of establishing \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Cabrera-Ruiz\u2019s conviction for aggravated battery is not an aggravated felony, for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2), as he only served a nine-month sentence which did not meet the one year requirement of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Thus, Cabrera-Ruiz\u2019s conviction for delivery of cannabis is the only conviction that invokes the \u00a7 1326(b)(2) statutory maximum of 20 years. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Under the Guidelines, the delivery of cannabis conviction, for which Cabrera-Ruiz received a four month sentence, does not meet the requirements for a 16-level increase, but does meet the requirements for a 12-level increase. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), (B). However, Cabrera-Ruiz\u2019s conviction for aggravated battery is a crime of violence, such that the 16-level increase would apply. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), comment. (n.l(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The issue then becomes whether the conviction used to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) needs to be the same conviction that invokes the penalty provision in \u00a7 1326(b)(2). We have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">[Section] 2L1.2 is not dependent upon 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 and that a previous offense may be an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for the purpose of the 16-level enhancement in the guideline while not qualifying for the statutory enhancement at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).... While we agree that there is a difference between the definitions of \u201caggravated felony,\u201d that difference does not cause a conflict between the statute and the guideline or create an ambiguity as to what sentence applies to a conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayi\"><em>United States v. Lazo-Ortiz, </em>136 F.3d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir.1998). Therefore, Cabrera-Ruiz\u2019s conviction for delivery of cannabis, a felony drug trafficking crime, could be used to invoke the \u00a7 1326(b)(2) penalty provision, while his conviction for aggravated battery, a crime of violence, could be used to enhance his sentence by 16 levels under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Accordingly, the district court erred in concluding that Cabrera-Ruiz\u2019s conviction for delivery of cannabis was the only conviction that would determine the level of enhancement he would receive under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">The district court did not err in enhancing Cabrera-Ruiz\u2019s sentence under the statute or the Guidelines based on his past convictions. The district court also did not err in determining his state court conviction for delivery of cannabis was an aggravate^, felony. The district court erred, however, in its application of U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2(b) based on its belief the conviction used to support the enhanced penalty provision under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) was the only prior conviction that could be used to support a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b). We thus vacate and remand for resentencing. On remand, the district court should treat the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory as mandated by <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">. The indictment, however, did allege that Cabrera-Ruiz's reentry following deportation was in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
