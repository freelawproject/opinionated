Giddings, </em>No. 03-40421, 2004 WL 1814091 (5th Cir. Aug.16, 2004). He sought \u2014 and the Supreme Court granted \u2014 a writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">Edwards did not raise an objection to the constitutionality of his sentence in the district court, therefore, this court reviews the issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). Under plain error, this court may only correct a defendant\u2019s sentence if there is an: (1) error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) (\u201cA plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\u2019s attention.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">To show reversible plain error under <em>Booker, </em>the petitioner must \u201cdemonstrate! ] that the sentencing judge sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521. \u201c[I]f it is equally plausible that the error worked in favor of the defense, the defendant loses; if the effect of the error is uncertain so that we do not know which, if either, side is helped, the defendant loses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Edwards fails to demonstrate that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence had the Guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory. Indeed, while the Guidelines permitted a sentence as low as 188 months, the court sentenced Edwards to 192 months confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-19\">Accordingly, we conclude that nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision requires us to change our prior affirmance in this case. We therefore reinstate our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>judgment affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
