Jemerson was serving a three year term of supervised release consequent to serving a fifty-one month sentence for aiding and abetting cocaine base distribution. After Jemerson admitted to violating the conditions of his supervised release by testing positive for controlled substances on three occasions, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>court revoked his term of supervised release and sentenced him to fourteen months in prison. In this appeal, Jemerson contends that the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004), specifically his need for substance abuse treatment, when it revoked his supervised release and when it found that his failed drug tests resulted in a Grade B violation. Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s order imposing a term of imprisonment after revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). The district court abuses its discretion when it fails or refuses to exercise its discretion or when its exercise of discretion is flawed by an erroneous legal or factual premise. <em>James v. Jacobson, </em>6 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1993). In exercising this discretion, the district court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West Supp.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Section 3553(a)(2)(D) states that in determining a particular sentence, the court \u201cshall consider ... the need for the sentence imposed ... to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other corrective treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). Under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(g)(1) (West Supp.2004), revocation of supervised release is mandatory if the- defendant, like Jemerson, possessed a controlled substance in violation of the terms of his supervised release. However, \u201c[t]he court shall consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse programs, or an individual\u2019s current or past participation in such programs, warrants an exception ... from the rule of Section 3583(g).\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(d) (West Supp.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">In considering the proper sentence to impose, the district court heard evidence of Jemerson\u2019s prior treatment for drug abuse and the potential for his participation in an in-patient treatment program. We find that implicit in the district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release and impose a prison term was its consideration and rejection of Jemerson\u2019s argument in favor of his placement in an in-patient substance abuse program in lieu of revocation of supervised release. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">We also conclude that the district court did not commit plain error by finding that Jemerson\u2019s failed drug tests resulted in a Grade B violation under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2) (2004).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> First, we note that Jemerson\u2019s argument is premised on the policy statements of Chapter Seven of the federal sentencing guidelines, which are advisory and nonbinding. <em>Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 642. Second, a Grade B violation consists of conduct that constitutes any federal, state, or local offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that is not defined as a Grade A violation. USSG \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2). Intentional use of a controlled substance is sufficient to establish possession. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>30 F.3d 23, 25 (4th Cir.1994) (finding voluntary and knowing ingestion constitutes possession). Because of Jemerson\u2019s prior drug-related conviction, his possession of controlled substances would subject him to a term of imprisonment exceeding one year. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2000). Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>cordingly, Jemerson\u2019s conduct resulted in a Grade B violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-7\"> Counsel raised this issue pursuant to <em>Anders v.
