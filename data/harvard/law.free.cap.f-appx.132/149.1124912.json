The Paper Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union, Local 8-0369, pursued a grievance on Jackson\u2019s behalf, and the arbitrator ordered the reinstatement of Jackson because the Company lacked \u201cproper cause\u201d to terminate his employment. The Company filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award on the grounds that (1) the award violates the public policy of encouraging harassment victims to come forward, and (2) the arbitrator did not explicitly find that Jack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>son was amenable to lesser discipline and therefore unlikely to continue harassing co-workers. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to vacate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">We generally regard an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement as the final word on the meaning of the contract \u201cbecause both employer and union have granted to the arbitrator the authority to interpret the meaning of their contract\u2019s language, including such words as \u2018just cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>E. Associated Coal Corp. v. United Mine Workers of Am., Dist. 17, </em>531 U.S. 57, 61, 121 S.Ct. 462, 148 L.Ed.2d 354 (2000). The extremely narrow \u201cpublic policy\u201d exception to this general rule does not apply because the arbitrator\u2019s decision to order Jackson\u2019s reinstatement does not violate an \u201cexplicit, well defined, and dominant\u201d public policy. <em>Id., </em>531 U.S. at 62, 121 S.Ct. 462 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although strong public policy supports the prevention and reporting of harassment in the work force, no law, regulation, or precedent requires the Company to fire Jackson, without progressive discipline, for one allegation of harassment. <em>See Stead Motors of Walnut Creek v. Auto. Machinists Lodge No. 1173, </em>886 F.2d 1200, 1212 (9th Cir.1989) (en banc) (\u201cIf a court relies on public policy to vacate an arbitral award reinstating an employee, it must be a policy that bars <em>reinstatement. </em>\u201d) (emphasis in original). Consequently, it cannot be argued that the arbitrator lacked authority to reinstate Jackson after his first offense and an 18-month suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">This circuit has not established a rule requiring a finding of amenability to lesser discipline as a predicate to an award of reinstatement. <em>See id. </em>at 1213. Even if the circuit so required, the arbitrator implicitly (if not explicitly) found that Jackson\u2019s behavior was correctable and that progressive discipline was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">AFFIRMED. The motion for attorneys\u2019 fees is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-5\">. We review de novo the confirmation of an arbitration award. See <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 947-48, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995); <em>Poweragent, Inc. v. Elec. Data Sys. Corp., </em>358 F.3d 1187, 1193 (9th Cir.2004) (noting review of the award is \u201cboth limited and highly deferential'') (internal quotation marks omitted). We defer to a labor arbitrator's award \u201cas long as the arbitrator even arguably construed] or appl[ied] the contract.\u201d <em>Teamsters Local Union 58 v.
