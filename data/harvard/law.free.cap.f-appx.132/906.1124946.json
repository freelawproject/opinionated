We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, underlying proceedings, and specification of appellate issues, and hold as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-21\">(1) Relying on <em>Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140 (2d Cir.2003), Lin argues that the immigration judge erroneously discredited her testimony that she was a Falun Gong practitioner based on the paucity of the detail she offered concerning Falun Gong practices. This argument fails for two reasons. First, the immigration judge reached no conclusion as to whether Qiu practiced Falun Gong. Second, we said in <em>Qiu </em>that an immigration judge faced with vague testimony \u201cmay fairly wonder whether the testimony is fabricated\u201d and suggested that under such circumstances the immigration judge may wish to probe for further details. <em>Id. </em>In this case, the immigration judge did probe for further details and Lin was unable to supply any.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">(2) The immigration judge (1) permissibly drew an inference that Lin claimed that police seeking to arrest her at her workplace had been deterred by a closed door and (2) correctly rejected this claim as implausible. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-23\">(3) Although the record contains evidence that China persecutes and sometimes tortures Falun Gong adherents, the immigration judge permissibly found that Lin failed to establish past persecution on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>the basis of her membership in Falun Gong. Absent credited evidence that the government knew of Lin\u2019s purported Falun Gong membership, there is no basis for arguing that Lin established that she had a well-founded fear of future persecution, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), that her life or freedom would be threatened on the basis of Falun Gong membership, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), or that she would more likely than not be tortured if she returned to China, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">(4) We have considered Lin\u2019s remaining contentions and found that they lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">We therefore deny Lin\u2019s petition for review. The disposition of this appeal vacates the stay of removal previously entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
