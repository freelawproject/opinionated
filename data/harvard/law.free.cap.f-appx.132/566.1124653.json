After the Michigan state courts denied Wilson post-conviction relief, Wilson filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming: (1) there was insufficient evidence at trial to convict him of first-degree murder and assault with intent to murder; (2) prosecutorial misconduct denied him a fair trial; (3) he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial; and (4) he was denied effective assistance of counsel on appeal. The district court denied the petition, and this court granted a certificate of appealability as to the first three issues in Wilson\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-19\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), an application for writ of habeas corpus should not be granted unless a state court adjudication resulted in a decision that (1) \u201cwas contrary to ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of United States,\u201d or (2) involved an \u201cunreasonable application of ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d Having studied the record on appeal and the briefs of the parties, we are not persuaded that the district court erred in holding that the decisions of the Michigan courts upholding Wilson\u2019s convictions on both direct and collateral review were neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Because the reasons for this determination were fully articulated by the district court, the issuance of a detailed opinion by this court would be duplicative and would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court on the basis of the reasoning set out by that court in its opinion and order entered on January 9, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-16\">.
