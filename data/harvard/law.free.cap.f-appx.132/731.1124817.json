See <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In his plea agreement, Palmer \u201cwaive[d] the right to appeal ... any sentence within the maximum provided in the statute(s) of conviction or the manner in which that sentence was determined.\u201d This appeal waiver is valid, even though it was entered before <em>Booker. See United States v. Cardenas, </em>405 F.3d 1046, 1047 (9th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>67 F.3d 200, 202 \u2014 03 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-24\">Palmer\u2019s appeal waiver did contain an exception in the event the district court \u201cin imposing sentence departs (as that term is used in Park K of the Sentencing Guidelines) upward from the guideline range determined by the Court to be applicable.\u201d The district court did not depart upward from the guideline range it calculated. Rather, Palmer objects to what the court included as relevant conduct in computing that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-25\">Because the district court imposed a fifteen-month term, which is within the three-year maximum provided in the statute of conviction, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206, and did not depart upward in doing so, we lack jurisdiction to consider Palmer\u2019s appeal. <em>See United States v. Anglin, </em>215 F.3d 1064, 1065 \u2014 68 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-26\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b763-28\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
