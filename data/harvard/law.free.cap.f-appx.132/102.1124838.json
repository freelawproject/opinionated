Scott filed a motion to suppress evidence and statements, which the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied. Through counsel, Scott waived his right to a jury trial and requested permission to proceed pro se. He was permitted to proceed pro se with his former attorney as standby counsel, and after a bench trial, the court denied Scott\u2019s motions for a judgment of acquittal and found him guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) prepared by the United States Probation Office grouped the two counts and recommended a base offense level of 32, based on a total quantity of 115.4 grams of pseudoephedrine, a two-level increase because Scott had possessed a firearm, and a two-level increase because Scott was the organizer of the drug activity. The PSR also recommended a Category IV criminal history based on seven points, including three points for a 1991 four-year sentence for burglary and stealing, and two points each for two concurrent 1995 sentences for stealing. These proposed findings resulted in a guideline range of 262-327 months\u2019 imprisonment. Scott disputed the PSR\u2019s drug-quantity finding, both offense-level enhancements, and the assessment of three points for his 1991 sentence. At sentencing, he also asserted that he was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The court found that Scott was responsible for 157.4 grams of pseudoephedrine, that both offense-level increases were appropriate, and that Scott was not entitled to an acceptance of responsibility reduction. The district court sentenced Scott to 296 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">Counsel for Scott has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), suggesting that the district court erred in denying Scott\u2019s motion to suppress statements made before and after his arrest, and evidence seized from his vehicle pursuant to a consent search and an inventory search. Counsel also suggests that the district court erred by denying Scott\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. Counsel renews Scott\u2019s objection to several sentencing decisions, including the drug quantity calculation, the role enhancement, the assessment of criminal history points for the 1991 offense, and the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. In a pro se supplemental brief, Scott argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and in an additional supplemental brief which he has moved for leave to file, he argues that the sentence violated his Sixth Amendment rights based on the reasoning of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-17\">The encounter between Scott and law enforcement officers occurred after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Missouri Highway Patrol corporal, Perry Hazelwood, overheard a police dispatch concerning a suspicious purchase of pseudoephedrine pills at a Target store. Hazelwood conducted an immediate investigation of the purchase, and then located at a convenience store the vehicle in which the purchaser was observed leaving the store. When Hazelwood encountered the driver of the vehicle, defendant Scott, in the convenience store, he told Scott that he \u201cneed[ed] to talk to [him] about [the vehicle].\u201d During a conversation outside the store, Scott admitted buying the pseudoephedrine pills, but claimed they were for a cold. Hazelwood requested consent to search the vehicle, and according to the officer, Scott consented. Upon finding evidence of methamphetamine manufacture in the vehicle, Hazelwood placed Scott under arrest. After he was administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the police station, Scott made admissions regarding the purchase of the pills. In the meantime, the state patrol conducted an inventory search of Scott\u2019s vehicle, and discovered more evidence of illegal drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We believe that the district court properly denied Scott\u2019s motion to suppress his pre-arrest statements at the convenience store and the evidence obtained from his vehicle pursuant to the consent search. Corporal Hazelwood testified that he did not force or otherwise coerce Scott into stepping outside and answering his questions, and the district court was entitled to credit this testimony over Scott\u2019s conflicting version. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>281 F.3d 746, 748 (8th Cir.2002) (credibility determinations of district court are \u201cvirtually unreviewable\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Drayton, </em>536 U.S. 194, 201, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002) (\u201cEven when law enforcement officers have no basis for suspecting a particular individual, they may pose questions, ask for identification, and request consent to search ... provided they do not induce cooperation by coercive means.\u201d). Hazelwood also testified that Scott \u201cresponded positively\u201d and \u201cdid not seem to [have] any objection\u201d when asked for permission to search his vehicle, and this testimony supports the district court\u2019s finding that Scott consented to the search even though a written consent form was not executed. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>254 F.3d 692, 695 (8th Cir.2001) (\u201cConsent can be inferred from words, gestures, and other conduct\u201d); <em>United States v. Chaidez, </em>906 F.2d 377, 381-82 (8th Cir.1990) (\u201ca search may be justified by a voluntary oral consent even in the absence of a valid written consent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We also conclude that the district court properly denied Scott\u2019s motion to suppress statements made after Scott\u2019s arrest, and evidence uncovered during the inventory search of his car. The record included Hazelwood\u2019s testimony that his search of Scott\u2019s vehicle revealed coffee filters, aluminum foil, plastic tubing, and a cooler that smelled of ether, and the testimony of Officer Alford, who advised Scott of his rights and testified that Scott indicated that he understood and waived those rights. This testimony supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hazelwood had probable cause to arrest Scott and that Scott\u2019s subsequent incriminating statements and actions were voluntary and made with the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See United States v. Syslo, </em>303 F.3d 860, 865 (8th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (waiver of Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is voluntary if it is product of free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception); <em>United States v. McClain, </em>171 F.3d 1168, 1170 (8th Cir.1999) (existence of probable cause to make warrantless arrest depends on whether, at moment arrest was made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>facts and circumstances within officer\u2019s knowledge were sufficient for prudent man to believe defendant had committed or was committing crime); <em>cf. United States v. Nation, </em>243 F.3d 467, 469-70 (8th Cir.2001) (observation of items including used coffee filters, plastic and glassware, along with odor of ether, \u201craised sufficient suspicion of criminal activity to support a finding of probable cause\u201d for issuance of search warrant). It is also clear that the police had authority to inventory the vehicle after Scott was arrested. <em>See Colorado v. Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 371-72, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We also believe that the record supports the district court\u2019s denial of Scott\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. Scott stipulated at trial that he was a convicted felon, and that the rifle found in his vehicle had previously traveled in and affected interstate commerce. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). The trial testimony of both Officer Hazel-wood and Officer Alford also demonstrated that Scott admitted buying pseudoephedrine and intending to use it to manufacture methamphetamine. The verdict is entitled to all reasonable inferences, <em>United States v. Stroh, </em>176 F.3d 439, 440 (8th Cir.1999), and this testimony amply supports Scott\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\"> Scott also raises several objections to the district court\u2019s calculation of the appropriate guidelines range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We find these objections to be without merit. The trial and sentencing testimony of both Corporal Hazelwood and Officer Alford, which the district court credited, demonstrated that 55.4 grams of pseudoephedrine had been found hidden in a doghouse, that Scott admitted he intended to use that pseudoephedrine to make methamphetamine, and that Scott admitted to prior manufactures that would have required an estimated 102 grams of pure pseudoephedrine. This testimony supports the court\u2019s determination that Scott should be held accountable for 157.4 grams of pseudoephedrine. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>258 F.3d 788, 790-91 (8th Cir.2001) (at sentencing, court may consider drug transactions which were part of regular pattern or scheme of drug activity). The district court\u2019s decision to impose a two-level enhancement based on Scott\u2019s leadership role in the drug offense was not clearly erroneous, because during the course of the trial and the sentencing hearing, both Hazel-wood and Alford testified that Scott told them another person had assisted him in making methamphetamine by obtaining precursors and acting as a look-out. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c); <em>United States v. Yerkes, </em>345 F.3d 558, 563 (8th Cir.2003) (government need only prove that defendant controlled at least one other participant in drug offense to impose two-level role enhancement; role enhancement was proper where, according to testimony, at least two others had bought methamphetamine precursors for him at his request).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Further, the district court did not clearly err in denying an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.2) (reduction not intended to apply to defendant who puts government to its burden at trial by denying essential factual elements of guilt), and Scott was properly assessed three criminal history points for his 1991 sentence for burglary and stealing. Although Scott served less than one year of his four-year sentence, criminal history points are assessed based on the sentence pronounced, not the time served. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">In light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we agree with Scott that the district court\u2019s application of mandatory sentencing guidelines, combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>with its findings concerning drug quantity and role in the offense, was contrary to the Sixth Amendment as applied in <em>Booker. </em>Scott did not raise a Sixth Amendment objection in the district court, however, and we thus review his sentence under the plain error standard. We find that Scott\u2019s substantial rights were not affected by the court\u2019s erroneous application of mandatory sentencing guidelines, because the record as a whole does not establish a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that he would have received a more favorable sentence had the court considered the guidelines as advisory. <em>See United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 553, slip op. at 11 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc). The guidelines recommended a sentence between 262 and 327 months, and the district court imposed a sentence of 296 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because this sentence is at the middle of the guideline range, and we have no other reason based on the record to believe the court would have imposed a more favorable sentence had it understood that the guidelines were only advisory, we determine that Scott has failed to show that his substantial rights were affected by the court\u2019s erroneous application of the mandatory guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Scott\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance is properly addressed in a habeas corpus proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Santana, </em>150 F.3d 860, 863 (8th Cir.1998) (appeals court will consider ineffective-assistance claim on direct appeal only in exceptional cases in which record on ineffectiveness issue exists or where result would otherwise be miscarriage of justice). Although Scott has elected to proceed pro se on appeal with counsel apparently acting on a \u201cstandby\u201d basis, we nonetheless have conducted an independent review of the record under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we find no other nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, Scott\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief is granted, and we affirm. We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on the condition that counsel complies with Part V of this court\u2019s Amended Criminal Justice Act Plan.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-12\">.
