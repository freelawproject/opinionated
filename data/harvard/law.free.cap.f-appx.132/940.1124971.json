Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 182, 183 (2d Cir.2003). Substantial evidence is \u201c \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">\u201cDisability\u201d is defined by the Act, in relevant part, as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period <em>of not less than 12 months.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A) (emphasis supplied). An individual can be found disabled under the Act \u201conly if [her] physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that [s]he is not only unable to do [her] previous work but cannot, considering [her] age, education, and work experience, engage in any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). The claimant bears the burden of proving that she suffers from a disability and that her impairment prevents her from returning to her prior employment. <em>See Balsamo v. Chater, </em>142 F.3d 75, 79-80 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Reviewing the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Malone was not entitled to disability benefits because the medical evidence in the record demonstrated that Malone \u201cwas capable of at least sedentary and probably light work, within less than 12 months after her alleged onset date and after her motor vehicle accident.\u201d ALJ Decision at 4. Malone\u2019s past work was in fact sedentary in nature, and therefore she failed to establish that she was unable to return to her past work due to the impairment. In reaching his determination, the ALJ also considered Malone\u2019s testimony regarding her pain and other limitations, but properly concluded that Malone\u2019s allegations were not credible, as they were not supported by the \u201cobjective medical evidence\u201d and \u201cin fact were substantially contradicted by the opinions and assessments of treating specialists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
