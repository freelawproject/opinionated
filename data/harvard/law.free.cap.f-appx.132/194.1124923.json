MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b226-25\">After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this court has deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>mined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Appellant Julius Stewart, a state prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 asserting that Defendants violated his constitutional right to due process when they implemented disciplinary sanctions resulting in the termination of his ability to earn good time credits. Stewart sought both the restoration of good time credits and monetary damages. The district court dismissed Stewart\u2019s complaint without prejudice, concluding that an action seeking the restoration of good time credits must be brought under the habeas corpus statutes with exhaustion of state remedies required. <em>See United States v. Furman, </em>112 F.3d 435, 438 (10th Cir.1997). The court further concluded that Stewart\u2019s claims for damages were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) and <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Stewart then filed the instant appeal together with a request to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis. </em>In his appellate brief, Stewart does not address the grounds upon which the district court dismissed his complaint but, instead, presents arguments challenging his underlying conviction and sentence. Having reviewed the record, Stewart\u2019s appellate brief, and the applicable law, we conclude that the dismissal of Stewart\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint was proper. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Stewart\u2019s complaint without prejudice is affirmed for substantially the reasons stated by the district court in its Memorandum Opinion and Order dated June 30, 2004. Stewart\u2019s motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>is granted. Stewart is reminded that he remains obligated to continue making partial payments until his appellate filing fee is paid in full. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b226-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
