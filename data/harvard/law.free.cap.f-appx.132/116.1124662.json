We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-25\">\u201c[T]he scope of an investigative detention must be carefully tailored to its underlying justification, and may last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>of the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Chavez-Valenzuela, </em>268 F.3d 719, 724 (9th Cir.2001). An officer may, however, expand the scope of his inquiry beyond matters reasonably related to the stop \u201cif he notices particularized, objective factors arousing his suspicion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Under the totality of the circumstances presented in this case, reasonable suspicion existed to justify the additional inquiries made during the course of the traffic stop: the absence of the car\u2019s registered owner, the overwhelming smell of the air freshener, the misalignment of the airbag compartment with the car\u2019s console, and Ringgold\u2019s extreme nervousness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d 464, 468-70 (9th Cir.2000). Ring-gold\u2019s responses to the initial inquiries, in particular Ringgold\u2019s explanation of his travel route and plans, and the officers\u2019 discovery that Ringgold had previously been detained as a passenger in a truck in which $660,000 in cash was found in a hidden compartment provided further justification for the officers\u2019 additional questioning of Ringgold following the formal completion of the traffic stop. Because reasonable suspicion existed, the validity of the officers\u2019 additional inquiries does not depend on the encounter being consensual. <em>See Chavez-Valenzuela, </em>268 F.3d at 724-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Ringgold contends that even if the officers\u2019 initial questioning was constitutionally valid, his subsequent consent to a search of the car was not voluntary and therefore invalid. Specifically, Ringgold contends the coercive environment and the threat of a dog sniff undermined the voluntariness of his consent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">A search conducted pursuant to a person\u2019s consent, voluntarily given in light of the totality of the circumstances, is constitutionally permissible. <em>Schneekloth v. Bustamante, </em>412 U.S. 218, 222, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). We consider several factors to determine the voluntariness of consent including: whether the defendant was in custody; whether the arresting officers had their guns drawn; whether Miranda warnings were given; whether the defendant was notified that he had a right not to consent; and whether the defendant had been told a search warrant could be obtained. <em>United States v. Patayan Soriano, </em>361 F.3d 494, 502 (9th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Applying these factors to the circumstances of this case reveals Ringgold\u2019s consent was indeed voluntary. Even if we were to assume that Ringgold was in custody during the period in which he was pressed to give his consent to the search, the remainder of the relevant factors indicate voluntary consent. The arresting officers did not have their guns drawn, nor is there any suggestion that their weapons were prominently displayed. Miranda warnings were not given; however, the encounter was, at most, a Terry stop for which Miranda warnings are not required. <em>See Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 440, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984); <em>United States v. Bautista, </em>684 F.2d 1286, 1291 (9th Cir.1982). Ringgold was also fully and repeatedly advised of his right to refuse consent. That Ringgold understood this right is evident from his colloquies with the officers. <em>See Patayan-Soriano, </em>361 F.3d at 504. Although the officers did threaten to conduct a \u201cfree dog sniff\u2019 of the car with a narcotics dog, the threat of a lawful dog sniff did not render Ring-gold\u2019s consent involuntary. <em>See Illinois v. Caballes, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 834, 838, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005); <em>United States v. Todhunter, </em>297 F.3d 886, 891 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">We conclude that the officers had reasonable suspicion to justify broadening the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>scope of their questioning, and the search was conducted pursuant to Ringgold\u2019s voluntary consent. Accordingly, Ringgold\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
