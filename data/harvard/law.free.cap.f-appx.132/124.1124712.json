We have jurisdiction pursuant to <em>8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review an adverse credibility determination for substantial evidence, <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by Patatanyan\u2019s failure to produce evidence that she is a practicing Jehovah\u2019s Witness, despite her testimony that she had attended services three times a week for several months in the United States. <em>See Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 723-24 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The IJ was reasonable in requiring corroborating evidence given inconsistencies in Patatanyan\u2019s testimony, her \u201cnon-responsive\u201d demeanor, and the fact that another asylum application with an entirely different legal and factual basis had been submitted on Patatanyan\u2019s behalf. <em>See Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that \u201cwhere the IJ has reason to question the applicant\u2019s credibility, and the applicant fails to produce nonduplicative, material, easily available corroborating evidence and provides no credible explanation for such failure, an adverse credibility finding will withstand appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Because Patatanyan failed to demonstrate that she was eligible for asylum, it necessarily follows that she failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. </em>As<em>chroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Because Patatanyan also failed to credibly demonstrate that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to Armenia, the IJ properly denied relief under the CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b157-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
