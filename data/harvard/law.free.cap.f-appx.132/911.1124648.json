The BIA summarily affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying Lin\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal, denying him relief under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and ordering his removal from the United States. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, decision below, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Where the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ directly. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We generally treat an IJ\u2019s credibility determination as a factual finding subject to the substantial evidence standard, <em>id. </em>at 307, and reverse only where \u201cno reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find the past persecution or fear of future persecution necessary to sustain the petitioner\u2019s burden,\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000). Board precedent supports adverse credibility findings based on \u201cinconsistent statements, contradictory evidence, and inherently improbable testimony.\u201d <em>Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 152 n. 6 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">At an airport interview upon his arrival in the country, Lin initially stated that he faced religious persecution because he practiced Falun Gong. When the interviewer questioned him more closely, Lin admitted that he did not practice Falun Gong but claimed that he would be \u201cbeaten up\u201d if he returned to China because he lived illegally with his girlfriend. Lin also indicated that his purpose in coming to the country was \u201cto work.\u201d In his subsequent asylum application, Lin claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution because his mother had been sterilized and because his family had faced discrimination because of his parents\u2019 violation of China\u2019s family planning laws. In support of this claim, Lin submitted identification documents, a second-hand medical opinion (based on an X-ray allegedly taken of Lin\u2019s mother) that Lin\u2019s mother\u2019s fallopian tubes had been tied, and an affidavit from Lin\u2019s mother that she had been forcibly sterilized. Lin also claimed protection under the CAT, on the ground that illegal emigres are regularly jailed, and have reportedly been tortured, upon their return to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">The IJ found that Lin was not a credible witness, because of certain inconsistencies in his testimony and because he admittedly lied twice in his airport interview. The IJ further found that, even assuming the truth of Lin\u2019s testimony with respect to the discrimination he faced growing up, this discrimination had not amounted to persecution. In affirming the IJ\u2019s order, the BIA cited, with respect to Lin\u2019s CAT claim, the most recent State Department Report on China, which indicated a policy of imprisonment upon a <em>second, </em>not a first, repatriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">Upon review of the record, we find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was based on substantial evidence. Put differently, a reasonable factfinder could conclude, as did the IJ, that, because Lin lied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>twice in the past about his reasons for seeking asylum, his current account was fabricated. With respect to Lin\u2019s CAT claim, we note that the State Department\u2019s 2004 report continues to report a policy of imprisonment only after the second repatriation. We have considered Lin\u2019s remaining arguments on this appeal and find that each of them is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">For the foregoing reasons the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
