Thomas argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence underlying his convictions. Specifically, Thomas contends that investigating officers lacked reasonable suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>to conduct a pat-down search. Thomas further challenges the officers\u2019 credibility, asserting that they testified to facts supporting the search for the first time at the hearing on the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The evidence presented at the suppression hearing supports the district court\u2019s finding that the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct a pat-down search. <em>See United States v. Webster, </em>162 F.3d 308, 332 (5th Cir.1998). Because we will not disturb the district court\u2019s witness credibility findings, we reject Thomas\u2019s challenge to the veracity of the officers\u2019 suppression hearing testimony. <em>United States v. Garza, </em>118 F.3d 278, 282-83 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
