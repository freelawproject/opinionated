He was sentenced to 77 months in custody and three years of supervised release. Before trial, Diaz-Guerro moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that he had obtained derivative citizenship of the United States pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 (1982) through his mother\u2019s naturalization. The district court denied the motion, ruling that because this was a factual dispute, and because the government had to prove that Diaz-Guerrero was an alien for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, Diaz-Guerrero should submit a proposed jury instruction regarding his citizenship. After Diaz-Guerrero submitted the proposed jury instruction, the district court, relying upon <em>Schneider v. INS, </em>65 F.Supp. 377, 380 (W.D.Wash.1946), <em>aff'd sub nom., </em>161 F.2d 1022 (9th Cir.1947), held that Diaz-Guerrero could not show citizenship as a matter of law, because he had neither legally entered nor was legally residing in the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>ed States. The court therefore rejected Diaz-Guerrero\u2019s proposed instruction. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate Diaz-Guerrero\u2019s conviction and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The government and Diaz-Guerrero agree that the 1982 version of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 governs this case; they dispute, however, whether Diaz-Guerrero can show citizenship under this statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsection (5) provides that a child born outside the United States of alien parents may become a citizen if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">such child is residing in the United States pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of naturalization of the parent last naturalized ... or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the United States while under the age of eighteen years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The proposed jury instruction stated that if Diaz-Guerrero</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">was not born in the United States, he acquired U.S. citizenship if both of the following conditions are satisfied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\"><em>First: </em>The defendant\u2019s mother naturalized as a U.S. citizen before the defendant\u2019s 18th birthday; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\"><em>Second: </em>The defendant began permanently residing in the United States after his mother became a U.S. citizen and before his 18th birthday. If you find the defendant acquired citizenship of the United States, you must vote to acquit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-13\">Relying upon <em>Schneider </em>for \u201cthe proposition that \u2018reside permanently\u2019 means to reside legally,\u201d the district judge rejected Diaz-Guerrero\u2019s proposed jury instruction because he did not \u201csee anything in [Diaz-Guerrero\u2019s] evidence ... that could support a finding by the jury that [he] ever resided legally in the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWv\">\u201cThe starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself. Absent congressional direction to the contrary, words in statutes are to be construed according to their ordinary, contemporary, common meaningfs].\u201d <em>United States v. Hackett, </em>311 F.3d 989, 991-92 (9th Cir.2002) (internal citations and quotations omitted). The 1982 version of Subsection (5) of the statute was written in the disjunctive. While in the first clause of the subsection Congress limited citizenship to those individuals \u201cresiding in the United States pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of naturalization of the parent last naturalized,\u201d in the second clause Congress omitted the \u201clawful admission\u201d language and simply stated that a minor may gain citizenship if he \u201cthereafter begins to reside permanently in the United States while under the age of eighteen years.\u201d No legal status is mentioned in this clause. \u201cIt is a \u2018well-established canon of statutory interpretation that the use of different words or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>terms within a statute demonstrates that Congress intended to convey a different meaning for those-words,\u2019 and [the court] must assume that the difference in usage is legally significant.\u201d <em>Padash v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 1161, 1169 n. 7 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>SEC v. McCarthy, </em>322 F.3d 650, 656 (9th Cir.2003)). If Congress intended to limit derivative citizenship to those with a legal status, it could have plainly stated so.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Indeed, the definitions of \u201cpermanent\u201d and \u201cresidence\u201d that accompany the 1982 statute belie a requirement of legal residency. The definitions state that the \u201cterm \u2018residence\u2019 means the place of general abode,\u201d and the \u201cterm \u2018permanent\u2019 means a relationship of continuing or lasting nature, as distinguished from temporary, but a relationship may be permanent <em>even though it is one that may be dissolved eventually at the instance ... of the United States.\u201d </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\"><em>Schneider </em>is inapposite. Although the court in <em>Schneider </em>discussed the meaning of permanent residence, 65 F.Supp. at 379-80, the naturalization statute examined there was not the same statute at issue in this case, and did not include the disjunctive language giving rise to the interpretation that lawful entry or residence was required by the statute before us. The district court thus erred in relying upon <em>Schneider, </em>and in ruling that Diaz-Guerrero was not entitled to his requested jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">Because we hold that Diaz-Guerrero\u2019s conviction must be vacated, we do not reach his arguments regarding sentencing. REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b771-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-10\">. The government also contests Diaz-Guerrero\u2019s other proffered facts, including whether Sara Diaz, whose citizenship papers were before the court, is his mother. However, the government argued that even if all other facts were true, Diaz-Guerrero could not prevail on his derivative citizenship claim, because he could not meet the requirements of clause 5 of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-11\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 (1982), which contained the language at issue here, was repealed by Act of Oct. 30. 2000. Pub.L. No. 106-395. Title I, \u00a7 103(a), 114 Stat. 1631, and has been replaced by revised statute 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433, which entirely eliminates the \"or thereafter begins to reside permanently\u201d portion of subsection 5. Subsection 5 has now been modified to explicitly make lawful admission a requirement for citizenship. It reads: \"The child is temporarily present in the United States pursuant to a lawful admission, and is maintaining such lawful status.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1433(a)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
