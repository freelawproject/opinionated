Consistent with the BIA\u2019s ruling in <em>Matter of C-Y-Z-, </em>1997 WL 353222, 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 915 (B.IA.1997) (in banc), Dong contended that he was entitled to relief as the spouse of a person who was forced to undergo sterilization. <em>See </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 915 (recognizing that an \u201calien whose spouse was forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization procedure can establish past persecution on account of political opinion and qualifies as a refugee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The IJ denied Dong\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal based on his finding that Dong was not credible, that Dong\u2019s testimony was internally inconsistent, that Dong had \u201ctestified ... as if he was reciting from a memorized script, not as if he was responding to specific questions from his own personal memories and experiences,\u201d and that Dong\u2019s application, testimony, and documentary evidence contained material inconsistencies and omissions which Dong had not satisfactorily explained. The IJ noted that Dong\u2019s credibility was further undermined by Dong\u2019s admissions (1) that he had obtained passports through fraudulent means both in the United States and China and (2) that sworn statements he had made in support of a 1993 application for advanced parole, which Dong attributed to a \u201cnon-attorney travel agent,\u201d were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">In addition, the IJ asserted that Dong\u2019s testimony, even if credible, may not have rendered him eligible for relief under <em>CY-Z- </em>because Dong\u2019s marriage had not been registered at the time of his wife\u2019s forced sterilization and that, therefore, Dong \u201cwas not in fact the legal spouse\u201d within the meaning of <em>C-Y-Z-. Compare Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 221, 223 (3d Cir.2004) (affirming the BIA\u2019s determination that <em>C-Y-Z- </em>does not apply to \u201c \u2018unmarried partners\u2019 \u201d), <em>with Ma v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 553, 559 (9th Cir.2004) (declining to defer to the BIA\u2019s ruling and holding that \u201chusbands, whose marriages are denied recognition by virtue of [China\u2019s] population control program [minimum age requirements] ..., may [not] be deprived of eligibility for asylum on the basis of that denial\u201d). In affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, the BIA did not specifically address whether Dong would have been eligible for relief under <em>C-Y-Z- </em>if his testimony had been credible, but stated only that it \u201cadopt[ed] and affirm[ed] the Immigration Judge\u2019s February 1, 1999, decision for the reasons set forth therein.\u2019.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">We defer to the IJ\u2019s factual findings as long as they are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d and we will reverse only if no reasonable factfinder could have reached the same conclusion. <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000). Upon our review of the record, we hold that the IJ\u2019s determination \u2014 that Dong, due to his lack of credibility, failed to establish either past persecution or a reasonable fear of future persecution based on his opposition to China\u2019s family planning polices \u2014 is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 67 (2d Cir.2004) (affirming denial of asylum under the substantial evidence standard where the IJ found that the asylum applicant had \u201c \u2018not presented consistent, detailed or credible testimony\u2019 to support his claim of persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Because we so hold, we do not reach, or express any view upon, the question of whether Dong would have been eligible for relief under <em>C-Y-Z- </em>if he had credibly testified that his wife was forcibly sterilized in 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Having considered all of petitioner\u2019s arguments and found each of them to be without merit, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-6\">. In his asylum application, Dong stated that, although he and his wife had a \u201ctraditional Chinese ceremony in December 1975,\u201d they did not register their marriage until 1990. Dong said that they avoided registering their marriage because \"registered marriages were subjected to the birth control policy of the government\u201d and he wanted \"to have more children\u201d than the policy permitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
