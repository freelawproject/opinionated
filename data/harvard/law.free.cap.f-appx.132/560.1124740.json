Rodriguez did not file a notice of appeal from the judgment entered June 10, 2002. Instead, almost two years later, Rodriguez filed a pro se motion for an out-of-time appeal, which the district court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\">\u201c[A] district court does <em>not </em>have the authority to create appellate jurisdiction simply by ordering an out-of-time direct criminal appeal. Compliance with the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure is imperative.\u201d <em>United States v. West, </em>240 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2001). <em>West </em>addresses the proper procedures for granting an out-of-time appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See id. </em>at 459-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-25\">We therefore VACATE the district court\u2019s order granting the out-of-time appeal, and we REMAND the case. On remand, the district court should treat Rodriguez\u2019s motion for an out-of-time appeal in accordance with <em>West </em>and <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-26\">ORDER VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b592-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
