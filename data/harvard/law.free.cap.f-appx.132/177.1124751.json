Penney Insurance Company on her claims of breach of contract and bad faith denial of benefits under an insurance contract. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, <em>see Buono v. Norton, </em>371 F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir.2004), and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Mrs. O\u2019Connell filed a claim for benefits under an accidental death and disability policy issued by J.C. Penney on her husband Richard O\u2019Connell, who died while hospitalized for a broken hip he sustained when he fell while exiting a bus. The immediate cause of Mr. O\u2019Connell\u2019s death was pneumonia, which developed during the hospitalization. J.C. Penney denied the request for policy benefits, stating that the policy provided coverage only where the insured\u2019s death resulted \u201csolely and independently\u201d from accident or injury, and not where a pre-existing disease contributes to the insured\u2019s death. J.C. Penney took the position that Mr. O\u2019Connell\u2019s pre-existing Parkinson\u2019s disease was a contributing cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Arizona courts strictly construe policy provisions which provide benefits, as here, only where death or disability is \u201csolely and independently\u201d caused by the accident at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">If the question is whether the death resulted solely from accidental causes, the test is as follows: (a) when an accident causes a diseased condition which, together with the accident, results in death, the accident alone is considered the cause of death; (b) when at the time of the accident the insured was suffering from some disease, but such disease had no causal connection with the death resulting from the accident, the accident is the sole cause of the death, and (c) when at the time of the accident there was an existing disease which, cooperating with the accident, resulted in the death, the accident cannot be considered as the sole cause, independent of all other causes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-10\"><em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Greber, </em>55 Ariz. 261, 100 P.2d 987, 987 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The district court erred by finding that Mr. O\u2019Connell\u2019s fall and subsequent hip fracture \u201cdid not directly and independently cause his death\u201d because the medical evidence offered on summary judgment did not establish conclusively the cause of Mr. O\u2019Connell\u2019s pneumonia. Where, as here, a coverage dispute turns on the cause of the insured\u2019s death or disability, summary judgment is proper where the medical evidence concerning the cause of death or disability is in agreement or undisputed. <em>See, e.g., Button v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>847 F.2d 584, 586-87 (9th Cir.1988). Where, however, the facts support more than one reasonable inference concerning the role of a pre-existing condition in death or disability, the issue of causation is reserved for the trier of fact. <em>See, e.g., Dickerson v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>56 Ariz. 70, 105 P.2d 517, 520 (1940) (reversing directed verdict for insurer where conflicting medical evidence would have supported jury verdict in favor of insured).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b210-13\">O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Al8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">Because there is no evidence in the record suggesting that Richard O\u2019Connell\u2019s death was caused \u201cdirectly and independently\u201d by his fall and resultant hip fracture, the district court properly granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>summary judgment to J.C. Penney Life Insurance Co. The court sees the matter differently, however, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Although the majority correctly invokes the legal framework set forth in <em>New York Life Insurance Co. v. Greber, </em>55 Ariz. 261, 100 P.2d 987, 987 (1940) <em>(\u201cGreber </em>/\u201d), its application of that standard to the factual record before us is flawed. In <em>Greber, </em>the insured, who suffered from bronchial asthma and myocarditis, was involved in a car accident, which triggered the onset of pneumonia and eventual death. <em>Id. </em>at 988. The insurance policy provided for a double indemnity where the insured\u2019s death \u201cresulted directly and independently of all other causes from bodily injury effected solely through external, violent and accidental cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 987. The insurance company refused to pay this double indemnity on the ground that the insured\u2019s death was at least partially attributable to his preexisting asthma and myocarditis. <em>Id. </em>at 988</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">At trial, a physician testified that the insured\u2019s \u201cheart condition, his asthmatic condition, they weren\u2019t primary factors but they were contributing factors in my mind....\u201d <em>Greber v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co. (\u201cGreber II\u201d), </em>61 Ariz. 341, 149 P.2d 671, 672 (Ariz.1944). The physician further acknowledged that \u201cthe chronic myocarditis cannot be overlooked as a contributory factor in either causing the pneumonia or establishing a so-called fertile field for the infection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the basis of that testimony, the Supreme Court of Arizona affirmed a directed verdict in favor of the insurance company because no reasonable jury could have found that the car accident directly and independently caused the insured\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Richard O\u2019Connell\u2019s death occurred under analogous circumstances. The death certificate indicates that pneumonia was the \u201cfinal disease or condition resulting in death\u201d and lists end stage Parkinson\u2019s disease as a \u201csignificant condition[ ] contributing to death but not resulting in the underlying cause.\u201d The attending physician\u2019s statement identifies pneumonia and congestive heart failure as the primary causes of death and a hip fracture as a secondary or contributory cause. In response to the question whether the hip fracture was, \u201cdirectly and independently of all other causes, sufficient to produce death,\u201d the attending physician answered, \u201cNo, it was a contribution to cause of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Moreover, when Dr. Ghebleh, one of the physicians who treated Richard O\u2019Connell, was asked whether \u201can accident aggravate[d] a pre-existing condition causing death,\u201d he responded affirmatively and explained that the \u201cfall with subsequent hip fracture compromis[ed] his pulmonary status, already weakened by his Parkinson\u2019s disease leading to pneumonia and respiratory failure.\u201d Similarly, a doctor who reviewed Richard O\u2019Connell\u2019s chart on behalf of the plaintiff concluded that the \u201cpatient\u2019s hip fracture ... was the initial event in a cascade of medical conditions which led to this patient\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">This material is the only record evidence that bears upon Richard O\u2019Connell\u2019s cause of death, and none of it suggests that his death was directly and independently caused by his fall and resultant hip fracture. Rather \u2014 like the doctor\u2019s testimony in <em>Greber </em>\u2014 each piece of evidence indicates either that Richard O\u2019Connell\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s disease contributed to his death or that his hip fracture was merely one of several contributory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Because no reasonable jury could conclude on the basis of the record evidence that Richard O\u2019Connell\u2019s fall was the <em>direct </em>and <em>independent </em>cause of his death, there is no genuine dispute of fact as to this issue, and I would therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
