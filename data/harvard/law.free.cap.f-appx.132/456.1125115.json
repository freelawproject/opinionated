Ben Yowel seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition as an unauthorized, successive petition. An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Yowel has not made the requisite showing. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>cordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
