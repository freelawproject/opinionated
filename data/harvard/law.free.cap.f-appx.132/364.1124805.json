Evans seeks review of a final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d) affirming an administrative judge\u2019s initial decision to sustain the Department of the Treasury\u2019s (\u201cthe Department\u2019s\u201d) removal of Mr. Evans from his position with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). <em>See Evans v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>No. AT0752030541-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Sept. 9, 2004). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b396-23\">Mr. Evans worked for the IRS in Memphis, Tennessee as an Offer-In-Compromise Examiner (\u201cOE\u201d). This position required Mr. Evans to develop and evaluate records dealing with taxpayers\u2019 offers to settle or compromise existing tax liabilities. Mr. Evans received several months of classroom and on-the-job training beginning in January of 2002. During this training period, Mr. Evans received a copy of a performance plan. After the training period, Mr. Evan\u2019s work as an OE was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>reviewed by experienced examiners and feedback was given to Mr. Evan by coaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">On or about September 17, 2002, Mr. Evans received a performance appraisal rating his job performance as unacceptable and offering him suggestions on how he could improve his performance. On February 20, 2003, Mr. Evans received another performance appraisal again rating his job performance as unacceptable. In response to these performance appraisals, Mr. Evans\u2019s supervisor sent Mr. Evans a letter on February 28, 2003 proposing his removal from his position with the IRS due to unacceptable performance. The letter included details of thirteen alleged deficiencies in Mr. Evans\u2019s job performance. On April 21, 2003, a field director issued a decision removing Mr. Evans from his position based on reasons set forth in the proposal letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Mr. Evans filed an. appeal with the MSPB. In an initial decision dated September 30, 2003, an administrative judge affirmed Mr. Evans removal, finding that the Department established by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Evans\u2019s performance was unacceptable, that Mr. Evans failed to establish that he was removed in reprisal for any protected activity, and that the penalty of removal was within the bounds of reasonableness. The decision of the administrative judge became final when the full MSPB denied Mr. Evans\u2019s petition for review on September 9, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">We review a decision of the MSPB to ensure it is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Mattern v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>291 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">On appeal, Mr. Evans does not present any clear argument why this court should reverse the decision of the MSPB. Instead, without citing to a transcript of the proceedings below or to any other part of the record before us, Mr. Evans recites a series of events that he apparently believes should move us to reverse the decision of the MSPB. For example, Mr. Evans alleges that \u201c[documents reflects [sic] and was [sic] presented in legal preceding [sic] that some of my errors made while as a OE, were because of following instructions from a Coach.\u201d Also, Mr. Evans, citing <em>Graham v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>46 M.S.P.R. 227 (1990), states that the IRS is \u201cholding me to a higher standard than is required in established performance standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">To the extent Mr. Evans challenges the findings of the MSPB, we conclude based on our review of the record that those findings are supported by substantial evidence. Furthermore, Mr. Evans\u2019s reference to <em>Graham </em>is unavailing. In that case the MSPB summarized case law addressing performance-based actions taken under chapter 75 of title 5 as requiring that \u201cthe agency\u2019s imposed standard be reasonable and provide for accurate measurement of the employee\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>46 M.S.P.R. at 235. Here, the administrative judge specifically noted that when an agency takes an action under chapter 75 \u201cit must simply prove that its measurement of the appellant\u2019s performance was both accurate and reasonable.\u201d Furthermore, after reviewing the evidence the administrative judge specifically concluded that the Department\u2019s measurement of the appellant\u2019s performance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>both accurate and reasonable. Thus, we discern that the administrative judge followed established procedures required by law. In addition, we find substantial evidence in the record supporting the administrative judge\u2019s conclusion that the measurement of Mr. Evans\u2019s performance by the IRS was both accurate and reasonable. We therefore reject Mr. Evans\u2019s suggestion that the IRS was holding Mr. Evans to a higher standard than is required in established performance standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the MSPB.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
