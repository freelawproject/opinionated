Kravitz, of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b911-24\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b911-25\">Appellant, Zai Bin Li, pro <em>se, </em>appeals from the BIA\u2019s decision denying his motion for reconsideration, and moves for a stay of removal. The parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, legal claims and appellate arguments is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-26\">Li cannot now contest the IJ\u2019s findings in his November 2001 decision because Li timely appealed from the BIA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>October 2008 denial of Ms motion for reconsideration, not the BIA\u2019s January 2003 order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">A petitioner must file a petition for review of a BIA order within thirty days of the date of the order. <em>See Paul v. INS, </em>348 F.3d 43, 45 (2d Cir.2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). This filing deadline is jurisdictional and may not be extended, even upon a showing of good cause. <em>Paul, </em>348 F.3d at 45. In this case, Li filed his petition for review on November 21, 2003, within thirty-days of the BIA\u2019s October 27, 2003 decision. <em>See </em>Petition for Review. However, it was filed beyond the thirty-day period for appealing any of the other BIA orders. Thus, this Court has jurisdiction to consider Li\u2019s petition for review only insofar as it challenges the October 27, 2003 BIA decision and Li\u2019s arguments beyond the scope of that BIA order cannot be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">A motion to reconsider \u201crequests that the Board re-examine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked ...\u201d <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 399, 403, n. 2 (BIA 1991). Accordingly, a motion to reconsider must specify the errors of fact or law in the challenged BIA decision, and must be supported by pertinent authority as \u201ca motion for reconsideration asks the Board to reevaluate its decision on the existing factual record.\u201d <em>Zhao v. United States DOJ, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90, 91 (2d Cir., 2001); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b) (\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law m the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Brice v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>806 F.2d 415, 419 (2d Cir.1986). The Attorney General, through the BIA, \u201chas \u2018broad discretion\u2019 to grant or deny such motions.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). An abuse of discretion will be found \u201cin those circumstances where the [BIAj\u2019s decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary conclusions or statements; that is to say, where the [BIA] has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 93 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">In this case, the BIA acted within its discretion in denying Li\u2019s July 2003 motion to reconsider. Li\u2019s submission of the X-ray and his wife\u2019s letter failed to specify any errors of fact or law committed by the BIA in its prior order- \u2014 the denial of his motion to reopen \u2014 as the evidence simply reiterates Li\u2019s primary claims that his wife was forced to have an IUD inserted and that both he and his wife faced sterilization and persecution in China due to China\u2019s family planning policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">In this Court, Li argues that his wife\u2019s forced abortion and sterilization warranted the grant of his request for asylum. However, Li fails to identify any error of fact or law made by the BIA in denying his reconsideration motion and makes only conclusory arguments in disagreement with the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s treatment of his applications and motions. Thus, the BIA reasonably denied Li\u2019s motion on the basis that Li had failed to identify any legal or factual defect requiring the BIA to reconsider its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Lastly, even construing Li\u2019s motion to reconsider as a motion to reopen, the BIA did not abuse its discretion m denying Li relief since Li had already submitted one motion to reopen; and, thus, Li was statutorily prohibited from filing another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>motion to reopen.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">For the foregoing reasons, this Court AFFIRMS the October 27, 2003 decision of the BIA and denies the motion for a stay.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b913-14\"> Section 1003.2 states that a party may file:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMj\">only one motion to reopen deportation or exclusion proceedings (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an alien may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings (whether before the Board or the Immigration Judge) and that motion must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-26\">Section 1003.2(c)(3) details exceptions which do not apply to Li\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
