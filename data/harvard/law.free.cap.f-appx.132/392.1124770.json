Goldberg, Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">UPON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition and the appeal be and hereby are DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">In November 1997, with his initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion for habeas relief still pending, Hector Rivera filed a <em>pro se </em>petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking to vacate his 1989 conviction for conspiracy to possess, and possession with intent to distribute, cocaine and heroin. Specifically, Rivera alleged that his 260-month sentence was improper because it was based on a prior state conviction which Rivera claimed was a byproduct of (1) ineffective assistance of counsel and (2) an involuntary guilty plea entered while Rivera was under the influence of alcohol and heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Characterizing Rivera\u2019s motion as a successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion for habeas relief, the District Court transferred Rivera\u2019s petition to this Court. On appeal, Rivera argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the District Court \u201cerred in characterizing the 2241 motion as a successive 2251 motion\u201d and \u201cshould ... have granted petitioner leave to amend his then pending timely 2255 motion so the merits of the issue could be adjudicated.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 19. <em>See Ching v. United States, </em>298 F.3d 174, 177 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201c[I]n general, when a \u00a7 2255 motion is filed before adjudication of an initial \u00a7 2255 motion is complete, the district court should construe the second \u00a7 2255 motion as a motion to amend the pending \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">Because Rivera\u2019s underlying petition, regardless of its character, is meritless, we dismiss it and defendant\u2019s appeal from the District Court\u2019s order as frivolous. <em>See Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 375, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001) (\u201c[A] defendant may not collaterally attack his prior conviction through a motion under \u00a7 2255, unless he claims that conviction was obtained in violation of the right to counsel and he raised that claim at his federal sentencing proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-18\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s arguments and have found each of them to be without merit. Accordingly, the petition and appeal are DISMISSED and petitioner\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-14\">. <em>See Grullon v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 137, 139 (2d Cir.2004) <em>(\u201cA </em>\u00a7 2241 petition generally challenges the <em>execution </em>of a federal prisoner's sentence, whereas challenges to the underlying conviction and sentence are properly raised in a \u00a7 2255 petition.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
