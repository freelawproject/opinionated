We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-26\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its finding of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tempt for abuse of discretion, but our review is more exacting than the usual abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Perez v. Danbury Hasp., </em>347 F.3d 419, 423 (2d Cir.2003). A district court\u2019s credibility finding is entitled to especially great deference. <em>See Seitzman v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, Inc., </em>311 F.3d 477, 484 (2d Cir. 2002). A district court\u2019s evaluation of expert testimony is also entitled to deference and reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 143, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Appellants argue that the District Court abused its discretion in finding appellee to have satisfied its burden to prove noncompliance with the injunction by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence. <em>Perez, </em>347 F.3d at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">On review of the record, we find that the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are amply supported, and can find no clear error in its findings that (1) the C4 to C24 fatty acid gas chromatography profiling and extrapolation from C4 content was a reliable method of determining butter content and produced results accurate to within the margin of error specified in the consent decree, (2) the consistency of the test results in showing a butter content below 40% indicated that the results could not be explained by experimental error, and (3) the C14 and C6 results confirmed the accuracy of the extrapolation and excluded the possibility that the C8, CIO, and C12 figures were indicative of the presence of unaccounted-for butter. The District Court did not improperly shift the burden of proof merely by noting that appellants presented no credible evidence to rebut the inference of these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In light of its factual findings, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in holding that appellee met its burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that appellants committed contempt by failing to comply with the injunction\u2019s requirement that they not misrepresent the butter content of their croissants. These facts support a strong inference that appellants\u2019 croissants were manufactured with a shortening consisting of below 50% butter.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
