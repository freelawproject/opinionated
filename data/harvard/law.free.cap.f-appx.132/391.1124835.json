See Kendrick v. Greiner, </em>296 F.Supp.2d 348 (E.D.N.Y.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">On February 15, 1996, petitioner was convicted in New York State Supreme Court principally of second-degree murder for the stabbing death of an elderly woman in Queens, New York. Petitioner urges on appeal that the District Court erroneously rejected two asserted grounds for <em>habeas </em>relief. First, petitioner argues that he was denied his Sixth Amendment rights by an unduly suggestive pretrial lineup that tainted pretrial and in-court identifications of petitioner. Second, petitioner asserts that he was denied a fair trial when the trial court permitted cross-examination of petitioner regarding pending criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s arguments and find them without merit. Substantially for the reasons stated in the memorandum, judgment, and order of the District Court, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
