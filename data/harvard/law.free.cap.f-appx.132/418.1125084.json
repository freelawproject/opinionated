We will deny Robinson\u2019s request for mandamus relief as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-24\">Robinson is detained pending the resolution of federal criminal charges. <em>See United States v. Hendricks, </em>395 F.3d 173, 184 (3d Cir.2005) (granting the United States\u2019 pretrial appeal and remanding for further proceedings). On March 3, 2005, the District Court filed Robinson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>habeas petition, which \u2014 among other .things \u2014 alleged an illegal arrest and prosecutorial misconduct. When Robinson filed his mandamus petition in this court on April 6, 2005, the District Court had not yet acted on his habeas petition. Two days later, however, the District Court denied Robinson\u2019s request.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, inasmuch as Robinson has now received what he requested (i.e, a ruling by the District Court), his mandamus petition is moot. <em>See, e.g., In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Pros. Liab. Litig., </em>94 F.3d 110, 111 (3d Cir.1996) (on mootness).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Robinson\u2019s mandamus petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-33\">. The District Court entered the denial of Robinson's habeas petition on both the criminal docket, D.V.I. Crim No. 04-cr-00005, and under a newly created civil number, D.V.I. Civ. No. 05-cv-00025. The District Court\u2019s order expressly denied relief to the extent that Robinson\u2019s request could be construed as seeking \"immediate release from detention, modification of the 'no bail\u2019 condition, or dismissal of the indictment.\u201d Order, 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
