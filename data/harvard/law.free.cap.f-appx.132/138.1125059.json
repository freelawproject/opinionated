INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1430-31 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-22\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Lin was ineligible for asylum because she failed to show an objectively well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2005). In particular, Lin did not show that the harm she fears would be perpetrated by the government or by forces that the government is unable or unwilling to control. <em>See Mashiri v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 1112, 1119 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-23\">Because Lin did not show eligibility for asylum, she necessarily fails to meet the higher burden of demonstrating eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-24\">Lin also did not demonstrate eligibility for relief under CAT because she did not show that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if returned to China. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b170-29\"> \u25a0pjjjg panei unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument.
