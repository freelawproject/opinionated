Schwarz states that Warner-Lambert Company consents. Teva opposes. Schwarz replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-27\">Schwarz brought suit against Teva in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for patent infringement.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Schwarz Pharma, Inc. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., </em>No. 01-4995. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Schwarz\u2019s amended complaint sought, inter alia, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. On August 2, 2004, Schwarz moved for a preliminary injunction. Before the hearing on Schwarz\u2019s motion, Teva consented to the entry of an injunction to remain in effect \u201cpending final resolution of this action.\u201d The order was entered on September 23, 2004. The district court proceeded to consider the case on the merits and on January 4, 2005 granted summary judgment in favor of Schwarz and dismissed Teva\u2019s affirmative defenses and counterclaims. The district court subsequently denied Teva\u2019s motion to amend its answer and Teva filed a notice of appeal, citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(c)(2), in a patent case a party may appeal a judgment that is final except for an accounting. Schwarz contends that Teva\u2019s appeal is premature because Schwarz\u2019s request for a permanent injunction has not been adjudicated and thus the district court\u2019s decision is not final except for an accounting. Schwarz cites the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Stamicarbon, N.V. v. Escambia Chemical Corp., </em>430 F.2d 920, 930 (5th Cir.1970) for the proposition that a case is not final except for an accounting if an unadjudicated request for injunctive relief remains pending before the district court. Teva concedes that an unadjudicated request for an injunction may pose a jurisdictional barrier, but contends that the injunction entered by the district court on September 23, 2004 gave Schwarz all the relief that it requested and thus there are no issues pending before the district court except for an accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We agree with Schwarz that Teva\u2019s appeal is premature because Schwarz\u2019s request for permanent injunctive relief remains pending before the district court. The district court infringement action on the merits is over, save for the request for a permanent injunction. Thus, Teva\u2019s appeal is premature and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">(1) Schwarz\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-28\"> Warner was joined as an involuntary plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
