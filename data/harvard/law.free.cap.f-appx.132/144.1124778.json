The IJ denied Zhang\u2019s application for lack of credibility. We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b177-25\">When the BIA affirms an IJ decision without opinion, we review the decision of the IJ for substantial evidence. <em>Zi Lin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 616 (9th Cir.2004). Zhang claims the Chinese government persecuted her by arresting her for practicing Christianity and subjecting her to a forced abortion and IUD insertion. The IJ addressed each ground separately, finding both of Zhang\u2019s claims not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">We independently evaluate each ground cited by the IJ for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir.2003). An IJ must support an adverse credibility determination with specific reasons for disbelief. <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1165 (9th Cir.2000). These reasons \u201cmust be substantial and bear a legitimate nexus to the finding. Thus, there must be a rational and supportable connection between the reasons cited and the conclusion that the petitioner is not credible.\u201d <em>Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1381 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s credibility conclusion regarding religious persecution. The IJ\u2019s primary justification for disbelief was Zhang\u2019s failure to tell a sufficient number of Bible stories. Zhang testified, however, that her group lacked Bibles to study and primarily focused on testimonials rather than Bible lessons. The IJ\u2019s preoccupation with Bible knowledge bore no legitimate nexus to credibility and the BIA\u2019s adoption of the IJ\u2019s decision was error. Whether Zhang had detailed knowledge of Christianity cannot be determinative of her credibility. The other inconsistencies noted by the IJ reveal nothing about Zhang\u2019s fear of persecution and are not an adequate basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Osorio v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 931 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201c[Tjhe omission of details from an applicant\u2019s earlier testimony cannot serve as the basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d); <em>Vilorio-Lopez v. INS, </em>852 F.2d 1137, 1142 (9th Cir.1988) (Minor inconsistencies that \u201creveal nothing about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear for his safety are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding regarding Zhang\u2019s forced abortion and IUD insertion is also unsupported by substantial evidence. The IJ\u2019s determination rests upon inconsistencies regarding the circumstances of Zhang\u2019s abortion. Although it is not contested that Zhang was forced to have an abortion, the IJ found her incredible based on discrepancies regarding when Zhang went to the countryside to have her child, when she was discovered, and when she was forced to have an abortion. However, the hearing transcript strongly suggests that the asserted inconsistencies were due to the IJ\u2019s misunderstanding of the testimony, not Zhang\u2019s lack of credibility. This court has \u201clong recognized that asylum hearings frequently generate mistranslations and miscommunications.\u201d <em>Maini v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 1167, 1177 (9th Cir.2000). Further, these disparities, like those within Zhang\u2019s religious testimony, are not sufficiently related to Zhang\u2019s past persecution to provide an adequate basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Zhang\u2019s credible testimony of the 36-hour detention and forced abortion and IUD insertion establish past persecution. Further, credible testimony of forced abortion entitles Zhang to asylum and withholding of removal. 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>Qu v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1195, 1203 (9th Cir.2005). Therefore, remand to the BIA is not necessary to consider whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Zhang\u2019s religious persecution justifies withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b177-26\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
