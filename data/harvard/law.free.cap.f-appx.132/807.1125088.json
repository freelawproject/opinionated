On appeal, he argues the district court sentenced him based on a drug quantity not charged in the indictment or admitted by him in his plea agreement, in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2005), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Pippen raised this argument in the district court and therefore is entitled to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 947 (11th Cir. Apr.5, 2005). We will reverse a <em>Booker </em>error only if the error was harmful, meaning that the error affected substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>In its brief, which we note was filed before our <em>Paz </em>decision, the government states that it believes remand for resentencing is appropriate because the district court did not indicate whether it would impose the same sentence if the Guidelines were advisory in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">After thorough review of the record, as well as careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no <em>Booker </em>constitutional error. However, we find <em>Booker </em>non-constitutional error and conclude that because the government has not met its burden to show harmlessness, and indeed appears to concede the error was not harmless, we vacate and remand Pippen\u2019s sentence for resentencing, pursuant to the discretionary Sentencing Guidelines scheme now required by <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The relevant facts are these. According to the PSI, Pippen pled guilty to an offense involving 1.9 grams of methamphetamine. The PSI, however, attributed 4.16 grams of methamphetamine to Pippen for purposes of calculating his offense level. This greater amount included the amounts involved in three additional methamphetamine-related charges for which Pippen was charged in the indictment. These three counts had been dismissed after Pip-pen pled guilty to the one count involving 1.9 grams. Based on 4.16 grams, the PSI calculated Pippen\u2019s base offense level at 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">The PSI recommended a 2-level safety-valve reduction, but indicated that Pippen should not receive further reduction for acceptance of responsibility, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), because while he was out on bond, a drug test revealed he tested positive for methamphetamine use. Several days after the drug test, he was arrested by the county sheriff for theft of services, damaging public property, and criminal damage to property in the first degree after he unlawfully obtained natural gas from city lines for his automotive repair service without first paying or obtaining authorization for the connection. With a criminal history category I and an adjusted offense level of 22, the Guidelines range was 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">At the sentencing hearing, Pippen made no objections to the PSI\u2019s factual statements. However, he lodged a <em>Blakely </em>objection to the PSI\u2019s recommended sentencing range, arguing that his co-defendant had received a sentence of only 18 months. He also objected to the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. He asserted that the drug test results potentially were inaccurate and were insufficient, standing alone, to support denying the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">The district court stated that it recognized Pippen\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection and realized that if the federal Guidelines were found unconstitutional, \u201cthere may be something in all of this that will have to be revisited or reexamined.\u201d However, relying on the controlling law in this Circuit at the time of Pippen\u2019s sentencing, the district court concluded that it had to continue to apply the Guidelines and, accordingly, imposed a 41-month sentence, which was at the bottom of the Guidelines range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. The Court subsequently applied the <em>Apprendi </em>rule in the context of Washington State\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, clarifying that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537 (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Most recently, in <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court found \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d in <em>Blakely. See </em>125 S.Ct. at 749. \u201cThe constitutional error is the use of extra-verdict enhancements to reach a guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge; the error is the mandatory nature of the guidelines once the guidelines range has been determined.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-, 2005 WL 483174 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Here, as a preliminary mater, Pippen does not argue, and we would not find, <em>constitutional </em>error based on <em>Booker. </em>Although the indictment did not allege, and Pippen did not admit as part of his guilty plea to, the drug quantity used to calculate his offense level, he failed to raise any fact-based objections to the PSI. Instead, he objected to the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and the recommended sentencing range, based only on the lower 18-month sentence given to his co-defendant. Because Pippen asserted no fact-based objection to the PSI, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred, within the meaning of <em>Booker. See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that there was no Sixth Amendment violation where defendant did not raise any objections to the factual statements in the PSI and thus admitted to the facts that enhanced his sentence). On this record, there was no impermissible judicial factfinding in violation of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">However, as conceded by the government, Pippen is right that there was <em>Booker </em>error, based on the remedial holding of the case, because the court treated the Guidelin\u00e9s range as mandatory and \u201cthe Supreme Court has now excised the mandatory nature of the Guidelines in <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330 (reviewing <em>Booker </em>claim for plain error). In <em>Shelton, </em>we concluded that \u201cit was [non-constitutional] <em>Booker </em>error for the district court to sentence Shelton under a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301 (\u201cthe [non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>] error is the mandatory nature of the guidelines once the guidelines range has been deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>mined\u201d))- \u201cAs a result of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding, <em>Booker </em>error exists when the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">\u201cIn cases involving preserved <em>Booker </em>error, the Government must show that the mandatory, as opposed to the advisory, application of the guidelines did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1270 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948). Based on the excision of the mandatory provisions of the Guidelines, in cases involving preserved <em>Booker </em>error, we have required the Government to show that the mandatory, as opposed to the advisory, application of the Guidelines did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948 (holding that the Government could not meet its burden under harmless error analysis because the record indicated that had the Guidelines been advisory, his sentence would have been shorter). Thus, the government bears the burden to show that the non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error did not affect substantial rights. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">A non-constitutional error is harmless \u201cif, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [outcome], or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cIf one can say \u2018with fair assurance ... that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 the judgment is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)); <em>see also United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1266 n. 20 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en bane) </em>(\u201cErrors do affect a substantial right of a party if they have a \u2018substantial influence\u2019 on the outcome of a case or leave \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to whether they affected the outcome of a case.\u201d (quoting <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 764-65, 66 S.Ct. at 1248)).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Based on our careful reading of the record, and particularly the transcript of the sentencing hearing, we can find no indication of whether or not the district court would have sentenced Pippen similarly under an advisory scheme. <em>Cf. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301 (applying plain error analysis to an non-preserved <em>Booker </em>error, and stating that because the defendant bore the burden of persuasion and no one could know what would have happened in an advisory system, the defendant could not meet his burden). On this record, the government has not met its burden to show harmlessness, or no effpct on substantial rights. <em>Cf. Davis, </em>407 F.3d at 1271-72 (\u201cWe simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Therefore, the Government cannot meet its burden of showing that the mandatory application of the guidelines in violation of Davis\u2019s Sixth Amendment right was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Accordingly, we vacate Pippen\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-8\">. As for Pippen's objection to the denial of an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, the court found that the drug test was reliable.
