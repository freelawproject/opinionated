He asserts that his trial counsel was ineffec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>tive for failing to object to his exclusion from a pre-trial hearing held to determine the admissibility of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct (the \u201cRape Shield hearing\u201d). We have jurisdiction to consider this petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In order to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must demonstrate that: 1) his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and 2) he was prejudiced. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>United States v. Fry, </em>322 F.3d 1198, 1200 (9th Cir.2003). In evaluating the prejudice prong, Culley must show that there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The court need not determine whether counsel\u2019s conduct was deficient if the petitioner fails to show that he was prejudiced. <em>Id. </em>at 697,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Culley\u2019s defense was that the victim fabricated the allegations against him because she believed he had killed her biological father. Culley argues that as a result of his exclusion from the Rape Shield hearing, his attorney pursued a theory that the victim\u2019s claims of prior sexual abuse by Culley\u2019s brothers were true and thus admissible to show \u201cmotive or bias\u201d against Culley under Oregon\u2019s Rape Shield Law. Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 40.210; Or. Evid. R. 412.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court excluded the evidence, finding that the evidence was not required to show motive or bias because Culley could make this showing using other evidence. However, Culley argues that had he been present at the hearing he would have insisted that the prior allegations were false and therefore the evidence of these prior claims would have been admissible. He alleges that his brothers and wife would have testified to the falsity of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">Even if the court assumes that counsel\u2019s failure to object to Culley\u2019s exclusion from the Rape Shield hearing constituted deficient performance, Culley has not shown that he was prejudiced as a result. Culley has not provided any evidence through affidavits or deposition testimony that his brothers or his wife would have testified to the falsity of these claims. Rather, Culley has only provided his own self-serving deposition testimony without any corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">Additionally, Culley\u2019s counsel vigorously cross-examined the victim and was able to present some evidence of other prior false allegations of sexual conduct. It does not appear that there is a reasonable probability that additional false allegations, especially those that are not corroborated, would likely have affected the outcome of this trial. Therefore, Culley is unable to establish that the result in the proceedings would have been different had the additional evidence of prior false allegations of sexual conduct been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">Therefore, as both the state court and the district court concluded, Culley has failed to show that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to Culley\u2019s absence from the Rape Shield hearing. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s determination was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The district court\u2019s denial of Gulley\u2019s petition for habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b196-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-7\">. Under the rule, past sexual conduct of the victim is admissible in Oregon if it either: 1) relates to the motive or bias of the alleged victim, 2) is necessary to rebut or explain scientific or medical evidence offered by the state, or 3) is otherwise constitutionally required.
