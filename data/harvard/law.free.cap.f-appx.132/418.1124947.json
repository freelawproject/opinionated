For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">According to his \u00a7 2241 petition, Gilmore pled guilty to receipt of child pornography in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. On January 27, 2003, Gilmore was sentenced to 32 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. The Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) has calculated that Gilmore is eligible under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) to earn up to 125 days of good conduct time.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">In February 2005, Gilmore filed the un-, derlying \u00a7 2241 petition in the District Court for the District of New Jersey. In his petition, Gilmore alleged that the BOP misinterpreted \u00a7 3624(b), depriving him of 19 days of good conduct time. Specifically, Gilmore argued that \u00a7 3624(b) allows him to earn up to 54 days per year of the term of sentence imposed, not 54 days per year of time actually served as the BOP\u2019s calculation provides. By order entered March 1, 2005, the District Court denied Gilmore\u2019s petition. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">The outcome of this appeal is controlled by our recent decision in <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172 (3d Cir.2005). In <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>402 F.3d at 174, we held that the meaning of \u00a7 3624(b) is ambiguous, and thus deferred to the BOP\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statute. Gilmore\u2019s claim, identical to that raised and rejected in <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>is unavailing. In short, for the reasons described in <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>the District Court properly rejected Gilmore\u2019s challenge to the BOP\u2019s calculation of his good conduct time.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">Because this appeal presents \u201cno substantial question,\u201d 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s March 1, 2005, order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
