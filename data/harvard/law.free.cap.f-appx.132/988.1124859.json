In his habeas petition, Abdel-Whab sought review of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) order of removal, release from detention, adjustment of resident status and a waiver of inadmissibility under the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Because Abdel-Whab had previously filed a consolidated \u00a7 2241 habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania challenging his detention and the decisions of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) and the BIA, as well as attacking the underlying convictions entered against him in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, <em>see Abdel-Whab v. Ridge, et al., </em>M.D. Pa. Civ. No. 04-cv-00787, the District Court concluded that appellant\u2019s petition constituted an abuse of the writ. The District Court dismissed the petition accordingly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-15\">Abdel-Whab argues that the District Court erred in dismissing his petition because the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) does not apply to \u00a7 2241 petitions. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, the District Court acknowledged our holding in <em>Zayas v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 247, 255 (3d Cir.2002), that the stricter AEDPA gatekeeping provision set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) is applicable only to habeas petitions filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and motions filed un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>der \u00a7 2255. However, the court further noted our conclusion in <em>Zayas </em>that \u00a7 2241 petitions are still within the ambit of the abuse of the writ doctrine as set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>McCleskey v. Zant, </em>499 U.S. 467, 491-92, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991). We can find no fault with the abuse of the writ analysis conducted by the District Court. Moreover, after careful review of the record together with the \u00a7 2241 petition filed at M.D. Pa. Civ. No. 04-cv-00787, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the underlying petition is nearly identical to the one dismissed on the merits (including the merits of appellant\u2019s challenges to the decisions of the IJ and BIA) by the Middle District of Pennsylvania. While Abdel-Whab asserts that he added \u201cnew constitutional violations\u201d and \u201cnew memo [sic] of laws and arguments\u201d to the underlying petition, <em>see </em>Motion for Summary Action at If 3, he fails to clearly indicate just what those new claims are, or to provide any explanation as to his reasons for failing to raise such issues with the District Court in the Middle District of Pennsylvania in his first habeas petition. Having thus failed to show any cause or prejudice for this failure, or that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will occur absent review, the underlying \u00a7 2241 petition was properly dismissed as an abuse of the writ. <em>See Zayas v. INS, </em>311 F.3d at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Accordingly, because it clearly appears that no substantial question is presented by this appeal, <em>see </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Appellant\u2019s motion for summary reversal is therefore denied, as is his \u201cEmergency Request for Humanitarian and Emergency Relief.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1021-12\">. In that same order, the District Court also dismissed Abdel-Whab\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition docketed at E.D. Pa. Civ. No. 05-cv-00059, which challenged his convictions of passport fraud. Although Abdel-Whab filed a notice of appeal from that decision, <em>see C.A. </em>No. OS-1964, he allowed the appeal to be procedurally terminated for failure to pay the necessary appellate docket and filing fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
