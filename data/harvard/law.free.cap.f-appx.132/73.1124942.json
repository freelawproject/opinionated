Hernandez-Olea did not object to judicial factfinding at trial and his claim is therefore reviewed only for \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). To show plain error, HernandezOlea must \u201cshow a \u2018reasonable probability,\u2019 based on the appellate record as a whole, that but for the error he would have received a more favorable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 552 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc). The record before the court shows that Hernandez-Olea has not met his burden. There is nothing to suggest that the district court would impose a lesser sentence on remand, and \u201c \u2018where the effect of the error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate \u2014 where we would have to speculate\u2014 the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553 (quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2005)). Thus, Hernandez-Olea has failed to meet his burden under plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">We therefore affirm the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\">.
