Mason Tenders\u2019 District Council Pension Plan, </em>299 F.Supp.2d 274 (S.D.N.Y.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">On appeal, the Campanellas contend that (1) they are entitled to accrue pension credits while on disability or workers\u2019 compensation; (2) the Plan was wrong in determining that Pietro Campanella lost credited service when he experienced a break in service; (3) the Plan is required to pay interest on its delayed payment of the Campanellas\u2019 disability benefits; (4) the Plan trustees are liable for wrongful delay in providing documents to the Campanellas; (5) the Plan\u2019s accrual ranges violate ERISA\u2019s minimum accrual standards; and (6) the Plan\u2019s \u201cfreeze\u201d provision violates ERISA\u2019s minimum accrual and vesting standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">We review grants of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Church of Am. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan v. Kerik, </em>356 F.3d 197, 203 (2d Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Blouin ex rel. Estate of Pouliot v. Spitzer, </em>356 F.3d 348, 356 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">I. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">The Plan argues that the Campanellas\u2019 first, second, fifth and sixth claims are time-barred under ERISA \u00a7 413, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113. However, ERISA \u00a7 413 applies only to breach of fiduciary duty claims. The Campanellas do not claim that the Plan violated its fiduciary duties; rather, the Campanellas challenge the terms of the Plan itself. Thus, the district court correctly determined that the six-year state contract law statute of limitations applies in this case, <em>see Valle v. Joint Plumbing Indus. Bd., </em>623 F.2d 196, 202 n. 10 (2d Cir.1980), and that the Campanellas\u2019 claims are not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">II. Accrual of Pension Credits while Receiving Disability Payments or Workers\u2019 Compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">The Campanellas argue that ERISA and the terms of their pension plan require the accrual of pension credits on account of their receipt of pension disability benefits and workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We consider only the Campanellas\u2019 argument as to workers\u2019 compensation and do not consider their argument as to disability benefits, because the latter argument was raised for the first time in the Campanellas\u2019 memorandum of law in opposition to the Plan\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number><em>See Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">As for the Campanellas\u2019 argument regarding workers\u2019 compensation, while the federal regulations state that an employee should earn credit for periods \u201cduring which no duties are performed (irrespective of whether the employment relationship has terminated) due to ... incapacity (including disability),\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2530.200b-2(a)(2), the regulations go on to note that \u201c[a]n hour for which an employee is directly or indirectly paid ... on account of a period during which no duties are performed is not required to be credited to the employee if such payment is made or due under a plan maintained solely for the purpose of complying with applicable workmen\u2019s compensation ... laws[.]\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2530.200b-2(a)(2)(ii). Similarly, the terms of the Plan require hours for which no duties are performed to be credited only for \u201ceach hour for \u25a0 which an Employee is paid ... by the Contributing Employer.\u201d <em>See </em>Plan \u00a7 1(14). Because workers\u2019 compensation is not paid by the employer, and because it is expressly exempt from the requirement that hours be credited, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that the receipt of workers\u2019 compensation does not enable the Campanellas to accrue pension credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">III. Loss of Credited Service upon Experiencing a Break in Service</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The Campanellas\u2019 next claim focuses on Pietro\u2019s attempt in 1992 to qualify for a disability pension despite his break in service between 1984 and 1985. The district court correctly decided that the Plan should be afforded deferential review of its provisions. When a plan is granted authority to interpret its provisions, this Court reviews its interpretations under an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. <em>Mario v. P &amp; C Food Markets, Inc., </em>313 F.3d 758, 763 (2d Cir.2002). Declining to hear the Campanellas\u2019 new arguments raised on appeal, <em>see Schmidt v. Polish People\u2019s Republic, </em>742 F.2d 67, 70 (2d Cir.1984), including their contention that the 1989 Plan was not in effect until 1995, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that the Plan\u2019s interpretation of the 1989 Plan was not arbitrary and capricious, and therefore its conclusion that Pietro Campanella lost his credited service as a result of his break in service should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">IV. Interest on Delayed Payments</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">The Campanellas also argue that they are entitled to interest on their disability payments because those payments were delayed. In <em>Dunnigan v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>277 F.3d 223, 230 (2d Cir. 2002), this Court held that interest may be awarded if the delay in the payment of benefits is unreasonable and unjustified. The district court found ample reason to conclude that the Plan\u2019s delay was reasonable. The Campanellas did not re-initiate their claim until two years after their initial claim had been denied. As soon as the Plan decided in favor of their later appeal, the Plan began making payments without delay. For the reasons discussed by the district court, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the delay was not unreasonable or unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">V. Liability for Wrongful Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">The Campanellas also argue that the Plan violated ERISA\u2019s requirement that pension plans must issue updated Summary Plan Descriptions (\u201cSPD\u201d) every fifth year unless no amendments have since been adopted. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1024(b)(1). The Plan appears to have violated that provision because, as of 2003, its most recent SPD had been issued in 1993, even though the Plan had since been amended. However, the question of whether penalties should be imposed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>such a case is left to the discretion of the district court. <em>See McDonald v. Pension Plan of NYSA-ILA Pension Trust Fund, </em>320 F.3d 151, 163 (2d Cir.2003) (citing <em>Devlin v. Empire Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>274 F.3d 76, 90 (2d Cir.2001)). Taking into account whether bad faith was involved, the number of requests made, the importance of the documents withheld, and the existence of prejudice to the Campanellas, <em>id., </em>the district court was well within its discretion in refusing to impose penalties on the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">VI. Violations of ERISA</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">A. Violation of ERISA\u2019s \u201cratable\u201d benefit requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The Campanellas also contend that the Plan violates ERISA\u2019s requirement that employees who work more than 1000 hours but less than full time be credited with no less than a ratable portion of benefit credit. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2530.204-2(c). The district court rightly concluded that \u201c[ajbsent a definition of \u2018full year,\u2019 it is entirely reasonable to calculate a full year of participation as a year of full-time employment.\u201d <em>Campanella, </em>299 F.Supp.2d at 283. We agree with the district court that \u201cit does not follow that because the Plan accords a full year of credit to employees who work 1500 hours, the Plan must therefore accord a full year of credit to employees who work 1351 hours.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Plan does not clearly define the number of hours in a full year of participation. However, under arbitrary and capricious review, the Plan\u2019s determination that 1820 hours was a \u201cfull year of participation\u201d was entirely reasonable and, therefore, the Plan\u2019s accrual ranges do not violate ERISA\u2019s \u201cratable\u201d benefit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">B. Violation of ERISA\u2019s prohibition against backloading</p>\n<p id=\"AMk\">Finally, the Campanellas argue that (1) the Plan\u2019s \u201cfreeze\u201d provision creates a plan year in which the \u201caccrued benefit\u201d does not equal the \u201cnormal retirement benefit\u201d and (2) the \u201cfreeze\u201d causes the Plan to be \u201cbackloaded\u201d \u2014 both in violation of ERISA. Following the Campanellas\u2019 argument would require us to overturn this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Langman v. haub, </em>328 F.3d 68 (2d Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1107, 124 S.Ct. 1061, 157 L.Ed.2d 893 (2004), which we do not, as a panel, have the power to do, <em>see Union of Needletrades, Indus. and Textile Employees v. I.N.S., </em>336 F.3d 200, 210 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
