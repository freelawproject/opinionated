Tavarez argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of his prior arrest for possession of marijuana pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Tavarez additionally asserts that the district court erred by applying a three-level enhancement to his sentence for his being a manager or supervisor. For the first time on appeal, Tavarez contends that the application of the three-level enhancement was unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">Because Tavarez asserted that he was accidentally present at the scene of the crime, his intent was at issue and the admission of evidence of extrinsic acts could therefore be relevant to intent. <em>See United States v. Wilwright, </em>56 F.3d 586, 589 (5th Cir.1995). As the prior arrest and the charged offense both involved Tavarez\u2019s intent to smuggle marijuana near Presidio, Texas, the evidence was relevant to an issue other than character. <em>See United States v. Gordon, </em>780 F.2d 1165, 1173 (5th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir.1978) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-17\">The facts surrounding the prior arrest and the charged offense were similar and involved the same intent. The district court issued a limiting instruction regarding the evidence of the prior arrest both at the time the evidence was presented and in the jury charge. Additionally, the presentation of the evidence of the prior arrest at trial did not occupy a significant portion of the trial, the prior arrest was not for a violent crime or a crime of greater magnitude than the charged offense, and the jury is presumed to have followed the district court\u2019s instruction limiting its consideration of the prior arrest. Accordingly, the prejudicial effect did not greatly outweigh the probative value. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Guevara, </em>162 F.3d 863, 872 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>48 F.3d 1389, 1396-97 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Beechum, </em>582 F.2d at 914. The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the evidence. <em>See Beechum, </em>582 F.2d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Following <em>Booker, </em>we continue to review the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines de novo and findings of fact for clear error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>No. 03-21220, 404 F.3d 355, 358-359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). A district court\u2019s determination that a defendant qualifies for an adjustment based on his role in the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Given the evidence that Tavarez guided a group of people transporting marijuana and was to receive greater compensation than the others in the group, the district court did not clearly err by applying a three-level enhancement to Tavarez\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). <em>See United States v. Palomo, </em>998 F.2d 253, 257-58 (5th Cir.1993); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Because Tavarez did not raise the <em>Booker </em>issue below, we review this issue for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Mar. 31, 2005)(No. 04-9517). Tavarez has not demonstrated that the district court would have imposed a different or a lesser sentence if it had been guided by the <em>Booker </em>holding. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 318 (5th Cir.2005). Therefore, Tavarez has not shown that his sentence is plainly erroneous. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
