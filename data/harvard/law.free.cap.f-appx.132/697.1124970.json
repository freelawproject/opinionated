The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) granted Tjahjadin\u2019s application for asylum based on Indonesia\u2019s history of discrimination and harassment of its ethnic Chinese. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) vacated the IJ\u2019s decision and ordered Tjahjadin removed to Indonesia. The BIA also denied Tjahjadin\u2019s later motion to reopen her case. Tjahjadin petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s rulings. The BIA had no authority to issue an order removing Tjahjadin to Indonesia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Molina-Camacho v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 937, 941 (9th Cir.2004). As in <em>Molincir-Camacho, </em>the BIA\u2019s act of issuing an ultra vires removal order \u201crenders that portion of the proceedings a \u2018legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>nullity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Noriega-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 874, 884 (9th Cir.2003)). Thus, we have no final order of removal before us, and we lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 to review this petition. <em>See id. </em>393 F.3d at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">We therefore treat Tjahjadin\u2019s petition for review as a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and transfer this petition to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco division. <em>See id. </em>at 941, 942 n. 4; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. Tjahjadin \u201cmay make any necessary amendments to perfect the form of the petition.\u201d <em>See Molinar-Camacho, </em>393 F.3d at 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Petitioner\u2019s motion to remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals, received April 8, 2005, and petitioner\u2019s Petition for Rehearing, filed April 8, 2005, are moot; respondent\u2019s opposition to the petition for rehearing with alternative motion to hold in abeyance, filed May 4, 2005, is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">TRANSFERRED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b730-11\">. That the BIA lacked the authority to order the removal of Tjahjadin was first raised by petitioner in her petition for rehearing and, in the alternative, her motion to remand to the BIA. In the government\u2019s opposition to the petition for rehearing it failed to oppose the petitioner's motion to remand or address the issue of the BIA's lack of authority to issue Tjahjadin\u2019s order of removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
