We REMAND for consideration of whether to resentence with respect to defendant-appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Defendant-appellant Nathaniel Bernard appeals Judge Amon\u2019s judgment convicting him, after a jury trial, of conspiracy to commit carjacking and robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and the substantive offenses of carjacking and robbery. The district court sentenced Bernard to, <em>inter alia, </em>188 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Bernard first argues that the government\u2019s evidence at trial was not sufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cWhen a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his conviction, we review the evidence adduced in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all inferences in favor of the prosecution.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Payton, </em>159 F.3d 49, 55-56 (2d Cir.1998). We will affirm if, after conducting such a review, \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Medina, </em>944 F.2d 60, 66 (2d Cir.1991) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). <em>See also United States v. Lung Fong Chen, </em>393 F.3d 139, 150 (2d Cir.2004). In the present case, the government adduced evidence that the defendant had a motive to commit the crimes alleged, was present when the crimes were planned, and warned a co-conspirator that the victim might be armed and that he should be ready with his own weapon. Moreover, the victim testified that another co-conspirator told him that the crime was, in effect, perpetrated on Bernard\u2019s behalf. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence presented at trial was legally sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Next, Bernard argues that the district court erred in refusing to hold a hearing pursuant to <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). The Fourth Amendment requires that such a hearing be held at the defendant\u2019s request \u201cwhere the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674. In the instant case, none of the omitted information to which Bernard points was critical to the probable cause determination, nor has Bernard made a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing\u201d that those omissions were made intentionally or with reckless disregard for truth. Accordingly, we conclude that it was not error for the district court to refuse to hold a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED. However, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005) and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings in conformity with <em>Crosby.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
