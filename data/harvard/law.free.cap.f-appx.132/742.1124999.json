He contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction to do so, an issue which we review <em>de novo. See United States v. Garrett, </em>253 F.3d 443, 446 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-21\">\u201cA district court\u2019s jurisdiction to revoke supervised release can be extended beyond the term of supervision under \u00a7 3583(i), based upon a warrant issued during the term of supervision, only if the warrant was issued 'upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation,\u2019 as required by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas-Amaya, </em>389 F.3d 901, 907 (9th Cir.2004). In this case, the Government conceded at oral argument that the April 18, 1999, warrant was defective because it was not properly supported by oath or affirmation. Because the warrant here was defective, the district court lacked jurisdiction to revoke Juarez\u2019s supervised release. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court revoking Juarez\u2019s term of supervised release and imposing an additional sentence is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b774-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
