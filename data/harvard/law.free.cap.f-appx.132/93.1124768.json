A presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) prepared by the United States Probation Office recommended a base offense level of 38, based on a drug quantity of 22.68 kilograms of methamphetamine mixture, USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), and a two-level adjustment for Padilla\u2019s role in the offense, based on his supervision of two co-conspirators. USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Over Padilla\u2019s objection to the sufficiency of the evidence on role in the offense, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adopted the recommendations of the PSR, and Padilla was sentenced to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Padilla does not challenge the district court\u2019s guideline computations based on sufficiency of the evidence, but he appeals the adjustment for role in the offense and the finding of drug quantity on constitutional grounds. For the first time on appeal, he cites <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), for the proposition that the district court should not have relied on findings of drug quantity or role in the offense because these matters were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He also moves for new counsel. In a pro se supplemental brief, which he has tendered along with a motion to file the brief, Padilla further argues that his sentence should be vacated in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because the drug quantity and role adjustment were neither submitted to a jury nor admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">In light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we agree with Padilla that the district court\u2019s application of mandatory sentencing guidelines, combined with its findings concerning drug quantity and role in the offense, was contrary to the Sixth Amendment as applied in <em>Booker. </em>Padilla did not raise a Sixth Amendment objection in the district court, however, and we thus review his sentence under the plain error standard. <em>United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc). We do not believe, based on the record as a whole, that there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that Padilla would have received a more favorable sentence if the district court had applied the advisory guideline regime announced in <em>Booker. </em>Although Padilla received a sentence at the low end of the applicable guideline range, that alone is insufficient to demonstrate a reasonable probability. <em>See Pirani, </em>at 558. We do not find an indication in the record that the court was inclined to impose a shorter term of imprisonment or that a reduced sentence under the advisory guideline regime is reasonably probable under the circumstances. \u201c \u2018[W]here the effect of the error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate \u2014 where we would have to speculate\u2014 the appellant has not met his burden of showing a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560 (quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">Padilla\u2019s motion to file a pro se brief is granted, and Padilla\u2019s renewed motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>appointment of different counsel is denied. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-8\">. The Honorable Mark W.
