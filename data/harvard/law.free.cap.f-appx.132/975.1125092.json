De La Cruz pled guilty to the charges pursuant to a bargained-for plea agreement. Counsel for De La Cruz has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, after careful review of the record, he cannot raise any meritorious issues and that the appeal is wholly frivolous. We are satisfied that counsel has fulfilled his <em>Anders </em>obligations, and we agree that the appeal is frivolous. We therefore grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-21\">De La Cruz is precluded from bringing an appeal pursuant to a waiver contained in his plea agreement. \u201cWaivers of appeals, if entered into knowingly and voluntarily, are valid, unless they work a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 563 (3d Cir.2001). The sentencing court reviewed this provision with De La Cruz extensively, answering questions posed by the defendant regarding the effect of the waiver. De La Cruz contends in his pro se brief that his waiver of appeal did not satisfy the requirements of <em>Khattak </em>because he only agreed to the plea bargain on the condition that his counsel would file a motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, seeking a four-point reduction based on his minor role in the conspiracy. Although counsel did not file this motion, counsel did present evidence of De La Cruz\u2019s minor role to the sentencing judge, and De La Cruz\u2019s sentence of 84 months was below the lower limit of the sentencing range that would have applied had he received a further downward departure, and was also below the 10 year mandatory minimum, a reduction made possible by the government\u2019s decision to file a motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K.1. This discrepancy does not present a non-frivolous issue as to the voluntariness of the waiver of appeal because De La Cruz was informed during the Rule 11 colloquy that he could only be sentenced below the mandatory minimum if the government filed a \u00a7 5K.1 motion and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>could appeal his sentence only if he was sentenced above the statutory maximum or if the sentencing judge erroneously departed upward from the otherwise applicable guidelines. Because De La Cruz was sentenced below the statutory minimum, neither of the conditions described by the plea agreement providing a right to appeal is satisfied, and the appeal must be considered wholly frivolous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence. Defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1008-14\">. This holding does not prejudice any ineffective assistance of counsel claim arising out of the negotiation of the waiver provision that De La Cruz may raise in a subsequent habeas petition. <em>See United States v. Thornton, </em>327 F.3d 268 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
