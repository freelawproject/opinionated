His sentence was later reduced to 78 months under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, and in April 2004 he was released from prison and began serving his term of supervised release. Within eight days, though, he was caught on videotape in the company of a convicted felon who was selling crack to an undercover agent, and a few months after that he was arrested by state authorities for selling drugs within 1,000 feet of a church. As a result the district court revoked Rush\u2019s supervised release and reimprisoned him for 23 months \u2014 a term just short of the two-year statutory maximum applicable where the underlying conviction is for a Class C felony, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) \u2014 to be followed by 12 additional months of supervised release. Rush filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel now moves to withdraw because she cannot find a nonfrivolous basis for appeal. <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel\u2019s supporting brief is facially adequate, and Rush himself has not responded to our invitation to present any objections, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), so we review only the potential issues identified in the brief. <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-15\">Rush\u2019s counsel identifies three potential arguments. First, she considers arguing that the district court abused its discretion in revoking his supervised release. <em>See United States v. Young, </em>41 F.3d 1184, 1186 (7th Cir.1994). Since Rush at his revocation healing admitted the violations, he could not contest the factual basis of the district court\u2019s decision; thus, any challenge to the revocation would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>have to be addressed to the court\u2019s application of the relevant statutes and sentencing guidelines. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), the district court may revoke supervised release after considering essentially the same factors it considered in imposing the original sentence, e.g., the nature and circumstances of the new violations, the defendant\u2019s history, the need to deter further crimes and protect the public, and the recommendations of the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Nonahal, </em>338 F.3d 668, 671 (7th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. McClanahan, </em>136 F.3d 1146, 1151 (7th Cir.1998). We agree with counsel that the district court\u2019s remarks during the revocation hearing evidence that it considered the \u00a7 3583 factors \u2014 the court was not required to make specific findings with respect to each, <em>see McClanahan, </em>136 F.3d at 1151 \u2014 and we note that the decision to revoke was consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s nonbinding policy statement that supervised release should be revoked upon finding a Grade A violation, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(l), which selling drugs is, <em>see United States v. Trotter, </em>270 F.3d 1150, 1151 (7th Cir.2001). In addition, counsel points out that the district court complied with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1, so there is no basis for a challenge to the revocation on procedural grounds. Rush was notified of the alleged violations, given appointed counsel, and advised about his rights at the revocation hearing. For all of these reasons, we agree with counsel that arguing that the district court abused its discretion in revoking Rush\u2019s supervised release would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Second, counsel considers whether Rush might argue that his new term of imprisonment is not \u201creasonable\u201d under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). It is not clear that <em>Booker </em>requires any change in our evaluation of prison terms imposed upon revocation of supervised release, since the revocation policy statements have always been advisory only. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 7 Pt. A(l); <em>United States v. Salinas, </em>365 F.3d 582, 588 (7th Cir.2004) . Two of our sister circuits have concluded that <em>Booker </em>replaced the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard we formerly applied with its new \u201creasonableness\u201d standard, <em>see United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 99 (2d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>400 F.3d 591, 592-93 (8th Cir.2005) ; <em>cf. United States v. Johnson, </em>403 F.3d 813, 2005 WL 857018, at *3 (6th Cir. Apr.15, 2005), but even if the two formulations are qualitatively different we would not find error under either. The new term of imprisonment is within the guideline range of 18 to 24 months for a Grade A violation and Category III criminal history, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, and the relevant statutory factors were considered. <em>See Salinas, </em>365 F.3d at 588-90 (holding that term of imprisonment \u201csignificantly longer\u201d than recommended in policy statement was not plainly unreasonable because court considered statutory factors and applicable guidelines and explained reasons for extending term). We thus agree with counsel that it would be frivolous to contest the term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">Finally, counsel considers whether Rush might argue that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel asserts that such an argument would be frivolous because we ordinarily refuse to review ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal if appellate counsel also represented the defendant at trial. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>169 F.3d 1049, 1052 (7th Cir.1999). In addition, our consideration on appeal is limited to matters shown in the record, and typically the facts necessary to establish ineffective assistance will be outside the record. <em>United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 976 (7th Cir.2002); <em>Martinez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>169 F.3d at 1052. For this reason we frequently caution defendants that an action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is a more appropriate vehicle for challenging counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Schuh, </em>289 F.3d at 976; <em>Martinez, </em>169 F.3d at 1052. Rush, of course, is at liberty to later utilize \u00a7 2255 if he can support a claim of ineffective assistance. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 509, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). In any event, as far as this appeal is concerned, counsel does not identify any deficiency in her performance that could arguably serve as a predicate for an ineffective assistance claim. Thus, as best we can tell here, ineffective assistance is not even a potential argument for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We GRANT the motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
