The IJ initially found petitioner was eligible for asylum on the basis of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of both her ethnicity and religion. Petitioner also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motions for reconsideration and to reopen. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-16\">The parties are familiar with the facts and we do not recite them here except as necessary for our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-17\">1. Because the BIA reviewed the IJ\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>we review the BIA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>denial of petitioner\u2019s application for asylum under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 924 (9th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s decision must be upheld if \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). This court can reverse \u201conly if the evidence presented by [the petitioner] was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id,.; see id. </em>n. 1 (\u201cTo reverse the BIA finding we must find that the evidence not only <em>supports </em>that conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it ....\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">We conclude substantial evidence does <em>not </em>support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioner did not establish eligibility for asylum on the basis of a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her ethnicity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the contrary, the evidence in the record compels the conclusion that petitioner established a well-founded fear of future persecution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by showing she has \u201ca subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear\u201d of future persecution in Indonesia. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Petitioner testified she fears being beaten, raped, or killed because of her ethnicity if she is removed to Indonesia. In the absence of a credibility finding, such testimony compels the conclusion that petitioner satisfied the subjective element of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Singh, </em>134 F.3d at 966.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Based on our previous decisions in <em>Sael </em>and <em>Lolong v. Gonzalez, </em>400 F.3d 1215 (9th Cir.2005), we also hold the evidence compels the conclusion petitioner satisfied the objective element of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Under the \u201cdisfavored group\u201d theory announced in <em>Sael, </em>petitioner established she was a member of a disfavored group in Indonesia because petitioner is ethnic Chinese. <em>See </em>386 F.3d at 927. Further, although petitioner did not present direct evidence showing she was individually targeted for persecution on account of her ethnicity or religion, petitioner can also establish the requisite \u201cindividualized risk of being singled out for persecution,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 925, by showing she is a Christian and a woman, two sub-groups at greater risk of persecution in Indonesia than the ethnic Chinese population as a whole. <em>See Lolong, </em>400 F.3d at 1221. Here, petitioner is Christian and is a woman, and is thus a member of two sub-groups facing a greater individualized risk of persecution in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Moreover, the documentary evidence submitted by petitioner shows the same volatile country conditions in Indonesia, especially dangerous to ethnic Chinese Christian women, which we discussed at length in <em>Sael </em>and <em>Lolong. </em>We reject the BIA\u2019s finding that these country conditions are lessened because the Indonesian \u201cgovernment is working to reduce racial tension.\u201d As we stated in <em>Lolong, </em>\u201c[the] evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>dence of the government\u2019s <em>willingness </em>to control the perpetrators of ethnic and religious violence in Indonesia fails to rebut the overwhelming evidence of the government\u2019s <em>inability </em>to control those forces.\u201d 400 F.3d at 1224-25 (emphases in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We recognize that unlike the petitioner in <em>Lolong, </em>petitioner here testified she has a 23-year-old sister still living in Indonesia and presented no evidence her sister had been subjected to harm there. The absence of such evidence could undermine petitioner\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Hakeem v. I.N.S., </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s claim of persecution upon return is weakened, even undercut, when similarly-situated family members continue to live in the country without incident.\u201d). Yet the BIA did not raise this distinction in its decision, instead relying solely upon its finding the Indonesian \u201cgovernment is working to reduce racial tension.\u201d Thus, the fact that petitioner has a 23-year-old sister still in Indonesia does not support the BIA\u2019s decision because the BIA did not rely upon it. <em>See Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cthis court cannot affirm the BIA on a ground upon which it did not rely.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Accordingly, under the \u201cdisfavored group\u201d theory announced in <em>Sael </em>and <em>Lo-long, </em>the evidence compels the conclusion petitioner established a well-founded fear of future persecution and is thus eligible for asylum. We grant the petition for review on this issue and remand so that the Attorney General may exercise his discretion whether to grant asylum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">2. We also agree with petitioner that the BIA abused its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004). Petitioner applied for asylum in part on the basis of religion, presented evidence and testimony in support of that claim, and the IJ found petitioner was eligible for asylum on the basis of ethnicity <em>and </em>religion. The BIA reversed the IJ\u2019s finding on the basis of ethnicity, but made no mention of petitioner\u2019s asylum claim based on religion. Petitioner raised the oversight in her motion to reopen, but the BIA again ignored the claim in denying the motion. The BIA thus abused its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration because the BIA failed to consider petitioner\u2019s asylum claim on the basis of religion. <em>See Arrozal v. I.N.S., </em>159 F.3d 429, 432 (9th Cir.1998) (the BIA abuses its discretion if it \u201cfails to state its reasons and show proper consideration of <em>all </em>factors when weighing equities and denying relief.\u201d). Accordingly, we grant the petition for review on this issue, vacate the BIA\u2019s order denying the motion for reconsideration, and remand to the BIA for it to consider whether petitioner is eligible for asylum on the basis of religion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b755-10\">. The government contends our jurisdiction is limited to the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioner's motion for reconsideration because petitioner did not petition for review from the BIA's denial of her application for asylum. The government is mistaken. \u201cThe petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The BIA denied petitioner's motions for reconsideration and to reopen on November 11, 2003, and petitioner filed a petition for review on December 12, 2003, within the thirty-day window. The BIA denied petitioner's application for asylum on May 19, 2003, and petitioner filed a petition for review from that decision on June 16, 2003, also within the thirty-day window. Thus, this court has jurisdiction to review both the denial of petitioner\u2019s motions for reconsideration and to reopen and her application for asylum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\">. We have previously recognized \"the term ethnicity describes a category which falls somewhere between and within the protected grounds of race and nationality.\" <em>Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1077 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b756-7\">. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion petitioner did not establish eligibility for asylum on the basis of past persecution. The various discriminatory and harassing incidents suffered by petitioner were not so severe as to constitute persecution <em>(e.g., </em>none of them resulted in physical injuiy or extreme emotional distress). <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995) (\"persecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.... Discrimination on the basis of race or religion, as morally reprehensible as it may be, does not ordinarily amount to 'persecution.' \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\">. Petitioner abandoned her withholding of removal claim when the IJ granted asylum and does not assert in her opening brief that she is entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture. Thus, petitioner waived both of those issues and we do not reach them. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1152; 1157 n. 3 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713, 721 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b757-12\">. Because we grant the petition for review on petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration, we need not consider whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying petitioner's motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
