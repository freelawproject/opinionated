On appeal, Tate argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his Rule 60(b) motion as untimely because, under Rule 60(b)(6), relief may be granted for any reason justifying relief and need not be requested within a specific time period. Tate also argues that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing him to withdraw funds on a monthly basis from his trust account in order to satisfy court filing fees. He further challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his original civil complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-22\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of relief under Rule 60(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cavaliere v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 F.2d 1111, 1115 (11th Cir.1993). Under Rule 60(b)(1), a party may file a motion for relief from a judgment or order based on mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect within one year from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>the date when the district court \u2022 entered the judgment or order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1). Under Rule 60(b)(6), a party may move for relief from judgment within a reasonable time, for \u201cany other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). We have indicated that relief under Rule 60(b)(6) \u201cis an extraordinary remedy which may be invoked only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Swim-Tech Corp., </em>722 F.2d 677, 680 (11th Cir.1984); <em>see also Frederick v. Kirby Tankships, Inc., </em>205 F.3d 1277, 1288 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Because the record demonstrates that Tate\u2019s motion was filed nearly two years after the district court dismissed his original complaint, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion as untimely. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
