At sentencing, Johnson objected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>to the application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, arguing under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), that the guidelines scheme in its entirety was unconstitutional. The parties stipulated to the base offense level as well as the applicable adjustments, establishing a guideline range of thirty-seven to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Johnson to a term of thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment and a four-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Johnson\u2019s objection to the guidelines at sentencing sufficiently preserved the <em>United States v. Booker </em>issue for our review. - U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In the instant case we are faced with a situation we\u2019ve recently addressed: a defendant sentenced to the low end of the guidelines, who preserves a <em>Booker </em>issue, but who faced no enhancement based on judge-found facts. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>406 F.3d 527 (8th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Haidley, </em>400 F.3d 642 (8th Cir.2005). As such, the issue is whether it is \u201charmless error to sentence a defendant under a mandatory federal sentencing guideline regime, as opposed to the <em>Booker </em>advisory system, when there is no Sixth Amendment issue as to the guideline computation and the defendant is sentenced at the bottom of the federal sentencing guideline range.\u201d <em>Haidley, </em>400 F.3d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Proving harmless error, or that any error does not affect substantial rights, is a burden that lies with the beneficiary of the error. Here, that is the government. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). As in <em>Garcia </em>and <em>Haidley, </em>there is nothing in this record to indicate that Johnson\u2019s sentence would have been the same under advisory guidelines. <em>See United States v. Marcussen, </em>403 F.3d 982 (8th Cir.2005) (finding harmless error because the district court set forth on the record the sentence it would have imposed had the mandatory guidelines scheme not been in place). Thus, the government has not satisfied its burden of proving the sentencing error is harmless. <em>Garcia, </em>406 F.3d 527, 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">We therefore vacate Johnson\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
