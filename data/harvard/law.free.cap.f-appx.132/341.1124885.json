He argues that his prior state conviction for carrying a concealed firearm should not be considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). For the reasons stated more fully below, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-30\">According to the undisputed facts in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Price was stopped by a patrol officer, found to be driving with a suspended license, and arrested. Thereafter, a consensual search of his car revealed two live 5.45 caliber rounds and a CN Romarm rifle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>model AK 74, manufactured in Romania. Price told officers that his fiance\u00e9, Kimberly Strauch, had purchased the gun and attempted, apparently unsuccessfully, to resell the gun back to the original seller. At the time of his arrest, Price previously had been convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>Florida state charges of carrying a concealed firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The PSI calculated Price\u2019s base offense level at 20, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), which applies when the offense involves a firearm and \u201cthe defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). Price was then given a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a)-(b), for a total offense level of 17. Price had five criminal history points, placing him in criminal history category III, which, at offense level 17, provided for a guidelines range of 30-37 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Price\u2019s sole objection to the PSI was that his prior conviction for carrying a concealed firearm should not be considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), and his offense level was, therefore, incorrectly calculated. At the sentencing hearing, Price reiterated his legal objection to the calculation of his offense level and resulting guidelines range. He did not contest that he had a conviction for carrying a concealed firearm, but argued that the crime of carrying a concealed firearm did not meet the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2K2.1. Nevertheless, Price conceded that the district court was bound by precedent to decide the issue against him. The court overruled Price\u2019s objection and sentenced Price to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment. No other objections were lodged.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On appeal, Price argues that his base offense level was incorrectly calculated at 20 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) because his prior conviction for carrying a concealed firearm is incorrectly considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under this Court\u2019s precedent. He acknowledges that we already have ruled, in <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.1998), that carrying a concealed firearm is considered a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d but respectfully disagrees with our analysis and decision. In support of his argument, Price argues that nothing in the Florida statute criminalizing carrying a concealed firearm requires proof of an element involving \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d and, thus, it should not be considered a crime of violence. He argues that a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d should require a showing of an intent to injure or commit violence, and a circuit split exists on the issue, making it ripe for reconsideration. Finally, Price argues that the State of Florida decriminalizes carrying a concealed firearm through issuance of a permit, and our interpretation of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d leads to potentially anomalous results.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 847 (11th Cir.1998). A district court\u2019s interpretations of the guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), a defendant\u2019s base offense level for a prohibited transaction involving a firearm is set at 20 if \u201cthe defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). \u201c[Cjrime of violence,\u201d as used in \u00a7 2K2.1, is given the same meaning as that term in \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and Application Note 1 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Commentary to \u00a7 4B1.2. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Under \u00a7 4B1.2, \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">[A]ny offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aaq\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l)-(2). The Commentary further clarifies that \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes conduct that, by its very nature, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">In <em>Gilbert, </em>we held that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon under Florida law fit the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) because \u201ccarrying a concealed weapon is conduct that poses a serious potential risk of injury.\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1372. More recently, in <em>United States v. Adams, </em>we reiterated our holding in <em>Gilbert </em>that the crime of carrying a concealed weapon constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of the career offender provisions found - in U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1, 4B1.2. <em>Adams, </em>316 F.3d 1196, 1197 (11th Cir.2003). We noted explicitly that, while the defendant there (as here) objected that his concealed weapons offenses were not \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d his objection was contrary to the holding in <em>Gilbert </em>and would not be revisited. <em>Id. </em>at 1197 n.l. We emphasized that \u201c[t]he law of this circuit is \u2018emphatic\u2019 that only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>Id. citing Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">While in <em>Adams, </em>a dissenting judge disagreed with the holding in <em>Gilbert </em>and urged the Court to hold an <em>en banc </em>hearing in light of a circuit split on the issue of whether carrying a concealed weapon constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we declined to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 1201-03 (Propst, J. dissenting); <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Adams, </em>62 Fed.Appx. 923 (11th Cir. Feb.25, 2003) (table). Thus, to date, neither an <em>en banc </em>panel nor the Supreme Court has overruled the holdings in <em>Gilbert </em>and <em>Adams. </em>Accordingly, a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon remains a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, and likewise, \u00a7 2K2.1, and a three-judge panel cannot overrule those holdings. Price\u2019s sentence is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-17\">. We note at the outset that Price did not raise a constitutional objection to his sentence either in the district court or in his initial brief on appeal. Therefore, any argument regarding the constitutionality of his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) has been abandoned. <em>See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1261 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that appellant abandoned his <em>Booker </em>claim on appeal by not raising a timely constitutional challenge to his sentence in his initial brief); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lebovitz, </em>401 F.3d 1263 (11th Cir.2005) (declining to address impact of <em>Booker </em>where appellant did not raise a constitutional challenge to the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to his case)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\"><em>. </em>Honorable Robert B.
