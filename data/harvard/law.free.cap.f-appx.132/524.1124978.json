Durant was sentenced to 24 months of imprisonment. He argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him because the testimony of the victim and her sister was unbelievable. He further contends that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the prosecutor to ask the victim leading questions on direct examination. Durant also asserts that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational trier of fact could have found Durant guilty of the offense charged. <em>United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 322 (5th Cir.2003). The victim\u2019s testimony was corroborated by her sister, who testified that she observed Durant touch the victim\u2019s breasts and \u201cprivate parts.\u201d The jury is solely responsible for determining the weight and credibility of the evidence. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>975 F.2d 159, 161 (5th Cir.1992). Additionally, in light of the victim\u2019s age and circumstances of the crime, the district court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the prosecutor to ask leading questions on direct examination. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>606 F.2d 96, 98 (5th Cir.1979). Accordingly, Durant\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">However, Durant\u2019s sentence is VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing in light of <em>Booker. </em>Durant\u2019s sentence was enhanced two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4(b)(3), based on the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe victim was in the custody, care, or supervisory control of the defendant.\u201d Durant\u2019s sentence was also enhanced two levels based on the district court\u2019s finding that he obstructed justice. At sentencing, Durant objected to the enhancements, arguing that the facts used to support the enhancements were not submitted to a jury or admitted by him. He thus contended that the enhancements violated the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-17\"><em>Booker </em>held that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. at 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621. <em>Booker </em>applies to Durant\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 769. As the Government acknowledges, resentencing is appropriate in Durant\u2019s case because the record does not indicate that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory regime. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>No. 03-20875, 407 F.3d 360, 376, 2005 WL 852416 at *12 (5th Cir. April 14, 2005). Thus, Durant\u2019s sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, REMANDED FOR RESEN-TENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b557-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
