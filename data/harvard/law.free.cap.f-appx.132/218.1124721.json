Reed, an inmate proceeding pro se, appeals the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim alleging constitutional violations related to his incarceration. The district court dismissed the claim without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-25\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act requires inmates bringing prison-condition actions to exhaust \u201csuch administrative remedies as are available[.]\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Suits involving multiple prison-condition complaints require \u201ctotal exhaustion,\u201d meaning \u201call available prison grievance remedies must be exhausted as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>to all of the claims.\u201d <em>Ross v. County of Bernalillo, </em>365 F.3d 1181, 1188 (10th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). To plead exhaustion properly, the prisoner plaintiff \u201cmust ... attach a copy of the applicable administrative dispositions to the complaint, or, in the absence of written documentation, describe with specificity the administrative proceeding and its outcome.\u201d <em>Steele v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>355 F.3d 1204, 1210 (10th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Mr. Reed raises at least five different prison-condition claims. The only items in the record addressing the exhaustion requirement are (1) a conclusory statement claiming that \u201cPlaintiff has previously sought informal or formal relief from the appropriate administrative officials regarding the acts complained of herein to no avail,\u201d R. Vol. I, doc. 8 at 7, and (2) a copy of one grievance, which does not indicate the grievance level or outcome. Mr. Reed\u2019s pleadings and attached grievance form do not satisfy the requirements of <em>Steele </em>by establishing that he has exhausted all his administrative remedies. To the extent that he may be able to satisfy the exhaustion requirement for a claim by showing that he was thwarted by prison authorities, he must allege that in his district-court pleadings as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Having conducted de novo review, <em>see Ross, </em>365 F.3d at 1185, we AFFIRM for substantially the same, reasons stated by the district court. Mr. Reed\u2019s motion to pay the appellate filing fee in partial payments is GRANTED. He is reminded that he is obligated to continue making partial payments until the entire fee is paid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-13\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
