Johnson appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction of her case brought against the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-80. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-25\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s determination regarding subject matter jurisdiction under the FTCA. <em>Bramwell v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>348 F.3d 804, 806 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-26\">On a motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a court may rely upon affidavits or other evidence properly before the court. <em>Ass\u2019n of Am. Med. Colls, v. United States, </em>217 F.3d 770, 778 (9th Cir.2000). A court may consider this evidence and resolve factual disputes, if necessary. <em>Id. </em>That is, with a rule 12(b)(1) motion, a court may weigh the evidence to determine whether it has jurisdiction. <em>See Roberts v. Corrothers, </em>812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir.1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Although Debbie Hill was a contractor, the evidence clearly indicates that the USPS controlled the \u201cdetailed physical performance\u201d of her position and exercised \u201csubstantial supervision\u201d over her day-today activities. <em>See, e.g., Lawrence v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>59 F.3d 112, 113 (9th Cir.1995). Such control renders inapplicable the independent contractor exception to the FTCA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The great weight of the evidence indicates that the USPS dictated every aspect of Hill\u2019s daily employment activities. Her duties were listed on a chart and left virtually no discretion as to how she was to perform her job. The directions as set forth on the chart and in the contract\u2019s scope of work were so detailed as to direct how many times to turn a mop over, as well as when and how to place safety signs. Moreover, the local postmaster also directed Hill where to clean on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">As the USPS points out, the United States may \u201cfix specific and precise conditions to implement federal objectives\u201d without becoming liable for an independent contractor\u2019s negligence. <em>United States v. Orleans, </em>425 U.S. 807, 816, 96 S.Ct. 1971, 48 L.Ed.2d 390 (1976). Here, however, the directions in the contract\u2019s scope of work were not merely conditions to implement federal objectives. Rather, through the scope of work and other directions from the local postmaster, the USPS mandated how Hill was to perform her job on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">The USPS points to other evidence indicating that it did not control Hill. For example, she was provided with no benefits such as health insurance. Further, she admits she was operating a \u201csmall business concern\u201d that was \u201cindependently owned and operated.\u201d Such evidence, however, only proves that she was a contractor \u2014 a premise that is not disputed and with which we start. The relevant inquiry is whether, despite her contractor status, the USPS exercised substantial control over Hill\u2019s daily activities. As to that question, the evidence overwhelmingly favors Plaintiff. Reviewing the matter de novo, we find that the USPS exercised substantial control over Hill so as to render the contractor exception to the FTCA inapplicable. Accordingly, subject-matter jurisdiction exists and the matter is remanded for further proceedings on the merits of the FTCA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b747-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">. This principle does not apply if \u2014 as is not the case here \u2014 the jurisdictional question is \"intertwined\u201d with the substantive merits of the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
