Treaty Doc. No. 100-20 (1988), 1465 U.N.T.S. 85; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision rather than the BIA\u2019s order. <em>See Zhang v. DOJ, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158-59 (2d Cir.2004). We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">During his asylum hearing, petitioner testified that for several years in the 1970s he worked in the counterterrorism unit of South Yemen\u2019s Ministry of the Interior. He then studied engineering in the former Soviet Union. Upon petitioner\u2019s return to South Yemen in 1984, his work at the Ministry of the Interior no longer focused on counterterrorism. Following the unification of North and South Yemen in early 1990s, petitioner moved to the Ministry of Defense in the new nation\u2019s capital. However, in 1993, petitioner left his post and returned to the territory of the former South Yemen, correctly anticipating that a civil war would break out between the North and the South. He eventually participated in the 1994 civil war on the side of South Yemen. Several summons or arrest warrants for petitioner have been issued by Yemeni authorities between 1994 and the present time. In December 1994, petitioner was arrested but apparently released without being interrogated or harmed in any manner. In 1997, petitioner left Yemen and entered the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">\u2022 In order to demonstrate his eligibility for asylum, an applicant must qualify as a \u201crefugee\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). \u201cRefiigee\u201d status, in turn, requires a demonstration that an asylum applicant \u201cis unable or unwilling to avail himself ... of the protection of [his country of nationality] because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). We have previously held that \u201c[w]ell-founded fear involves both a subjective and an objective component.\u201d <em>Abankwah v. INS, </em>185 F.3d 18, 22 (2d Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). In order to satisfy the latter, \u201can applicant must present credible, specific, and detailed evidence \u2014 whether by [his] own testimony or corroborating proof\u2014 that a reasonable person in [his] position would fear persecution if returned to [his] native country.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">In this case, the IJ found that petitioner\u2019s account was not credible. The IJ further concluded that, even absent the adverse credibility finding, petitioner\u2019s testimony would have been insufficient to demonstrate that he suffered past persecution or satisfied either the subjective or objective component of well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>On appeal, petitioner \u201cconcedes that the actions taken against him prior to his departure from Yemen to the United States do not rise to the level of past persecution.\u201d Petitioner nonetheless challenges the adverse credibility finding and the determination that he failed to make out his well-founded fear of persecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision for \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d deferring to the IJ\u2019s factual findings if \u201csupported by \u2018reasonable, substantial, and probative\u2019 evidence in the record when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Upon review of the record of this case, we affirm the IJ\u2019s conclusion that, even assuming petitioner\u2019s testimony was credible, it failed to meet the objective component of well-founded fear of future persecution. Accordingly, we need not review the IJ\u2019s credibility finding or the subjective component of petitioner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">With respect to the objective component, the IJ found that the evidence of petitioner\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in investigating Muslim fundamentalist[s]\u201d fell short of a \u201cconsistent and sufficiently detailed account necessary to provide a plausible and coherent account of the basis for his alleged fear.\u201d The IJ also found that petitioner \u201cprovided few details of the extent and purpose of his\u201d alleged efforts to combat terrorism and Muslim fundamentalism before and during Yemen\u2019s civil war. Therefore, the IJ concluded that the petitioner\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in ... these activities is remote to any claim of a fear of persecution and does not form a credible objective fear on that basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to find otherwise. Petitioner\u2019s asylum claim is largely premised on the notion that he will face retaliation for his earlier efforts to combat militant Muslim fundamentalism. We hold that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioner failed to present \u201ccredible, specific, and detailed\u201d proof of his past activities, <em>Abankwah, </em>185 F.3d at 22, that would satisfy the objective component of an asylum claim based on a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">An applicant who, like petitioner, fails to establish eligibility for asylum is necessarily unable to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">We have considered all of petitioner\u2019s arguments and found each of them to be without merit. Accordingly, the petition is DENIED and the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-9\">. On appeal, petitioner does not challenge the denial of his claim under the CAT.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
