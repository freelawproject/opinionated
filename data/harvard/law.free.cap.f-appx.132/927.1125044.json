We assume familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Chen seeks asylum and withholding of removal, claiming that he and his wife were subjected to China\u2019s coercive family planning policies. In substantial part, Chen claimed that his wife had been subjected to forced abortions and had been threatened with sterilization. At the hearings, the IJ received documentary evidence and Chen testified. The IJ then issued an oral ruling denying Chen\u2019s applications. The IJ found that Chen\u2019s testimony was not credible and plausible primarily because Chen was unable to reconcile discrepancies between his testimony and the documentary evidence and because he failed to provide sufficient details when probed during questioning. The IJ also noted that documents submitted in support of Chen\u2019s claims had not been authenticated and were thus entitled to limited weight. In the alternative, the IJ found that the asylum petition should be pretermitted because Chen did not timely apply for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">The statutory and regulatory grounds for asylum petitions based on China\u2019s coercive family planning policy are well established, as are the standards of review of the denial of such applications. <em>See Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 70-73 (2d Cir.2004). Where the BIA has affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See id. </em>at 73. We review findings of fact for \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and give particular deference to an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See id. </em>We must uphold a decision that is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole, and we may only reverse if we determine that the evidence compels the opposite conclusion. <em>See id. </em>\u201cWhere the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is based on specific examples in the record of inconsistent statements by the asylum applicant about matters material to his claim of persecution, or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters, a reviewing court will generally not be able to conclude that a reasonable adjudicator was compelled to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Dong v. Ashcroft, </em>406 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (explaining standards of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">In this case, the IJ\u2019s denial of the applications for asylum and withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence. We have considered all of Chen\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
