Rakoff, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b941-10\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">Yu Yun Chen (\u201cChen\u201d) petitions for review of the EOIR\u2019s decision denying him asylum, withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) relief. On appeal, Chen argues that the EOIR erred in denying his various applications for relief. In addressing Chen\u2019s claims, we assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">Chen, a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, arrived in the United States on April 16, 2000, and was placed in removal proceedings. Chen conceded removability, but sought asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. A hearing was held on Chen\u2019s claims for relief on June 14, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-16\">At the hearing, Chen described his and his wife\u2019s difficulties with the Chinese birth control officials prior to his arrival in the United States. According to Chen, these difficulties included fines, imprisonment, and his wife being forced to use an intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d). The couple\u2019s problems with the officials allegedly culminated in June, 2000, when \u2014 after Chen\u2019s departure for the United States \u2014 Chen\u2019s wife was forced to undergo an abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ issued an oral decision, finding Chen to be incredible, and denying Chen\u2019s applications for relief. The BIA subsequently affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-18\">We review an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004). Under this deferential standard of review, we will not <em>reverse </em>unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator\u201d would be compelled to find the alien to be credible. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 149 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will <em>vacate </em>an IJ\u2019s decision, however, where an IJ \u201chas not applied the law correctly, or has not supported its findings with record evidence.\u201d <em>See id. </em>We will also vacate where \u201cwe are deprived of the ability adequately to review\u201d the IJ\u2019s action, by virtue of the IJ\u2019s failure to consider important evidence supporting the alien\u2019s claim. <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Two aspects of the IJ\u2019s decision persuade us that this case is among those that must be returned to the agency for further review: 1) the IJ\u2019s reliance on the allegedly \u201cvague\u201d nature of Chen\u2019s testimony with respect to his wife\u2019s abortion, <em>see Matter of Yu Yun Chen, </em>No. A 77 309 453 \u2014 New York at 7-14 (Imm. Judge July 24, 2001) <em>(,hereinafter \u201cMatter of Chen\u2019\u2019)-, </em>and 2) the IJ\u2019s failure to clarify whether certain important corroborative documents in the record were considered. Together, these factors render us unable \u201cadequately to consider whether substantial evidence supports\u201d the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Tian-Yong Chen, </em>359 F.3d at 128. Accordingly \u201c[t]he appropriate course of action is to grant the petition for review, vacate the decision, and remand the case.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">In finding Chen to be incredible, the IJ relied considerably on what it perceived to be the suspiciously vague nature of Chen\u2019s testimony relating to his wife\u2019s abortion. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Chen, </em>at 7 (citing a part of Chen\u2019s testimony \u2014 in which he indicated that his wife \u201cdid not say much\u201d about the abortion when they discussed it \u2014 as \u201can example of the very vague and sketchy nature of [Chen\u2019s] testimony\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 10 (discussing Chen\u2019s inability, in his asylum testimony, to describe his wife\u2019s health difficulties following the abortion in medical terms and citing this as \u201can example of the lack of detail in [Chen\u2019s] testimony\u201d). We are unable, however, to find support in the record for the IJ\u2019s conclusion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Chen was not in China at the time of his wife\u2019s alleged abortion. <em>Cf. Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 79 n. 11. And, Chen specifically testified that his wife was not forthcoming in the phone call during which the couple discussed the incident. Furthermore, some of the details which the IJ found to be lacking \u2014 such as a more specific description of Chen\u2019s wife\u2019s medical ailments following the abortion \u2014 were not of the kind that one would anticipate an individual of Chen\u2019s education to be able to relate. <em>Cf. Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 289 (2d Cir.2000) (finding that it was unreasonable and erroneous for the BIA to expect that certain corroborative documents would be available to an alien, given the alien\u2019s \u201cfunctional illiteracy\u201d and \u201cthe circumstances of his departure.\u201d). We therefore find the IJ\u2019s reliance on this feature of Chen\u2019s testimony, in finding Chen to be incredible, to be unsupportable. <em>See Alvarado-Carillo v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 44, 52-53 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">We also agree with Chen that \u2014 in the particular circumstances of this case\u2014 the IJ\u2019s failure to discuss certain key corroborative documents is troubling. As our court has frequently indicated, a failure on the part of the agency to consider important material evidence may require vacatur. <em>See, e.g., Tian-Yong Chen, </em>359 F.3d at 128-29; <em>see also Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 290 (indicating that \u201cthe presence of corroborating evidence\u201d may be relevant to an IJ\u2019s assessment of credibility). In this case, Chen alleges that several key corroborative documents \u2014 including a certificate documenting his wife\u2019s abortion- \u2014 were not considered by the IJ. While it is possible that the IJ intended to reject those documents in rendering an overall adverse credibility finding, that intent is not made explicit in the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947). And, this is not a case in which the proof of Chen\u2019s lack of credibility was so overwhelming that we can easily presume \u2014 even in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>absence of any explicit statement by the IJ \u2014 that that was the I J\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the petition for review should be GRANTED, Chen\u2019s removal order is VACATED and the case REMANDED to the agency for further proceedings consistent with this order. We have considered all of the respondent\u2019s arguments to the contrary, and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-8\">. The BIA\u2019s affirmance does not alter our conclusion in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
