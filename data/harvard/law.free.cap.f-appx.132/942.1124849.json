We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-16\">1. In addition to challenging the BIA\u2019s December 18, 2002 order, Rahman challenges directly the BIA\u2019s July 24, 2002 order affirming the denial of asylum and withholding relief. We lack jurisdiction to review the latter order. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Zhao v. DOJ, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-17\">2. We review the denial of the motions to reconsider and reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Brice v. DOJ, </em>806 F.2d 415, 419 (2d Cir.1986) (motion to reconsider); <em>Iavorski v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 128 (2d Cir.2000) (motion to reopen); see <em>also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (decision on motion to reconsider or to reopen committed to BIA\u2019s discretion). The BIA abuses its discretion where it \u201cprovides no rational explanation,\u201d or where its decision \u201ccontains only summary or conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 93. The BIA abused its discretion in denying Rahman\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-18\">First, in denying the motion to reconsider, the BIA failed to provide any explanation for a deficiency in the IJ\u2019s decision. At his removal hearing, Rahman testified that in July 1993, he was arrested and detained in Bangladesh for his involvement with the Jatiyo political party, and that the criminal charges lodged against him were fabricated. The IJ declined to make an adverse credibility finding, but nevertheless found that Rahman did not suffer past persecution, relying primarily on court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>documents listing the allegedly false charges. There may be an explanation for this irregularity, but the BIA\u2019s decision fails to address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Second, the BIA ignored Rahman\u2019s motion to reopen altogether. <em>See Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 90 (motions to reconsider and motions to reopen are \u201cseparate and distinct and are not interchangeable\u201d). In support of this motion, Rahman submitted a recent State Department report on Bangladesh detailing instances of police and judicial corruption, and reporting that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party \u2014 at whose hands Rahman claimed past persecution \u2014 reclaimed control of the government in the October 2001 elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s denial of the motions to reconsider and reopen is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">The motion for, a stay of removal pending our decision is GRANTED; this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
