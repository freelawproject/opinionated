We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-21\">In Miller\u2019s complaint, he alleged James E. Donald, Jim Wetherington, and Edmond J. Bazar, Jr., in their individual and official capacities as prison officials with the Georgia Department of Corrections, denied him his constitutional right to access the courts by refusing to provide him with photocopies of legal documents relating to a \u00a7 1983 action he had filed in United States District Court for the Central Division of California. Prior to Miller completing service on the defendants, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Miller\u2019s instant \u00a7 1983 action as frivolous under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). In doing so, the court concluded that, because Miller had no constitutional right to free photocopies, he had failed to state a claim that was cognizable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-22\">Miller argues on appeal the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 1983 action as frivolous because he had a right to be provided with photocopies of the legal doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>uments relevant to the \u00a7 1983 action he had pending in California. Miller contends that, because he had a \u201cgenuine need\u201d for these photocopies, and because he is an indigent prisoner, prison officials were required to provide them.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Section 1915A states, in pertinent part, that a court \u201cshall review, before docketing, if feasible or, in any event, as soon as practicable after docketing, a complaint in a civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). This statute further provides that, on reviewing such a claim, the court \u201cshall identify cognizable claims or dismiss the complaint, or any portion of the complaint, if the complaint\u2014 is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a suit for failure to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). <em>Harden v. Pataki, </em>320 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2003). We, however, have not announced the standard of review applicable for a \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for frivolity. In concluding that de novo review was appropriate for \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) dismissals for failure to state a claim, we reasoned that the language in \u00a7 1915A \u201ctrack[ed]\u201d the language contained in dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Leal v. Georgia Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). On the other hand, we have determined that a court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for frivolity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">However, regardless of whether we review this \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) dismissal for frivolity de novo or for abuse of discretion, no reversible error occurred. We have determined that a claim is frivolous \u201cif it is without arguable merit either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001) (examining dismissal for frivolity under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)). \u201cAccess to the courts is clearly a constitutional right, grounded in the First Amendment, the Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Fifth Amendment, and/or the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Chappell v. Rich, </em>340 F.3d 1279, 1282 (11th Cir.2003) <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1219, 124 S.Ct. 1508, 158 L.Ed.2d 154 (2004). \u201cTo pass constitutional muster, access to the courts must be more than merely formal; it must also be adequate, effective, and meaningful.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Under this constitutional right to access the courts, prison authorities must \u201cprovid[e] prisoners with adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Blankenship, </em>163 F.3d 1284, 1290 (11th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1498, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977)). In <em>Wanninger v. Davenport, </em>697 F.2d 992 (11th Cir.1983), we examined a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 claim, in which a prisoner contended that jail officials had denied him \u201cmeaningful access to the courts\u201d by refusing his request for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>jail officials to provide him with free photocopies of ten specific federal and state legal precedents, to allow him to prepare for an evidentiary hearing in his motion for post-conviction relief. <em>Id. </em>at 993. In affirming this dismissal, we concluded that, although \u201cthere might be some circumstances in which prison officials might be required to provide photocopying services in order to preserve a prisoner\u2019s access to the courts,\u201d no support in the record existed for the contention that the jail officials abridged the prisoner\u2019s constitutional rights when they refused to provide him with free photocopies of the legal precedents he had requested. <em>Id. </em>at 994 &amp; n. 1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">In addition, to have standing to seek relief under this constitutional right to access the courts, a plaintiff must show \u201cactual injury.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, </em>331 F.3d 790, 797 (11th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 880, 124 S.Ct. 319, 157 L.Ed.2d 145 (2003). This requisite injury requirement is met by \u201cdemonstrating] that a nonfrivolous legal claim ha[s] been frustrated or ... impeded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). Indeed, this requirement means that \u201cprison officials\u2019 actions that allegedly violate an inmate\u2019s right of access to the courts must have impeded the inmate\u2019s pursuit of a nonfrivolous, post-conviction claim or civil rights action.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>163 F.3d at 1290. Thus, \u201ca plaintiff cannot merely allege a denial of access to a law library or adequate attorney, even if the denial is systemic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291 (quotations and citation omitted). \u201cTo prevail, a plaintiff must provide evidence of such deterrence, such as a denial or dismissal of a direct appeal, habeas petition, or civil rights case, that results from actions of prison officials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1290-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Miller asserts prison officials denied him his right to access the courts by refusing his request they provide him with free photocopies of legal documents he was required to serve on the defendants in his California \u00a7 1983 action. Moreover, instead of merely alleging a general denial of his constitutional right to access the courts, Miller asserted that he was injured because his \u00a7 1983 action was \u201cin jeopardy of being denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Miller, however, failed to allege the California federal court would not accept service of, or that Miller was unable to produce, hand-copied duplicates. Thus, similar to the facts in <em>Wanninger, </em>this denial did not constitute a denial of Miller\u2019s right to access the courts. <em>See Wanninger, </em>697 F.2d at 994 &amp; n. 1. Moreover, Miller failed to explain, and a review of his complaint does not reveal, why this injury necessarily resulted from the refusal of prison officials to provide him with free photocopies. <em>Cf. Wright v. Newsome, </em>795 F.2d 964, 968 (11th Cir.1986) (reversing district court\u2019s dismissal of complaint alleging that prison officials seized the prisoner\u2019s pleadings and law book and destroyed other legal papers). Accordingly, we conclude Miller\u2019s claim of denial of access to the courts was \u201cwithout arguable merit either in fact or law,\u201d and the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint for being frivolous was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>not erroneous. <em>See Bilal, </em>251 F.3d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\">.
