Ferreira pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B); the District Court entered judgment against him accordingly on April 15, 2004. The District Court sentenced Ferreira principally to 27 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-22\">On appeal, Ferreira challenges his sentence; he argues that the District Court erred in its application of an enhancement under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, specifically, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4(b)(2), and in its allocation of the burden of proof with respect to a factual dispute relevant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-23\">Because Ferreira\u2019s arguments on appeal pertain to a sentencing scheme that is no longer applied in the same manner that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>was when he was sentenced, we decline to decide the particularities of the dispute between him and the Government. Rather, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), this cause is hereby remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with <em>Crosby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Any appeal taken from the District Court\u2019s decision on remand can be initiated only by filing a new notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3, 4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Neither party to this matter will waive or forfeit any appropriate argument on remand or on any appeal post-remand by not filing a petition for rehearing of this remand order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
