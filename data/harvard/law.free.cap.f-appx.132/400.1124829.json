We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, underlying proceedings, and specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-19\">Singh applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture based on past persecution he suffered in Punjab, India due to, <em>inter alia, </em>his participation in a Sikh political party. The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) ruled that Singh established past persecution but that the government had carried its burden of showing that country conditions in India had changed to the extent that Singh no longer has a well founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Guan Shan Liao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 67 (2d Cir.2002); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i)-(ii). Singh appealed this ruling to the BIA. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on November 21, 2002. Singh did not file a petition for review from the BIA\u2019s November order. In December 2002, Singh submitted a motion to reopen removal proceedings and attached newspaper articles and other documents that allegedly demonstrated that he faced future persecution in India. Construing Singh\u2019s motion as a motion to reconsider, the BIA denied Singh\u2019s motion on May 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-20\">After the BIA affirms an IJ\u2019s order of removal, a petitioner may file a motion with the BIA (1) seeking to reopen removal proceedings based on new evidence, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c) or (2) seeking reconsideration of the removal order on the ground that the BIA made a legal or factual error, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>primary difference between a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider is that the latter motion requires a review of the record as it stood at the time of the decision and does not permit consideration of new evidence. <em>See Zhao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of motions to reopen and motions to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir.2004). We presume that the BIA construed Singh\u2019s motion as a motion to reconsider, in part, due to ambiguity in Singh\u2019s filings. The BIA correctly determined that Singh\u2019s motion to reconsider failed because it did not identify any specific legal or factual errors. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b). Singh\u2019s claim would also fail if we were to construe his motion as a motion to reopen because he did not properly present new evidence. For instance, the additional documents Singh provided with his motion were either immaterial to Singh\u2019s specific claim or available at the time of the former hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion and the petition for review is denied. The disposition of this appeal vacates the stay of removal previously entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
