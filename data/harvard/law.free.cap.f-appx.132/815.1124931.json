Specifically, Phillips argues that the district court should have evaluated the \u201ccomparative seriousness\u201d of the underlying incidents involving the Caucasian officers because the evidence shows that several of the Caucasian officers engaged in misconduct, such as attempted murder and aggravated battery, that was much more serious than his \u201cminor domestic spat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing all evidence and factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Burton v. Tampa Housing Authority, </em>271 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. We conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the City because Phillips was fired for, among other things, violating a temporary injunction on a number of separate occasions, and because the evidence showed that his former Caucasian co-employees, none of whom had violated a temporary injunction, were not in fact sufficiently similarly situated to be used as comparators.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
