He argues that the enhancement provisions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. He further argues that the \u201ctiming\u201d of his prior felony conviction, which was used to enhance his sentence, is a separate fact that must be alleged in the indictment and proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Palacios acknowledges that his first argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in light of the decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2536-43. This court does not have the authority to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984. Thus, Palacios\u2019s argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Palacios\u2019s argument that the indictment must allege the \u201ctiming\u201d of the prior felony conviction, which was used to enhance his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), has no merit. Palacios has not explained why an indictment that need not allege the defendant\u2019s prior conviction at all under <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is deficient for omitting the details of that prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Accordingly, Palacios\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b564-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
