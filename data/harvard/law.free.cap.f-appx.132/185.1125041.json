Gonfa also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen proceedings so that she may present new evidence. We deny the petition as to the asylum and withholding of removal claims, and we do not have jurisdiction to consider Gonfa\u2019s CAT claim. We also deny Gonfa\u2019s motion to reopen in light of new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. There are a number of discrepancies in Gonfa\u2019s application that supports the IJ\u2019s finding. Primarily, Gonfa conceded that she initially consciously misrepresented the length of her husband\u2019s tenure in prison, which is information that she understood to be material and central to her initial asylum claim. Also supporting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding were Gonfa\u2019s unpersuasive account of the rapes, her misrepresentations to an INS officer upon arrival in the United States, her misrepresentations about her contact with her first immigration attorney, and the IJ\u2019s observations of Gonfa\u2019s in-court demeanor. Fading to mention a rape in an earlier asylum interview will not, of itself, support an adverse credibility determination, <em>see Kebede v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 808, 811 (9th Cir.2004), but in this case there are other inconsistencies in her account that support the IJ\u2019s determination that the rape claims are not credible. Thus, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, and Gonfa fails to qualify for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cBy failing to qualify for asylum, petitioners necessarily fail to satisfy the more stringent standard of withholding of removal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Gonfa has also petitioned this court for review of her CAT claim. We have no jurisdiction to entertain this claim because Gonfa did not raise it on appeal before the BIA. <em>Cf. Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713 (9th Cir.2004) (noting that a petitioner\u2019s failure to raise an issue to the BIA constitutes a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, depriving this court of jurisdiction). In Gonfa\u2019s notice to appeal to the BIA, there is no mention of the CAT claim, and, in her brief supporting her appeal, she does not explicitly request that the BIA reverse the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief. The BIA does not address Gonfa\u2019s CAT claim in its opinion affirming the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">We affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of Gonfa\u2019s motion to reopen. Gonfa argues that her motion to reopen is appropriate because she has new, material evidence to present in support of her petition. Motions to reopen should be granted when they are based on \u201cnew\u201d evidence where \u201cthe new evidence is qualitatively different from the evidence presented at his asylum hearing.\u201d <em>See Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (2005) (defining new evidence as evidence that was not available at the time of the former hearing). Here, Gonfa presents affidavits, pictures, and a newspaper clipping in support of her motion to reopen. While arguably material, this additional evidence is not new be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>cause, with the exception of the May 2000 copy of the <em>Ethiopian Herald, </em>it all was available at the time of her 1999 hearing before the IJ. Because most of this additional evidence was previously available, and because the <em>Ethiopian Herald </em>evidence does not substantially change the nature of Gonfa\u2019s evidentiary case, the BIA properly denied Gonfa\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b218-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>cation and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
