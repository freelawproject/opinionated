For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the parties who are familiar with the factual and procedural background of this case, we need not reiterate that background except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-16\">In this consolidated appeal, the defendants claim the government failed to prove that the checks they conspired to utter were instruments of \u201can organization,\u201d as required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a). They contend that the counterfeit checks were instruments of the \u201ccheck owner or the holder of the account,\u201d rather than S &amp; T Bank. Appellants\u2019 Br. At 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-17\">Thus, the only issue before us is whether the \u201cof an organization\u201d requirement in \u00a7 513(a) may be fulfilled by use of counterfeited securities drawn on personal accounts of a legitimate bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-18\">The government argues that our review is the deferential review afforded to challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. Appellee\u2019s Br. At 3. However, the defendants are not arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support their conviction. Rather, they are arguing issues of statutory construction. Our standard of review is therefore <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-19\">Section 513 broadly defines \u201csecurity\u201d to include \u201ca note, stock certificate, treasury stock certificate, bond, treasury bond, debenture, certificate of deposit, interest coupon, bill, [or] check ... \u201d. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(c)(3)(A). We believe the district court correctly concluded that the checks at issue here belonged to both the fictitious individual account holders and S &amp; T Bank. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>155 F.3d 942, 946 (8th Cir.1998). S &amp; T Bank is an \u201corganization\u201d that is clearly involved in interstate commerce, and the checks in question had that bank\u2019s routing number along with nonexistent account numbers. The government correctly notes that S &amp; T\u2019s name added an air of legitimacy to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>scheme as store employees were more likely to accept checks that carried that name and routing number. Appellee Br. at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary fails to acknowledge that a check may belong to both the individual account holder and the banking entity (\u201corganization\u201d) purportedly issuing the check for the purposes of section 513. <em>Jackson, </em>at 946. Moreover, use of fictitious account numbers does not negate the legal reality that the instruments here, bearing the name and routing number of S &amp; T Bank, were instruments of that bank. <em>See United States v. Chappell, </em>6 F.3d 1095 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
