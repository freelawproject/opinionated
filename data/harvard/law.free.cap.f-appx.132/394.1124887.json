The IJ rejected Chen\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a), 1231(b)(3), and denied him relief under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), <em>adopted </em>Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100-20 (1988), 1465 U.N.T.S. 85; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-18\">When reviewing asylum claims, \u201c[w]e review the factual findings underlying the [IJ\u2019s] determinations under the substantial evidence standard, reversing only if no reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find that petitioner suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 177 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003) (noting that when the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ directly).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-19\">In this case, the IJ\u2019s adverse findings relating principally to material inconsistencies and omissions in the record were supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (per curiam); <em>see also Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause [asylum and withholding] relief are factually related but with a heavier burden for withholding, it follows that an applicant who fails to establish his eligibility for asylum necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding.\u201d). Likewise, the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief for Chen also satisfied the substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>dence standard. <em>See Mu-Xin Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 134, 144 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">We have considered all of Chen\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The petition for review is therefore DENIED, and the outstanding motion for stay of removal is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
