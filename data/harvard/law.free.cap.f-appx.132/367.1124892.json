Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Fred Johnson\u2019s appeal from <em>Johnson v. Principi, </em>02-2104 (Vet. App. Nov. 16, 2004) for lack of jurisdiction. Johnson has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-19\">Johnson appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims from a 2002 Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (BVA) decision finding that Johnson had failed to submit new and material evidence demonstrating a service-connected psychiatric disability. The BVA acknowledged that some of the evidence was, arguably new. However, the BVA further concluded that the evidence was not material for purposes of reopening Johnson\u2019s claim. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims affirmed the BVA\u2019s decision, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-21\">The record does not contain any evidence since [Johnson\u2019s last service connection claim was denied in 1992] that would support a claim for service connection for psychiatric disability, including either schizophrenia or nervous disorder .... The Board was correct in assessing the evidence of record since the 1992 claim-denial decision, and its conclusion that none of that evidence was new and material is supported by the record and is thus not clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-22\">Johnson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-23\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Veterans Court. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). This court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-24\">Johnson\u2019s appeal does not satisfy and of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. In his informal brief, Johnson asserts that the facts supported his claim for service connection. However, Johnson fails to assert any constitutional challenge concerning the decision on appeal, and he raises no issue concerning the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 findings and review of the BVA\u2019s determination that the evidence submitted was not new and material is not within our jurisdiction. In these circumstances, this court lacks jurisdiction to review Johnson\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-25\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
