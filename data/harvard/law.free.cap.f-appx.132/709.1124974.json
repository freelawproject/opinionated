We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Because the state court has supplied no reasoned decision on these claims, we perform an independent review of the record to determine whether the state court\u2019s decision was objectively unreasonable. <em>Delgado v. Lewis, </em>223 F.3d 976, 982 (9th Cir.2000). Further, in light of the record as a whole, any alleged error must have had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting statements obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Upon review of the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s statements were made after his <em>Miranda </em>warning was issued, but before he invoked his right to an attorney, was not objectively unreasonable, <em>see Delgado, </em>223 F.3d at 982, and had no effect on the verdict, <em>see Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in failing to require the state to accept his stipulation with respect to the victim\u2019s treating physician\u2019s testimony. However, the state is entitled to prove its case free from being forced to \u201cstipulate the evidence away\u201d and we conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling was not unreasonable. <em>See Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 189, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997). Accordingly, the denial of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, also based on this argument, was not objectively unreasonable. <em>See Delgado, </em>223 F.3d at 982.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">Appellant also contends that trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance during closing arguments by referencing to evidence not in the record. To succeed in this claim, appellant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Upon review, we conclude that appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice, <em>see id. </em>at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and that counsel\u2019s statement did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d <em>see Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>We construe the remaining uncertified issues briefed on appeal as a motion to expand the certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-l(e). Upon review of the claims, we conclude there has been no substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right, and the motion is denied. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b742-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
