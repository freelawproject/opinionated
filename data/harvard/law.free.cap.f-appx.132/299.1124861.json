Cruz-Perez argues that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), both by increasing Cruz-Perez\u2019s sentence based on previous felony drug convictions, and by treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory instead of applying them in an advisory fashion. Because <em>Booker </em>does not apply to the use of previous convictions in sentencing and any error in the use of the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion was harmless, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-24\">Cruz-Perez pleaded guilty to both crimes. During Cruz-Perez\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court applied a twelve-level enhancement for a previous felony conviction for drug trafficking. Cruz-Per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ez objected to the enhancement and argued that the court violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because the previous conviction had neither been admitted by Cruz-Perez nor found by a jury, and had not been included in the indictment. The district court overruled the objection, sentenced Cruz-Perez to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, and stated that the sentence would be the same if the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Sentencing Guidelines. Cruz-Perez appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Cruz-Perez argues that, under <em>Blakely, </em>the district court violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendment by increasing his sentence because of a previous conviction he had not admitted and that was not included in the indictment, and that we should remand for Cruz-Perez to be sentenced under the Guidelines without the twelve-level enhancement. This argument fails. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court \u201cheld that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence. This conclusion was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). We concluded that \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Cruz-Perez also argued that, even if <em>Booker </em>did not apply to the use of previous convictions in sentencing, the district court violated <em>Booker </em>by finding that his previous conviction was a drug-trafficking felony. This argument also fails. In <em>Shelton, </em>we held that, under <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>the district court did not err when it increased Shelton\u2019s sentence based on three previous crimes that were drug-related. <em>Id. </em>at 1327, 1329. We made no distinction between finding a previous conviction, and finding a previous conviction to be drug-related. <em>Id. </em>In <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>we held that, under <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the district court did not err when it increased Orduno-Mireles\u2019s sentence based on a previous conviction that the court found to be a crime of violence. 405 F.3d 960, 962 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). We held that the district court did not resolve \u201cdisputed facts related to the prior conviction which were not adjudicated in the prior proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the district court did not resolve disputed facts related to Cruz-Perez\u2019s previous conviction that were not adjudicated in his previous proceeding, the district court did not err by finding that Cruz-Perez\u2019s previous conviction was a drug-trafficking felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Cruz-Perez also argues that, under <em>Booker, </em>the district court erred when it treated the Guidelines as mandatory during sentencing. It is <em>\u201cBooker </em>error for the district court to sentence [a prisoner] under a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31. We must disregard this error, however, if the error was harmless. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u201cTo find harmless error, we must determine that the error did not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 670 (11th Cir.1998). Because the district court did not violate the Sixth Amendment, the only error was the statutory error of applying the Guidelines as mandatory. That error is \u201charmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], \u2018or had but very slight effect.\u2019 If one can say \u2018with fair assurance ... that the [sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>tence] was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 the [sentence] is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Homaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 762, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). We recently held that, where a district court explained that it would have imposed the same sentence even if the Guidelines did not apply, the error was harmless even under the more stringent \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard for constitutional error. <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir.2005). The district court stated that even if the Supreme Court applied \u201cthe <em>Blakely </em>rationale\u201d to the Guidelines, Cruz-Perez\u2019s sentence would have been the same. The <em>Booker </em>error was, therefore, harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
