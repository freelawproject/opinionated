R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-22\">Wendell Elliot Ricco, a federal prisoner appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The petition challenges Ricco\u2019s disciplinary conviction and resultant sanctions for violating Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Code 205. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13 Table 3. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a), and we affirm</p>\n<p id=\"b786-23\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b786-24\">Ricco, an inmate at Leavenworth, was found masturbating in his cell by a prison officer during the 3 a.m. bed count on May 25, 2002. According to the officer\u2019s report, Ricco \u201cwas sitting on the edge of his bunk stroking his penis with his right hand. He had his boxers pulled down with his penis fully exposed. His cell lights were on and he made no attempt to stop what he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>doing.\u201d (R., Doc. 1, Ex. A.) Ricco was charged with \u201cEngaging in a sexual act\u201d in violation of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13, Table 3, code 205. He was found guilty by a Discipline Hearing Officer in June 19, 2002, following administrative discipline proceedings. Sanctions of some form were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Ricco filed a habeas petition in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 claiming that he was unlawfully disciplined for engaging in a sex act. He argued that masturbation is not a \u201csex act\u201d prohibited by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13, Table 3, code 205. The district court dismissed Ricco\u2019s Habeas petition, holding that the behavior described in the incident report was sufficient to establish the commission of a sexual act in violation of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13, Table 3, code 205. Ricco filed a Motion for Reconsideration on December 3, 2003, renewing his original argument. The district court denied Ricco\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration on April 29, 2004. The district court granted Ricco leave to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Ricco appeals from the order of dismissal and the order denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Habeas proceedings are typically brought under \u00a7 2241 to challenge the legality of custody and secure either release from illegal custody or a shortened period of confinement. <em>Rhodes v. Hannigan, </em>12 F.3d 989, 991 (10th Cir.1993). However, \u201ca \u00a7 2241 attack on the execution of a sentence may challenge some matters that occur at prison, such as deprivation of good-time credits and other prison disciplinary matters.\u201d <em>McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 811 (10th Cir.1997). This is because prison disciplinary proceedings, such as the deprivation of good-time credits, affect the fact or duration of the prisoner\u2019s custody. <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 487-88, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Additionally, prisoners have a protected property interest in good time credits which requires due process procedural protections before they can be revoked. <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). To comport with the minimum requirements of procedural due process, the findings of the prison disciplinary board must be supported by \u201csome evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">Ricco was found in violation of a High Category offense \u2014 engaging in sexual acts. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13, Table 3, code 205. High Category offenses are punishable by sanctions including parole date rescission, loss of good time credits, disciplinary transfer, segregation, monetary restitution, loss of privileges, change of quarters, removal from programs and group activities, loss of job, and the impoundment of personal property. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13, Table 3. Ricco argues that masturbation is not prohibited by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13, Table 3, code 205. That provision prohibits prisoners from \u201cengaging in sexual acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">On appeal, Ricco argues the term \u201csexual acts\u201d should be given the definition found in the criminal statutes. Specifically, he points to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(2) where \u201csexual act\u201d is defined as contact between one person\u2019s penis, mouth, hand or object and another\u2019s genitals or anus. He argues the prohibited sexual acts necessarily re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>quire the involvement of another person and thus, masturbation is not prohibited by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.13, Table 3, code 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">It is unclear from the record, however, whether Ricco has been denied good time credits or subjected to another form of discipline which affects the duration of his imprisonment. Where a disciplinary action does not \u201cwork a major disruption in [a prisoner\u2019s] environment\u201d or \u201cinevitably affect the duration of his sentence,\u201d the prisoner has not suffered a hardship that triggers due process protections. <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 486-87, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Ricco\u2019s petition for habeas is devoid of any clear statement describing the nature of the disciplinary sanction. The district court specifically noted that \u201cPetitioner does not specify whether he was penalized by the loss of good time credits.\u201d (R., Doc. 5 at 2.) The only disciplinary action apparent in the record is Ricco\u2019s claim that his \u201crecord and file will be damage [sic] for life as well as his character \u2018assassinated <em>FOREV</em>ER!/[\u2019] \u201d (R., Doc. 7 at 2.) Character assassination does not affect the duration of Ricco\u2019s imprisonment nor is it a formal disciplinary action and thus is not subject to review under \u00a7 2241. Additionally, the alleged damage to his \u201crecord and file\u201d, standing alone, is insufficient disciplinary action for purposes of \u00a7 2241 as there is no indication that it affects the duration of his imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.
