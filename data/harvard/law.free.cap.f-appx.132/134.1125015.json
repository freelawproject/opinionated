Rodriguez challenges his twenty-five years to life sentence imposed under California\u2019s Three Strikes Law, CaLPenal Code \u00a7\u00a7 667(d), 667(e)(2), 1170.12(b) and 1170.12(c)(2), for a petty theft with a prior conviction under CaLPenal Code \u00a7 666. He argues that his sentence is an unreasonable application of federal law, in violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Rodriguez pled guilty to petty theft of a package of cheese and two candy bars, worth about $4.00. The \u201cprior\u201d to which he pled, however, was in fact thirty-three robbery convictions. We review the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision on this claim, as it is the last reasoned state court decision. <em>Ylst v. Nunnemaker, </em>501 U.S. 797, 803, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Although the state Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was issued before <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003,) and <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003), it was not contrary to, nor did it involve an unreasonable application of, then-clearly established federal law. <em>See Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980); <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983); <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991); <em>see also Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 381-82, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Court of Appeal took into account the \u201cnature and circumstances of appellant\u2019s current felony offense and qualifying prior felony convictions\u201d when it affirmed Rodriguez\u2019s three-strikes sentence. In <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. at 285, 100 S.Ct. 1133, the Court had upheld a sentence of life with the possibility of parole for a defendant convicted of obtaining $120 by false pretenses, with prior convictions for credit card fraud and forgery. In <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. at 996, 111 S.Ct. 2680, the Court upheld a sentence of life without parole for a first time offender convicted for possession of 672 grams of cocaine, finding that it was not unusual. <em>But see Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. at 303, 103 S.Ct. 3001 (finding a sentence of life without parole for uttering a \u201cno account\u201d check with six prior nonviolent crimes to be cruel and unusual punishment). Although the California Court of Appeal did not cite these decisions explicitly, Rodriguez\u2019s sentence, considered within the context of his recidivism, was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of those decisions. <em>See Early v. Packer, </em>537 U.S. 3, 8, 123 S.Ct. 362, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002) (\u201cAvoiding [the] pitfalls [of <em>Williams </em>] does not require citation of our cases \u2014 indeed, it does not even require <em>awareness </em>of our cases, so long as neither the reasoning nor the result of the state-court decision contradicts them.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">In <em>Ewing, </em>the Court reaffirmed that \u201c[i]n weighing the gravity of [a petitioner\u2019s] offense, [a court] must place on the scales not only his current felony, but also his long history of felony recidivism.\u201d 538 U.S. at 28, 123 S.Ct. 1179. This is precisely what the California Court of Appeal did in taking into account Rodriguez\u2019s 33 prior convictions. The district court\u2019s denial of his petition for habeas corpus is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b166-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
