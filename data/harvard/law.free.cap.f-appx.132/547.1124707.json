Garcia-Coronado, </em>108 Fed.Appx. 939 (5th Cir.2004), <em>vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1362, 161 L.Ed.2d 99 (2005). He argued that his sentence constituted reversible error because, <em>inter alia, </em>the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). We dismissed his appeal, ruling that reversal of Garcia\u2019s sentence on <em>Blakely </em>grounds was foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464 (5th Cir.2004), <em>vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1003, 160 L.Ed.2d 1006 (2005). Garcia subsequently appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court vacated this Court\u2019s judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">Garcia entered into a plea agreement wherein he waived his right to appeal a sentence imposed within the U.S. Sentencing Guideline range. The district court followed the applicable guidelines in this case. Thus, Garcia\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument is foreclosed by his plea agreement. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 746-47, 2005 U.S.App. LEXIS 6530, *6-10 (5th Cir. Apr. 15, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-20\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that we could entertain a Boofcer-based appeal of Garcia\u2019s sentence, we still would not reverse his sentence or vacate it and remand for resentencing. Garcia did not object on Sixth Amendment/ <em>Booker </em>grounds to his sentence in the district court. Therefore, we would review his sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Under that standard we will reverse if an appellant can show that (1) there is error; (2) the error is plain; and (3) the error affects \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the error \u201cmust have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201c \u2018If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-21\">Assuming Garcia\u2019s sentence constitutes <em>Booker </em>error, we find that his substantial rights were not affected. In order to show that substantial rights were affected, Garcia must \u201cdemonstratef ] that the sentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521. A review of the sentencing hearing does not yield any evidence that the sentencing judge would have reached a different result. Thus, on this ground, we affirm Garcia\u2019s sentence in the alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Accordingly, we reinstate our prior judgment affirming Garcia\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
