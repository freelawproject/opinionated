He claimed that his indictment was void because he was not therein charged with an independent substantive offense; that the trial court, in effect, amended the indictment to include an aggravating offense at the sentencing phase; and that the trial court enhanced his sentence using facts not found by the jury or admitted by Speight. The District Court, determining that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was not an inadequate or ineffective means by which Speight could bring his claims, dismissed Speight\u2019s petition. Speight filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. Speight appeals. Because this appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Speight cannot bring his petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, because a motion to challenge his conviction and sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2005). Although Speight\u2019s claims appear at first blush to be based on <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 243 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348,147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and Apprendi\u2019s progeny, Speight purports to ground his arguments in <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). No matter which of these cases he relies on, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is not an inadequate or ineffective way to bring his claims. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120-21 (3d Cir.2002); <em>United States ex rel Leguillou v. Davis, </em>212 F.2d 681, 684 (3d Cir.1954). Therefore, the District Court properly dismissed Speight\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction and declined to grant his motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">For the reasons stated above, the District Court\u2019s orders will be summarily affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-9\">. As the District Court noted in response to Speight\u2019s argument that the Suspension Clause was violated by the dismissal of his petition for lack of jurisdiction, \"the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person\u2019s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Swain v. Pressley, </em>430 U.S. 372, 381, 97 S.Ct. 1224, 51 L.Ed.2d 411 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
