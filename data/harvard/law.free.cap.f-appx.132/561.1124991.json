(hereinafter \u201cExperian\u201d) seeking to suppress reporting of his poor credit history and damages resulting therefrom. Experian removed the case to federal court. Gore moved to remand the case to state court but Judge Barefoot Sanders denied the motion to remand. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment and in September 2004, Judge Sanders denied Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to Experian on all counts. Gore appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the reply brief, the record excerpt and relevant portions of the record itself. For the reasons stated by Judge Sanders in each of the Memorandum and Orders as to which Gore sought appellate review in this appeal, we affirm the rulings of Judge Sanders therein and we affirm the final judgment entered by Judge Sanders on September 7, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
