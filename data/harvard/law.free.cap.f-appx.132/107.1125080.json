His counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). For reversal, counsel argues that Clemmons\u2019s criminal history was improperly calculated, because three of his prior sentences should have been considered related. However, these sentences were separated by intervening arrests, and thus were properly deemed to be unrelated for purposes of Clemmons\u2019s criminal history score. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2. Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-24\">. The Honorable Howard F. Sachs, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
