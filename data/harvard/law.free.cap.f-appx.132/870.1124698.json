The IJ denied Wang\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of deportation and found that Wang was not credible, that Wang\u2019s story was implausible, and that he supplemented his application with insufficient corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Where the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, as here, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Zhang v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158-59 (2d Cir.2004). We defer to an IJ\u2019s factual findings as long as they are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Under the substantial evidence standard, a finding of fact must stand \u201cif it is supported by \u2018reasonable, substantial, and probative\u2019 evidence in the record when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Diallo v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000)). When the petitioner challenges a credibility finding made by an IJ and subsequently adopted by the BIA, \u201cwe afford \u2018particular deference\u2019 in applying the substantial evidence standard,\u201d <em>Zhang v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Montero v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997)); that is, we reverse an adverse credibility determination only if \u201ca reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit [the petitioner\u2019s] testimony.\u201d <em>Chen v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Upon a thorough review of the record, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-12\">We also note that Wang additionally argues in his petition that he is eligible for withholding of removal under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. In order to receive relief under the Convention Against Torture, Wang was required to \u201cestablish that it is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>see also Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 184 (2d Cir.2004). Even if we had jurisdiction to review this claim, the IJ\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence. The record does not compel a reasonable fact-finder to find that the petitioner qualified for relief under the treaty. <em>Id. </em>at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED and the order of the BIA is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
