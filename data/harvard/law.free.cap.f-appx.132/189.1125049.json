McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b221-24\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-25\">Petitioner Raul Jeronimo Rios is a native and citizen of Nicaragua who was granted lawful permanent resident status in Colorado in 1997. On February 27, 2003, he was convicted by the State of Colorado of \u201cSex Assault-10-year age difference,\u201d in violation of Colo.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 18-3-402(l)(e). Admin. R. at 108. A notice to appear was filed to initiate removal proceedings on September 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>2003. <em>Id. </em>at 128. An immigration judge (IJ) ruled that petitioner\u2019s conviction constituted an aggravated felony within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and that he should be removed to Nicaragua. The Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) affirmed without opinion. Petitioner petitions for review of the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Because the Board affirmed without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency decision. Admin. R. at 2; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(ii). The IJ\u2019s determination that petitioner committed an aggravated felony within the meaning of the INA implicates the jurisdiction-stripping provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). <em>See Khalayleh v. INS, </em>287 F.3d 978, 979 (10th Cir.2002). Because this case is governed by the permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, however, we have jurisdiction to determine whether the jurisdictional bar applies. <em>See Tapia Garcia v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1216, 1219-20 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Petitioner argues on appeal that: (1) the IJ erred in determining that his conviction was an aggravated felony because it was a misdemeanor under state law; (2) the IJ\u2019s \u201cchild abuse\u201d analysis should not apply to his state conviction; and (3) the IJ erred by relying on documents underlying the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In support of his arguments, petitioner asserts that he was charged as being deportable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), Pet\u2019r Br. at 11 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1, 16, which covers \u201c[djomestic violence, stalking, and child abuse.\u201d Contradicting that assertion, the notice to appear clearly states that petitioner was charged with having been convicted of an aggravated felony under \u201cSection 237(a) (2) (A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) [codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) ] ... in that, at any time after admission, [petitioner was] convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act [codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) ].\u201d Admin. R. at 128. Section 1101(a)(43)(A) defines an aggravated felony to include \u201cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d The IJ\u2019s decision plainly states that petitioner was deportable because his state conviction for sexual assault of a minor constituted \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and was therefore an aggravated felony within the meaning of the INA, that is, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). <em>See </em>Admin. R. at 87.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, petitioner asserts that \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d is defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, Pet\u2019r Br. at 22, but the IJ explicitly relied on the definition in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(a)(8), which the Board adopted in <em>In re Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 991, 995-996 (BIA 1999), Admin. R. at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">The IJ\u2019s decision stands or falls on the reasons the IJ actually stated. <em>See Mickeviciute v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 1159, 1162-63 (10th Cir.2003). Petitioner does not address or challenge the reasoning upon which the IJ relied, however, and we therefore will not disturb the IJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioner committed an aggravated felony within the meaning of the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">In addition, petitioner\u2019s argument that his state conviction for a misdemeanor cannot constitute an aggravated felony under the INA is without merit. \u201c \u2018Aggravated felony\u2019 is a term of art created by Congress to describe a class of offenses that subjects aliens convicted of those offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>to certain disabilities.\u201d <em>United States v. Robles-Rodriguez, </em>281 F.3d 900, 902 (9th Cir.2002) (citing H.R.Rep. No. 101-681(1), at 147 (Sept. 5, 1990), <em>reprinted in </em>1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6472, 6553). Thus, \u201c \u2018[aggravated felonies\u2019 are not necessarily a subset of felonies; for instance, an offense classified by state law as a misdemeanor can be an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 ... if the offense otherwise conforms to the federal definition of \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 903; <em>see also Espinoza-Franco v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 461, 465 (7th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Gonzales-Vela, </em>276 F.3d 763, 766-768 (6th Cir.2001). As already noted, petitioner has not challenged the IJ\u2019s reasons for his determination that petitioner\u2019s conviction fell within 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Finally, petitioner\u2019s argument that the IJ should not have relied on a document underlying his conviction to determine the victim\u2019s age is frivolous. The statute of conviction showed that the victim was a minor and that the conviction fell within the scope of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(a)(8). <em>Compare </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 18-3-402(l)(e) <em>-with </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We conclude that we lack jurisdiction over this petition for review because petitioner was convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of the INA. <em>See Khalayleh, </em>287 F.3d at 979. Petitioner\u2019s counsel is admonished that his apparent disregard for the accuracy of his factual and legal arguments is a disservice to both court and client and that future dereliction may result in disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Petitioner seeks leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis on appeal. In order to succeed on his motion, he must show both an inability to pay the filing fee and the existence of a nonfrivolous issue that states a claim on which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(e)(2); <em>Coppedge v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 438, 445, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962); <em>Ragan v. Cox, </em>305 F.2d 58, 60 (10th Cir.1962). We conclude that petitioner has not raised a nonfrivolous issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Petitioner\u2019s application to proceed in for-ma pauperis is denied, and we order him to pay all appellate filing fees as directed by the Clerk of Court. The petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b221-26\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">. The IJ inadvertently cited INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), which is codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), but there is no question that he meant to cite INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(A), which is codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
