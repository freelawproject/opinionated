R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b698-17\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b698-18\">In April and May 2001, the City of Chicago ticketed and placed a \u201cDenver Boot\u201d on Raymond Russell\u2019s car. Russell filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in June 2003, alleging a practice of ticketing and booting vehicles based on the race of the owner, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. He also asserted state law claims. On April 21, 2004, the district court granted the City\u2019s motion to dismiss because the two-year statute of limitations for civil rights actions had expired by the time Russell filed suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-22\">On April 30 Russell filed a motion to reconsider under Rule 59, which the district court denied on July 7 because Russell did not present any new evidence, legal authority, or arguments beyond that which he introduced in the earlier proceedings. The district court denied a subsequent motion filed by Russell entitled \u201cMotion to Reconsider Factual Dispute,\u201d which although not styled as a Rule 60(b) motion became one as a matter of law. <em>See Talano v. Northwestern Med. Faculty Found., </em>273 F.3d 757, 762 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-23\">Although the district court denied Russell\u2019s Rule 59 motion on July 7, Russell did not file his appeal until September 30, well beyond the allowable thirty days from the date of that judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(A). We therefore limited this appeal to a review of the denial of his second motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-24\">In only general, cursory terms, Russell challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his second motion to reconsider. He contends, for instance, that the district court abused its discretion by \u201cignoring errors in .the law\u201d that were documented in his motion. But \u201clegal error is not a proper ground for relief under Rule 60(b).\u201d <em>Gleash v. Yuswak, </em>308 F.3d 758, 761 (7th Cir.2002). Nor are disputed factual issues grounds for relief under Rule 60(b). If Russell wanted to challenge the dismissal of his complaint on these grounds, he should have filed a timely notice of appeal. <em>Bell v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>214 F.3d 798, 801 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Russell\u2019s second motion to reconsider is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
