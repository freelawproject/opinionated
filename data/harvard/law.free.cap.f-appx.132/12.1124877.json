INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Evidence of Abdallah\u2019s harassment by Israeli soldiers does not compel a finding of past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Cf. Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 584 (5th Cir.1996) (alien twice detained and beaten for participation in large demonstrations did not establish past persecution); <em>Ozdemir v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 6, 7 (5th Cir.1994) (alien did not suffer persecution when he was detained for three days, questioned about his participation in terrorist organizations, and beaten); <em>Fleurinor v. INS, </em>585 F.2d 129, 132 (5th Cir.1978) (alien beaten during a ten-day detention did not establish probable persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-19\">Because Abdallah has not shown persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution as required for obtaining asylum, he also has not shown a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution as required by the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994). Similarly, he has not cleared \u201cthe higher bar of torture\u201d as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>quired for relief under the CAT. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Contrary to Abdallah\u2019s contentions, the July 28, 1951, United Nations \u201cConvention relating to the Status of Refugees\u201d (Convention) does not give Abdallah any rights beyond what he already enjoys under United States immigration statutes. <em>See INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 421-28, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984); <em>see also Faddoul, </em>37 F.3d at 190 (holding that \u201cstateless individuals must demonstrate the same well-founded fear of persecution as those with nationalities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Abdallah contends that the IJ\u2019s order that he be removed \u201cto such nation as may accept him\u201d demonstrates that he is entitled to asylum because his removal is impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible and that it deprives him of due process by removing him \u201cto nowhere.\u201d The removal order specifying removal to \u201csuch country as may accept\u201d Abdallah is facially valid under immigration statutes and does not establish that he is entitled to asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b) (providing various alternative destinations for aliens being removed). Moreover, Abdallah has not shown that he has sought or been refused admission to another country. His speculative contentions entitle him to no relief. <em>See Smith v. City of Brenham, Tex., </em>865 F.2d 662, 664 (5th Cir.1989) (affirming dismissal of premature due-process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We decline to consider Abdallah\u2019s \u201cRecord Excerpt\u201d about a Palestinian stowaway because that evidence was outside the administrative record. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>19 F.3d 1090, 1096 n. 7 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b45-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under tire limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
