(\u201cCrane\u201d), the manufacturer of a hot chocolate vending machine, and Compass Group U.S.A., Inc., doing business as Imperial Vending Group (\u201cImperial\u201d), the owner of the machine. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>See Buono v. Norton, </em>371 F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir.2004). We must determine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Valencia, whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law. <em>See Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir.2004). Here, the relevant substantive law is the Washington Products Liability Act (WPLA), Revised Code of Washington \u00a7\u00a7 7.72.010-.070. <em>See Snead v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>237 F.3d 1080, 1090 (9th Cir.2001) (noting that federal courts apply state substantive law in diversity actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The WPLA requires a plaintiff to prove that (1) a product was not \u201creasonably safe\u201d because of design or because of inadequate warnings, (2) the defendant manufactored the product, (3) the plaintiff was injured, and (4) the defective design or inadequate warnings proximately caused the injury. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 7.72.030. In Washington, a plaintiff can prove that a product is not \u201creasonably safe\u201d under either a \u201crisk-utility\u201d test or a \u201cconsumer expectations\u201d test. <em>See Soproni v. Polygon Apartment Partners, </em>137 Wash.2d 319, 971 P.2d 500, 508 (1999) (en banc) (Talmadge, J., concurring and dissenting) (lamenting that \u201cin <em>[Falk v. Keene Corp., </em>113 Wash.2d 645, 782 P.2d 974 (1989) ] we held the consumer expectations test was a separate means of demonstrating a design defect was present in a product\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">Valencia argues that the hot chocolate machine was defectively designed because (1) the shelf on which the hot chocolate dispensed was too low, and (2) the machine dispensed the hot chocolate at an excessively hot temperature. She also argues that the hot chocolate machine was defective because Crane and Imperial failed to provide adequate warnings, and that Crane and Imperial were negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">We conclude that the district court correctly held that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to design defect under either the risk-utility test or the consumer expectations test. Valencia did not provide evidence that an alternative design would prevent similar accidents or that lowering the temperature of the hot chocolate would eliminate the risk of injury. Nor did Valencia provide evidence that consumers expect hot chocolate to be served at a significantly lower temperature. Although she argues that we should apply a different standard where children are involved, the machine\u2019s coin slot and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>other features assure that a toddler cannot activate the machine without assistance from a taller (and likely much older) person\u2019s assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Valencia\u2019s inadequate warnings claim fails because she did not show that the lack of warnings was a proximate cause of the injury. <em>See Ayers v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Prods. Co., </em>117 Wash.2d 747, 818 P.2d 1337, 1340 (1992) (en banc). \u201c[T]he lack of warnings did not contribute to the accident in any way.\u201d <em>Soproni </em>971 P.2d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Valencia\u2019s claim that the district court somehow improperly \u201cignored\u201d her expert\u2019s affidavits fails because the district court denied the appellee\u2019s motion to strike the affidavits and explicitly stated that it would consider the affidavits in deciding summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Finally, the district court properly dismissed on summary judgment Valencia\u2019s negligence claim. <em>See Thongchoom v. Graco Children\u2019s Prods., Inc., </em>117 Wash. App. 299, 71 P.3d 214, 217 n. 1 (2003) (\u201c[Strict liability] is the only type of claim a plaintiff has against a manufacturer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Appellee\u2019s motion to amend its removal petition is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-13\">.
