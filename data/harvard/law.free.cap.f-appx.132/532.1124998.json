This panel, proceeding <em>sua sponte, </em>has now reheard the captioned appeal and concludes that, in light of the previous issuance by the district court of an amended judgment that conformed to the agreed position of the government and the appellant, our original opinion was incorrect in ruling that the district court had lacked jurisdiction to enter its amended judgment. We are satisfied that our judgment vacating the district court\u2019s amended judgment and remanding for entry of the appropriate judgment was improvidently issued. Therefore, in the interest of judicial economy, our opinion, judgment, and mandate should be and hereby are recalled, and this appeal is dismissed as moot. In consequence, the amended judgment of the district court sentencing de Paz under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) only, for which the maximum imprisonment was 2 years, stands as the final judgment of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">OPINION, JUDGMENT, AND MANDATE WITHDRAWN; APPEAL DISMISSED AS MOOT; AMENDED JUDGMENT OF DISTRICT COURT AND SENTENCE IMPOSED THEREIN REINSTATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
