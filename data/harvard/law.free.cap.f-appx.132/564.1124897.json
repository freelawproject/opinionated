Cardenas argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court plainly erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it sentenced him under a mandatory guideline sentencing scheme. The argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>United. States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517 (U.S. Mar. 31, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In light of <em>Booker, </em>the district court clearly erred in computing Cardenas\u2019s sentence under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. ValenzuelaQuevedo, </em>No. 03-41754, 407 F.3d 728, 733, 2005 WL 941353, *4 (5th Cir. Apr.25, 2005). Nevertheless, because Cardenas has not demonstrated that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had it known that the sentencing guidelines were advisory only, he has failed to demonstrate that the error affected his substantial rights.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 521-22. Accordingly, Cardenas has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Cardenas concedes that the issue whether 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) &amp; (b)(2) were rendered unconstitutional by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and subsequent Supreme Court precedent is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and he raises it solely to preserve it for further review by the Supreme Court. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). We therefore must follow <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under . the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b597-10\"> Cardenas's argument that <em>Mares </em>was wrongly decided is unavailing. Absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision of the Supreme Court, one panel may not overrule the decision of a prior panel. <em>United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
