The timeliness of a motion for a new trial is a jurisdictional question, and we review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court had jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s claims. <em>United States v. Correa, </em>362 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2004). After thorough review of the record, as well as careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-22\">The procedural facts relevant to our jurisdictional analysis are straightforward. Angulo was convicted of conspiracy to import cocaine on April 19, 1999 and filed his Rule 33 motion on April 17, 2002. On July 29, 2002, Angulo filed a motion to supplement his Rule 33 motion, seeking to present newly discovered evidence. In his motion to supplement, Angulo argued that the newly discovered evidence should be allowed because it related back to the original Rule 33 motion. The district court disagreed, finding that because the Rule 33 motion was not based on newly discovered evidence, Angulo could not present such evidence by moving to supplement the original motion, over three months after the 3-year time period for filing a Rule 33 motion had expired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure state that any motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence must be filed within three years after the verdict or finding of guilt. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1). The date of the verdict \u2014 in Angulo\u2019s case, April 19, 1999 \u2014 is the triggering date for the 3-year period. <em>Correa, </em>362 F.3d at 1308. In a procedural stance analogous to the one facing the district court here, we considered whether, after denying the defendant\u2019s original motion for a new trial, the district court had the power to construe a motion for reconsideration, filed after the Rule 33 time period ended, as a \u201crenewed motion for a new trial that somehow related back to his timely filing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bramlett, </em>116 F.3d 1403, 1405-1406 (11th Cir.1997). We ruled that motions filed outside the Rule 33 time period are untimely, and that the district court lacks jurisdiction to enter an order enlarging the time period in which the defendant can file such a motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1406.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In addition to the analogous case of <em>Bramlett, </em>we note that the Tenth Circuit has rejected Angulo\u2019s very argument, that an untimely motion to supplement a timely Rule 33 motion should be permitted where the motion to supplement \u201crelates back\u201d to the original motion. <em>See United States v. Custodio, </em>141 F.3d 965 (10th Cir.1998). In <em>Custodio, </em>the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s supplement as untimely, stating that \u201ca defendant may not add new arguments in support of a motion for new trial by including them in an amendment filed after the time under Rule 33 has expired.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Here, the 3-year time period for filing Rule 33 motions based on newly discovered evidence expired on April 19, 2002, which was before Angulo filed his motion to supplement. Based on the plain language of Rule 33, our decision in <em>Bramlett, </em>and the persuasive authority of <em>Custodio, </em>we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Angulo\u2019s motion to supplement was untimely and it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion\u2019s merits. Accordingly, we affirm its decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-16\">. Angulo does not assert on appeal that the district court erred in denying his original motion for a new trial. Accordingly, he abandoned this issue. <em>United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 830-831 (11th Cir.2000) (issues not raised on appeal are deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\">. In light of our disposition, we are unpersuaded by Angulo\u2019s due diligence argument. Moreover, we deny Angulo leave to file an \"informative supplemental Motion to his pending Rule 33 Motion.\u201d Any such motion would be untimely because it would be filed after expiration of the time period for filing Rule 33 motions. Thus, such a motion is not necessary, \"in the interest of justice,\u201d as Angulo argues. <em>United States v. Renick, </em>273 F.3d 1009, 1019 (11th Cir.2001) (\"a district court is without jurisdiction to grant a new trial using the 'in the interest of justice' standard unless the motion is [timely] filed ...\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
