Rev.Code \u00a7 49.60. The district court entered summary judgment after determining that LeBourgeois\u2019s claims were contractually time-barred by the six-month limitation on actions provided in Rebecca Irene Fisheries\u2019s (\u201cRIF\u201d) Crew Member Employment Contract (\u201cAgreement\u201d), which LeBourgeois signed. The district court also dismissed LeBourgeois\u2019s state law claim based on the Agreement\u2019s provision that \u201call disputes of whatever nature arising out of [the] employment relationship\u201d would be governed by federal maritime law \u201cand shall not be enlarged, supplemented or modified by the laws of any state or local jurisdiction.\u201d We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>see Manatt v. Bank of America, </em>339 F.3d 792, 796 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-19\">As a seaman, LeBourgeois enjoys special protection under maritime law. <em>Orsini v. O/S SEABROOKE O.N., </em>247 F.3d 953, 964 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cIn admiralty, law imposes a restraint on what normally on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>land might be viewed as hard bargaining^ between employer and employee.\u201d). RIF thus has the burden to demonstrate that LeBourgeois\u2019s waiver of rights \u201c \u2018was executed freely, without deception or coercion, [ ] that it was made by the seaman with full understanding of his rights\u2019 and that it is fair to the seaman.\u201d <em>Fuller v. Golden Age Fisheries, </em>14 F.3d 1405, 1408 (9th Cir.1994) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., </em>317 U.S. 239, 248, 63 S.Ct. 246, 87 L.Ed. 239 (1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">RIF has not met its burden. Under the plain language of the contract, <em>see Flores v. American Seafoods Co., </em>335 F.3d 904, 910 (9th Cir.2003), the six-month limitation clause applies to a narrower category of disputes (\u201cany legal action arising in connection with <em>this agreement\u201d) </em>than the preceding choice-of-law clause (\u201call disputes of whatever nature arising out of this employment relationship\u201d) and venue clause (\u201cany legal action between [RIF and Crew Member]\u201d). LeBourgeois stated in his sworn declaration that he did not knowingly or voluntarily waive his rights; this statement is sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact such that summary judgment is inappropriate. <em>See Arrow Electronics Inc. v. Justus (In re Kaypro), </em>218 F.3d 1070, 1075 (9th Cir.2000). Furthermore, although \u201cthe nature of the ... legal advice available to the seaman at the time of signing the release [is] relevant to an appraisal of [ ]his understanding,\u201d <em>Garrett, </em>317 U.S. at 248, RIF has presented no evidence that the meaning it urges this court to apply was explained to LeBourgeois before signing.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">LeBourgeois\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim arises from his employment relationship with RIF, not in connection with any provision in the written Agreement. <em>See Manat\u00ed, </em>339 F.3d at 797 (noting that \u00a7 1981 protects against \u201cemployment discrimination occurring during the course of the employment\u201d even where no written employment contract exists). Unlike in <em>Simula v. Autoliv, </em>175 F.3d 716, 722 (9th Cir.1999), which did not apply the special protections afforded under maritime law, RIF\u2019s compliance with the Agreement is irrelevant to LeBourgeois\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim. Because this written contract merely specifies his employment duties, rules of conduct,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and compensation terms, LeBourgeois\u2019s \u00a7 1981 race discrimination claim does not bear \u201ca significant relationship to the contract.\u201d <em>C.f id. </em>at 720 (\u201cIf Autoliv had fully complied with the contract, ... there would be no tort claims.\u201d). Even under <em>Simula\u2019s </em>liberal construction of a similar contract\u2014 a standard inapplicable outside the arbitration context \u2014 LeBourgeois\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim does not \u201carise in connection with\u201d the Agreement. <em>Mediterranean Ent. v. Ssangyong Corp., </em>708 F.2d 1458, 1464 (9th Cir.1983) (concluding that an arbitration clause in an contract encompassing claims \u201carising hereunder\u201d did not include alleged violations which \u201ccould have been accomplished even if the Agreement did not exist.\u201d). Because the six-month contractual limitation on actions therefore does not apply, we reverse the district court\u2019s dismissal of LeBourgeois\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">We affirm, however, the district court\u2019s summary judgment as to LeBourgeois\u2019s state law claim under Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 49.60. The Agreement\u2019s choice-of-law clause applies to \u201call disputes of whatever nature arising out of this employment relationship,\u201d and therefore encompasses this claim. Here, the \u201cUnited States has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>genuine and significant interest in the matters affected by the contract____\u201d <em>Flores, </em>335 F.3d at 917, 918 (citing Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws \u00a7 187). Federal maritime law is not contrary to a fundamental policy of Washington law; LeBourgeois remains protected by federal anti-discrimination statutes such as \u00a7 1981. Nor is Washington\u2019s interest \u201cmaterially greater.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917. \u201cTo the contrary, the federal interest in a maritime contract governing seamen\u2019s wages is manifest, salient, and must be weighed on the issue of choice of law in this admiralty case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>LeBourgeois\u2019s claims are based on conduct that occurred at sea, and Le-Bourgeois himself is a resident of Louisiana, not Washington. Federal maritime law therefore applies to the exclusion of state law, as specified in the Agreement, and we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment of LeBourgeois\u2019s claim under Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 49.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED. Each side shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b190-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-20\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we reference them here only as they are necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">. By signing the Agreement, LeBourgeois \"agree[d] to follow the rules outlined\u201d in the Crew Member Handbook, which provides RIF's harassment policy. RIF, however is not bound by any reciprocal obligation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b192-6\">WALLACE, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Even if the majority were right (which I doubt) that, in contrast to those sentences in the Agreement which refer to the \u201cagreement\u201d <em>and </em>to the \u201cemployment relationship,\u201d the six-month limitation provision is narrower and refers only to the former term, I would still conclude that the six-month limitation provision applies to LeBourgeois\u2019 section 1981 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Section 1981 protects the right to make and enforce contracts, which includes \u201cthe making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(b). In contrast to other statutory rights, such as those created by Title VII or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a section 1981 claim is premised on discriminatory interference with a contractual relationship. <em>See, e.g., Perry v. Woodward, </em>199 F.3d 1126, 1132 (10th Cir.1999) (\u201cEven as amended, section 1981 continues to center on the protection of contractual rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">The majority reasons that because a contractual relationship need not be reduced to writing, LeBourgeois\u2019 section 1981 is not necessarily premised on \u2014 and is instead independent from \u2014 the Agreement. <em>See Ante </em>at- (\u201cLeBourgeois\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim arises from his employment relationship with RIF, not in connection with any provision in the written Agreement.\u201d). Yet, the parties\u2019 contractual relationship was governed by the Agreement, which included a merger clause. As a result, LeBourgeois\u2019 section 1981 claim was tied to the contractual relationship established by the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Furthermore, we have recognized that the phrase \u201carising in connection with\u201d is considerably broader in scope than \u201carising hereunder\u201d or \u201carising out of.\u201d <em>Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., </em>175 F.3d 716, 720 &amp; n. 3 (9th Cir.1999). If the six-month limitation provision used either of the latter two phrases, it would arguably have encompassed only breach of contract claims or claims based on contractual rights. Instead, the provision applies to all legal actions \u201carising in connection with\u201d the Agreement, and this is broad enough to encompass a claim tied to the contractual relationship established by the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">Because I conclude that the six-month limitation provision applies to a section 1981 claim, I would also hold that RIF has satisfied its burden of showing LeBourgeois\u2019 waiver of a longer filing period \u201c \u2018was executed freely, without deception or coercion, [ ] that it was made by [him] with full understanding of his rights\u2019 and that it is fair to [him].\u201d <em>Fuller v. Golden </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number><em>Age Fisheries, </em>14 F.3d 1405, 1408 (9th Cir.1994) (alteration in original), <em>quoting Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., </em>317 U.S. 239, 248, 63 S.Ct. 246, 87 L.Ed. 239 (1942). LeBourgeois \u201chad sufficient education and experience to read and understand the contract[ ][he] signed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the limiting provision was in conspicuous boldface type, LeBourgeois initialed or signed each page of the Agreement, and he signed the same Agreement six times over the course of approximately a year and a half.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Alternatively, the amicus challenges the validity of LeBourgeois\u2019 waiver by arguing it was not \u201cclear and unmistakable,\u201d as required by <em>Wright v. Universal Mar. Serv. Corp., </em>525 U.S. 70, 80, 119 S.Ct. 391, 142 L.Ed.2d 361 (1998). Yet, the Court in <em>Wright </em>suggested this heightened standard does not apply to \u201can individual\u2019s waiver of his own rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80-81; <em>see also Interstate Brands Corp. v. Bakery Drivers &amp; Bakery Goods Vending Machs., </em>167 F.3d 764, 767 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Thus, I conclude that the six-month limitation clearly applies to LeBourgeois\u2019 section 1981 claim and was validly agreed to by LeBourgeois. The issue remains, however, whether an employer and an employee may contractually shorten the limitations period for such a claim, and whether the six-month period in this case was reasonable. <em>See Order of United Commercial Travelers of Am. v. Wolfe, </em>331 U.S. 586, 608, 67 S.Ct. 1355, 91 L.Ed. 1687 (1947). Pursuant to the choice-of-law provision in the Agreement, I would decide this issue as a matter of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">In several cases, courts have upheld similar contractual provisions limiting the time to file civil rights claims. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v. Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. Co., </em>966 F.2d 1188 (7th Cir.1992) (six-month period to file section 1981 claim); <em>Myers v. Western-Southern Life Ins. Co., </em>849 F.2d 259 (6th Cir.1988) (six-month period to file claim of constructive discharge based on Michigan\u2019s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act and Michigan Handicappers\u2019 Civil Rights Act); <em>Soltani v. Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. Co., </em>258 F.3d 1038, 1042-45 (9th Cir.2001) (six-month period to file claims of wrongful termination and unfair business practices based on California law). In addition, Congress has established a six-month limitations period for filing Title VII discrimination charges with the EEOC, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l), and for seamen to file in rem actions for unpaid wages. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 10602(a). While these precedents and statutory provisions are not necessarily controlling, they provide solid grounds on which to uphold the six-month limitation provision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s reversal of the district court\u2019s summary judgment on LeBourgeois\u2019 section 1981 claim. I concur, however, in the majority\u2019s memorandum disposition insofar as it affirms summary judgment for RIF on LeBourgeois\u2019 state law claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
