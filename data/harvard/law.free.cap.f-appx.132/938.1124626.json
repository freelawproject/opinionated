Li argues that the IJ\u2019s opinion is not supported by substantial evidence and that the IJ\u2019s review of his CAT claim was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-17\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. \u201cUnder this standard, a finding will stand if it is supported by \u2018reasonable, substantial, and probative\u2019 evidence in the record when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-18\">Li claims that, because of statements he made concerning China-Taiwan relations, he was dismissed from his job as a driver for the Chinese government and required to report for \u201creeducation.\u201d But Li provides few additional details that would support his claim that the act he allegedly fears would constitute persecution. Indeed, case law suggests that the vague act of re-education as Li described it in his testimony would not, by itself, rise to the level of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Nelson v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000); <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1243 (3d Cir.1993). Furthermore, Li\u2019s professed fear of persecution does not appeal* to be objectively reasonable. As the IJ noted, Li remained in China for two months after making his allegedly controversial statements, and his father was subjected to a mere three telephone calls asking Li to report for reeducation. Li testified that those calls occurred in the week after he was dismissed and that neither he nor his father received <em>any </em>calls after that. We conclude that substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Li\u2019s alleged fear of persecution is not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Li also claims that he will be persecuted because he will be imprisoned for fleeing China illegally. However, \u201c[pjunishment for violation of a generally applicable criminal law is not persecution.\u201d <em>Saleh v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1992). Finally, Li argues that the IJ erred in examining his CAT claim. Li argues that in light of <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169 (2d Cir.2004), the IJ\u2019s review was deficient because the IJ did not conduct a separate CAT analysis and did not examine country conditions or other evidence Li had provided. In <em>Ramsameachire </em>we emphasized that \u201c[bjecause the CAT inquiry is independent of the asylum analysis ... the BIA\u2019s decision with respect to an alien\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal pursuant to the INA should never, in itself, be determinative of the alien\u2019s CAT claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184-85. We stated that in judging a GAT claim, the BIA is required to consider <em>\u201call </em>evidence of possible torture proffered by the alien, regardless of the weight it accords the alien\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 184 (emphasis in original). Contrary to Li\u2019s contentions, however, the IJ in this case expressly considered various reports and other evidence included in the record before concluding that Li had not established that he would more likely than not be tortured should he be returned to China. We conclude that the IJ\u2019s review of Li\u2019s CAT claim was sufficient to establish that Li does not have a valid CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
