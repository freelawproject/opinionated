At the sentencing hearing, Mullins objected to the district court\u2019s consideration of certain relevant conduct <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and his criminal history in determining his sentence, arguing that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applied to the federal sentencing guidelines. The district court overruled his objections, relying on <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). Mullins appeals his sentence, alleging that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014- U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment and that the district court erred in applying the guidelines as mandatory. He argues that his sentence should be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing in accord with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-16\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, violated the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 746, 750 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2004) (requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable guideline range), and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2004) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756-57 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). The government states in its appellate brief that it does not oppose Mullins\u2019 request for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-17\">We therefore vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-18\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b518-13\"> Mullins objected to the recommendation in the presentence report that he was responsible for ninety grams of methamphetamine and that his conduct created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
