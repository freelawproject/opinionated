(\u201cIBP\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order confirming the arbitrator\u2019s award in part and vacating it in part, and the district court\u2019s subsequent refusal to reconsider its decision after the arbitrator amended his initial determination in favor of Local 556 International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America (\u201cUnion\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">I. The Arbitrator\u2019s Determination that IBP Violated the Collective Bargaining Agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">Judicial \u201creview of an arbitrator\u2019s decision is <em>extremely </em>narrow\u201d; an arbitrator\u2019s resolution need only be \u201crationally derived from some plausible theory of the general framework or intent of the agreement.\u201d <em>Van Waters &amp; Rogers, Inc. v. International Bhd. Of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of Am., </em>56 F.3d 1132, 1135 (9th Cir.1995) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-17\">It is plausible that the arbitrator construed the CBA provision \u201callowing\u201d a 30-minute meal period as \u201callotting\u201d or \u201cproviding\u201d the employees with a 30-min-ute respite. Such a reading is consistent with the other provisions of the agreement. <em>See id. </em>at 1136 (arbitrator\u2019s determination upheld where provision in question \u201cmay be read consistently with the arbitral award\u201d). Moreover, the arbitrator could have reasonably concluded that because IBP\u2019s authority to set work hours was limited to instances where the hours were directly connected to production, IBP was powerless to unilaterally change the timing of the lunch period during which no production occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>II. The Arbitrator\u2019s Award and Clarification</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The <em>functus officio </em>doctrine does not prohibit an arbitrator from \u201ccorrecting] a mistake which is apparent on the face of his award, complete an arbitration if the award is not complete, and clarify an ambiguity in the award.\u201d <em>International Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffers, Warehousemen and Helpers of Am., AFL-CIO, Local 631 v. Silver State Disp. Serv., Inc., </em>109 F.3d 1409, 1412 (9th Cir.1997) (citing <em>McClatchy Newspapers v. Central Valley Typographical Union No. 46, Int\u2019l Typographical Union, </em>686 F.2d 731, 734 n. 1 (9th Cir.1982)). A fair reading of the district court\u2019s order vacating in part and confirming in part the arbitrator\u2019s award suggests that the arbitrator had leave to clarify whether the back-pay-with-interest award was a remedy for the CBA violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We reject IBP\u2019s argument that the Award and Clarification did not draw from the essence of the CBA. If the arbitrator concluded that the primary effect of the extension kept employees at work for extra time, regardless of whether that time was spent on break or working, then it is plausible that the arbitrator saw fit to pay employees for that time. <em>Van Waters, </em>56 F.3d at 1135 (courts grant broad deference to the judgments of arbitrators as long as they are \u201crationally derived from some plausible theory of the general framework or intent of the agreement\u201d) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Moreover, that the arbitrator relied on \u201ctraditional\u201d NLRB remedies does not suggest that his remedy disregarded the essence of the agreement. Arbitrators are free to look to the law for guidance in fashioning remedies. <em>Id. </em>at 1137. Simple reference to outside law does not affirmatively demonstrate that the arbitrator fashioned his own brand of industrial justice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Finally, IBP argues that the Award and Clarification should be vacated because the Union allegedly had improper ex-parte communications with the arbitrator, precluding IBP from an opportunity to present its position to the arbitrator. The Union\u2019s allegedly ex-parte communications with the arbitrator were not objectionable because the Union only requested that the arbitrator clarify his award. <em>Silver State Disp. Serv., </em>109 F.3d at 1412 (arbitrator may clarify an award without a joint request of the parties).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">III. Attorneys\u2019 Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">There is nothing in the CBA that provides for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the event of a breach by either party. Instead, the agreement specifically provides that \u201c[t]he arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses ... shall be borne equally by the employer and the Union. All other costs and expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">Moreover, although attorneys\u2019 fees may be assessed if a losing party acted in bad faith, IBP did not act in bad faith as evidenced by its <em>successful </em>challenge in the district court to the arbitrator\u2019s conclusions that IBP had violated \u00a7 8(a)(5) of the NLRA. <em>See Phoenix Newspapers, Inc. v. Phoenix Mailers Union Local 752, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>989 F.2d 1077, 1084 (9th Cir.1993) (party did not \u201cunjustifiably refuse[ ] to comply with the award\u201d where \u201c[n]ot only did [the party] have a good faith objection to the arbitrator\u2019s remedy, it correctly believed that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Similarly, we refuse to award fees under Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 38 because IBP did not act in bad faith. IBP\u2019s attempts to vacate the award and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>this ensuing appeal, although ultimately unconvincing, were not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b768-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
