The court sentenced Davis to 210 months imprisonment. He has timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">At Davis\u2019 sentencing, the district court found, by a preponderance of the evidence \u2014 and over Davis\u2019 objection \u2014 that he was responsible for 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine and adopted the presentence report\u2019s recommendation that Davis\u2019 sentence be enhanced by two levels for possession of a firearm. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2000). Davis objected to both sentencing enhancements based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the precursor to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">On appeal, Davis contends that his sentence violates the rules announced in both <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker, </em>which were decided while his direct appeal was pending. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the federal sentencing guidelines scheme, under which courts were required to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence, violated the Sixth Amendment because of its mandatory nature. <em>Id. </em>at 746, 750 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by making the guidelines advisory through the removal of two statutory provisions that had rendered them mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 746, 756-57 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">In light of <em>Booker, </em>we find that the district court erred in sentencing Davis. We of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time of Davis\u2019 sentencing. Accordingly, although we affirm Davis\u2019 conviction, we vacate his sentence and remand for proceedings consistent with <em>Booker. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
