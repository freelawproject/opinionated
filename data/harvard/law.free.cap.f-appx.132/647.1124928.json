Seifert, </em>172 F.3d 54 (7th Cir.1998) (unpublished order), Herschel Seifert filed in his closed criminal case what he titled a \u201cMotion to Compel Compliance with and Performance of Plea Agreement or Withdraw Pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d) and Amendment to Rule 11(e).\u201d He contended that the government breached his plea agreement at sentencing by making statements that caused the district court to deny him points for accepting responsibility in calculating his offense level under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The district court construed Seifert\u2019s motion as one pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, opened a new civil action, and ordered the government to show cause why it should not be granted. Among other responses, the government pointed out that Seifert had missed the one-year deadline for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion. Seifert filed a motion requesting the court not to construe his filing as a \u00a7 2255 motion but instead to grant it based on its \u201cinherent authority\u201d and \u201cpursuant either to the Federal Rules or to its common law authority.\u201d The district court concluded that it lacked the inherent authority to modify a previously imposed sentence. It denied the motion for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the civil action that it had opened without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The district court was correct that it lacked the \u201cinherent authority\u201d to modify Seifert\u2019s term of imprisonment after it was imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) (\u201cThe court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except that ... the court may modify an imposed term of imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d); <em>Romandine v. United States, </em>206 F.3d 731, 735 (7th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Barragan-Mendoza, </em>174 F.3d 1024, 1028 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540-41 (10th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Bridges, </em>116 F.3d 1110, 1112 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Seifert claims on appeal that he is not seeking a modification of his sentence, but rather enforcement of his plea agreement. A motion under \u00a7 2255 is the proper vehicle to seek specific performance of a plea agreement or withdrawal of a plea on the ground that the conviction or sentence was in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 1\u00cd1; <em>United States v. Evans, </em>224 F.3d 670, 673-74 (7th Cir.2000); <em>see also Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262-63, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971) (\u201cthe interests of justice\u201d demand the enforcement of promises when a plea rests upon them); <em>Bischel v. United States, </em>32 F.3d 259, 264 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that \u00a7 2255 is the proper vehicle to claim that the government breached a plea agreement); <em>Carnine v. United States, </em>974 F.2d 924, 927, 932 (7th Cir.1992) (same). Seifert did not want to pursue that route, so the district court was correct to deny his motion for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Romandine, </em>206 F.3d at 736 (district court should not convert prisoner\u2019s filing from one type of action to another).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
