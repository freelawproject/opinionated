We have jurisdiction pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Murti failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of an enumerated ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Murti, a Hindu Congress-party member, failed to demonstrate that on the single occasion he was arrested, detained and beaten, the Punjab police acted on account of Murti\u2019s actual or imputed political opinion. <em>See Dinu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 1041, 1044-45 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that legitimate criminal investigation is not persecution on account of an applicant\u2019s political opinion). Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Murti did not show a well-founded fear of future persecution because he could successfully relocate within India. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998-99 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Because Murti failed to establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Lata, </em>204 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">Murti is ineligible for CAT relief because he has not shown that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured if returned to India. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>see also Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004), petitioner\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
