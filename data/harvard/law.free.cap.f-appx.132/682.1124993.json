We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition on timeliness grounds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number><em>Guillory v. Roe, </em>329 F.3d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), imposes a one-year statute of limitations for the filing of federal habeas corpus petitions. Because Pitts\u2019 conviction became final before the AEDPA was enacted, the statute of limitations began to run on April 25,1996, and expired on April 24, 1997. <em>Malcom v. Payne, </em>281 F.3d 951, 955 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2001). Pitts filed his first federal habeas petition on December 20, 2000, more than three and one-half years after the statute of limitations had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">AEDPA provides for \u201cstatutory tolling\u201d of its one-year statute of limitations while a \u201cproperly filed\u201d petition for state post-conviction collateral review is \u201cpending.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Pitts argues that he is entitled to statutory tolling between the California Court of Appeal\u2019s denial of his first state habeas petition on June 13, 1996, and the California Supreme Court\u2019s denial of his second state habeas petition on September 27, 2000, on the theory that both applications were part of the same \u201cround\u201d of collateral review. <em>See Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 222, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002). We conclude that because the California Court of Appeal denied Pitts\u2019 petition in part based on his \u201cunexplained delay,\u201d citing <em>In re Clark, 5 </em>Cal.4th 750, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 855 P.2d 729, 750-51 (1993) (stating that \u201ca petitioner must explain and justify any substantial delay in presenting a claim\u201d), and because the California Supreme Court denied his petition \u201con the merits and for lack of diligence,\u201d the state courts determined that the filing of Pitts\u2019 second petition was untimely. <em>See La Crosse v. Kernan, </em>244 F.3d 702, 705 (9th Cir.2001) (finding that state court\u2019s denial of petition \u201con the merits and for lack of diligence\u201d was based on untimeliness because the petition was filed 12 years after his conviction); <em>Nino v. Galaza, </em>183 F.3d 1003, 1007, n. 4 (9th Cir.1999) (suggesting that a California state court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition with citation to <em>Clark </em>is for untimeliness); <em>see also Gaston v. Palmer, </em>387 F.3d 1004, 1016 (9th Cir.2004) (same); <em>Thompson v. Calderon, </em>122 F.3d 28, 29 (9th Cir.), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds by </em>120 F.3d 1045 (9th Cir.1997), <em>and rev\u2019d by </em>523 U.S. 538, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998) (same). Because the California courts dismissed the petition as untimely, it was not \u201cpending\u201d during the three and one half year interval. <em>See Carey, </em>536 U.S. at 226, 122 S.Ct. 2134.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Furthermore, given our conclusion that the state courts dismissed the petition as untimely, the petition was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>See Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005) (holding that a state post-conviction petition rejected by the state court as untimely is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and is therefore not subject to statutory tolling under \u00a7 2244(d)(2)). Because the petition was neither \u201cpending\u201d nor \u201cproperly filed,\u201d Pitts is not entitled to statutory tolling between June 13, 1996 and September 27, 2000. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">Pitts is only entitled to statutory tolling between the filing of his first state habeas petition on May 18, 1996, and the Court of Appeal\u2019s denial of that petition on June 13, 1996. This extended his deadline to May 16, 1997. Because Pitts\u2019 federal habeas petition was filed on December 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>2000, the district court properly dismissed it as untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b715-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-6\"><em>. </em>Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-17\">. We decline to address Pitts\u2019 equitable tolling argument, because it was not raised below, <em>see Jiminez v. Rice, </em>276 F.3d 478, 481 (9th Cir.2001), it was not embraced within the Certificate of Appealability, <em>see Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1102-1103 (9th Cir.1999), and there is insufficient evidence in the record on which to determine whether extraordinary circumstances beyond Pitts\u2019 control prevented him from filing on time, <em>see Spitsyn v. Moore, </em>345 F.3d 796, 800 (9th Cir.2003); <em>cf Calderon v. United States District Court (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (9th Cir.1997); <em>overruled on other grounds by Calderon v. United States District Court (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530, 540 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Woodford v. Garceau, </em>538 U.S. 202, 123 S.Ct. 1398, 155 L.Ed.2d 363 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
