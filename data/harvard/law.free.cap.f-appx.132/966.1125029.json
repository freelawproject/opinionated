At sentencing on June 13, 2003, the District Court determined that Leonor\u2019s guideline range was 51 to 63 months of incarceration, which was compressed to 60 to 63 months as a result of the mandatory statutory minimum of five years given the nature of the offense. Although Leonor\u2019s counsel raised the possibility of moving for a \u201csafety valve\u201d downward adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(l)-(5), a recent ruling by this Court foreclosed that possibility. <em>See United States v. Boddie, </em>318 F.3d 491, 494 (3d Cir. Jan.28, 2003). The District Court sentenced Leonor to 60 months imprisonment and a four-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">After filing a timely notice of appeal, Leonor\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court held that the \u201cconstitutional requirement of substantial equality and fair process\u201d necessitates that appellant\u2019s counsel vigorously act as an advocate for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Thus, counsel\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A11\">role as advocate requires that he support his client\u2019s appeal to the best of his ability. Of course, if counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw. That request must, however, be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-6\"><em>Id. </em>In <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001), we reiterated that an <em>Anders </em>brief must demonstrate that counsel has \u201cthoroughly examined the record in search of appealable issues,\u201d and it must \u201cexplain why the issues are frivolous.\u201d Thus, our inquiry is twofold: (1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the requirements of Anders; and (2) \u201cwhether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Marvin, </em>211 F.3d 778, 780 (3d Cir.2000)); <em>see also Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396 (explaining that the court must proceed, \u201cafter a full examination of all the proceedings, to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous\u201d). If review fails to reveal any non-frivolous issues, the Court \u201cmay grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">We conclude that counsel fulfilled the requirements of <em>Anders </em>with respect to Leonor\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counsel asserted that there were no deficiencies with regard to Leonor\u2019s guilty plea colloquy. Our review of the appended plea agreement and colloquy verifies that Leonor\u2019s plea complied with both the requirements of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 and <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">Our own independent review of the record reveals, however, that Leonor\u2019s sentence was imposed before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). At first blush, this suggests that there may be a possibility that Leonor might benefit if he were re-sentenced under an advisory sentencing scheme. Leonor, however, was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of sixty months, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), and a remand for resentencing cannot result in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>lighter sentence. Accordingly, there is no basis for vacating Leonor\u2019s sentence. Indeed, Leonor may have anticipated as much as he did not respond to this Court\u2019s inquiry regarding the applicability of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Accordingly, we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and we will affirm Leonor\u2019s conviction and sentence. We certify that the issues presented in the appeal lack legal merit and thus do not require the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court.3d Cir. LAR 109.2(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-7\">. Counsel advised Leonor of his right to file an informal brief pursuant to 3d Cir. L.A.R. 109.2(a), but Leonor chose not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b999-13\">. The District Court had jurisdiction over this federal criminal offense pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.
