Zabrinas seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from a \u201cfinal order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court,\u201d unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Because Zabrinas has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2), this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-22\">Zabrinas was convicted in Kansas state court of aggravated indecent solicitation of a child in violation of Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 25-3511; he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of sixty months. After exhausting his state court remedies, Zabrinas brought the instant \u00a7 2254 petition raising the following claims: (1) because the crime charged could be committed in more than one way, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree on the act underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the conviction; (2) the trial court erred in refusing to give a lesser included offense instruction; (3) his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence; (4) the trial court\u2019s upward departure from the presumptive sentencing range violated the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); and (5) his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance in failing to object to certain statements made by the prosecutor during closing arguments. In concluding Zabrinas was not entitled to habeas relief, the district court reasoned as follows: (1) the state court\u2019s determination that no unanimity instruction was necessary because each alternative means of committing the crime was supported by substantial evidence is consistent with <em>Schad v. Arizona, </em>501 U.S. 624, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555 (1991); (2) failure to give a lesser included offense instruction in a non-capital case, whether or not warranted, is not grounds for federal habeas relief, <em>Spears v. Mullin, </em>343 F.3d 1215, 1236 (10th Cir.2003); (3) the state court\u2019s determination that Zabrinas\u2019 conviction was sufficiently supported by the testimony of the officer recounting the statements the young victim made contemporaneously with the crime was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); (4) <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>are not retroactively applicable on federal habeas review;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (5) trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue of prosecutorial misconduct with regard to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument because the prosecutor\u2019s statements were permissible comments on the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">To be entitled to a COA, Zabrinas must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Zabrinas has satisfied his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Zabrinas need not demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Having undertaken a review of Zabrinas\u2019 application for a COA and appellate filings, the district court\u2019s order, and the entire record before this court pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Court in <em>Miller-El, </em>this court concludes that Zabrinas is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Zabrinas\u2019 \u00a7 2254 petition is not reasonably subject to debate and the issues he seeks to raise on appeal are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, this court DENIES Zabrinas\u2019 request for a COA and DISMISSES this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-5\">. We note that in concluding that <em>Blakely </em>is not retroactively applicable on federal habeas review, the district court relied on <em>Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001); <em>Leonard v. United States, </em>383 F.3d 1146 (10th Cir.2004); and <em>Browning v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 1262 (10th Cir.2001) (en banc). Each of these cases, however, deals with the standards this court employs in analyzing whether to grant an applicant permission to file a <em>second or successive </em>habeas petition or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. They do not deal with the question whether <em>Blakely </em>is retroactively applicable to a <em>first </em>habeas petition, such as that in this case. In any event, this court has specifically applied the retroactivity analysis set out in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) and concluded that <em>Blakely </em>is not retroactively applicable to a first habeas petition. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>400 F.3d 844 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
