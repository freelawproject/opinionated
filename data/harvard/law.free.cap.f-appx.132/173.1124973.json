We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">In this record, the judicial documents pertaining to Rivera\u2019s predicate conviction contain little more than the fact of conviction. Nothing in the record suggests that what occurred between Rivera and his \u201cvictim\u201d \u2014 who is now his common-law wife and with whom he has two children \u2014 constituted \u201cabuse\u201d as we have understood that term. Under such circumstances, we are \u201ccompelled to hold that the government has not met its burden of proving that the conduct of which the defendant was convicted constitutes a predicate offense, and the conviction may not be used as a basis for removal.\u201d <em>Tokatly v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 613, 620-21 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">We therefore hold both that our jurisdiction has not been stripped under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), and that the charge of removability against Rivera under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(ni) ought not to have been sustained. <em>See Penuliar v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (explaining how the \u201cthe jurisdictional question and the merits collapse into one\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Because the IJ\u2019s decision on the second charge of removability rested solely on viability of the first charge, and the government has offered no alternative theory to sustain the \u00a7 237(a)(2)(E)(i) charge, this charge cannot stand either. <em>See Stuard v. Stewart, </em>401 F.3d 1064, 1067 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[W]e are not going to construct an argument for the [government] sua sponte, depriving [petitioner\u2019s] counsel of a fair chance to respond to it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-13\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b206-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
