Where the duty is not specific but general, and its performance as such involves the exercise of judgment and discretion, the writ will not lie. This is elementary law. Bouvier\u2019s Law Dict. (Mandamus 1-3-9); Tapping on Mandamus 282.</p> <p id=\"b253-10\" pgmap=\"253(80) 254(65)\">Section 2 of the Road and Bridge Act of 1883, declares that \u201c The commissioners of highways shall have charge of the roads and bridges of their respective towns, and it shall be their duty to keep the same in repair and to improve them so far as practicable,\u201d and by Sec. 5 they are \u201c to exercise such care and supervision over them as the public good may require,\u201d which doubtless :mplies the duty, subject to the same limitations, of putting them in suitable condition for public use and travel when they get out of repair. But this is general, and its performance, as to time, manner and extent of repair, is necessarily in some measure conditional and discretionary. In these broad terms therefore it is not the subject of mandamus. County of St. Clair v. the People ex rel., 85 Ill. 400-1.</p> <p id=\"b254-5\" pgmap=\"254\">The specific act or acts here sought to he enforced was the rebuilding of these bridges, which had been demanded and refused. Whether it was an imperative duty of the commissioners might depend on one or more of\" many circumstances. The answer denied it on several distinct grounds; (1) that the road had been abandoned and another substituted; (2) that upon petition duly presented it had been vacated by their order, which was reversed on appeal to three supervisors in \u25a0consideration of promises made by relator, which he had failed and refused to perform; (8) that they had no money on hand with which to rebuild them, nor any means of procuring the amount necessary for that purpose; (4) that if the bridges were\" rebuilt, the road, for reasons stated, would still he impracticable during a large portion of the year; (5) that if practicable it was not demanded by public necessity or convenience, which were fully met by others mentioned.</p> <p id=\"b254-6\" pgmap=\"254\">It will he observed that some of these averments were in denial of allegations in the petition, and others presented new matter.</p> <p id=\"b254-7\" pgmap=\"254(143) 255(53)\">We understand, under the statute, as before, where the answer is sufficient in law, issues of fact should be formed upon it by further pleading, even though it traverses the allegation of the petition \u2014 much more when it introduces new matter. Thus, in The People v. The Ill. Cent. R. R. Co., 62 Ill. 512, the court said, \u201cIt will be seen that the return traverses the allegations of the writ, which charge,\u201d etc. \u201c To this portion of the return the demurrer will therefore be overruled and the relator will have leave to withdraw the demurrer an$ make an issue of fact.\u201d Under the statute the petition takes the place of the alternative writ here referred to, and the answer that of the return. And in The People v. The Town of Waynesville, 88 Ill. 472, it was said, \u201c There were no pleas filed or other issues made than were presented by the petition and answer, nor other special issues of fact formed, but the trial was had before the jury on each allegation contained in the petition. \u25a0 This was contrary to the well established practice and should not be sanctioned.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b255-4\" pgmap=\"255\">In the ease at bar the replications filed only denied, (1) that the road had been \u201cvacated\u201d (which we think was not intended to be alleged in the answer), and (2) that any \u201cinducement\u201d had been offered to the supervisors \u201cin writing\u201d (the materiality of which may be doubted, as the case is not within the terms of \u00a7 51 of the act). So that it was tried as was the one last above cited, with no issues but those presented by the petition and answer, and none whatever as to the new matter introduced by the answer.</p> <p id=\"Aqa\" pgmap=\"255\">Overlooking this irregularity we proceed to notice, what is sufficient for our present purpose, the question of means with which to rebuild the bridges.</p> <p id=\"b255-6\" pgmap=\"255(225) 256(75)\">Without these, clearly, there could be no duty to rebuild, for it would not be, in the language of the statute, \u201c practicable.\u201d The petition represents, upon information and belief,, that respondents had on hand money enough for the purpose.. The answer denies it, and the proof is, without contradiction, that they had not a dollar. This ends the case for a mandamus \u201cthat they immediately repair said bridges and (so) put the road in condition for use as a public highway.\u201d And why not to the whole case, since the alternative prayer \u2014 for a mandamus \u201cthat they levy a tax and use the same without unnecessary delay to build good and sufficient bridge.;-,\u201d \u2014 was not supported by any averment that they had re\u00f1v ed, or been requested to levy a tax, or could have raised, by such means, the amount required. But waiving this omission, the answer averred that before the petition was filed they had levied for the current year the maximum amount allowed by law for road and bridge purposes; that in their judgment it would all be needed for ordinary repairs, and that the bridges and approaches would cost \u00a73,000. And although no issue was made upon these averments, evidence was produced in support of them, from which it appeared by a clear preponderanee that the cost of suitable bridges and approaches would he \u00a72,500, and absolutely that the value of the taxable property of the town, outside the city of Bloomington, by the last assessment roll, was \u00a766,486, and the amount levied \u00a74,500, or about 69 cents on the \u00a7100, of which the excess over 60 cents was to pay damages- allowed and awarded for laying out and vacating roads and for ditching to drain them.</p> <p id=\"b256-5\" pgmap=\"256\">This exhausted their power to levy a tax for road and bridge purposes under \u00a7 13 of the statute, and no other is given, so far as we have been able to find or are advised by counsel, except by \u00a7 14, which authorizes a further amount, not exceeding four tenths of one per cent., with the consent in writing of a majority of a joint board composed of the commissioners and the town auditors and assessor, \u201cif in the opinion of the commissioners a greater levy (than is allowed by the preceding section) is needed in view of some contingency and they certify. the same as therein prescribed. But the record contains no intimation that there was any contingency. Certainly the destruction of these bridges was not, of itself, nor is any suggested as having arisen out of it \u2022 and if there had been, the exercise of this power depended, first, upon the discretion of the commissioners to so certify, and second, the consent of one or more of the other town officers mentioned, and therefore it could not he compelled by mandamus.</p> <p id=\"b256-6\" pgmap=\"256\">It is thus seen that they, were without the means and without ability by taxation to procure the means required to build these bridges. iSTor were they under any obligation of duty to apply to the county hoard for aid under \u00a7 19, if that had been the case attempted to be made by the petition, for the reason that they were not able to \u201c furnish\u201d on the part of the town \u201c one half of the required amount.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b256-7\" pgmap=\"256(65) 257(55)\">The specific and sole object of this proceeding was to obtain a writ of mandamus. We know of no precedent or authority for granting an order of court in lieu of it. The order here made requires the performance of no particular act, but generally that the respondents \u201c proceed at the earli.est practicable time to put said highway in suitable repair,\u201d and to that end \u201c take all the steps provided by the statute to raise by taxation the largest amount that the law allows\u201d and \u201cout of it set apart a sum sufficient \u201d for that purpose. An order so general and uncertain can hardly be said to he in the nature of a mandamus.</p> <p id=\"b257-4\" pgmap=\"257\">As has been shown, the commissioners had already levied the largest amount allowed by the law, and since that, in their judgment, was not as much as was needed for ordinary repairs of roads and bridges, and also to put tills particular piece of road in suitable condition for use as a public highway, we apprehend the court could not rightfully control their discretion in the application of tho fund.</p> <p id=\"b257-5\" pgmap=\"257\">'\\For the reasons above given the order will beTeversed.</p> <p id=\"b257-6\" pgmap=\"257\">Order reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
