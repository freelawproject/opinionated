We reject their argument that the limitations bar of federal habeas review of state convictions starts to run when the state rules on habeas applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-29\">Ybanez\u2019s murder conviction became final March 17, 1988, when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied his petition for discretionary review. Ybanez filed a state habeas application September 4, 1992, which was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on February 10, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-30\">He filed a second state habeas application April 24, 1997, which included a new claim that a jury instruction was unconstitutional. The instruction had been upheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 1990, but the court reversed that decision in 1994. The second application was dismissed as a successive petition June 4, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Four months later, November 6, 1997, Ybanez filed a federal habeas petition, which the district court dismissed as barred by the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Lawson\u2019s murder conviction became final November 17, 1993, when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied his petition for discretionary review. He filed a state habeas application July 24, 1996, which was denied December 11, 1996. Lawson\u2019s state habeas application raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Lawson filed a federal habeas petition December 1, 1997, and the magistrate judge recommended that it be dismissed as time-barred. The district court adopted the recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Because Ybanez\u2019s and Lawson\u2019s convictions became final before the enactment of the AEDPA, each had until April 24, 1997 to file a federal habeas petition. <em>See Flanagan v. Johnson, </em>154 F.3d 196, 201 (5th Cir.1998)(establishing that date as the deadline for petitioners whose convictions were final before enactment of the AED-PA). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), a pending state habeas application tolls the statute of limitations created by the AED-PA. Even with tolling for the disposition of their state habeas applications, the AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations had expired for both petitioners, and we affirm the dismissal of their petitions on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The petitioners argue that their claims are not time-barred because the rulings on their state court habeas applications are the factual predicates of their federal ha-beas petitions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ybanez argues that he was denied due process of law by the state court\u2019s refusal to consider his second habe-as application, and that the state court decision is the factual predicate of his purely legal question. Lawson argues that his ineffective assistance of counsel claim presents a mixed question of law and fact \u2014 whether the state court\u2019s application of law to facts was unreasonable \u2014 and that the state court decision is the factual predicate of his federal petition. The petitioners argue that since they could not present federal habeas claims on these decisions until after the state courts rendered them, the one-year statute of limitations under the AEDPA began to run from the dates of the state court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Section 2244(d)(1)(D) provides for equitable tolling when the facts on which a federal habeas claim is based would not have been discovered by a duly diligent petitioner. <em>See, e.g., Fisher v. Johnson, </em>174 F.3d 710, 715 n. 14 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>189 F.3d 471 (5th Cir.1999). These facts do not include asserted errors in a state court\u2019s disposition of a state habeas application. Behind the petitioners\u2019 language is an extraordinary proposition: the factual predicate for their claims consists neither of evidence nor events at trial but in the state court\u2019s rulings on their constitutional claims. Congress granted petitioners one year to file a federal habeas petition. It is, <em>inter alia, </em>one year from the latest of the dates the factual predicate for the claim could have been discovered or the conclusion of <em>direct </em>review. The statute does not count the time a petitioner\u2019s state claim was pending in the state court. This structure, fleshed out by many federal decisions, would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>turned upside down should we play this game of recharacterization and semantics.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\">.
