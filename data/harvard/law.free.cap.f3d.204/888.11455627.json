Following the authority of <em>Bruning v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we hold that post-petition interest is an \u201cintegral part\u201d of such a tax debt and therefore nondis-chargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">We have jurisdiction over bankruptcy appeals from the district court and the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit (\u201cBAP\u201d) under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). All of the issues in the instant cases are questions of law which we review <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-21\">\n<em>The Ward Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b963-22\"><em>Board of Equalization of California v. Ward </em>is a chapter 11 case in which debtor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>John Ward (\u201cWard\u201d), doing business as Artisan Woodworkers, appeals from the judgment of the BAP. Ward contends that he is not personally liable for post-petition, pre-confirmation, interest on an otherwise nondischargeable tax debt that he owes to appellee creditor, the California State Board of Equalization (\u201cthe Board\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Ward filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Board filed a claim against the bankruptcy estate for the principal amount of the tax debt and pre-petition interest. The Board also included post-confirmation interest in its claim, but the claim did not include post-petition, pre-confirmation interest and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">The bankruptcy court confirmed Ward\u2019s chapter 11 plan of reorganization, which provided for the full payment of the Board\u2019s claim over 37 months at ten percent per annum post-confirmation interest. Ward satisfied the requirements of the plan in full. Subsequent to Ward\u2019s discharge, the Board issued an assessment against Ward for post-petition, pre-confir-mation, interest and penalties and later recorded a lien against Ward for this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Ward initiated an adversary proceeding challenging the Board\u2019s assessment and collection efforts. The bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of Ward, holding that he was not personally liable for post-petition, pre-confirmation interest and penalties. The BAP reversed, holding that Ward was personally liable for such interest and penalties. Appealing to this court from the judgment of the BAP, Ward contends he is not liable for post-petition interest and penalties, but he does not distinguish between post-petition penalties and post petition interest. As Ward does not raise the issue, we will, without deciding, treat post-petition penalties as equivalent to post-petition interest for the purpose of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">\n<em>The Bossert Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\"><em>Bossert v. United States </em>is a chapter 12 case in which the creditor, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), appeals <em>from </em>the judgment of the district court. The IRS contends that appellee debtor Rudy Bos-sert (\u201cBossert\u201d) is personally liable for post-petition interest on his nondischargeable tax debt. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">Bossert filed a chapter 12 bankruptcy petition. The bankruptcy court confirmed Bossert\u2019s debt reorganization plan, which provided for the full payment of his pre-petition tax debt. The plan did not discuss post-petition interest. Bossert successfully completed the plan, and the bankruptcy court granted him a discharge. After the discharge, the IRS issued a notice of levy for unpaid post-petition interest and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">Bossert filed the current adversary proceeding to contest the IRS\u2019 assessment and its collection efforts. The bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of Bossert and held that he was not personally liable for post-petition interest but was liable for post-petition penalties. The IRS then appealed to the district court, which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment. Appealing to this court from the judgment of the district court, the IRS contends that Bos-sert is personally liable for post-petition interest. Bossert does not cross-appeal the issue of liability for post-petition penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-14\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b964-15\">The <em>Ward </em>and <em>Bossert </em>appeals turn on the distinction between a creditor\u2019s claim against the bankruptcy estate as compared to a debtor\u2019s personal liability for certain classes of debt excepted from discharge. A bankruptcy estate is created when a debtor initiates a bankruptcy proceeding by filing a petition. With several exceptions not pertinent to these appeals, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>bankruptcy estate consists of \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">Once a petition has been filed, the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s automatic stay provision generally bars a creditor from attempting to collect a debt from the debtor, the debt- or\u2019s property, or the property of the estate by means other than filing a claim against the bankruptcy estate (\u201ca claim\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A creditor\u2019s claim, if contested, is restricted to the amount of the debt as valued on the date the petition was filed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, a contested claim may not include post-petition interest as such \u201cunmatured interest\u201d was not part of the debt as of the date of the petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The amount actually paid out of the estate on each claim, and in what order each claim is paid, is determined by the debtor\u2019s plan of reorganization (\u201cthe plan\u201d). Under both chapters 11 and 12, once the bankruptcy court confirms a plan, its terms bind the debtor and all creditors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a chapter 11 bankruptcy, the confirmation of a plan also \u201cdischarges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of such confirmation.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In a chapter 12 bankruptcy, on the other hand, a debtor is not discharged at confirmation but when he completes all payments under the plan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Neither chapter 11 nor chapter 12, however, discharge a debtor from personal liability for a tax debt excepted from discharge by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(1)(A).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Ward and Bossert acknowledge that the amount of their tax debts, as of the date they filed their petitions, was excepted from discharge. Ward argues, however, that his discharge relieved him of personal liability for post-petition, pre-confirmation, interest on the tax debt. Similarly, Bos-sert contends that his personal liability for post petition-interest was discharged. The question presented by both appeals is whether post-petition interest on a tax debt excepted from discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(1)(A) is also excepted from discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">The Supreme Court squarely addressed this issue in <em>Bruning v. United </em>States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Bruning </em>held that post-petition interest on a tax debt excepted from discharge under \u00a7 17 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is likewise nondischargeable. The Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-16\">In most situations, interest is considered to be the cost of the use of the amounts owing a creditor and an incentive to prompt repayment and, thus, an integral part of a continuing debt. Interest on a tax debt would seem to fit that description. Thus, logic and reason indicate that post-petition interest on a tax claim excepted from discharge by \u00a7 17 of the Act should be recoverable in a later action against the debtor personally, and there is no evidence of any congressional intent to the contrary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-17\">As \u00a7 17 of the Bankruptcy Act and \u00a7 523(a)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code are functionally equivalent, we see no reason why <em>Bruning </em>is not dispositive of Ward and Bossert\u2019s appeals. Following <em>Brun-ing, </em>therefore, we hold that post-petition interest on a tax debt excepted from discharge, as an \u201cintegral part\u201d of such a debt, is also excepted from discharge un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>der 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 528(a)(1)(A) and recoverable against the debtor personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Ward argues that <em>Bruning </em>is not applicable to his case, however, as the Court expressly limited its holding to those cases in which a creditor\u2019s claim is not paid in full from the bankruptcy estate. Ward bases this argument on the following underlined statement from <em>Bruning, </em>which we place in context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-5\">As to claims against the trustee in bankruptcy, the general rule for liquidation of the bankruptcy estate has long been that a creditor will be allowed interest only to the date of the petition in bankruptcy. In <em>New York v. Saper,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court held that the general rule applies to claims against the trustee for taxes as well as for other debts. But the instant case concerns the debtor\u2019s personal liability for post-petition interest on a debt for taxes which survives bankruptcy to the extent that it is not paid out of the estate. Petitioner asserts that the traditional rule which denies post-petition interest as a claim against the bankruptcy estate also applies to discharge the debt- or from personal liability for such interest even if the underlying tax debt is not discharged by \u00a7 17. We hold that it does not so apply.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">We do not read the underlined sentence to limit Bruning\u2019s holding in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Furthermore, Bossert asserts that <em>Bruning </em>does not apply to cases brought under chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code. He makes several arguments, but the gravamen of his position is that sections 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 502(a)(2), 1222(a), and 1222(a)(2) result in the discharge of his personal liability for the post-petition interest. These arguments are not well taken. The sections cited by Bossert govern claims against the bankruptcy estate, but they do not affect the exception of tax debts from discharge or a debtor\u2019s personal liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">Finally, both Ward and Bossert argue that excepting post-petition interest on a tax debt from discharge would frustrate the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s purpose-giving a debtor a fresh financial start. Congress, however, furthered a competing purpose in enacting the exception from discharge provision of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 528(a)(1)(A). As stated in <em>Bruning:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-13\">Nor is petitioner aided by the now-familiar principle that one main purpose of Bankruptcy Act is to let the honest debtor begin his financial life anew .... \u00a7 17 is not a compassionate section for debtors. Rather, it demonstrates congressional judgment that certain prob<em>lems </em>\u2014 e.g., those of financing government-override the value of giving the debtor a wholly fresh start. Congress clearly intended that personal liability for unpaid tax debts survive bankruptcy. The general humanitarian purpose of the Bankruptcy Act provides no reason to believe that Congress had a different intention with regard to personal liability for the interest on such debts.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-15\">Congress\u2019 intent to exclude tax debts from discharge is clear under the Bankruptcy Code, and, like the Court in <em>Bruning, </em>we have no reason to believe that Congress intended a contrary result with regard to post-petition interest on such a debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-17\">\n<em>Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b966-18\">The judgment of the BAP in <em>Board of Equalization of California v.
