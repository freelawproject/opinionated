It is also wholly false and untrue that deponent undertook and promised plaintiff to provide money for the payment of said note when the same should become due and payable, or that she agreed to indemnify and save harmless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the plaintiff from any loss or damage for or by reason of his giving said note, or that she assumed any liability to plaintiff whatever by reason of his giving said note.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u201c All of which facts deponent says are true, and she expects to be able to prove them on the trial of the eause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We are quite at a loss to understand wherein the learned court below considered this affidavit of defense defective. As we read it, it is a clear, explicit and unequivocal denial of every essential averment of fact contained in the plaintiff\u2019s statement; and, assuming as we must, in this class of cases, that the defendant\u2019s averments are true, the plaintiff has nothing left on which to base a recovery. The court was clearly i\u00f1 error in adjudging the affidavit of defense insufficient and entering judgment for plaintiff. The assignments of error are sustained. Judgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
