Wakefield as master, from whose report it appeared that on May 15, 1871, Elisha P. Gibbons, Samuel A. Wood and James A. Cromlow, entered into articles of copartnership for the purpose of carrying on the sawmill and planing mill business in Bridgeport borough. At the time of the formation of the partnership Samuel A. Wood owned a one third interest in lots Nos. 11 and 12, in the plan of the borough of Bridgeport. The articles provided, inter alia, as follows: \u201c Each partner is to invest an equal amount of funds in the purchase of the ground, and the erection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>mill.\u201d S. A. Wood contributed his one third interest in lots Nos. 11 and 12, without any- special writing, and the funds of the firm were used in purchasing the adjoining lots Nos. 108 and 111. The firm used the four lots during the continuance of the partnership. The business was continued until June 20, 1885, when it. was dissolved by an agreement in writing by which it was stipulated that Gibbons should take possession of the entire real and personal property of the firm, and pay off the partnership indebtedness \u201cto the amount of thirteen thousand dollars, provided they reach that sum. If the debts of the Co. exceed thirteen thousand dollars, then said E. P. Gibbons pay one-third of all excess over thirteen thousand of indebtedness and said Samuel A. Wood and James A. Cromlow the other two-thirds of such excess, and if said E. P. Gibbons can realize more out of the entire, property by judicious management than thirteen thousand dollars, and the indebtedness of the Co,, is .more..than that sum, then be is to apply it to the payment of the debts of the Co. If there is anything remaining after all indebtedness of the Co. is paid, and his own expenses for settling the business of the Co., such proceeds is to be divided equally between the three partners.\u201d Gibbons in his lifetime, and his executors after his death, paid off debts of the firm amounting to $18,427.52.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-4\">On November 27, 1885, Samuel A. Wood confessed a judgment to his three sons, Thomas A. Wood, L. M. Wood, and C. B. Wood, and on October 10, 1890, the sheriff made return that he had sold under this judgment Samuel A. Wood\u2019s interest in lots Nos. 11, 12, 108, and 111 to the plaintiffs, Thomas S. Wood, L. M. Wood and C. B. Wood. The master reported as a fact that before Thomas S. Wood, L. M. Wood and C. B. Wood obtained the judgment upon which the above writ was issued the said plaintiffs \u201chad notice of the dissolution of the firm of Gibbons, Wood'&amp; Cromlow, and that the lots aforesaid had been turned over to the liquidating partner as assets for the 2&gt;ayment of the firm\u2019s debts, and that these lots had been used and treated as partnership property. They had this notice more than four months before the note was given, more than nine months before they obtained the judgment, and nearly five years before they issued execution and sold the interest as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The bill in the case was filed for the purpose of obtaining a decree to sell the real estate of Samuel A.

The second specification is therefore groundless, unless there was substantial error in confirming the master\u2019s amended report. In view of its controlling effect, we have given the question thus presented a careful consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The confirmation of that report involved the consideration of thirty-seven exceptions,\u2014filed thereto by appellants,\u2014all of which were overruled by the court. Waiving the informality of virtually embracing so many questions in one specification of error, we have considered said exceptions in connection with the amended report, bill, answer and proofs upon which the report is based, and are fully satisfied there was no error in dismissing the exceptions and confirming said report. We find nothing in either of said exceptions that requires further notice than has been taken of them by the master and the learned court below. Such of them as are material to the issue are either not well founded, or contrary to cleai'ty established facts in the case. Some of the most material facts are admitted by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">As was well said bjr the learned president of the common pleas, the only practical question of much importance in the case is what interest, if any, did the appellants, Louis M., Charles B. and Thomas S. Wood, acquire in the real estate, in question,.by virtue of the sheriff\u2019s sale to them on their judgment against Samuel A. Wood. In view of the specific facts rightly found by the learned master, he correctly concluded that as between the partners \u2022 themselves the lots in question were partnership property from the time the formation of the partnership was consummated and its business put in full operation, and consequently as between themselves and those who dealt with them, with knowledge of the facts, the lots were personal estate: Collner v. Greig et al., 137 Pa. 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">There is nothing in either of the four specifications that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>requires further notice. Neither of them is sustained, and the record discloses no sufficient reason for reversal or modification of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, with costs to be paid by the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
