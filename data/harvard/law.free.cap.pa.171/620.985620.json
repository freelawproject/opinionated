On the morning of March 8,1892, plaintiff went there to look after his wife\u2019s, business and remained in and about her store until evening. He left the store on 11th avenue, about 10:40 o\u2019clock in the evening to go to the depot of the defendant to take a train for New York. On the way from the store to the train he stopped with a friend at a hotel and drank some whisky and then hurried along to the depot. He then says that he saw a train standing on the track; that he went to the baggage gate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>and asked a man in charge of the gate if that train is going to New York, and he said, \u201cYes, do you want to go?\u201d And plaintiff said, \u201cI do; \u201d that he showed his ticket and passed through the baggage gate\u2014not the gate provided for passengers\u2014and then hurried to the train which was moving as he got upon it; that he had a large satchel or telescope in his hand at the time; that he got upon the platform of the Pullman car and saw a man standing opposite him in a blue uniform and white cap; that he said to this man, \u201c Please give me a berth for New York,\u201d and was told, \u201c You are on the wrong train, sir ; \u201d that he said then, \u201c Stop, please, and let me off, I want to go to New York;\u201d that the employee said, \u201cWe cannot stop this train, step over on your left side and jump off, we are going slow ; \u201d that the left side was opposite from where he got on; that he slipped down on the last step, and it was dark and he could not see, could not see how fast the train was going \u2022and he stepped off; that the next thing he knew or remembered he was under the car; that he did not know whether the train was going fast or slow, all he remembered after stepping off was the car going over him. He further testified that his left foot was crushed and he had to have it amputated ; also that the train stopped and he was picked up and that there was no platform where he jumped off ; that he remained on the train from a minute to a minute and a half before getting off ; that there was no light and nothing to indicate how fast the train was going; that the road was smooth and he could not tell from the motion of the train whether it was going slow or fast; that he had his satchel in his hand when he got off, and it was so dark he could not see anything ; that he jumped off with his satchel in his hand, facing the way the train was going; that the satchel was in his left hand and the railing in his right and he jumped with the motion of the train, and he then says : \u201c The train was going so rapid that I found my feet had left me and I went down on my hands and knees, and the next thing that I knew I was under the cars. The train went so swift that it pulled the feet from under me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-5\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>Fug ene </em>Mullin, <em>T.

Their negligence or the negligence of either of them as to any matters involving the safety or security of passengers while being conveyed was the neglect of the railroad company: P. R. R. v.

It was plainly dangerous, and the plaintiff must be considered as having voluntarily assumed the risk involved in it: 4 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 766; Penna. R. R. v. Langdon, 92 Pa. 21; Johnson v. R. R., 70 Pa. 357.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b641-9\">The case of Edgerton v. N. Y. C. R. R., 39 N. Y. 227, cited by the appellant, has no application to this case. It was a question of passengers injured by an accident. Also in case 59 N. Y. 351. There the train did not stop long enough to allow the passengers to get off. Nash. &amp; Chatta. R. R. v. Erwin, Am. &amp; Eng. R. R., was a ease where a \u201c special \u201d on which plaintiff was riding collided with another train. Penna. R. R. v. Ray, 102 U. S. 451, simply decides that the conductor and porter of a sleeping ear are employees of the railroad company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>so far as the condition, etc., of the car is concerned, not as to running the train, etc.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aj7\">November 4, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AXdj\">Mb. Justice McCollum,</author>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The plaintiff got upon the platform of one of the Pullman cars as the train was moving from the station at Altoona towards Pittsburg, and having requested a trainman to give him a berth for New York he was told that he was on the wrong train, that it would not stop to let him off, but that it was going slow and he could jump from it. He was on the car about a minute and a half after the train started from the station and the rate of speed it had attained when he stepped or jumped from it is best described in his own language. He said, \u201c the train went so swift that it pulled the feet from under me.\u201d It is a reasonable conclusion from his testimony in regard to the speed of the train and the time he was on it that it was moving at the rate of from ten to fifteen miles an hour when he jumped from it. It is well settled that to jump from a moving train is an act of negligence which will defeat a suit for an injury caused by it unless it plainly appears that the circumstances connected with and surrounding it justified or excused it. In this case the plaintiff was safe upon the train and if his getting upon it instead of the New York train was due to the negligence of the company he might have had an action against the latter for the expenses he incurred and the inconvenience to which he was subjected in consequence of its fault. But his presence on the train through the negligence of the company furnished no warrant or excuse for jumping from it as he did. We must therefore for the purposes of this suit consider his presence there as due to his own unassisted mistake and regard the act of jumping from the car in the light of what occurred after he had gotten upon it. The sole attempted extenuation of the act lies in the conversation with the person called by the plaintiff a trainman, but whether this person was the conductor of the train, a brakeman, or a Pullman ear porter does not appear. It does appear however that he did not order the plaintiff to jump from the car and that what he said amounted at most to a suggestion or expression of opinion that he might do so. In this conversation therefore there was no warrant for the act under consideration and nothing to subject the company to liability for the consequences of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The plaintiff jumped from a rapidly moving train about eleven o\u2019clock at night and when it was so dark that he could not see where the jump would land him. He did so to escape being carried to the next station when he desired to go in the opposite direction. This desire was the sole cause of bis rash and entirely voluntary act, and he must be considered as having deliberately accepted the risks involved in it. It is essential to the safety of the traveling public that the railroad company shall be held to a strict accountability to its passenger for an injury resulting from its negligence, but common justice requires that it shall not be held liable to him for an injury caused by bis own negligence or violation of its rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">We find nothing in the cases cited by the plaintiff to sustain his contention which is at variance with the views expressed and the conclusion reached by the learned court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The specifications of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
