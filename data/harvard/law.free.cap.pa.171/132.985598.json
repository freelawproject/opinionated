The note was a substitute for three other notes made by the maker to the same payee, and indorsed by him to the bank. The bank kept an account with the maker, in which it charged him with the note, and subsequently cx-edited him with certain amounts, the aggregate of which did not equal the face of the note. The bank also kept an account with the payee of the note, in which it chai\u2019ged him with the amount of three notes which had matured, and ci'edited him on the same day with the substituted note. At the time of the trial the account of the payee showed a balance due the bank. <em>Held, </em>in the failure of the defendant to point out anything in the accounts between the payee and the bank, which was applicable as a payment on the note, that it was proper to giro binding instructions for the plaintiff.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b150-7\">Argued April 12, 1895.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIk\">Appeal, No. 253, Jan.

As the notes became due, they were paid by Nelson Bros. &amp; Co. by their checks upon the bank. This course of business continued until the firm of Nelson Bros. &amp; Co. went into liquidation and transferred all their assets to the bank as security for the payment of their debts. Among them were three notes of Edward McClain, one of \u00a73,000, another of \u00a72,500, and another of \u00a72,000. All of them had been indorsed by and discounted for Nelson Bros. &amp; Compauy by the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-5\">On November 12, 1885, in place of these three notes, the bank accepted the note in suit, with an assignment of a number of lien claims, amounting with interest included, altogether to \u00a77,529.48 as additional collateral security. Appended to the schedule was this note from McClain\u2019s counsel to the counsel for the bank:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-6\">\u201c Dear Sir: The interest has not been calculated very closely, and at the same rate of increase as in the \u2018 Harrowgate &amp; Unknown \u2019 cases, would run several hundred dollars in excess of above total I should think. Although there may be some slight objection to some of above claims when the properties liened are sold the conveyancers almost invariably insist on payment of claims and considering the other securities held as collateral I think the bank ought to be satisfied with this collateral.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-7\">\u201cYours truly,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">\u201c (Signed) H.

Justice McCollum,</author>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">We cannot discover in the bank accounts called for and presented by the appellants anything which authorizes or tends to sustain their present contention. The note in suit was made to the order of Nelson Bros. &amp; Co., and payable on demand. The payees transferred it, by indorsement, to the appellee, and the latter received from the maker an assignment of certain securities as collateral to it. It appears from the recital in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>assignment that the note for which the collateral was given was a substitute for three other notes of the assignor held by the bank, drawn to the order of Nelson Bros. &amp; Co., and indorsed by them. It is claimed by the appellants that the note in question and the notes for which it is a substitute were made by McClain for the accommodation of the payees named in them. But we are unable to find in the accounts, the assignment or the letters, anything which establishes this claim. This, however, is not a matter of much importance in the case, and we merely refer to it in passing. The controlling question is whether the note has been paid by the maker and payees or by either of them, and if not how much has been paid upon it beyond the sums credited in the bank\u2019s account with McClain. These credits from May 8, 1886, to Feb. 6, 1888, inclusive, amount to $2,016.88. Whether they represent sums realized from the collateral and paid to the bank by Terry in accordance with McClain\u2019s letter to him we cannot say; nor is there anything in the evidence to enlighten us on this point. The learned counsel for the appellants has not directed our attention to anything in the accounts between Nelson Bros. &amp; Co. and the bank which is applicable as a payment on the note, and we are not able to find from the evidence that there should be other credits upon it than those made as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We think therefore that the learned court below did not err in its instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
