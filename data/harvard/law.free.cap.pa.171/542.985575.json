The answer admitted paragraph one and the first part of paragraph two, but averred that said square, with others, was dedicated by the commonwealth to public uses. The first clause of paragraph three was admitted, but it was denied that said square had been reserved and averred that said square had been' dedicated to public uses, and that the borough of Beaver had dominion over, care and control 'thereof; and that the occupation thereof, except to such an extent as was reasonably sufficient for the courthouse, by the county of Beaver, was unlawful and in violation of public right. Paragraph four was admitted to this extent, that they had entered upon said square, had constructed in part and intended to complete the construction of a driveway along the western side and partly within the limits thereof; had dug up and removed two or three shade trees; that they had constructed a driveway about twenty-five feet in width along the northern side of said square and within the limits thereof, and had permitted a curb and sidewalk to be placed thereon; but it was denied that they had closed, or permitted to be closed, Turnpike alley, and averred that said alley had been practically closed for fifty years and that no notice to plaihtiff of said acts had been required by law. It was also denied that they were about to remove the fence from said square, but averred that said fence was maintained by the commissioners of the county of Beaver without any lawful authority. Paragraph five was denied. And it was \"averred that all acts by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>them done were in pursuance of a general plan for the improvement of *the streets, alleys and public squares of said borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-3\">The case was heard on bill, answer and proofs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-4\">The case of Buchanan v.

J., of the 5th judicial district, specially presiding, filed the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-5\">These two cases, to a great extent, involve the same questions of fact and the same questions of law. They were tried for the most part together, and were together argued by the same counsel at the same time. They involve questions as to the streets and public squares of the borough of Beaver, the power of the borough councils in relation thereto, and the action of the borough authorities in relation to certain streets, alleys and public squares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-6\">The town of Beaver was laid out by the state of Pennsylvania from lands reserved out of the depreciation tract north of the Ohio river. The act of September 28, 1791, authorized the governor to direct the surveyor general to lay out a town and outlets ; and the act of 1793 empowered the governor \u201c to direct the surveyor-general to survey 200 acres of land in town lots, on or near the ground where the old French town stood, in such manner as the commissioners appointed by the governor should direct,\u201d and provided that the governor should reserve out of the lots of said town so much land as \u201c he shall deem necessary for public uses.\u201d Under this act of 1791, though not in strict conformity therewith, Daniel Leet, deputy surveyor general, in the absence of commissioners, laid out the town of Beaver, and an act of assembly of March 6, 1793 (3 Smith Laws, 90), was passed confirming the survey and authorizing the governor to sell and convey the lots contained in the survey subject to the provision, \u201c in the manner and under the regulations, exceptions and reservations prescribed in the act of assembly 28 September, 1791.\u201d And the governor, acting under this provision, directed the surveyor general to mark the reservations required by the act of 1791 on the town plot. Daniel Leet had only marked the four central squares as public squares. On the 11th of March, 1793, the governor, through his secretary, directed the surveyor general as follows: \u201c The governor directs me to inform you, that besides the lots marked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>public square, he deems it expedient to reserve for public uses lots Nos. 1, 20, 21, 22,155,156 and 15S, and you will be pleased accordingly to mark official entry thereon on the original survey in your office.\u201d This was accordingly done, and on the 12th of March, 1798, the governor issued his commission to sell, so that the four lots in the center and the corner lots of the town plot marked \u201c public squares \u201d shall be reserved as lands deemed necessary for public uses and reserved by the governor accordingly. And under these acts and the action of the governor, and in accordance with this town plot made by Daniel Leet, approved by the general assembly and by the governor, the lots so laid out in the town of Beaver were sold. The streets were laid out on a plan parallel with the Ohio river, to wit: Front, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth; and Beaver, Elk, Market, Raccoon and Buffalo at right angles thereto. Each of said streets was laid out and marked on said plan as being one hundred feet in width, except that Fifth street, the northern boundary, and Buffalo street, the western boundary, are marked on the plot as being two hundred feet in width. Between each , of these streets equi-distant were laid out and marked alleys of twenty-five feet in width. The northeast block of lots and the northwest block are marked in plan \u201c public square,\u201d and were not sold. The portion lying bounded on the north by Turnpike alley, on the east by Insurance alley, on the south by Corporation alley, and on the west by Commerce alley, divided into four squares by Third street running east and west, and Market street running north and south, each of which on the plan is marked \u201c public square,\u201d were reserved for public use and not sold. Each of these public squares is three hundred feet, running north and south, and three hundred and sixty feet east and west, exclusive of streets and alleys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFt\">The borough of Beaver was incorporated by act of March 29, 1802, P. L. 116. By proceedings in the court of quarter sessions of Beaver county, at No. 2, September Term, 1866, the borough was brought under the general act of 1851, and is subject to the general laws and has the same powers, privileges and duties as conferred by the general borough laws of this commonwealth.- \u2022 The original act of incorporation appears to have given but limited powers to the borough authorities. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-5\">\u25a0 By act of April 2, 1803 (4 Smith Laws, 89), the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>designated the southwest square as a place for the erection of a courthouse and public building \u201c on such part of the public square as the commissioners of the county might think proper,\u201d and on that square a courthouse was built, occupying, with the ground inclosed, about one fourth the square. In 1876 a new courthouse was built on a different part of the same square. The jail, however, in 1856, was removed to other property. By act of March 29, 1824, the trustees of the Presbyterian church were authorized to occupy a portion of the southwest square, not exceeding one quarter of an acre, for a church, and a building was erected and used in accordance with this grant, but which has recently been abandoned and a new church built on property outside of the public square. By act of April 10, 1826, the Methodist Episcopal Church trustees were granted leave to occupy a quarter of an acre of the southeast square for a church, and it is so occupied. By act of February 25, 1815, the Beaver Academy was allowed to erect a building on the southeast square, and a portion of that square was so occupied for many years. - The academy has since been removed from that square.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-3\">The contention in these two cases relates to the action of the borough councils and the borough authorities in relation to these four central squares and the streets or alleys bounding the same. The town of Beaver seems to have had a very gradual growth. As originally marked out on paper it was a magnificent plan, having very fine, wide streets and large, deep lots. Nevertheless, as in so many towns in western Pennsylvania, the fashion was to build houses out to the line of the street, and rather than lose land in front, the owner preferred running the risk of building a little over on the street, so that the front of the houses were built, as a rule, on or near the street line. When there were porches erected they were frequently built out on the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-4\">There appears to have been for a long time but little attention paid by the municipal authorities to the streets, and even as far back as thirty years ago, according to my recollection\u2014 and the evidence shows the fact\u2014the streets of Beaver were mere country roads. An occasional proprietor, in the business part of town\u2014if it may be said to have had such a portion\u2014 might have had a small pavement of brick in front for his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>accommodation; but the man who had a cinder walk in front of his residence on the street was entitled to be considered a citizen of unusual public spirit and enterprise. The public squares were unsightly places, in fact, nuisances. And up until 1883 the lot owners, so far as the occupying and using these alleys or making any pavements or improvements was concerned, were very much like Israel of old, \u201c without a king, and every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-4\">A municipal revolution occurred in the election of 1882, and a. borough council was elected on the question of municipal improvements, and .those in favor thereof were in the majority. The council so elected passed ordinances enacting that sidewalks be laid on Third street from the eastern to the western boundary and paid for by the property owners. And they, also, it would appear from the testimony\u2014although the ordinances were not produced, the testimony shows they were passed\u2014 enacted that sidewalks of brick or stone should be laid on the four alleys bounding the central public squares, at a like expense. It seems that this gave rise to very serious opposition, and a distinguished lawyer (now deceased) and a property holder, opposite one of these public squares, resisted the matter in court, and personally declared he would not submit to have brick sidewalks placed in front of his residence. In time, however, he became reconciled and of his own accord put down a sidewalk. The resistance to these enactments of council was so great that the sidewalks on these alleys were not laid of either a uniform grade or a uniform width, or to uniform places on the alley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-5\">On the 9th of August, 1892, councils passed an ordinance providing for the improvement, grading and paving of Third street from boundary to boundary. In pursuance of which, in 1893, the street was improved to a width of about sixty feet, paved with brick from the western boundary to the eastern boundary of the public square, leaving a space of twenty feet between the sidewalk and the property line and the line of the public square unpaved; and from the east side of the public square eastwardly for some distance the whole width was improved, and then beyond towards the eastern boundary the improvement is sixty feet in width. A grade was fixed and the street was graded in accordance with this ordinance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>And a matter of importance in relation to one of the complaints in this case is this: At the crossing of Commerce alley, Third street in this improvement was graded down to a depth, the borough engineer says, of two and one half feet, presumably at the crown of the pavement, as at the side it is evidently three feet or more, thus cutting off Commerce alley from Third street on either side, without the necessary grading of Commerce alley to accommodate itself to the new grade of Third street as improved, graded and paved. The borough authorities, apparently by general consent, having undertaken to improve the streets, began to grade and work on these wide streets, and the traveled portion\u2014sidewalks included\u2014through the town is from forty to fifty feet, except as before stated as to Third street. The portions lying between the sidewalks and the property line is left in grass, and has upon it fine shade trees varying in age. But this unpaved portion lying between the improved portion of the street and the property line, with its grassy plots and shade trees, has become a prominent feature of the town; and this class of improvement has changed it from an unsightly, slovenly kept, place, as it was thirty years ago, until it is really a very beautiful town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-3\">Except as to the designation of portions that may be occupied for these various public buildings the state of Pennsylvania has paid no attention whatever to those central public squares ; they have been left entirely neglected or to the care of the borough authorities or to such public spirited citizens as may have seen fit to contribute to their improvement, and up to within a few years were places for nuisances. The borough authorities have within a few years taken charge of these public squares, made paths through them, have planted trees and cared for them, and they are now in fairly good order and are an attractive feature of the town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\">On the 24th of May, 1893, the borough councils passed a resolution for improvement as follows: \u201c On motion of Davidson seconded by Holt, the plan submitted to council by H. T. Barker for the improvement of streets and pavements around central public square is adopted, Hice, Cunningham, Davidson and Holt voting therefor unconditionally; Eakin and Moore voting for its adoption on condition the property holders should move their pavement out to conform to the new plan at their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>own expense,\u201d and the plan produced shows what was intended clearly as to the squares was indefinite as to the alleys. It is o t' the action under this resolution and plan that the bills complain. A large amount of testimony was offered on each side and admitted that the court was unable to say at the time whether or not it was relevant, but which we have not considered relevant and have entirely disregarded. As before stated, the alleys on each side of these public squares were laid out of the width of twenty-five feet for highways. On one side of that twenty-five feet were the private lots sold to different parties, and on the other side the public square.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\">As to the bill of John M. Buchanan, Esq., the first and second paragraphs are true. The third paragraph is true thus far: \u201cThat your orator, and those under whom he holds, under the direction of the town council and its engineer, and under an ordinance of said borough, paved the sidewalks in front of their said properties, the premises aforesaid, on the west side of Commerce alley and the south side of Corporation alley, entirely at their own cost and expense, about the year 1883, and according to the grade then and there established ; \u201d but as to that part which says, \u201c said sidewalks being of a width of nine feet, leaving a roadway of sixteen feet,\u201d the evidence does not bear that out. While the sidewalk laid may have been less than nine feet in width, nevertheless the owners of the property there had planted a line of shade trees on Commerce alley outside of the center from their <em>property </em>line ,\u2022 and the curb as set in 1883,. by the plaintiff or those under whom he claims, is thirteen and one half feet from the property line, leaving only eleven and one half feet from the curb to the outside of the street. As to-the other portion of this paragraph, \u201c that the land immediately opposite your orator\u2019s property on said alleys is not the property of the defendants,\u201d is a question largely of law to be hereafter discussed\u2014it is the public square.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\">The fourth paragraph, \u201c That the said council has commenced to \u00edemove the curb, tear up the sidewalk, laid as aforesaid on the west side of Commerce alley; disturb the trees, dig up and carry away the earth from said alley immediately adjacent to- and in front of your orator\u2019s property, and to place the curb, laid as aforesaid, in a ditch already dug at a distance from your-orator\u2019s property of eighteen and one half feet.\u201d That is cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>reet, except that the plan shows that it is eighteen feet, not eighteen and one half, \u201cleaving a roadway six and one half feet; \u201d it should be seven; \u201c and at a depth of three feet or thereabout below the grade established as aforesaid. That said excavation and change of sidewalk extend a distance of seven hundred feet and close to public travel.\u201d That is true. Nevertheless the fact is that the grading of Commerce alley on each side of Third street was made necessary, in fact essential, by the previous grading and improving of Third street, the leading street in the town. The grading of Third street at this point to the depth before stated necessarily carries with it the grading of Commerce alley to accommodate it to that grade, and if damage is done to the plaintiff by that grade, it is a part of the necessary damage resulting from the change of grade at his property on Third street, on which his property fronts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-5\">As to the fifth paragraph, \u201c That the defendants are about to remove the curb and sidewalk upon the south side of Corporation alley,\u201d is true; \u201c which changes so made and about to be made, change the original plan of the streets and alleys of said boroughs and destroy the symmetry, harmony and uniformity thereof,\u201d we are not prepared to find from the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-6\">The sixth paragraph raises a question of law on the facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-7\">The seventh paragraph raises a question of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-8\">The eighth paragraph appears to be 1 rue as a matter of fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-9\">The ninth paragraph, \u201c That the injury done your petitioner would be irreparable, and he is without adequate remedy at law,\u201d in our judgment is not founded in fact; the injury, if any, clearly is not an irreparable injury, nor is it such as cannot be compensated in damages, for which the plaintiff not only has a right of action but has instituted an action in the common pleas court of Beaver county, as to property at Third street and Commerce alley, viewers were appointed and said viewers have reported him damages for the grading of Third street and Commerce alley in connection therewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-10\">In the bill of the commonwealth against the same parties, the first, second and third paragraphs of the bill are true, as already found. The fourth paragraph, \u201c That the defendants have unlawfully entered upon said square, have dug up and removed the soil and earth from a portion thereof, dug up and removed ornamental, and shade trees, and have constructed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>part and threaten to construct an alley, street or public highway along or upon the west side of said square, and partly within the limits thereof, and have unlawfully entered upon and constructed an alley, street or highway, set a curb and laid a pavement or sidewalk upon the north side of said square, and within the limits thereof, and have closed or permitted to be closed and remain closed Turnpike alley, the northern boundary of said square, which was and is a public highway; all of which acts and things have been done without legal notice to your orator as required by law, and without the passing of an ordinance authorizing the same, and they are about to enter upon said square for the further purpose of removing the fence therefrom and exercising ownership and control,\u201d is a mixed question of law and fact. The facts alleged are in part true and in part are not sustained by the testimony. The facts found by the court upon the testimony will be stated hereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-4\">Fifth: \u201cThat by.reason of the unlawful acts of the defendants as aforesaid done and about to be done, your orator has suffered and will suffer irreparable injury and has no adequate remedy at law, and therefore prays,\u201d etc., is largely a question of law, although the evidence does not indicate that the actual damage to the commonwealth is appreciable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\">The counsel and parties requested the judge trying the case to accompany them on a trip around these squares and examine the same. He did accompany them, and in such a tour of investigation, at their request, has endeavored to make himself familiar, by sight, with the surroundings. First, as to Turnpike alley: Private property or lot owners on the opposite northwest square, namely, \u201cthe courthouse square,\u201d are, on the west Mr. Laird; next comes Judge Agnew, and next on market street Judge Hice, each having lots one hundred and twenty feet in width and running back three hundred feet or more. Opposite the northeast square the property is occupied very much in the same way. The houses were originally set out, either the house line or with the porch to the extreme of the lot limit, unless it be the house occupied by Judge Agnew, which is now a short distance back from the street. Mr. Laird\u2019s house was built probably fifty years ago or more out to the street line, and the porch over the street or alley line, and has so continued. At the other corner, occupied by Judge Hice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the house was so originally built; now a new house stands back from the street. Also, at the northeast square some of the houses have their porches built over on the street, and have long been so occupied. Opposite the courthouse square a row of trees\u2014maple, catalpa and horse-chestnut\u2014were planted at least forty years ago, at a distance of fifteen feet from the property line. They have grown to be very considerable trees. Since those trees were planted the driveway has been outside of those trees, leaving fifteen feet between the property line and the line of trees for foot travel and for ornament. Along this line were some of the earliest improvements of the borough, in the way of a cinder walk; but some twelve or fifteen years ago the three owners joined together of their own accord and put -down a neat brick pavement at their own expense between the property line and this first row of trees, leaving about six feet between the sidewalk and the row of trees. The travel by vehicle was then outside of this fifteen feet\u2014or with the growth of the trees almost sixteen feet\u2014leaving only nine or ten feet for a roadway. At an average of about twenty-two feet from the first line there was a second row of trees on the public square. The line of travel by vehicles then lay in part between this row of trees, sixteen feet from the property line, and the row on the public square, being of the average width of about twenty-two feet, and almost necessarily has been in part on the public square ; and until recently there was nothing to prevent horses and vehicles from going any place on the public square. And the weight of the testimony is that for a considerable length of time the larger portion of the travel was wholly on the public square. Opposite the northeast square, on Turnpike alley, at least two porches were out on the alley, and in addition a row of trees run along the entire front, out so far as to drive vehicle travel almost entirely on the square. These trees were planted by private owners, and nobody seems to have objected. Shade trees on the streets and in front of properties seem to be a feature of Beaver town, which the people are generally satisfied with and of which they are justly proud. In fact, the warmest opponents of the action of council would be unwilling to have these trees removed, and claim that they are not a -nuisance and should not be removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b571-3\">The borough council in making improvements assumed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>they were the custodians of these public squares held for public use, and that they had a right to improve them as in their judgment comported with the public benefit, and they were confronted with this problem of the shade trees, many houses standing out to the street lines and shade trees standing out on the alley in front, many of them grown to be of good size and useful, which it would take many years to reproduce. And, being anxious to improve and beautify the town, and especially these public squares and their surroundings, they undertook in their discretion to leave these trees and to construct a driveway on the public square in front of Turnpike alley of about eighteen feet in width and a paved sidewalk of about six feet; thus constructing driveways so as to avoid the necessity of taking out these trees and so as to make a reasonable and commodious driveway around the entire central public squares, a distance of over half a mile. On Commerce alley the old curb line was thirteen feet from the property line, and of that thirteen feet a portion was occupied by a brick pavement and a portion a grassy plot, with trees close to the curb line, leaving twelve feet for a driveway. The plan on which the borough council have acted is to make the curb line eighteen' feet from the property line, and a driveway on the balance of the twenty-five feet of Commerce alley, and in part on the public square, the driveway to. be twenty feet in width, seven feet on a part of the alley and thirteen feet on the public square. On Corporation alley side a driveway of twenty feet, the larger portion of which would be on the public square ; and on Insurance alley a driveway of twenty feet, of which about twelve and one half feet would be within the lines of Insurance alley and seven and one half feet, taken fro in the public square.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-4\">In regard to the alleged closing of these alleys as laid out by the commonwealth, the defendants deny that they have closed' them to public travel. There has certainly been no legal vacation or closing of any of these alleys. As to the encroachment by private persons upon the alleys, it is sufficient to say in regard to all that testimony, if any claim of right is based On the long, uninterrupted, continuous acts of encroachment by the lot owners and acquiescence by the public, that it is not sufficient to raise any question as to right. The right of the public to the alleys is unimpaired thereby. The defendants-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>have not by any act of theirs closed these alleys further than by the curbing and footwalk on Market street at Turnpike alley, and at the junction corners of Commerce and Insurance alleys. On Turnpike alley the curb is so sot and the pavement so laid that vehicle travel would be impeded thereby. The principal obstruction to travel, aside from the trees and the sidewalks, is one erected by Mr. Laird across Turnpike alley at the junction with Commerce, at which place he has an iron railing. According to the testimony, that is an erection by Mr. Laird, without any authority of councils, without their consent, but of his own private motion, and if a nuisance, as it certainly is, it is removable as any other nuisance erected by a private party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A98\">In regard to the damage claimed by Mr. Buchanan, that he has suffered irreparable damage, by this work done and proposed work on Commerce alley, to his lot, which fronts ninety feet on Third street and runs back along Commerce alley one hundred and fifty feet towards Turnpike alley, we have no doubt he is sincere in his belief that it damages him. The weight of the testimony is that it does not, but on the contrary will benefit his property. The damage to his property, as before stated, comes from the grading and improving of Third street, which is already done and for which he has had an award of damages. The grading of Commerce alley, we have already found, is a necessary consequence. My own judgment, on an inspection of the property in company with the owner and the attorneys would be, that the change of grade on Third street already made and settled, makes necessary the change of grade on Commerce alley; that the changes the council propose to make is not only a detriment, but it will add very considerably to the market value of the property. As to his property fronting on Corporation alley, at the corner of Commerce alley, the testimony is in equilibrio. I would be unable to find, as a matter of fact, that it was damaged. And the same thing would be true of his other property; but if damaged he would have legal redress to recover damages. Further, that while in our opinion the question for the court to decide is one of power in the councils, not one of discretion, yet as a higher court may have a different opinion, we find as a fact that the proposed making of these driveways around and in part on the public square will be an improvement to the public squares and of general public bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>fit to the town, and we are unable to see that there is, in fact, any private detriment to be suffered by the lot owners, but to a great extent it will not only be beneficial to the public, if carried out, but will add to the value of the properties on the alleys \u25a0and fronting these squares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-4\">The grading on the public squares is merely the necessary grading for the driveways and proper sloping thereof, the larger portion of it rendered necessary by the grading of Third street, whether the proposed change in the location of driveway on the alleys be made or not. The work on the square in front of Turnpike alley was completed before bill filed, as was also the larger portion of the work on Commerce alley. The work lias been done at expense of borough without special expense to the lot holders. The proposed changes or improvements on the public squares in no way interfere with the public uses heretofore designated by the legislature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">On the pleadings and findings of fact there arise two general questions as to the power of the borough authorities and the manner of its exercise:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">First, as to the public squares within the borough limits; and, second, as to the public streets therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-7\">Counsel for the complainant take the broad ground that the state has never dedicated these squares for public use, but simply reserved them, and that the state as owner has the absolute power of disposal, control, and at least has the sole and' exclusive right to direct and limit the uses thereof; and that the borough authorities have no power over the squares to regulate and manage, unless perhaps to keep them clean, but not even to cut down a tree, whether of natural growth or planted by the borough or a private person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-8\">The very able and ingenious argument of Hon.

And if our views be correct as to the power of the corporate authorities in the premises, when duly exercised, it is probable that in a short time an ordinance or resolution will be passed with due notice to and hearing of property holders and observance of all legal requirements, in consequence of which much of the work already done will be validated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-3\">Further proceedings to change these alleys complained of must be enjoined until a resolution or ordinance therefor has been duly passed and published.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-4\">Let a decree be prepared by counsel in accordance with this opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\">The borough of Beaver should pay the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree of court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-7\">_Z&gt;. <em>F. </em>Patterson, <em>Ellis N. </em>Bigger, <em>J.

The former are the words used in dedication, and the latter those used in a reservation. So that the portion of argument of appellants, based upon the Allegheny town act of 1787, goes for naught.</p>\n<p data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-9\">We contend that there is a statutory dedication of the squares to the public. If there is not, then there is a dedication deducible from the acts of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-10\">There may be a dedication of government lands, but the evidence from which consent to user will be inferred must be more than usually clear, to be conclusive in such success: 5 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 407.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-11\">Public squares were very clearly recognized as a legitimate public use, and the same rules of law are applicable to the dedication of public squares as to the dedication of highways; 6 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 416 ; Birmingham v. Anderson, 48 Pa. 258.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-12\">Dedication is the appropriation of land to some public use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>made by the owner of the fee and accepted for such use by, or on behalf of the public: ,5 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 395.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-4\">In this case we contend that there was-a dedication of \u201c Public Squares \u201d to public use, or in other words to the public, and the title of the state was qualified to that extent: Act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 321; Cook v. Burlington, 30 Iowa, 95; Barclay v. Howell\u2019s Lessee, 6 Pet. 498; Cincinnati v. White\u2019s Lessee, 6 Pet. 430; New Orleans v. U.

Maywood Village, 6 N.

L. 91; act of Feb. 25, 1813, 6 Sm. L. 29; act -of March 14, 1814, 6 Sm. L. 132 ; act of March 29, 1824, P. L. 149; act of April 10, 1826, P. L. 352; act of April 15, 1834, P.

The only things that the town council have done in- relation to the alleys was to leave them with their rows of beautiful trees and remove the sidewalks out to the edge of the public squares. Nothing has been done which deprives the public of the free use of the alleys. The borough of Beaver has' only exercised its right under the act of April 8,1851, to regulate the streets and alleys, public squares, common grounds, etc. The facts found by the court' below show these regulations to have been reasonable, and being so, they have the right to make them by proper ordinances: Dillon\u2019s Municipal Corporations, 4th ed. par. 645; Livingston v.
