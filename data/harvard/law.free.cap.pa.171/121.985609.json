He was a brakeman in the employ of defendant, and was one of a crew sent to the refining company\u2019s yard to shift cars. The assistant superintendent of the refining company directed what cars should be shifted and where they should be placed. In the course of his work plaintiff set his foot upon an iron stirrup placed on freight cars to enable brakemen to mount the car. The stirrup was out of repair, and under the pressure of plaintiff\u2019s foot the step flew from under him, and his foot fell upon the track and was run over by the wheel of the car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-12\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-13\">[If the defendant railroad company go on the premises of another person or corporation to draw or shift cars, their duty is to see that the cars used are in a proper condition to be used in the way that the work to be done requires.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-14\">If such work requires a brakeman to jump on the cars when in motion by means of the step alluded to in the evidence, then it was the duty of the railroad company to see that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>step was not a trap that would lure one to danger. This duty is not altered by reason of the company sending a locomotive and crew to the refining company\u2019s yard to do such shifting or moving of cars as the refining company\u2019s superintendent should direct.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">Defendant\u2019s points were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-6\">2. If the jury believe that the car from which the plaintiff fell, and on which the step or stirrup is alleged to have been loose or otherwise defective, did not belong to the defendant, then under all the circumstances as they appear in evidence the defendant would not be responsible for the accident, and the verdict should be for it. <em>Answer : </em>Refused. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-7\">3. It does not appear from the evidence in the cause that the defendant owed any duty to the plaintiff touching the repair of the car from which he fell, or in reference to keeping it in good order.

It was the giving to the appellee of a defective and dangerous appliance to use that creates the liability here.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AHa\">October 7, 1895:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AFp8\">Mr. Justice McCollum,</author>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The plaintiff was injured while in the service of the defendant company as a brakeman. The injury he received was due to a defect in the step of a freight car on which he was attempting to get, in the performance of the duties of his employment. It is settled by the verdict that no fault of his contributed in producing it. The car belonged to and was in the yard of the Atlantic Refining Company. The plaintiff was one of a crew sent into the yard by the defendant company to shift some cars there. The superintendent of the refining company directed what cars should be shifted and where they should be placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">It was while the crew were engaged in the work they were sent to do that the plaintiff received the injury for which he seeks compensation in this action. The cause of it has already been stated. If he had received it from the same cause while transporting the car from one point to another on the defendant company\u2019s road, the liability of his employer to compensate him for it could not be successfully questioned. In the recent case of Dooner v. Canal Co., 164 Pa. 17, this subject was fully considered in an opinion by our brother Dean, who in the course of it said: \u201c The measure of duty of the receiving road as to cars turned over to to it for transportation by connecting roads is settled by many cases. It is bound to make such inspection as the nature of the transportation requires, and if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>pass and haul ears faulty in construction or dangerously out of repair it is answerable to its own employees who are thereby injured; the many cases both in England and in this country which sustain in substance this proposition are cited in Patterson\u2019s Railway Accident Law, p. 309.\u201d If the defendant company is responsible to its employees for the condition of the cars it receives for transportation over its own lines, why is it not so for the condition of the cars it requires them to shift from one place to another on the tracks and in the yard of the refining company ? They are as clearly in its service in the latter case as in the former; their work is of the same nature in one case as in the other, and the risks attending it are the same. No sufficient reason appears for discriminating between the liability of a railroad company for injuries to its employees in handling upon its own line the cars of another corporation which are \u201cfaulty in construction or dangerously out of repair\u201d and its liability to them for injuries in handling such cars by its order elsewhere. It is not the ownership of the cars or of the line on which they are moved that imposes the liability'- upon the company, but it is the handling or shifting of them by its orders. The cases cited by the learned counsel for the defendant company do not, we think, sustain its contention. They differ materially in their facts from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The defendant company was not bound to shift the cars in the yard of the refining company without a previous inspection of them. If the latter refused to allow an inspection the former could have properly declined to engage in the work of shifting them. But having done the work it is responsible to its employees for injuries caused by the unsafe condition of the cars they were required to handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The specifications are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
