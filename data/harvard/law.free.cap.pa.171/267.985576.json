Gardner, wife of defendant, who being duly sworn according to law says she makes defense for her husband in above action as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">\u201c She is informed by counsel there can be no recovery upon the plaintiff\u2019s statement, filed for the following reasons :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">\u201c1. Whilst it is alleged in plaintiff\u2019s statement, during the time from 1st of January, 1889, to 6th August 1894, more than <em>5i\u00a1 </em>years, that defendant took for his own use at different times sums equal in the aggregate to &lt;f2,098.18, it is not alleged that he wrongfully or improperly took the same, nor that the same was not accountable on, or due for his salary and compensation which during that period he had earned, and which would amount to a sum very much more than $2,098.18, nor that he was not authorized in some way to take and use the said sum as he was the cashier, and in the legal control of the funds and assets of the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">\u201c This the sole averment of the plaintiff\u2019s statement, she is informed, does not of itself form the foundation of an action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-8\">\u201c 2. This averment of the plaintiff is not helped by the production of so-called memoranda, copies of which are annexed to the statement. The memoranda are merely blank pieces of paper (unused checks), with no words of writing and which indicate nothing. They bear no date; they do not say he nor any one promises to pay the same, nor any of them; they do not say he was to pay them to the bank, nor to any one else; nor is there on them the slightest evidence of an}' undertaking or promise on the part of him or any one, either for his own benefit, or against him, as to any matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-9\">\u201c They are not such evidence of debt by him to the bank, as she is informed, upon which an action can rest, and certainly not such prima facie evidence of debt, upon which plaintiff would be entitled to a judgment under the rules, without the addition of more.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-10\">The court made absolute a rule, for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-11\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) discharging rule to set aside service; (2) making absolute a rule for judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>Aug.

O\u2019Donnell, 2 Miles, 101, was for a \u201c book debt,\u201d and the statement was under the old act of March 28,1835, P. L. 89, applicable to the city of Philadelphia, providing for the recovery of \u201c book debts \u201d therein specified. The case was decided on the ground that the book entries were not entries in the original book of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim in Harbison v. Hawkins, 81* Pa. 142, was under the same act of 1835, and it was held that the entries were not the proper subject of book account: Wall v. Dovey, 60 Pa. 212, was decided upon the ground that \u201c the book entries contain no charge against the defendant,\u201d and they were not original entries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-10\">As to the requisites of a statement under the act of 1887, we refer to the case of Blanchard v. Hunter, 7 Pa. C. C.

Martin, 5 Pa. C. C. R. 333.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_b\">October 7, 1895 :</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ArO\">Mr. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The sheriff\u2019s return was in the form prescribed by the statute, and therefore by its terms showed a good service. But if it were traversable it was good on the facts so far as they appear. The defendant had gone away leaving his family in his residence, and there was no evidence of his intention to acquire a new domicile, certainty none that he had acquired one. The only negation of intention to return is by an inference from the circumstances, drawn by his wife, who expressly admits that she had no information from him on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">On the other branch of the case, the plaintiff\u2019s statement contained the averment that tho defendant \u201ctook for his own use out of the moneys of and belonging to the said bank \u201d the sum etc. and that no part of the said sum \u201c has ever been paid by the defendant to the plaintiff, and that the same is owing, unpaid and due from the defendant to the plaintiff.\u201d This states a good prima facie cause of action. The plaintiff was not bound to go further and negative possible defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The averments in the statement as to the tickets or memoranda deposited by the defendant in the place of the money he took, and the copies of such tickets attached to the statement, are in compliance with the act of 1887. The tickets do not of themselves import any liability on the part of the defendant, and would certainty not comply with the rule under the old affidavit of defense law that required the instrument sued on to be such as could go to the jury to establish, unaided by other evidene.e, the liability of the defendant. But this rule and the cases of Harbison v. Hawkins, 81* Pa. 142, and Wall v. Dovey, 60 Pa. 212, cited by appellant, were under the former statutes by which the affidavit was made to the instrument sued on. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>All the cause of action that the court had before it on the rule for judgment was the copy filed. Under the practice act of 1887 however the affidavit is to a defense against the statement, and the copy of instrument attached to the latter is merely a matter of evidence, in aid of that precision in setting forth the cause of action, which it was probably perceived would be likely to be wanting in the rambling story which the act invited plaintiffs to substitute for a declaration in the scientific and approved form.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">The circumstances are such that there may be a hardship in the case, and if defendant or his counsel can produce any evidence to cast a doubt on the amount, or on the merits in any way, he will have a good standing to have the judgment opened, but on this record we find no error in entering it.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b291-5\">Steerett, C.
