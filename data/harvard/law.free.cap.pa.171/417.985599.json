G. Emig &amp; Bro. to H. W. Emig &amp; Bro., the present firm, W. H. Emig still continuing as a member of the last firm; that he sought to obtain definite information from Mr. Ludwig, the manager, as to what his pay really was to be, and did not learn definitely until seven or eight months after he had been working for the firm, when it was agreed that he was to have two hundred dollars for the first- year, if he staid the year out; that he did work during that year, and that during the early part of that year the firm changed to the name in which the suit is brought, H. W. Emig &amp; Bro., and that he did continue to work the full year until April 1st, 1890; that then he entered into a contract with the firm through their manager, Mr. Ludwig, to continue on working for the firm at twenty dollars per month, and that he continued to work under that until about the 10th or 11th day of J une, 1890; that he received payments of all that was due him for all the work performed from the time he began to work until he ceased to work for them,\u2014all the wages that was due him except a balance of $83.93 ; that one payment that he received from the manager, Mr. Ludwig, was an order on Clayton Emig for ten dollars \u2022 and that Clayton Emig promised him time and again to pay this balance that was due him from the firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>To be followed by proof of the fact that H.

G. Ludwig to bind the defendants for the pay of the plaintiff; that there is no offer to prove either the partnership of the defendants, nor by any legal proof the agency of J. G.

There is nothing in the offer that proposes to show that. I will overrule the offer, and seal a bill of exceptions for the plaintiff. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b438-14\">Plaintiff offered to renew the offer to prove the execution of this contract for the purpose of establishing the agency of J. G. Ludwig, and for the purpose of showing by the contents of the contract\" itself that the powers of the agent were such as the employment of laborers and workmen to do the work, that that is an inference fairly to be inferred from the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The Court: That offer I have already ruled upon.

W. Emig&amp; Bro., through H. W. Emig, received the money from Mr. Kissinger for the digging of this well, to be followed by proof, of course, that the plaintiff worked at the digging of that well, and that there is a balance then due him from these parties of $86.93, for the digging of that well, and others,\u2014it is to be followed by proof of that,\u2014the digging of other wells ; and to be followed by other proof showing the connection of H. <em>W. </em>Emig with this business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">The Court: Is that all ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">Objected to that the purpose is not sufficiently specific to let us understand what is intended to be sustained by the offer; that the testimony proposed is not proper legal evidence to show the agency of J.

W. Emig was present on many occasions taking part in the management of this work. I desire to add that to the offer;\u2014and also to cite the rule of court on page 6, under admissions for the purpose of trial,\u2014the rule in regard to partnerships.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">Mr. Niles: All the objections to the original offer are renewed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-7\">The Court: The offer as a whole is very clearly inadmissible. It contains a very large amount of irrelevant matter. I will overrule the offer. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-8\">Plaintiff offered to prove by himself that he saw in the York Daily, a newspaper published in the county of York, an advertisement of a firm of the name of A. G. Emig &amp; Bro., J. G. Ludwig, manager, engaged in the business of digging artesian wells ; that he went to J. G. Ludwig, and entered into an engagement with him to work for said firm.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-9\">To be followed .by proof that he did work for said firm.; and during the time he so worked for said firm the firm was changed by taking in Clayton Emig, the other member of the firm, mentioned as defendants in this suit. To be followed by other proof establishing the fact of the liability of the defendants. To be followed by the proof of the advertisement in the paper, and that there was a balance due for labor performed of $83.93, or something like that, with interest from the date of the judgment before the justice of the peace.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-10\">The offer was objected to as not proper legal evidence for any purpose in this ease; as not heing legal evidence to establish, or tend to establish, any liability on the part of the defendants, or either of them, to the plaintiff; as being an offer to show the contents of a written instrument by parol, and as being irrelevant and misleading, particularly without an offer to prove any facts showing or tending to show the authority of the J. G. Ludwig mentioned to bind or contract for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>ants ; and being an offer to show conclusions, and not facts, as to the partnership and the agency, and the change of partnership. And, further, that the offer is contradictory of the statement, in that it proposes to prove that in 1889 the firm with whom the alleged contract was made was composed of Albert Emig and H. W. Emig, whereas the statement alleges that H. W. Emig and Clayton Emig were engaged in the business of drilling and boring wells on the 1st day of April, 1889, and says nothing about Albert Emig.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-4\">The Court: Is Ludwig in attendance ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-5\">Mr. MeClune : Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">The Court: The offer, as made, I shall have to overrule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">Exception to the plaintiff, and bill sealed by order of court.

Undoubtedly the general rule is that where an offer is made as a whole, of evidence partly admissible and partly not, the judge may reject it all, and is not bound to separate the good from the bad: Wharton v. Douglass, 76 Pa. 273 ; Smith v. Arsenal Bank, 104 Pa. 518 ; Evans v. Evans, 155 Pa. 572. But he may always do so, and we are not prepared to say that in some cases where the offer is clearly competent in substance and the objection is to a small or unimportant part, it may not become the duty of a judge to point out, or at least to call upon the party objecting to specify the parts objected to.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Our difficulty7 in the present case has been caused chiefly by the want of the pleadings and the evidence. Neither have been printed, and we are without guide to the status of the case when the separate offers were made and their relation to each other. It is said in appellee\u2019s paper-book that they were not progressive as they7 appear in the assignments of error, but that the first in time was the one set forth in the sixth assignment. This was a long offer containing undoubtedly a great deal of irrelevant matter, and was specifically objected to on that ground among others. The ruling of the learned judge was that \u201c the offer, <em>as </em>made, cannot be admitted.\u201d This was a clear intimation to appellant to separate his offer into its component parts, and according to appellee\u2019s paper-book he proceeded to do so. But the substance of the offer, which would have made it good, was the recognition of Ludwig\u2019s authority to employ plaintiff for the firm, by Clayton Emig\u2019s promise to pay the balance of his wages, and by the firm\u2019s payment of his board while engaged in the work. Unfortunately none of the subsequent offers presented this evidence free from the objectionable matters with which it was clogged in the first, and most of them omitted it altogether. The agreement made by Ludwig with Kissinger, of itself proved nothing, for he might have been specially deputed to make that contract without any general authority, and as pointed out by the learned judge in his opinion refusing a new trial, even a general authority as manager to procure contracts to dig wells, does not imply any7 authority to do the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>or to engage workmen for that purpose. All the offers therefore which were based on this Kissinger contract were properly excluded for irrelevancy when they were offered, although if plaiutiff had separately offered and got in the evidence above mentioned as to the recognition by the firm of Ludwig\u2019s authority to engage him, the Kissinger contract might then have been admissible as corroborative. As the offers were made however we are unable to see that the appellant suffered any injustice at the hands of the learned court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
