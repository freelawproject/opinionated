Well, of course, if that is so, anything that he said at that time would be binding upon his principal.] [1] In other words, [if he said and did that which made the defendant believe and understand and act upon the idea that he was the party interested\u2014that he was the principal\u2014his principal is responsible for that. On no other condition than that would evidence be permitted to contradict that contract;] [2] so that if you come to the conclusion that the agent did not fraudulently represent himself as the principal, you need inquire no further, because the evidence \u2022which has been introduced in relation to that ought not and imust not affect this contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-12\">On the other hand, [if you should find that the defendant believed the agent to be the principal in the transaction, then, of course, you have a right to consider the evidence which has been offered upon that subject relating to this contract.] [3] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>[At that time, if there were representations which made certain conditions, and they were not carried out, then, of course, the defendant had a right to rescind the contract, and to give notice that he would not require the advertisement to be inserted any longer.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-5\">It is veiy important, however, in considering the whole case, that you should consider whether the defendant acted upon what he says was his belief, and that is that the agent was the principal in this transaction. If in any way, by letter, by conversation, or in any other way, he recognized the principal as principal and the agent only as agent, then, of course, your verdict should be for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-6\">Verdict axxd judgment for defendant.

This was not contained in the written contract and the defendant testified that when he called the attention of the agent to the omission, the latter replied that he was the \u201c boss of the programme,\u201d arxd \u201c I am the man who is running this business.\u201d It is apparent therefore that the omitted part of the contract was not left out of the instrument by any mistake, or by any fraud. The defendant knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>it was not in before, and at the time, he signed it, and he accepted the agent\u2019s assertion that he was the \u201c boss \u201d as a sufficient provision for the absence of the omitted term of the contract. But the contract contained on its face in plain words a positive notice that \u201c the publishers are not bound by any agreement other than that expressed on the face of this contract,-\u201d also the words \u201cNo verbal agreement recognized.\u201d And the contracting parties were.\u201cHallowell &amp; Co., Publishers,\u201d and \u201c Henry Lierz.\u201d The contract was a direction to Hallowell &amp; Co., signed by Lierz, to insert his advertisement in the National Theatre Programme for forty weeks at two dollars a week. The defense was that the agent who made the contract said he was the \u201c boss of the programme,\u201d and that he agreed to send the defendant two theater tickets weekly and that the defendant might change his advertisement whenever he wished, nothing of which appeared in the contract, and the whole of which was supported only by the oath of the defendant and flatly contradicted by the other party. To allow such a defense to prevail against such a contract, and in the circumstances stated by the defendant, would be simply to revolutionize the law as to the alteration of written instruments by parol as it has been settled by all our modern cases. In Thomas v. Loose, 114 Pa. 85, we refused to permit just such a defense to be made to a written contract, which contained a similar notice to the one appearing on this instrument. In an elaborate opinion by our late brother Tiujnkby the whole subject was reviewed carefully, and the judgment was reversed because the court below had permitted the parol testimony to go to the jury in circumstances very like the present. The assignments of error are all sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Judgment reversed and new venire awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
