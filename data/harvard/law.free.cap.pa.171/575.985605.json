In the first, the subject of complaint, is that \u201cthe court erred in not instructing the jury to disregard entirely\u201d the improper and irrelevant testimony, elicited by the plaintiff\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant, recited therein. This admittedly improper testimony was immediately stricken out by the learned trial judge on motion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>defendant\u2019s counsel. He thus promptly did all be was asked to do, and should not be convicted of error for not doing more. As to the second assignment, the court was clearly right in sustaining the objection and excluding secondary evidence of the contents of the bill shown to be in existence, but not produced.</p>\n<p id=\"Asc\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
