Kerr, and (2) giving the attorneys a lien on the assets of the estate to secure payment of such fees. We have concluded that the trial court correctly construed and applied the agreement, and that its order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">The parties agree that in August 1961 decedent made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>will, apparently executing two duplicate originals thereof, in which she provided in pertinent part: \u201cI do hereby designate Almario M. Aviles as my sole heir and beneficiary\u201d; that Aviles become her legal guardian \u201cif and when necessary\u201d; and appointing him as executor. After her death the public administrator found one of the documents, which had been torn across several times and then pasted together with trading stamps; the other was in the hands of Aviles, who before Mrs. Kerr\u2019s death had moved from his former home in San Diego (in the vicinity of Mrs. Kerr\u2019s home) to the San Mateo area. Aviles was not related to Mrs. Kerr.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The public administrator applied for letters of administration of Mrs. Kerr\u2019s estate. Aviles consulted with a firm of attorneys in San Mateo, who in turn sought the assistance of a San Diego firm, respondents on this appeal. In November 1962 Aviles and the two firms of attorneys entered into a written \u201cAttorneys\u2019 Retainer Agreement,\u201d the pertinent portions of which are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Thereafter the San Diego firm was successful in securing the admission of decedent\u2019s will to probate and the appointment of Aviles as executor. In so doing, the work they performed included extensive interviewing of witnesses to the will, the procuring of their affidavits, and the preparation of petition for probate of will, order admitting the will to probate, and letters testamentary. The attorneys were of the view that Aviles, by reason of being named in the will \u201cas my sole heir and beneficiary,\u201d would be entitled to distribution of all the property of the estate, even though the will did not expressly so provide. The same firm, as attorneys of record for the executor, Aviles, also prepared the notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>creditors, order appointing inheritance tax appraiser, notice of sale of real property, and petition to borrow money to encumber real property of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">In August 1964 Aviles noticed a motion for substitution of attorneys and to fix fees for \u2018 \u2018work done to this time.\u201d Following a hearing the court made its order of substitution and decision relative to the attorneys\u2019 fees, in which it was found among other things that respondent attorneys \u201chave fully performed all of the conditions on their part to be performed under said [written attorneys\u2019 retainer] agreement; [and are] entitled to a full one-half of the net recovery of . . . Aviles . . . [from the estate of Mrs. Kerr] . . . ; that said attorneys are further entitled to a lien against the assets of said estate as security for the payment of said share; that the amount of said share to which said attorneys are entitled cannot be ascertained until creditors claims and costs of administration have been paid\u201d following sale of certain real property which comprised the principal asset of the estate; that \u201csaid attorneys have waived all claims for fees as counsel for said Executor.\u201d Accordingly, the order fixed the fees of the attorneys under the retainer agreement at \u201cone-half of the net recovery\u201d of Aviles from the Kerr estate \u201cafter deducting all the court costs, creditors claims and costs of administration,\u201d and gave them a lien on estate assets to secure payment of the fees. This appeal by Aviles followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Aviles contends that the award to respondents of one-half the net recovery from the estate violates the provisions of sections 901 and 910 of the Probate Code, which limit the compensation of executors and their attorneys, and of section 903, which declares that contracts for a higher compensation shall be void. (See <em>Estate of Hite </em>(1909) 155 Cal. 448, 452-456 [101 P. 448]; <em>Estate of Higgins </em>(1910) 158 Cal. 355 [111 P. 8] ; <em>Firebaugh </em>v. <em>Burbank </em>(1898) 121 Cal. 186, 191-192 [53 P. 560].)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Although a contingent fee contract for services rendered as attorney for an executor is invalid (see <em>Estate of Hastings </em>(1952) 108 Cal.App.2d 713 [239 P.2d 684]), contingent attorney fee contracts with an heir, devisee or legatee to secure the probate of a document as a will or to protect or advance his claims to share in an estate have been upheld as proper. (See <em>Houge </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 706 [285 P.2d 257] ; <em>Estate of Raphael </em>(1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 792, 796-798 [230 P.2d 436] ; see also <em>Estate of Cazaurang </em>(1934) 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Cal.2d 712, 717 [3] [36 P.2d 1069] ; <em>Estate of Cazaurang </em>(1946) 75 Cal.App.2d 217 [170 P.2d 694].)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The trial court is correct in its implied conclusion that the contract now before us falls within the latter category, and is valid. As noted (fn. 1, <em>ante), </em>the contract specifies that Aviles is to pay the attorneys \u201cfor their services a guaranteed fee\u201d of $200 to \u201cdefray their costs in connection with the prosecution of the probate of said Will and other actions, if any, and to\u201d additionally pay them one-half \u201cof the recovery in said estate proceedings by reason of any compromise or proof of the said Will and the admission thereof and the procurement of the distribution of the assets. . . .\u201d This language does not suggest that the attorneys would also act as counsel for the executor, or that the fees called for in the contract were intended to cover legal services rendered in any such capacity. If for any reason Aviles had not acted as executor, the attorneys\u2019 contingent fee contract with him would not have obligated them to render services as counsel for any other personal representative the court might have appointed; their obligation to Aviles under the contract was to procure probate of the will and thereafter protect his interests up through the point of distribution to him of the estate assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Also, the waiver by the attorneys of all claims for fees as counsel for the executor removes any possibility that they might receive a contingent fee for services rendered in that capacity. Additionally, since any fee otherwise payable to counsel for the executor would have been deducted as a cost of administration (pursuant to the court\u2019s order), the waiver actually operated to increase the expected net recovery by Aviles.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Aviles' suggestion that the court did not make a proper inquiry or order pursuant to the requirements of section 1020.1 of the Probate Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is likewise without merit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>In the first place, the inquiry contemplated by that section appears to be permissive rather than mandatory. Next, Aviles does not claim that as a \u201cperson interested in the estate\u201d he moved the court to inquire into the attorney fee contract under the provisions of section 1020.1, although it would have been proper for him to apply for such review. Finally, the record shows that respondent attorneys presented evidence of extensive service rendered in securing admission of the will to probate, which it must be presumed entered into the court\u2019s determination. (Cf. <em>Estate of Raphael </em>(1951) <em>supra, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 792, 794-795.)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">The court did not err in ordering that the attorneys have a lien on the estate assets to secure payment of their fees. Their contract with Aviles specifically gives them a lien on his claim to the estate or any \u201csum recovered by way of settlement.\u201d No impropriety is shown. (See <em>Gostin </em>v. <em>State Farm Ins. Co. </em>(1964) 224 Cal.App.2d 319, 323-325 [2-10] [36 Cal.Rptr. 596] ; <em>Estate of Cazaurang </em>(1946) <em>supra, </em>75 Cal. App.2d 217, 219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Traynor, C. J., McComb, J., Peters J., Tobriner, J., Peek, J., and Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-8\">\" Client [Aviles] hereby retains Attorneys to represent him ... in the matter of proving the Will of Sue B.
