That ease involved a Utah statute requiring satisfaction of an automobile accident judgment as a condition to the reinstatement of the judgment debtor\u2019s driver\u2019s license, the statute specifically providing that a discharge in bankruptcy did not relieve the debtor from this condition. Suspension of the judgment debtor\u2019s license was made dependent on the creditor\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\">In the <em>Kesler </em>case the Supreme Court discussed its holding in <em>Reitz </em>v. <em>Mealey, </em>314 U.S. 33 [62 S.Ct. 24, 86 L.Ed. 21], involving a similar New York statute. In that ease it was determined that no conflict with the Bankruptcy Act existed, because the statute was not designed to aid collection of debts but, rather, to enforce a policy against irresponsible driving, which policy would be frustrated if negligent drivers could avoid the statute by the simple expedient of voluntary bankruptcy. (314 U.S. at p. 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">At the time the New York judgment should have been certified, the law in that state did not make suspension dependent on the creditor\u2019s request. The Supreme Court concluded in the <em>Kesler </em>case, however, that the differences between the Utah statute and the New York statute, even before the latter was amended to require action by the creditor, were insubstantial, and therefore held, on the basis of the <em>Reitz </em>case, that the Utah 'statute did not conflict with the Bankruptcy Act, pointing out that the bearing of the statute on the purposes served by bankruptcy legislation was essentially tangential (369 U.S. at p. 174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Similarly, the statute here under consideration was not designed to aid collection of debts but to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. As stated in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>85 Cal.App.2d 361, 365 [193 P.2d 11], \u201cThe purpose of the act [Contractors License Law] is to guard the public against the consequences of incompetent workmanship, imposition and deception.\u201d (See also <em>Fraenkel </em>v. <em>Bank of America, </em>40 Cal.2d 845, 848 [2] [256 P.2d 569]; <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Contractors\u2019 etc. Board, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.2d 414, 419.) Accordingly, the present statute, as did the statute upheld in the <em>Kesler </em>ease, bears only tangentially on the purposes served by the Bankruptcy Act and does not conflict with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">It should be noted, incidentally, that the sanctions of section 7113.5 of the Business and Professions Code are not so far-reaching as those contained in the Utah statute. As said in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>Hope </em>v. <em>Contractors\u2019 etc. Board, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.2d 414, 425: \u201c [T]he sanctions of section 7113.5 are much less drastic than those of the Utah Financial Responsibility Act. Here acts of bankruptcy do not require peremptory license revocation. They merely give cause for the taking of some disciplinary action. Whether such action will be taken and, if so, the extent thereof, is left to be gauged by a comprehensive appraisal of all factors relevant to the ultimate issue: Can this person at the present time be deemed competent to continue to pursue a vocation substantially affecting the public weal ? \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Second. <em>Should the penalty imposed by the registrar be set aside on the ground that it constituted an abuse of discretion?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><em>No. </em> The general rule is here applicable that in a mandamus proceeding to review an administrative order the determination of the penalty by the administrative body will not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverage etc. Appeals Board, </em>52 Cal.2d 287, 293 [8] [341 P.2d 296]; <em>Bonham </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>45 Cal. 2d 304, 306 [288 P.2d 502].)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The hearing officer in the present case, after two hearings on the merits and taking into account plaintiff\u2019s operations as a contractor, selected a particular group of persons, injured by his operations as a contractor, with a high public interest to protect and as a condition to reinstatement required him to make their injury whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The payments which the registrar\u2019s decision requires plaintiff to make before he can be reinstated relate to pension funds, health and welfare funds, and vacation funds, all of which were due and owing for the benefit of his employees. Such sums constitute \u201cwages\u201d of these employees and are a preferred claim in bankruptcy. <em>(In re Otto, </em>146 F.Supp. 786, 788-789.)</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Since wages and related benefits derived from wages of employees have received special attention by the Legislature and been accorded a preference in our law, they may receive special attention in the penalty imposed for a violation of the Contractors License Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">It is conceivable that under certain circumstances such a penalty requiring payment of wages may be unreasonable. Under the above-stated rule, however, the determination of the penalty will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion has been clearly shown; and no such showing has been made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The judgment is reversed, and the superior court is directed to deny the writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Traynor, C.
