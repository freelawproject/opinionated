J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE0\">A jury found the defendants guilty of first degree murder and fixed the penalty at death for Daniel Allen Roberts and life imprisonment for Mae Blanche Coleman. The trial court denied Roberts\u2019 motion for new trial but granted Mrs. Coleman\u2019s motion on the ground that involuntary statements were admitted in evidence against her. The People\u2019s appeal from the order granting Mrs. Coleman a new trial has been consolidated with Roberts' automatic appeal. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Mr. and Mrs. Luther Popejoy managed the apartment house in which they lived in San Francisco. At approximately 10 p.m. on June 20, 1962, Popejoy left the building to go to his job at a steel plant. When he returned the next morning he found his wife dead under a bed in their bedroom. She had been strangled, possibly with an electrical extension cord, after having suffered a blow on the nose. The time of death was sometime between 10:30 p.m. on June 20, when she was last seen alive, and 2:30 the following morning. There was testimony that it would have required considerable strength for one person to place the body under the bed. A man\u2019s watch, the victim\u2019s purse, a pair of red shoes with small steel heels, the rental agreements between the Popejoys and their tenants, and a rent receipt book were missing. There was no evidence that the apartment had been entered forcibly.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Defendants had lived in the apartment house as man and wife for several months. Popejoy testified that on his way to work on the night of the killing he saw them sitting on the front steps of the building. Another tenant testified that he met defendant Roberts in the cellar of the building at approximately 10:30 p.m. that night. Roberts offered him several dozen books of matches, which he was throwing away because he was \u201ccleaning up.\u201d Roberts and the witness walked out of the cellar together and separated in front of the victim\u2019s door when Roberts said he intended to pay his rent. As the witness walked upstairs Roberts knocked on the door. The victim called, \u201cWhat do you want at this time of night?\u201d and Roberts said that he wished to pay the rent. The witness saw the victim open her door and Roberts enter the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The police found Roberts\u2019 palmprint on the arm of a chair in the Popejoy apartment and his fingerprint near the bottom of the door between the living room and bedroom. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the defendants\u2019 apartment the police found a radio, two pairs of men\u2019s pants, and a note addressed to Roberts signed by Mrs. Coleman stating that she planned to leave him to go to Santa Barbara because he was being unfaithful to her. The card on the defendants' mailbox near the front door of the building with Roberts\u2019 name on it was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Charles Roberts, defendant Roberts\u2019 brother, was the chief prosecution witness. He testified that he visited the defendants on June 20 at approximately 6 p.m. Defendant Roberts said that he planned to hold up a garment factory at 10 p.m. that evening. Charles agreed to take some of defendants\u2019 clothing to his home, and he left with the clothes by a side door at Roberts\u2019 direction to avoid being seen by the Pope-joys. Charles next saw the defendants when they arrived at his home at approximately 2:30 a.m. on June 21. Roberts then told Charles, \u201cI think I hit her too hard,\u201d and in response to Charles\u2019 question, \u201chit who too hard?\u201d Roberts answered, \u201cmy landlady.\u201d Roberts said that his landlady was under or by the bed. Mrs. Coleman was not present during this conversation. Charles agreed to drive the defendants to Sacramento. On the way Mrs. Coleman said that she had searched the Popejoy apartment and indicated that she had been present when Roberts killed the victim. Mrs. Coleman said she thought it would be best if the victim were dead so that they could not be identified. When they arrived in Sacramento Roberts had Charles pawn a watch that was identified at the trial as the one taken from the Popejoy apartment. They then went to the American River and threw in an electrical cord and a blue purse, which Roberts indicated had come from the Popejoy apartment. Mrs. Coleman told Charles that she had left a note in their apartment designed to mislead the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Charles\u2019 wife testified that the defendants\u2019 clothes were in Charles\u2019 automobile on the evening of June 20, that when the defendants arrived at her apartment after midnight that night Mrs. Coleman gave her a pair of black shoes with laces and large wedge heels, and that the defendants left with Charles. When Charles returned the following day he showed her a newspaper story about the killing. He also disposed of the shoes Mrs. Coleman had given her.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In early October 1962 an inspector from the San Francisco Police Department and a San Francisco Assistant District Attorney, armed with warrants for the defendants\u2019 arrest for murder, went to Oregon where defendants were being held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>on another criminal charge. By that time the police had gathered most of the evidence recited above. The investigators questioned both defendants, and parts of tape recordings of the interrogations were played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Roberts told the investigators that he and Mrs. Coleman left the Popejoy apartment house sometime around the middle of June at approximately midnight or 1 a.m. They did not tell Mr. or Mrs. Popejoy that they were leaving. They left because Roberts had no job and had only $17. They hitchhiked to Marysville and then to Oroville, where they caught a freight train to Oregon. Roberts stated that he had not seen Mrs. Popejoy on the day he left San Francisco but that he saw Mr. Popejoy at about 9 p.m. when he and Mrs. Coleman were sitting on the outside steps and Mr. Popejoy left to go to work. He had not been in the Popejoys\u2019 apartment on that day and had not been in it since the last time he paid the rent, which he always paid in the daytime and never at night. He had never attempted to pay the rent at night and had never been anywhere near the Popejoy door after Mr. Popejoy had gone to work. He had only been inside the Popejoy apartment at the desk and had never at any time been in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In a separate interview, Mrs. Coleman first told the investigators that she had been living with Roberts for about three months at the Popejoy apartment house before they left San Francisco sometime after June 25. They left at about 3:30 or 4 a.m., hitchhiked to Marysville, and then took a freight train to Oregon. They left because Roberts had violated his parole and they had seen his parole officer in San Francisco. She had not been in the Popejoy apartment the evening before they left. After they saw Mr. Popejoy on his way to work, they went to their apartment where they remained until 2 or 3 a.m. when they left San Francisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">When the investigators told Mrs. Coleman that they had talked to Roberts\u2019 brother Charles and knew how she and Roberts left San Francisco, she admitted that she and Roberts had gone to Charles\u2019 apartment at about 3 or 4 a.m. and asked him for a ride to Sacramento. In the morning Charles pawned a guitar and Roberts pawned his watch. She did not see Mrs. Popejoy the evening before and neither she nor Roberts attempted to pay the rent that night. She admitted writing the note left in the kitchen but claimed that she wrote it to make Roberts leave San Francisco. She wrote it about 2 a.m. when Roberts was in the Fillmore district for about two hours. When asked if she had ever seen a pair of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Mrs. Popejoy\u2019s shoes, she said that Mrs. Popejoy had given her a pair of black shoes but that she could not remember what she had done with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Neither defendant testified at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Because of the introduction into evidence of defendants\u2019 statements and comment by the court and prosecutor on defendants\u2019 failure to testify, we requested briefs directed to the question whether the recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1 [84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653], and <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977], were applicable to this ease. In the <em>Escobedo </em>case it was held that \u201cwhere ... [a criminal] investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the suspect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied \u2018the Assistance of Counsel\u2019 in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as \u2018made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u2019 <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S., at 342 [372 U.S. 335 (83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, 93 A.L.R.2d 733)], and that no statement elicited by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial.\u201d <em>(Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 490-491 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977].)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Conceding that the investigation into Mrs. Popejoy\u2019s murder had focused on defendants, that they were in police custody, that the interrogations by the investigators lent themselves to eliciting incriminating statements, and that incriminating statements were elicited and used against them at the trial, the Attorney General contends that the <em>Escobedo </em>ease is not controlling because there was no objection to the introduction of the statements into evidence and there is no showing that defendants were not advised of their right to remain silent and no showing that either of them requested and was denied the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Since this case was tried before the <em>Escobedo </em>decision, defendants\u2019 failure to object to the admission of their statements into evidence does not preclude their raising the question on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>62 Cal.2d 692, 711 [44 Cal.Rptr. 30, 401 P.2d 382], and cases cited.)  The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>right to counsel during interrogation does not turn on a request <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dorado, </em>62 Cal.2d 338, 347 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361]), and a waiver of that right and of the right to remain silent cannot be presumed.  The burden is therefore on the prosecution to show that a defendant was either informed of these rights or otherwise waived them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>62 Cal.2d 571, 580-581 [43 Cal.Rptr. 201, 400 P.2d <em>97]; People </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>62 Cal.2d 692, 711-712 [44 Cal.Rptr. 30, 401 P.2d 382]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lilliock, </em>62 Cal.2d 618, 621 [43 Cal.Rptr. 699, 401 P.2d 4].)  Accordingly, whether or not the trial court erred in holding that Mrs. Coleman\u2019s statements were involuntary, it did not err in granting her motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Since Roberts did not confess to the investigators but only made false exculpatory statements and since the jury was instructed that Mrs. Coleman\u2019s statements should be considered only against her, it is contended that the error in admitting their statements into evidence was not prejudicial to Roberts. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>60 Cal.2d 378, 385-386 [33 Cal.Rptr. 497, 384 P.2d 1001]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, </em>62 Cal.2d 338, 356-357 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361].) This error cannot be considered alone, however, for the court and prosecutor also erred in commenting on defendants\u2019 failure to testify.  It is now settled that such comment violates the Fifth Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609 [85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d <em>106]; </em>see also <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 653].)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Except for Charles\u2019 testimony of defendants\u2019 oral admissions to him, the evidence was almost wholly circumstantial. It was the defense theory that the circumstances were consistent with innocence, or at most second degree murder, and that as a possible participant in the crime, Charles was unworthy of belief. Charles was familiar with the Popejoy apartment house, said he was there on the evening of June 20, and knew that defendants were planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>to leave town. He pawned Mr. Popejoy\u2019s watch and threw the other things allegedly taken from the apartment into the river. He at first denied any knowledge of the crime, and only implicated defendants after the police learned that he had pawned the watch. Thus, Charles had an obvious interest in directing suspicion away from himself. Roberts\u2019 entry into Mrs. Popejoy\u2019s apartment in full view of another tenant was not consistent with a preexisting plan to rob or kill, and the jury might well have entertained at least a reasonable doubt whether Roberts was guilty of first degree murder had the prosecution not been allowed to prove that both he and Mrs. Coleman lied to the police and had the court and prosecutor not commented on their failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In his argument to the jury the prosecutor repeatedly stressed defendants\u2019 lies<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as evidence of consciousness of guilt that destroyed any innocent interpretation that might be placed upon the other evidence, and he asserted that the lies were part of a prearranged plan of Roberts and Mrs. Coleman to mislead the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Moreover, the inadmissible statements were not merely repetitions of similar admissible statements. Accordingly, it cannot be determined what impact their erroneous admission may have had on Roberts\u2019 decision not to testify. The prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>cutor took full advantage of that decision by forcefully commenting on it in his argument,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as he then reasonably assumed he was entitled to do. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a713; <em>People </em>v. <em>Adamson, </em>27 Cal.2d 478 [165 P.2d 3] ; <em>Adamson </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U.S. 46 [67 S.Ct. 1672, 91 L.Ed. 1903, 171 A.L.R 1223].) With evidence before the jury that he had repeatedly lied to the police, Roberts and his trial counsel may have concluded that it would be futile for Roberts to attempt to exculpate himself by testifying to other exculpatory facts even if they were true. Had he not been deprived of his right to counsel during interrogation, he might have been advised to say nothing or to tell the truth if he was innocent or guilty of only second degree murder, even though the truth might have appeared to him as less exculpatory than false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>denials of any incriminating facts. He was induced at a critical stage in the proceedings to make choices that he could make intelligently only with the advice of counsel. <em>(Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478, 486 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d <em>977]; </em>see <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>368 U.S. 52, 55 [82 S.Ct. 157, 7 L.Ed.2d 114]; <em>White </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 59, 60 [83 S.Ct. 1050, 10 L.Ed.2d 193]; <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 75-76 [62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680]; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Kaiser, </em>323 U.S. 471, 475-476 [65 S.Ct. 363, 89 L.Ed. 398] ; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>58 Cal.2d 630, 644 [25 Cal.Rptr. 448, 375 P.2d 296] [dissenting opinion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">After reviewing the entire record in the light of all the foregoing considerations, we are of the opinion that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to Roberts would have been reached had defendants\u2019 statements not been erroneously admitted into evidence and had the court and prosecutor not commented on their failure to testify. Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed. (See Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 4\u00bd; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bostick, </em>62 Cal.2d 820, 823-826 [44 Cal.Rptr. 649, 402 P.2d 529].)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The reversal of Roberts\u2019 conviction is compelled by the <em>Griffin </em>ease and by the <em>Escobedo </em>case regardless of whether a request for counsel during interrogation is controlling. Roberts repeatedly stated to the investigators that he wished to answer questions only in the presence of an attorney. Despite these protests, the investigators persisted in questioning him and succeeded in eliciting statements that were introduced into evidence against him. The prosecutor vigorously urged in argument that those statements and Roberts\u2019 failure to testify destroyed his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The trial court granted Mrs. Coleman\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground that her statements were involuntary and clearly prejudcial. Since her statements are also inadmissible under the rules set forth in the <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, </em>62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361], <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>62 Cal.2d 571 [43 Cal.Rptr. 201, 400 P.2d 97], <em>People </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>62 Cal.2d 692 [44 Cal.Rptr. 30, 401 P.2d 382], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Lilliock, </em>62 Cal.2d 618 [43 Cal.Rptr. 699, 401 P.2d 4], and since the court and prosecutor also erred in commenting on her failure to testify, we need not and have not determined whether the trial court correctly ruled that her statements were involuntary. The reasons and authorities set forth at length after the hearing and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>hearing in <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, </em>62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361], compelled this court, as they have other courts,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in being faithful to the Constitution of the United States as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, to hold that the rule of the <em>Escobedo </em>case does not depend upon a request for counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The order granting defendant Coleman a new trial is affirmed. The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Peters, J., Tobriner, J., Peek, J., and Dooling, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The record affirmatively shows that defendant \u00a1Roberts requested counsel and did not waive Ms rights. The tape recording of Ms interview with the investigators began before they introduced themselves to him and continued until the end of the questioning. At no time did they inform Roberts of his rights. Moreover, he repeatedly stated to the investigators that he wished to answer questions only in the presence of an attorney. \u00a1Despite these protests, the investigators persisted in questioning him and succeeded in eliciting statements that were used against him at the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\">For example: \u201cWell, we know that ultimately both of these defendants were captured in Oregon. We know that, don\u2019t we? And at that time the frame of mind of Daniel Boberts, I suppose, should have been, \u2018Well, I am caught. My parole has been violated. O.K. I give up now. That is it. \u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">\u201cAnd if you asked him then . . . \u2018Well, how did you get away that night,\u2019 he could have said easily, \u2018Well, I went out to Charles and he drove me to Sacramento.\u2019 Or he could have said, \u2018Well, we went to Sacramento.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">\u201c \u2018Did you go to see Mrs. Popejoy that night?\u2019 He could have easily said, \u2018Well, yes, I did. I did, yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">\u201c \u2018Did you see Charles that night?\u2019 He should have replied, \u2018Well, yes, I saw Charles that night.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">\u201cInstead, what did he say? Here is a man that tries to tell you that he has nothing to do with this murder, that the only reason that he fled was his violation of parole. In effect, he should be in a position of saying, \u2018Well, there is nothing more to lie about now. I am caught. My parole has been violated. You have me now. There is no reason to lie.\u2019 And yet he does. He lies about Ms prints. He lies about going to Marysville. He lies about seeing Charles that night. He lies about being near her apartment that night or going in her apartment that night. He lies about seeing her that night. And the question comes into your mind, \u2018Why?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-13\">\u201cHere is a man who has nothing to run from any more. His parole is violated. He is captured. And he lies once, twice, three times, and lies some more. And the question comes up, \u2018Well, what is this man lying for? Wliat for? What does he know? What is he trying to conceal?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-5\">For example: \u201cSo they ask you, \u2018Disbelieve Charles,\u2019 they say to you, \u2018Disbelieve him.' They don't take the stand under oath and tell you he lied. These are the people who could tell you that he lied, if he did so. They do not do so. They ask you to disbelieve because he made some inconsistencies. . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\u201cShouldn\u2019t you say, \u2018At least, if X am asked as a logical person to reject his testimony, I should have liked to have heard the testimony of one of those two defendants or both; I should have liked to have at least have heard them say one thing, \u201cI didn\u2019t kill Mrs. Popejoy.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u201cI should think you might want to hear perhaps a little more and say something about, \u2018I didn\u2019t throw a cord in the river.' But, no, you are not accorded that privilege, and the defendants need not take the stand. I don't mean to conclude, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, for one moment that they need to take the stand, or that they should, or that you should conclude just even for a moment that they are guilty by not taking the stand, because, thank God, in America no one need get up . . . there and hang himself, and I, for one, believe in this law. The prosecutor must prove his case to you beyond a reasonable doubt, and this is good law and this is what I am trying to do. I don\u2019t think we should have to rely on their testimony to convict them, and the law promises this, and I agree to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u201cBut they sit here with so much knowledge within their grasp and deny you that; you can conclude that, in fact, Charles Roberts and these other witnesses like McKinley Brown, in fact, did tell the truth. You can at least logically do this ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">\u201c . . . [Counsel for Roberts] says, after all, he says, my client, you know, has been convicted of a felony and if he took the stand, you wouldn\u2019t believe him anyway, because he would stand impeached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">\u201cWhat sort of an explanation is that? What sort of a substitution is that for offering you at least evidence, for having at least this much come from the mouth of the defendant . . . Daniel Roberts, under oath?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">\u201cOne, the motive for Charles to lie; two, to tell you he didn't kill Mrs. Popejoy, under oath, \u2018I didn\u2019t kill Mrs. Popejoy.\u2019 Three, \u2018I was with Dora.'

[43 Cal.Rptr. 577], filed on March 30, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The defendant in that ease was convicted in 1959 of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment; his conviction was affirmed by the District Court of Appeal, and this court unanimously denied a hearing. In April 1964, about a year after <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, </em>372 U.S. 353 [83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811], was decided, the District Court of Appeal was compelled to vacate its judgment because the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>had not been represented by counsel on appeal. Counsel was then appointed, the appellate court again reviewed the record, and affirmed the judgment for the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">After <em>Escobedo, </em>we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for a hearing and retransferred the case to the District Court of Appeal for reconsideration in light of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Upon reviewing the case for the third time, two members of the three-member District Court of Appeal felt compelled, six years after conviction, to reverse on the authority of <em>Escobedo </em>and this court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, </em>62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361], in spite of the fact that the defendant had voluntarily confessed to having committed a cold-blooded murder in the perpetration of robbery and had had the advantage of every legal resource.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">While the long history of review of the <em>Benavidez </em>conviction makes a reversal more appalling than in the present case, Justice Fourt analyzes the problems faced by law enforcement officers when appellate courts, with apparent indifference to the rights of law-abiding citizens, move the rules of formal court procedure back to the police station and reverse convictions where there has been no miscarriage of justice. His dissent is quoted, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">\u201c... In effect, a policeman, under the rule set forth <em>[Dorado </em>rule], when he thinks he has a prime suspect in custody must proceed to arraign the suspect for further questioning\u2014and if the policeman does not so properly arraign the suspect, even a full, complete and voluntary confession of the suspect made within two minutes thereafter is not admissible at the trial. And this is done apparently (not to protect an innocent person) but to punish the police for a failure to perform their duty\u2014but the net result is that a dangerous criminal is turned loose onto society and decent people are at the mercy of that dangerous criminal until he is caught in some other crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">\u201cA Pandora\u2019s box of confusion, uncertainty, disarray and discord is unleashed by such a decree. For example, the law books are full of cases where committing judges, trial judges and others have proceeded in cases with the understanding of all concerned that there was a sufficient, proper and legal waiver of some particular right by a defendant (such as a public trial, jury trial, delay in trial, delay in pronouncing judgment, appointment of counsel, jury challenge, etc.) and which later have been reversed by an appellate court because some justice thought that the judge of the lower court had misinterpreted the evidence of waiver. Can anyone imagine how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>many criminals in the future will swear (even though an officer has fully complied with the law of <em>Dorado) </em>to the effect that they did not really understand that they were waiving any rights, that they did not hear what the policemen had to say, that they were emotionally disturbed at the time and did not really mean to waive any rights. Furthermore, it can easily be seen in the light of the fact that no workable rule is or can be laid down as to what constitutes a proper waiver and as a consequence every police officer necessarily will be practically on his own. In other words, the court says, in effect, that it will nullify the policeman\u2019s efforts and the results obtained therefrom if he does not meet the standards of the court, but the court refuses to tell the policeman in advance what the standards are. Could anyone design a better formula for handcuffing the police ? Query: does the suspect have to make a declaration of waiver, or can he impliedly waive ? What is the standard a policeman is to use in coming to a conclusion as to whether a suspect has intelligently and understandably waived his rights to keep still\u2014keeping in mind, of course, that the waiver must depend upon the particular facts and circumstances of each case, including the background, experience and conduct of the suspect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">\u201cHeretofore the courts have thought that \u2018the serious and weighty responsibility \u2019 of making a determination as to whether there was a waiver of a substantial right was lodged in the trial judge. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 465 [58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461, 146 A.L.R. 357].) Now, apparently, the policeman is supposed to make the determination as to whether and when the suspect makes an intelligent and knowledgeable waiver. The simple stating of the proposition makes it clear that the successful interrogation of suspects will be next to impossible under any such rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">\u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has in the past ruled to the effect that there was no constitutional right of a suspect to be advised of his right to counsel or of his right to remain silent. <em>(Haynes </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503 [83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513]; <em>Crooker </em>v. <em>California, </em>357 U.S. 433 [78 S.Ct. 1287, 2 L.Ed.2d 1448]; <em>Cicenia </em>v. <em>Lagay, </em>357 U.S. 504 [78 S.Ct. 1297, 2 L.Ed.2d 1523].) Likewise, our Supreme Court has heretofore similarly held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ditson, </em>57 Cal.2d 415 [20 Cal.Rptr. 165, 369 P.2d 714] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garner, </em>57 Cal.2d 135 [18 Cal.Rptr. 40, 367 P.2d 680]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>56 Cal.2d 71 [14 Cal.Rptr. 13, 363 P.2d 13] ; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Crooker, </em>47 Cal.2d 348 [303 P.2d 753].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u201cUnder <em>Dorado </em>policemen who ordinarily are not required to be learned and skilled in constitutional law now have the burden of advising suspects of their constitutional rights, and they must do so at just the right moment in the proceedings, otherwise the probabilities are extremely great that a self-confessed violent criminal will be turned loose. It appears that any court, at the very least, should look at the totality of the circumstances in the police procedure to determine whether there was fundamental fairness; even under those circumstances there would be no well-defined guide lines for a policeman to follow. There should never be a situation, however, where a coldblooded, robbing, murderer in the face of a mountain of conclusive evidence against him may be released into society solely because the police failed to comply with a rule which was nonexistent at the time of the investigation and the trial\u2014and particularly so where the reversal is not upon the theory that possibly the defendant is innocent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">\u201cA hearing before a judicial officer in a judicial proceeding is one thing\u2014a police investigation is something else. The rules of evidence should, of course, prevail in the judicial proceeding, but certainly not in the police interrogation process. The next step might well be to promulgate a rule to the effect that the police cannot consider hearsay evidence in their investigations. Query: what occurs in the event a suspect asks for a named attorney and the police secure that named attorney for the defendant and the suspect later claims that the attorney was ineffective, and, therefore, was no attorney at all\u2014is the free and voluntary confession of the suspect made after he had talked to the named attorney to be admitted or rejected because counsel was supposedly ineffective? Is there to be a presumption that any suspect who confesses after seeing his attorney has an ineffective attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201cAssume that a crime has been committed, and the police arrest a prime suspect and have him in custody and the suspect wants to talk to his attorney A (who has represented him in several other criminal trials) but A is out of the country on a vacation at the time and will not be back for 30 days\u2014what do the police do\u2014is the investigation \u00e1t a standstill and stalemate\u2014and if the suspect confesses in the meantime and before the attorney returns, is the confession admissible into evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">\u201cThe police, as I understand it, are representatives of the executive arm of the government\u2014there to enforce the law as written, to protect and to serve the community. Why should an officer be insulated from talking to a suspect? There seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>to be expressed in both <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Dorado </em>a veiled distrust of the police. As heretofore indicated, police are but the representatives of the public and the presumption is that they perform their duties faithfully and well, and the records bear out the fact that they do their jobs extremly well considering the judge-made hurdles which have been put into their paths. The fact that police work is not performed in public view should be of no particular consequence, for by the nature of things, it has to be so conducted\u2014the work of the police is to ferret out crime and to keep the community a safe place for its residents. It may be distasteful to have police at all or to have them investigating and questioning\u2014on the other hand, it is more distasteful to be unable to walk on an ordinary street in a city without fear of violence being committed to your person or property. If people committed no crime, there would be little need for policemen. But be that as it may, the judicial attitude of this state seems entirely unrealistic as to conditions as they exist insofar as the police are concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201cIn <em>Dorado </em>the court waves aside any forebodings of law enforcement officials as to the effect of its ruling. The court cites as authority, in part, for its position a statement in an article by J. Edgar Hoover in a 1951-1952 Iowa Law Review (p. 182) where Hoover said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">\u201c \u2018Agents are taught that any suspect or arrested person, at the outset of an interview, must be advised that he is not required to make a statement and that any statement given can be used against him in court. Moreover, the individual must be informed that, if he desires, he may obtain the services of an attorney of his own choice. Duress or brutality of any type is absolutely forbidden. Any Special Agent guilty of such conduct is subject to immediate dismissal from the service. The highest ethics of law enforcement become part of the Special Agent\u2019s credo. Nothing less can be accepted.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">\u201cHoover also pointed out in that article that the P.B.I. <em>is not a police </em>force\u2014it is the <em>investigative </em>arm of the Department of Justice, <em>is strictly a fact-finding agency. It does not authorize or decline prosecution or make recommendations or evaluations.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">\u201cIn any event, if J. Edgar Hoover is to be used as an authority (and I assuredly believe he should be) then it is appropriate to have something of his of more recent date. In a speech at St. Ignatius Loyola University on November 24, 1964, and reported in the Congressional Record February 8, 1965, he said, among other things:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">\u201c \u2018The moment has arrived when we must face realistically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the startling fact that since 1958 crime in this country has increased five times faster than our population growth. Serious crimes\u2014murder, forcible rape, robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, automobile theft\u2014have mounted steadily since the end of World War II. In 1951 these crimes for the first time topped the 1 million mark, and more than 2%. million serious crimes were reported during 1963.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\u2018\u2018 \u2018 Even more ominous is the fact that this terrifying spiral in crime has come about through a growing wave of yonthful criminality across the Nation. Last year for the 15th consecutive year crimes involving our young people increased over the previous year. For all serions crimes committed in the United States in 1963, youthful offenders were responsible for a staggering 72 percent of the total arrests for these crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">\u201c \u2018What a grim and unhappy commentary on the moral climate of this great Nation. The moral strength of our Nation has decreased alarmingly. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">\u201c \u2018These shocking statistics together with the public\u2019s apparent indifference to them are indicative of the false morality we are tolerating today. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">\u201c <em>\u2018Law and order are the foundations upon which successfu,l government must stand.

It has nothing to do with temporary standards ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">\u201c \u2018Unfortunately and too often humanity, if left to itself, moves along the line of least resistance. That is the reason we make such slow progress, and why we are prone to wait for pathfinders to blaze the way for us to follow. Each of us hopes that beyond the despair and darkness of today there is something better in store for tomorrow. <em>It will be tragic if nothing but hope is brought to bear on the problem of crime in the United States today....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">\n<em>\u201c \u2018. . .If we are to reverse the crime picture in this country, </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\n<em>we must make a sustained effort to stir the complacent ones to awareness.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">\u201c <em>\u2018We mollycoddle young criminals and release unreformed hoodlums to prey anew on society.

The statistics show, without question, that Washington, D.C. has more aggravated assaults than any city of corresponding size in the United States, where armed marauders prowl the streets at night, where no sensible woman dares walk at nighttime\u2014where an atmosphere of lawlessness even pervades the public schools. And a look at the crime statistics of this area (California) will indicate that ever since the courts apparently have embraced the philosophy of superior rights for inferiors or criminals, the law-abiding public has suffered drastically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">\u201cThe rights of those accused of crimes should not be paramount and superior to the rights of the decent law-abiding citizens of the community. It is to engage in nothing short of duplicity to say that the rule of <em>Dorado </em>will not seriously hamper effective law enforcement in California\u2014and the penalty in effect, as I have heretofore indicated, is visited upon the pubEc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">\u201cThe police have the right and duty to conduct reasonable interrogations of persons charged with crime\u2014it is a duty they will have, regardless of Supreme Court decisions, and it is totally unrealistic and manifestly unfair and dangerous to expound rules of conduct or procedure to which the police cannot possibly strictly adhere while at the same time performing their duties and fulfilling their responsibilities as expected of them by the decent people of the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">\u201cThis business of grasping at anything to support a reversal in a criminal ease (the search for error) has gotten to the point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>of absurdity where justice is perverted and respect for the administration of justice is nil.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">\u201cIf any support is needed for that assertion, I only point to the general disrespect for authority and specifically to the disrespect for the law enforcement officer who is repeatedly assaulted while acting in the line of duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\u201cI refuse to join in what I think is a most unfortunate trend of judicial decisions which strain to give the guilty not the same but vastly more protection than the law-abiding citizen receives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\"><em>\u2018\u2018 </em>Furthermore, contrary to the rule of <em>Dorado, </em>the appellate courts of Illinois, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and New Jersey have held in effect that the rule of <em>Escobedo </em>is as the Supreme Court of the United States stated it, namely <em>that the refusal of a suspect\u2019s request for counsel is an indispensable condition of the new constitutional rule.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">\u201cAdmittedly, this so-called newly discovered constitutional right uncovered in <em>Dorado </em>is something which no other court in the past 150 years has ever before found. It seems to me that rights which reach constitutional magnitude in 1965 surely must have been of some significance or size sometime during the last 100 years at least to the extent that one appellate court in the land would have observed such a right and so declared it. There is no such opinion in the books which I can find. I am unwilling to attribute to all of the appellate justices of all of the appellate courts of the United States in the past 150 years such blindness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">\u201cIf the thought is that free and voluntary confessions should no longer be used or available to the prosecution in the trial of cases, it would be far better to so announce in so many words and have done with it.
