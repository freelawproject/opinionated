As will appear, plaintiff has failed to establish error in the proceedings below. The orders appealed from will accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Plaintiff owns a water distribution system, including pipelines extending through land subdivided into some 9,000 building lots, of which only about 935 were occupied and served by plaintiff during the taxable years here involved (1958-1959; 1959-1960). For some reason, perhaps because of the physical distribution of the users\u2019 homes, the entire pipeline system was in service. The lines had been installed by the subdivider at a cost to it of nearly 1.5 million dollars, and at a cost to plaintiff of an additional $78,320. In 1958 the assessed valuation of the pipelines and service connections as set by the assessor was $165,470, and in 1959 it was $167,780.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Over plaintiff\u2019s protests and requests for reduction for each of the two years, the board of supervisors upheld the valuations. Plaintiff then paid the taxes under protest, and brought this action to recover them.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">As shown at the trial, the valuation method employed by the assessor was this: Historical cost of the pipelines was first established, and then reduced for depreciation at the rate of 2% percent per year; because of \u201clow customer density\u201d a \u201climited-use factor\u201d of 50 percent was then applied to 80 percent of the depreciated cost and the resulting figure was added to the other 20 percent of depreciated cost to reach the appraised market value; to this market value the \u201cequalization factor\u201d of 25 percent was applied to produce the assessed valuation of the pipelines and service connections (see fn. 1, <em>ante). </em>The effect of applying the 50 percent \u201climited-use factor\u201d to 80 percent of the depreciated cost was equivalent to reducing such cost by 40 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) is authorized to fix plaintiff\u2019s water rates, but had not yet done so. During the two years in question the rate at which plaintiff sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>water to consumers was substantially less than the rate charged by a comparable water company (Hesperia). In fixing rates, the PUC in practice allows as the rate base upon which the reasonable return to the company is to be computed, only that proportion of the cost of a system represented by the proportion of actual users to the total potential,- i.e., the PUC does not permit the imposition of an undue burden upon actual consumers in order to provide a return on cost of the entire system, nor (in fixing rates) does it allow as an operating cost the proportion of taxes paid on the value of that part of the total system not serving users.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The trial court found that the assessments for the two years were \u201carbitrary, erroneous, invalid, unfair, unlawful and an abuse of discretion\u201d; that the board should have reduced or equalized the assessments; that \u201cAmong other matters, said Assessor and said Board used an improper method of valuation.\u201d Judgment was entered July 18, 1962, canceling the assessments and ordering the board to reassess and equalize the property \u201cusing a proper method of valuation,\u201d and further decreeing that plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the difference between the taxes paid and those found due after reassessment, that the court \u201cshall retain jurisdiction of this action to make such orders as may be necessary or appropriate,\u201d and that plaintiff recover costs of $345.25. Neither the findings nor the judgment fixed or suggested the, or any, \u201cproper method of valuation\u201d to be \u201cused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In August 1962 the board of supervisors held a hearing, received evidence, and again fixed the equalized assessed valuations of the property for the two years at the same amounts as before.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>In October 1962 plaintiff noticed a motion to vacate and annul the board\u2019s findings and order, or, in the alternative, for an order setting the case for retrial on the valuation issue. A hearing was held on November 30, at which the court had before it the minutes of the board (fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>as well as an affidavit of plaintiff\u2019s counsel setting forth the evidence presented to the board at the August hearing. The affidavit stated that plaintiff's evidence (substantially identical with that presented by plaintiff at the previous trial) showed that the valuation should be based upon capitalization of earnings and earning power, that plaintiff\u2019s earnings are limited by the policies and practices of the PUC, and that the value of the property is $100,000 to $150,000. Attached to the affidavit was a statement of the county assessor (which had been presented to the board) declaring that the assessor had considered replacement cost less depreciation, as well as sales analysis and capitalized earning ability of the property; the statement contained information as to the sale of another water company at $373 per service connection which if applied to plaintiff\u2019s situation would have resulted in a price of $516,575; it showed a rate differential of 53 percent in favor of plaintiff\u2019s consumers as compared with those of another similar water company; it contained a \u201cSummation Approach,\u201d setting forth the valuation method originally used by the assessor, including a statement that \u201cThis method indirectly recognizes income in that the absence of income sufficient to support the full cost resulted in an additional 40 per cent discount from the normal\u201d; and it contained a calculation of value based upon capitalization of anticipated income on a net income average over a three-year period, making allowance for only partial use of plaintiff\u2019s facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Following the November 30 hearing the court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion in toto. Its written order relates among other things that testimony at the first trial indicated that the board had received no evidence supporting its first order con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>firming the assessor\u2019s valuations, that the court had noted that defendant had not considered earning power and so had used an erroneous and improper valuation method, that at the second board hearing evidence of earnings and earning power was received and considered. The order contains findings that at the second board hearing earning power was considered, that in the reassessment the board found fair assessed value based upon market value, that despite the same result the board did not use the same method of valuation it had used before, that the board had fully complied with the court\u2019s earlier judgment, and that the court\u2019s special retention of jurisdiction should be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">On appeal plaintiff contends that the board in fixing the same valuation in the reassessment proceedings actually used the same <em>method </em>of valuation and so exceeded its jurisdiction, and that in any event the reassessments are invalid under the principle of res judicata. These contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">As just noted, the court\u2019s order points out and plaintiff does not dispute that at the second board hearing evidence was received in support of the method followed by the board as set forth in its minutes (fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>including evidence of plaintiff\u2019s earnings and earning power. Moreover, as the court specifically found, at the second hearing the board gave consideration to plaintiff\u2019s earning power in equalizing the assessed valuations of plaintiff\u2019s property. The court appears correct in its determination that the board thus employed a different, and approved, method of valuation and had complied with the court\u2019s earlier judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Further, no prejudice to plaintiff seems to be shown. Although when this matter was pending in the trial court plaintiff referred to its rights in the pipelines as \u201cflow rights,\u201d it concedes in its brief on appeal that the value of its rights is the same as the value of the lines themselves. No reason appears why the lines should not be valued and assessed under the same methods applied to other like tangible property. Also, since there is no suggestion that the lines are held in tax-exempt ownership the assessor would not customarily assess the possessory interest in the lines separately from the lines themselves. (See <em>De Luz Homes, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of San Diego </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 546, 563 [10-11] [290 P.2d 544].) Thus there is no merit in plaintiff\u2019s argument that its rights in the lines should be valued by means of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>capitalization of income method approved in <em>Be Luz </em>for the assessment of taxable possessory interests in land held in tax-exempt fee ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\"><em>Guaranty Liquidating Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1937) 22 Cal.App.2d 684 [71 P.2d 931], cited by plaintiff in support of its argument that under the principle of res judicata the board was precluded from reassessing the property at the same amount, following the second board hearing, is not persuasive. Two separate lawsuits were there involved rather than, as here, supplemental proceedings over which the court retained jurisdiction and thereafter determined that the board had complied with the court\u2019s directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The orders appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Traynor, C. J., McComb, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., Peek, J., and Mosk, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b897-9\"> The assessments were made at 25 percent of market value. Thus the market value found for the two years was \u00a7661,880 and \u00a7671,120, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-6\">The board\u2019s minutes, which set forth its written findings of fact, recite that (paragraph IV) the board considered earning power, present and anticipated; that in determining present earning power the board considered the relevant evidence concerning actual past earnings, rate-making practices of the PUG, comparative water rates of comparable water systems, consumer density relative to maximum use of the system, fair rate of return, failure to apply to the PUC for rate increases and all other matters presented relative thereto; that in determining anticipated growth in earnings the board considered prospective growth of the area and the history of growth of the system in number of customers, area and consumer density; that (paragraph V) the board also considered historical cost, reasonable depreciation, extent of use and status of ownership of the physical plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The board specifically found \u201cVI The assessor used, in valuing this system, a method of valuation which started from historical cost, with due allowance for depreciation\u2019\u2019; that (VII) this is the same method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>used \u201cin valuing all of the hundreds of water systems in this County\u201d; that (Till) the assessor\u2019s method \u201ccontained a just and proper allowance for low density of consumers . . . which effectually gave adequate weight to earning power . . . and such method was . . . proper\u201d; that (IX) the assessor\u2019s valuation was fair, just and accurate for the two years involved in this action, but that for the year 1962-1963 (also considered by the board in the same proceeding) the assessor had made an inadequate allowance for low consumer density and for that year the assessment was accordingly reduced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
