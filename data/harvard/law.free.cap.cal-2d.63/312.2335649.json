(d)) and by committing acts of moral turpitude and dishonesty (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6106). The local committee found against petitioner. The Board of Governors agreed with the committee\u2019s findings and recommended a three-month suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">In September 1961 Adell S. Benner retained petitioner, who maintains offices in Hayward, to represent her in an action for divorce against her husband, Elmer E. Benner. In October 1961 petitioner served Mr. Benner with an order to show cause, returnable in Department No. 15 of the Alameda County Superior Court, at 2 p.m. on November 22, 1961. Approximately one week prior to November 22, Patrick Coleman, Mr. Benner\u2019s attorney, telephoned petitioner from Los Angeles and requested a continuance on the ground that he anticipated being in trial in Los Angeles on November 22. Since Mrs. Benner had complained of the delays her two previous attorneys had incurred, petitioner refused the request. On the morning of November 22, Mr. Coleman telephoned petitioner\u2019s office and informed petitioner\u2019s secretary, Mrs. Chapman, that he could not get a plane out of Los Angeles in time for the hearing. He therefore requested a continuance of one week. The evidence, although in conflict, indicates that Mrs. Chapman responded that she could not grant the request but would advise petitioner of it and did not believe there would be any problem. She said that petitioner would telephone Mr. Coleman. She gave petitioner the message about noon, and petitioner responded: \u201cThat is tough. I will make the appearance anyhow.\u201d Petitioner contends that he tried to telephone Mr. Coleman, but that he could not reach him. At 2 p.m., petitioner appeared at the hearing before Superior Court Judge Lyle Cook. Judge Cook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>testified that he normally asks a party whether someone is appearing on the other side, and that he assumes he did on this occasion. Judge Cook recalled that petitioner failed to advise him of Mr. Coleman\u2019s telephone call and the request for a continuance, and thus he treated the case as a default matter. Several days later, Mr. Coleman notified Judge Cook of his request for a continuance, and he replied that he would delay the signing of the order until Mr. Coleman had an opportunity to appear. Judge Cook then conferred with petitioner about the matter and reminded petitioner that he had not informed the court of the request for a continuance. Judge Cook testified that petitioner replied that he didn\u2019t feel he was obliged to. Petitioner, supported by an affidavit by Mrs. Benner,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contends that he did inform Judge Cook of the telephone call. Petitioner concedes, however, that he does not remember what happened at the hearing, and relies on a memorandum he made several weeks later to support his contention that he did inform the judge. Moreover, he does not deny that he told Judge Cook that he did not consider himself obligated to inform the court of the telephone call, although he contends that he also told the judge at the time that he had in fact informed him of the call. Paced with this conflict in the testimony, the board found that petitioner knew of the telephone call, that he did not inform Judge Cook of the call at the hearing, and that he did not inform him that Mr. Benner\u2019s attorney had requested a continuance. Thus, the board found that petitioner \u201cwilfully and deliberately concealed his knowledge that Patrick Coleman represented the defendant and had requested that the matter be continued. [Petitioner] thereby intentionally misled the Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Petitioner contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the findings of fact made by the Board of Governors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201cAlthough the board\u2019s \u2018findings are not binding on this court, which will itself pass upon the sufficiency and weight of the evidence . . . petitioner has the burden of showing wherein the decision of the board is erroneous or unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Linnick </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>62 Cal.2d 17, 19 [41 Cal.Rptr. 1, 396 P.2d 33]; <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>46 Cal.2d 241, 242 [293 P.2d 455].) We have concluded that petitioner has not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Petitioner contends that the failure to convey Mr. Coleman\u2019s request for a continuance does not constitute misleading \u201cthe judge or any judicial officer by an artifice or false statement of fact or law.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6068, subd. (d).) There is no merit to this contention. The concealment of a request for a continuance misleads the judge as effectively as a false statement that there was no request. No distinction can therefore be drawn among concealment, half-truth, and false statement of fact. (See <em>Green </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>213 Cal. 403, 405 [2 P.2d 340].) \u201cIt is the endeavor to secure an advantage by means of falsity which is denounced.\u201d <em>(Pickering </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>24 Cal.2d 141, 145 [148 P.2d 1].)  Moreover, there is no merit to petitioner\u2019s contention that misleading the judge does not constitute an \u201cact involving moral turpitude\u201d condemned by Business and Professions Code, section 6106. (See <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>39 Cal.2d 367, 369 [246 P.2d 931]; <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>State Bar, </em>24 Cal.2d 141, 142-145 [148 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Finally, petitioner contends that the Board of Governors erred in refusing to continue the hearing to obtain transcripts of two proceedings in the <em>Benner </em>case subsequent to the hearing of November 22, 1961. Petitioner did not remember what happened in these proceedings, but hoped that there would be some indication in them that he had informed the court of Mr. Coleman\u2019s telephone call. There is no indication, however, that petitioner could not have obtained these transcripts in advance of his appearance before the Board of Governors or that they would have been sufficient to rebut the evidence against him. Under these circumstances, petitioner was not prejudiced by the board\u2019s refusal to obtain the transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Although petitioner\u2019s conduct warrants censure, we do not believe that a three-month suspension is justified. There is nothing in the record to indicate that petitioner planned to mislead Judge Cook, and his failure to disclose that Mr. Benner was represented by an attorney who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>requested a continuance may have reflected only a spur of the moment decision motivated by an overzealous regard for his client\u2019s interest. With the exception of one private reproval hy the Board of Governors, petitioner\u2019s record as an attorney is without previous blemish. Under these circumstances we conclude that a public reprimand will constitute sufficient discipline. This opinion shall serve as such reprimand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Mrs. Benner says in her handwritten affidavit: \"I remember distinctly that you told the Judge Donald [sic] Cook that your answering service had gotten a phone call at the last minute almost from Mr. Coleman saying they couldn\u2019t get reservations or were afraid they couldn\u2019t get back to L.A. But since you weren\u2019t in the office to get the message the Judge decided to go ahead with the trial.\u201d This affidavit, supplied after petitioner telephoned Mrs. Benner, is at least in part clearly inaccurate. Mr. Coleman talked to petitioner\u2019s secretary, not his answering service, and told her he couldn\u2019t get a plane from Los Angeles, not back to Los Angeles, and the Judge\u2019s name is Lyle Cook, not Donald Cook. Moreover, Judge Cook\u2019s recollection that petitioner was silent about the phone call is in direct conflict with Mrs. Benner\u2019s statement that he proceeded with the hearing because petitioner had not personally received the telephone call.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
