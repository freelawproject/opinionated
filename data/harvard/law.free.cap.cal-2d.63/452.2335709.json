They appeal from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">George Mack died as a result of a knife wound shortly after an affray with defendants on the morning of May 26, 1963. Defendants, residents of Oakland, drove to San Francisco on Saturday, May 25. They visited various parts of the city, ending up at Third and Tehama Streets late on Sunday morning. There they saw Mack whom they knew as a supplier of methedrine. Apparently Mack owed Hendrix some money; defendants attempted either to obtain methedrine from Mack in discharge of the debt or to convince Mack to repay the money that he owed Hendrix. The discussion relating to these matters degenerated into an affray which resulted in Mack\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">The record does not spell out the exact sequence of events. In essence defendants contend that Mack pulled out a knife, that they used their knives only to defend themselves, and that in the struggle which ensued Mack was stabbed. No prosecution witness saw the beginning of the affray. After the stabbing defendants left the scene and returned to Oakland. The following day they turned themselves over to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Defendants contend that the evidence establishes, as a matter of law, that they acted in self-defense; that the trial court erred in instructing the jury in several respects; that certain of the trial judge\u2019s remarks were prejudicial, and that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence statements which were obtained in violation of defendants\u2019 rights to counsel and to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">As we explain below, we conclude that the evidence does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>demonstrate self-defense as a matter of law; we further hold that the trial court prejudicially erred in instructing the jury that it must find defendants guilty of second degree murder if the killing occurred during a conspiracy to obtain methedrine; we finally direct that on retrial the trial court inquire into the circumstances surrounding defendants\u2019 statements to determine whether those statements were taken in violation of the principles enunciated in <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 478 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361]. We need not consider whether the trial court\u2019s remarks to the jury were prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">I. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">We cannot accept defendants\u2019 first contention that the evidence, as a matter of law, establishes that they acted in self-defense. Defendants argue that their extrajudicial statements to the police, which the prosecution introduced at trial, showed that they acted in self-defense and that the prosecution is \u2018 \u2018bound\u2019 \u2019 by these statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Acosta </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 538, 542-543 [290 P.2d 1], we stated the rule for determining if the prosecution is \u201cbound\u201d by extrajudicial statements it introduces: \u201c... if there is prosecution evidence which tends to disprove criminality and other prosecution evidence which tends to prove criminality, it is the function of the trier of fact to determine which version is to be believed. [Citations.]  The courts may sometimes say the prosecution is \u2018bound by\u2019 extrajudicial statements of defendant which are introduced by the prosecution and which are irreconcilable with guilt, but this concept is applicable only where there is no competent and substantial evidence which could establish guilt. [ Citations. ] \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">In this case other \u201ccompetent and substantial evidence\u201d tends to prove that the defendants did not act in self-defense. Admittedly the prosecution introduced no direct evidence which explained how the argument degenerated into physical violence. But from the circumstances, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>fact that both defendants were physically larger men than Mack, the jury could have found that defendants did not kill Mack as a result of their reasonable fear of a present danger of great bodily injury. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 197, subd. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The prosecution\u2019s witness, Mr. Miles, testified that he was about 200 feet from the altercation; that he saw a crowd watching a commotion; that when the crowd backed up he saw Williams kick Mack, who was then \u201csliding down the wall.\u201d Mr. Cotney, standing fairly close to the affray, testified that he saw defendants \u201cscuffling\u201d with Mack and that the defendants \u201chad him down.\u201d He heard Mack say, \u201cI will give it to you.\u201d He also testified that the only knife he saw was in Williams\u2019 hand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Mrs. Ritchie, landlady at the Yukon Hotel, testified that she heard Rose Johnson scream from the street, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two people let this man alone. You are going to kill him. \u201d She later looked down from her window in the hotel and saw, on the sidewalk beneath the window, the defendants on either side of Mack. She stated that they were all standing up and that Mack \u2018\u2018 looked like he was helpless. \u2019 \u2019 She testified she saw a \u201cknife come out like that in a thrust with the blood dripping from it. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Defendants apparently recognize the damaging effect of Mrs. Ritchie\u2019s testimony. They contend that the jury must have rejected her testimony because they did not find defendants guilty of first degree murder under the felony-murder doctrine. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 189.) Although some of Mrs. Ritchie\u2019s testimony tended to show that defendants were robbing Mack, that is not the only inference the jury might have drawn from the evidence. Defendants\u2019 contention must therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">II. <em>Erroneous instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Defendants object to the trial court\u2019s rulings on proffered instructions as to the law of self-defense and on the rendered instructions as to the second degree murder rule; we shall explain why we have concluded that defendants \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>latter contention compels reversal. As to the former we need only state that the court\u2019s instructions on self-defense adequately apprised the jury of the matters which defendants\u2019 suggested instructions sought to present; the court did not err in rejecting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">As to the latter, the trial court instructed the jury that the defendants would be guilty of murder in the second degree if \u201cthe killing [was] done in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate a violation of section 245a of the Penal Code, assault with a deadly weapon, or in the violation of Section 182 of the Penal Code, conspiracy. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This instruction unduly broadens the felony-second-degree-murder rule and does not accord with our recent cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">This court has expressed the nature and extent of the felony-second-degree-murder rule in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 772, 795 [36 Cal.Rptr. 620, 388 P.2d 892]: \u201cA homicide that is a direct causal result of the commission of a felony inherently dangerous to human life (other than the six felonies enumerated in Pen. Code, \u00a7 189) constitutes at least second degree murder. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Poindexter </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 142, 149 [5, 6] [330 P.2d 763] [administering narcotics to a minor] <em>; People </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 196, 205 [7] [208 P.2d 974] [abortion] <em>; </em>cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>McIntyre </em>(1931) 213 Cal. 50, 56 [4] [1 P.2d 443] [drunk driving].)\u201d See also the recent eases of <em>People </em>v. <em>Schader </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 716, 732 [44 Cal.Rptr. 193, 401 P.2d 665], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 777, 780-781 [44 Cal.Rptr. 442, 402 P.2d 130], in which we approved and followed the <em>Ford </em>formulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number> The felony involved in this case, conspiracy to possess methedrine, is surely not, as such, inherently dangerous. The trial court erred, therefore, in instructing the jury it might convict the defendants of second degree murder on the basis of the felony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Furthermore, the erroneous instruction caused prejudice to defendants. Although the jury, even in the absence of the erroneous instructions, would probably not have completely exculpated defendants, it could well have found defendants guilty of voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The record convinces us that, if the court had not given the questionable instruction, the jury would have found defendants guilty of at least some offense. The court adequately instructed the jury on self-defense; the jury\u2019s guilty verdict demonstrated that it did not accept that exoneration. Nor could the jury have exculpated defendants upon the basis of section 195, subdivision 2, of the Penal Code which excuses homicides \u201cupon a sudden combat, when no undue advantage is taken, nor any dangerous weapon used\u201d; defendants, in the combat, here, used knives.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The prejudicial vice of the instruction lay in the fact that it precluded the jury from finding defendants guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The trial judge instructed the jury that \u201cif [the conspiracy to possess methedrine] is being perpetrated and there is a killing in connection with it, it is second degree murder, even though the killing was accidental.\u201d Voluntary manslaughter consists of the unlawful killing of a human being without malice, \u201cupon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion. \u2019' Thus, if defendants had engaged in a conspiracy to possess methedrine and killed Mack only \u201cupon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion,\u201d they would have been guilty of voluntary manslaughter only. Yet, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the instruction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> if the jury found only such a conspiracy, it would have been <em>compelled </em>to find defendants guilty of second degree murder: defendants would have perpetrated a killing \u201cin connection with\u201d the conspiracy to obtain methedrine even though a sudden quarrel or heat of passion propelled the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We cannot say that in the absence of the erroneous instruction it is not reasonably probable that the jury could have concluded that the argument with Mack led to a \u201csudden quarrel\u201d which culminated in his death. Although the evidence clearly showed that defendants were seeking methedrine it did not at all definitely disclose the events that preceded the stabbing. No witness testified to the occurrences before the knifing. Defendants themselves, despite some variations in their statements, continuously maintained that the killing emanated from an argument between Hendrix and Mack.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Moreover, the probability that the jury, if it had been properly instructed, might have reached a voluntary manslaughter verdict rather than that of second degree murder, finds support in the legal fuzziness of the demarcation between second degree murder and manslaughter. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gorshen </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 716, 730, fn. 11 [336 P.2d 492].) Further, in the instant case the jury, toward the end of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>deliberations, asked the court to clarify the difference between second degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. The possibility of a verdict of manslaughter must have been very much present in the minds of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">III. <em>Introduction of defendants\u2019 statements in evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Defendants contend that their statements to the police should not have been introduced as evidence at the trial. They rely on the principles enunciated in <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 478 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361], In <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado, supra, </em>at pp. 353-354, we held that \u201cdefendant\u2019s confession should not properly be introduced into evidence because (1) the investigation was no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but had begun to focus on a particular suspect, (2) the suspect was in custody, (3) the authorities had carried out a process of interrogations that lent itself to eliciting incriminating statements, (4) the authorities had not effectively informed defendant of his right to counsel or of his absolute right to remain silent, and no evidence establishes that he had waived these rights.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">About 9:30 a.m. on May 27, 1963, the day after the killing, defendants phoned the police and told them they were going to turn themselves in.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They arrived at the police station later that morning. Inspectors Sutton and Dyer and an assistant district attorney took Williams\u2019 statement from 11:50 to 12:45. Then Hendrix gave a statement. The rendition of this statement apparently consumed about the same period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Because the defendants\u2019 trial took place before the United States Supreme Court rendered the <em>Escobedo </em>decision the circumstances surrounding these statements were not developed. Since we reverse on other grounds, we need not determine the merits of defendants\u2019 contention on the barren record before us.  On remand, if the defendants object to the introduction of their extrajudicial statements,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>will, of course, consider any evidence which might hear on whether those statements were obtained in violation of defendants\u2019 rights to counsel and to remain silent as enunciated in <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1964) 378 U.S. 478 [84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Dorado </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 338 [42 Cal.Rptr. 169, 398 P.2d 361], and determine if any such violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The judgments are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Traynor, C. J., Peters, J., and Peek, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-10\">As related by Inspector Sutton, who took the statements and testified at trial, defendants' statements varied somewhat in explaining precisely what took place during the affray. In view of the other evidence which tends to disprove their story, however, the variations between defendants\u2019 statements are not crucial. It is arguable, however, that the prosecution is not, in any event, bound in a situation in which the defendants\u2019 statements vary substantially.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Mack\u2019s knife remains somewhat of a mystery. Neither side introduced it into evidence. Inspector Sutton, the only investigating officer to testify, was asked what \u201cpersonal effects\u201d were \u201cfound on Mack\u2019s person when the body was picked up. \u2019 \u2019 He answered that a notebook, some pills and a few pennies were found. He did not mention a knife. He did not arrive at the scene of the crime, however, until about an hour after the stabbing. Mr. Andrews, a defense witness who arrived at the scene sometime after noon, admitted on cross-examination that he did not see a knife at the scene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Taken in context it is clear that the involved conspiracy constituted a conspiracy to possess methedrine without a prescription. Business and Professions Code section 4230 declares unlawful the possession of methedrine without a prescription. A violation of that section is a misdemeanor. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4235.) Conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor is a felony. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b483-9\">This formulation of the second-degree-felony-murder rule has been commended by the commentators (see Moreland, The Law of Homicide (1952) 224; Perkins, <em>A Reexamination of Malice Aforethought </em>(1934) 43 Yale L.J. 537; see also Pike, <em>What is Second Degree Murder in California? </em>(1936) 9 So. Cal.L.Rev. 112, 118-119). (See also Model Penal Code [Proposed Oficial Draft, May 4, 1962] art. 210, especially section 210.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Moreover, as we recently stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 777, 781 [44 Cal.Rptr. 442, 402 P.2d 130), \u201cThe purpose of the felony murder rule is to deter felons from killing negligently or accidentally. ...\u201d This purpose may be well served with respect to felonies such as robbery or burglary, but it has little relevance to a felony which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>is not inherently dangerous. If the felony is not inherently dangerous it is highly improbable that the potential felon will be deterred; he will not anticipate that any injury or death might arise solely from the fact that he will commit the felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Cowan </em>(1940) 38 Cal.App.2d 231, 244 [101 P.2d 125, 135], cited by respondent, is not inconsistent with this conclusion. That case involved a \u201cconspiracy to injure persons and property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b484-10\">In determining whether the trial court properly instructed on felony murder we look to the elements of the felony in the abstract, not the particular \u201cfacts\u201d of the case. If the felony, as such, is not inherently dangerous the trial court should not instruct the jury that it might serve as a basis for a second degree murder conviction. Any implications to the contrary in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pulley </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 366, 373 [37 Cal.Rptr. 376], are disapproved. Of course, we do look to the particular facts of the case in determining whether the instruction prejudiced the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The trial court instructed the jury: \"The essential feature that distinguishes manslaughter from murder in the second degree or from any murder is that in manslaughter the killing be done without malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\"In practical application this means that the unlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice . . . but without a deliberately formed and premeditated intent to kill is murder in the second degree in any of the following cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">\"One, when the killing results from an unlawful act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to human life, which act is deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers the life of another.

It was that defendants murdered George Mack.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">The court instructed on conspiracy, as it did on a killing as a result of a robbery, or of an assault with a deadly weapon, only because during the trial evidence was adduced from which the jury could have concluded that the killing was in perpetration of any one of such offenses. The court instructed upon other possibilities which conceivably found some support in the evidence, such as the theories advanced by the defendants that the killing was the result of self-defense on their part or of an accident. Thus, when the majority conclude that the trial court erred in such instructions, before reversing the convictions of second degree murder they must comply with the constitutional mandate and decide \u2018 \u2018 after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence\u201d (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 4\u00bd) that \u201cthe error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">The majority eschew this test, asserting only that \u201cthe erroneous instruction caused prejudice to defendants\u201d <em>(ante, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>p. 458) and that \u201cWe cannot say that in the absence of the erroneous instruction it is not reasonably probable that the jury could have concluded that the argument with [the victim] led to a \u2018sudden quarrel\u2019 which culminated in his death.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The majority acknowledge \u201cthe evidence clearly showed that defendants were seeking methedrine\u201d but they assert \u201cit did not at all definitely disclose the events that preceded the stabbing. No witness testified to the occurrences before the knifing.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 459.) I submit that it was for the jury to determine whether the evidence definitely disclosed what happened before the stabbing. Certainly, there was direct testimony from eyewitnesses which when weighed with the testimony of the defendants was ample to sustain the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">A review of the evidence shows that defendants conspired in advance to obtain methedrine from their victim and when he resisted the deal they offered him they jointly assaulted him in such a wanton and brutal manner as to result in his death. Both Williams and Hendrix were physically larger and heavier than Mack. So vicious was their assault upon him as to cause bystanders to intercede urging the victim to give defendants whatever it was they were demanding of him. One woman spectator, Rose Johnson, screamed at defendants to let him alone that \u201cYou are going to kill him.\u201d When her repeated screams failed to stop the assault she called to a woman in the hotel at the place where the fight was in progress, a Mrs. Terry Ritchie, \u201cThere is <em>[sic] </em>two hypes down here killing another one. \u2019 \u2019 Mrs. Ritchie, hearing the screams, looked down from her window and observed that the defendants were standing on either side of their victim who was crouched over and \u201clooked like he was helpless\u201d and that she saw a \u201cknife come out like that in a thrust with the blood dripping from it. ... \u201d She telephoned the police. She stated she heard one man say during the fight, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give us the stuff, man! We don\u2019t want to kill you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Another witness testified to hearing the victim say after having been downed on the sidewalk between his assailants, \u2018 \u2018 I will give it to you. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">During the fighting one of the defendants plunged his knife in the victim\u2019s heart. With the victim dying at their feet, these defendants rifled his pockets, accomplished their objective of obtaining some ampules of methedrine and fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>It is not difficult to understand the jury's rejection of the defendants\u2019 claim that the killing was the result of the exercise of their right of self-defense, although neither would admit to intentionally striking the death blow, since even according to a defense witness the victim, although quarrelsome and irritable since his illness, was in such weakened condition that he needed the witness\u2019 assistance, from time to time, in mounting the stairs of his abode.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Defendant Williams corroborated much of the testimony of the eyewitnesses. He acknowledged that Bose Johnson, during the scuffle, urged the victim to give Hendrix \u201canything if you owe it to him\" and later to scream to Mrs. Bitchie to \u201ccome down here, they are down here robbing a man. There is two hypes down here-\u2014there was two hypes down here robbing a man. \u2019' He also testified that during the scuffle a further bystander, one Gilmore, interceded to urge the victim \u201cif you owe the fellow anything why don\u2019t you pay him.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">A city fireman, who came upon the scene, testified that as the victim sank to the sidewalk he saw defendant Williams kick him and that defendants then walked to their car and left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">These brief references to testimony in the record indicate an abundance of evidence to sustain a conviction of first degree murder under the felony murder rule (Pen. Code, \u00a7 189\u2014murder committed during the perpetration of a robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The evidence overwhelmingly sustains the conclusion that defendants\u2019 conduct was unprovoked. Their acts disclosed \u201can abandoned and malignant heart,\" supporting the conclusion that the killing was malicious and thus constituted murder of the second degree. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>215 Cal.App. 2d 341, 347 [30 Cal.Rptr. 280].) Likewise, the evidence warranted the instruction that the killing occurred in the course of an assault with a deadly weapon\u2014both defendants having admitted that they pulled out their knives during the fight\u2014 thus constituting murder in the second degree and fully warranting the instruction given by the judge on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">There remains only the question of error with respect to the judge\u2019s references to a killing which is the result of a conspiracy to obtain methedrine. I respectfully submit that if this constituted error it was hyperteehnical and miniscule when weighed on the scales required of us under the California Constitution (art. VI, \u00a7 4\u00bd).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">I submit further that the leniency of the jury in fixing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>crime at a lesser degree than warranted should not be used as a basis for conjecture that conceivably they might have gone even further and found the offense to be voluntary manslaughter but for the allegedly erroneous instruction on conspiracy. I respectfully submit that a review of the evidence precludes the conclusion that there was a miscarriage of justice. Furthermore, under the test of <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 835 [299 P.2d 243], a review of the entire transcript indicates it is not reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the defendants would have been reached had the errors complained of not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">McComb, J., and Schauer, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court sitting under assignment by the Chairman of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
