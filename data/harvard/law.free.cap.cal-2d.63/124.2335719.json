Even though plaintiff properly received workmen\u2019s compensation benefits since her injury was one \u201carising out of and in the course of the employment\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>(Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600), summary judgment must be reversed because the trial court erred in concluding that the provisions of section 3601 of that code barred any recovery from defendant coemployee in the present civil action for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The undisputed facts show that the employer maintained a parking lot for the convenience of its personnel. <em>At </em>the end of their shift and while plaintiff was walking on the parking lot, she was struck by defendant\u2019s automobile as defendant was preparing to drive away from the plant. Plaintiff was awarded workmen\u2019s compensation benefits under the established rule that \u201cInjuries sustained by an employee while going to or from his place of work on premises owned and controlled by his employer are generally deemed to have arisen out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d <em>(California Cas. Ind. Exch. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>21 Cal.2d 751, 757 [135 P.2d 158].)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Section 3600 (all statutory references are to the Labor Code) states in relevant part that \u201cLiability for the compensation provided by this division, <em>in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person . . . </em>shall, without regard to negligence, exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his employees <em>arising out of and in the course of the employment. </em>...\u201d (Italics added throughout.) It is then provided in section 3601, as amended in 1959 (Stats. 1959, ch. 1189, p. 3275), that \u201c (a) Where the conditions of compensation exist, the right to recover such compensation . . . is . . . the exclusive remedy for injury or death of an employee against the employer <em>or against any other employee of the employer acting within the scope of his employment. . . </em>,\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 3852 then specifies that \u201cThe claim of an employee for compensation does not affect his claim or right of action for all damages proximately resulting from such injury or death <em>against any person other than the employer.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">We must determine whether plaintiff\u2019s action for negligence can proceed against defendant on the assumption that defendant is within the class of \u201cany person other than the employer\u201d as provided in section 3852, or whether the action is barred by the provision of section 3601 that workmen\u2019s compensation is the exclusive remedy \u2018\u2018 against any other employee of the employer acting within the scope of his employment. \u2019 \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Clearly, since section 3601 specifically refers to \u201cany other employee of the employer,\u201d any immunity granted therein must prevail over the more general third party liability retained by section 3852.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Defendant argues that the employee\u2019s immunity from suit for all acts \u201cwithin the scope of his employment\u201d is of identical extent with the employer\u2019s immunity from civil suit for injuries by an employee \u201carising out of and in the course of the employment. \u2019 \u2019 Plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that by use of the term \u201cscope of employment\u201d the Legislature intended to confer upon an employee immunity from suit by coemployees only as to situations where the employee perpetrating the injury acts in the scope of employment in the <em>respondeat superior </em>sense of that term. Essentially, the issue is whether \u201cacting within the scope of his employment\u201d in section 3601 has the same meaning as \u201carising out of and in the course of the employment\u201d in section 3600.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Prior to 1959 when section 3601 was amended, there was no doubt that the common law right of an employee to sue a coemployee for injuries negligently inflicted while on the job (7 Labatt, Master &amp; Servant (2d ed. 1919) pp. 8006-8007), was preserved in this jurisdiction by section 3852. <em>Baugh </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 200, 214 [148 P.2d 633, 152 A.L.R 1043], held that \u201cOur workmen\u2019s compensation laws were not designed to relieve one other than the employer from any liability imposed by statute or common law. \u201d (Accord <em>Lamoreux </em>v. <em>San Diego etc. Ry. Co. </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 617, 625 [311 P.2d 1].) At that time and until 1959, section 3601 merely stated: \u201cWhere the conditions of compensation exist, the right to recover such compensation . . . is . . . the exclusive remedy against the <em>employer </em>for the injury or death.\u201d (Stats. 1937, ch. 90, p. 269.)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">In <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Bonnesen </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 327 [280 P.2d 481], the surviving heirs of an employee killed while riding in his employer\u2019s vehicle driven by a coemployee brought an action against the allegedly negligent coemployee and the common employer. Plaintiffs alleged that the deceased and the driver \u201cwere both acting within the scope of their employment. \u2019 \u2019 Demurrer was sustained as to both defendants, on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive remedy was workmen's compensation. In reversing the judgment as to the allegedly negligent coemployee the court stated: \u201c... we know of no rule prohibiting a suit by one [coemployee] against the other for damages on account of negligence, even though their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>common employer may be protected from such a suit by provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. \u201d The court then expressly construed section 3852, holding the allegedly negligent coemployee to be a \u201c \u2018person other than\u2019 \u201d the employer within the latter section (131 Cal.App.2d at p. 329).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Also relevant to the background of judicial decisions against which the Legislature acted is <em>Towt </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(March 1959) 168 Cal.App.2d 520 [336 P.2d 276], a suit against an officer of plaintiff-employee\u2019s corporate employer for damages sustained by plaintiff as the result of the defendant officer\u2019s allegedly negligent failure to perform certain asserted duties concerning plant safety. Plaintiff collected workmen\u2019s compensation benefits prior to prosecution of the civil action. Judgment of nonsuit was affirmed, but there is some basis in that opinion for concluding that such a supervisory officer, who in a technical sense is also a coemployee, could be liable to the employee (see 168 Cal.App.2d at p. 527 et seq.). Such liability could be passed on to the employer\u2019s general insurance carrier, a result directly contrary to sections 3600 and 3601. (See also <em>Pleasant Talley Lima Bean etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Cal-Farm Ins. Co. </em>(1956) 142 Cal.App.2d 126, 133-134 [298 P.2d 109].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Having considered the foregoing background of judicial decisions, we cannot agree with defendant\u2019s contention that the Legislature intended to exempt from the common law liability retained in section 3852 all employee actions causing harm to coemployees to the identical extent that the common employer is exempted from civil liability because of its provision for workmen\u2019s compensation. The <em>Singleton </em>case involved a coemployee who while acting in the <em>scope of his employment </em>harmed the employee-plaintiff. The asserted liability in <em>Towt, supra, </em>also was for acts of a coemployee allegedly causing harm to the employee while both were acting in the scope of their employment.  The presumption that an overall change is intended where a statute is amended following a judicial decision (45 Cal.Jur.2d 614) is given its full effect if section 3601 as amended is construed to change the law stated in those cases and exempt from civil liability only a coemployee\u2019s actions within the scope of employment, rather than those \u201carising out of and in the course of the employment.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition we are particularly aware that <em>Singleton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>expressly construed section 3852, and that section providing for third party liability was left unchanged by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In distinguishing between the latter two phrases descriptive of employee actions, we note that \u2018\u2018 Conduct is within the scope of employment only if the servant is actuated to some extent by an intent to serve his master.\u201d (Rest.2d Agency, \u00a7 235, com. a; accord <em>Dolinar </em>v. <em>Pedone, </em>63 Cal.App.2d 169, 175 [3] [146 P.2d 237]; see <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Blackman, </em>59 Cal.2d 668, 676 [5] [31 Cal.Rptr. 36, 381 P.2d 916].) Defendant has not attempted to establish that she was still serving her employer when she was in the act of removing her automobile from the parking lot after completing her work shift. As the record now stands it appears that parking in the lot was, instead, a benefit to defendant provided by the employer as an incident of compensation. It is established that injuries received while enjoying the benefits furnished by the employer arise out of the course of the employment <em>(Reinert </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>46 Cal.2d 349, 354-355 [294 P.2d 713]), so that if defendant had been injured in the present accident she could have collected workmen\u2019s compensation.  The express judicial acknowledgment that an injury received while enjoying an incident of employment solely for the benefit of the employee is one arising out of and in the course of employment is a further indication that if the Legislature had intended to immunize employees from suit for their actions in such situations it would not have used in section 3601 the more restricted language \u201cscope of employment.\u201d A similar conclusion was reached in <em>Mclvor </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 128 [33 Cal.Rptr. 740].</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Also, a referee of the Industrial Accident Commission stated in a parking lot case identical on its basic facts to the situation at bar, in accordance with the position advanced in that case by the commission, that the negligent coemployee should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>liable to the injured employee since the coemployee was not engaged in any active service for the employer and hence was not acting in the scope of his employment. The referee reasoned: \u201c [T]he purpose of section 3601 is to make workmen's compensation the exclusive remedy of an injured workman against his employer. That purpose would be defeated if a right of action existed against a fellow employee acting in the scope of his employment in such a way that the fellow employee\u2019s negligence could be imputed to the employer. For that reason workmen\u2019s compensation was also made the exclusive remedy against a fellow workman \u2018acting within the scope of his employment. \u2019 The words \u2018acting within the scope of his employment \u2019 should be construed in the light of the purpose of the section, so as not to extend the immunity beyond <em>respondeat superior </em>situations.\u201d <em>(Motal </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(Oct. 1964) 29 Cal.Comp.Cases 224.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Respondent\u2019s arguments are to the effect that the co-employee\u2019s right of action preserved by section 3852 has been totally repealed by implication from the language of section 3601. Such repeals are not favored, particularly in the absence of a more clear-cut mandate than the language of section 3601.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   \u201c \u2018 Statutes are not presumed to alter the common law otherwise than the act expressly provides. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 280, 290 [268 P.2d 754].)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Judgment for defendant is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Traynor, C. J., McComb, J., Peters, J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., and Burke, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Under section 3601 employees remain liable to coemployees for injuries caused by conduct such as unprovoked physical aggression, reckless disregard for safety, or \u2018 \u2018 calculated and conscious willingness to permit injury. \u2019 \u2019 There is no issue herein as to any liability of defendant under the latter exceptions in section 3601.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\">For an example of a situation where the liability insurance carrier protected itself from such suits by a special policy exclusion, see <em>Rollo </em>v. <em>California State Automobile Assn., </em>159 Cal.App.2d 172 [323 P.2d 531].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\">It is true that on occasion the phrase <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>scope of employment \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em>has been used interchangeably with \u2018' arising out of and in the course of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>employment.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>San Francisco </em>&amp; <em>Sacramento Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>201 Cal. 597, 599-600 [258 P. 86].) However, this court recognized in a leading ease involving workmen\u2019s compensation coverage, <em>Pacific Emp. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>26 Cal.2d 286, 293 [158 P.2d 9, 159 A.L.R. 313], that scope of employment defines a more restricted area of employee conduct than the customary phrase \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d We stated: \"Although this court has not gone so far as to hold that every injury to an employee attending to his duties and within the course of his employment is compensable, it has, in many eases, upheld the allowance of compensation for injuries arising out of acts <em>not strictly within the scope of the employment </em>: returning from lunch [citation] ; drinking wine because of indisposition [citation]; smoking [citation], ...\u201d (See also <em>DeMirjian </em>v. <em>Ideal Heating Corp., </em>112 Cal.App.2d 251 [246 P.2d 51].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Respondent has cited several commentators who state in effect that amended section 3601 abolished an employee\u2019s civil action against a coemployee, except for situations involving wilfulness, intoxication, or other such conduct. (See 2 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (1960), p. 1671; 37 State Bar J. 743, 745; 34 State Bar J. 707; Cont. Ed. Bar, Workmen\u2019s Comp. Practice, \u00a7 19.6.) But none of the latter authorities expressly considered the issue before us prior to making the statements relied upon. Nor was the present issue considered in <em>Lowman </em>v. <em>Stafford, </em>226 Cal. App.2d 31, 38-39 [37 Cal.Rptr. 681]. Numerous out-of-state statutes and eases also are cited (see, e.g., cases cited in 2 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Comp. Law, \u00a7 72.20, and 1964 Supplement, p. 173), but the statutory provisions in the many jurisdictions are too varied to be presently helpful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b156-10\">We also note that the precise meaning of the phrase \u201carising out of the course of employment\u201d has been litigated so frequently as to have been the subject of a law review comment published but a few years before the 1959 amendment to section 3601. (Bianchi, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation: Meaning of the Phrase \u201cArising out of Employment\u2019\u2019 as used in the California Labor Code </em>(1956) 8 Hast.L.J. 49.) In light of the extensive definition of that term it would appear that the Legislature would have employed \u201carising out of the course of employment\u201d in section 3601 if its intent was that argued by respondent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
