We have concluded that such use of the special tax revenues is without authority in the law; accordingly, the writ sought by petitioner junior college district to compel respondent county superintendent of schools to approve and permit the proposed use will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Petitioner came into existence on July 1, 1963. During the 1963-1964 school year it entered into interdistrict attendance agreements with other junior college districts, as authorized by sections 10801 et seq. The agreements provided that junior college students residing in petitioner\u2019s district could attend junior colleges in the other districts, that in consideration therefor petitioner would pay a designated sum per student to such other districts, and that the payments would be made during the next (1964-1965) school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Petitioner\u2019s budget for the 1963-1964 school year included proposed special purpose expenditures totaling $1,647,500 for interdistrict attendance agreements and plant and equipment leases, of which it proposed to raise $729,310 by a special tax, as authorized by section 25541.5,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the remainder by its general purposes tax rate. The special tax was accordingly levied to the extent of $0,185 (although under the statute it could have reached $0,341) and produced the $729,310, which became part of petitioner\u2019s interdistrict attendance fund (No. 75-63), sometimes herein termed the special tax fund. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>balance of the total budgeted for special purposes in 1963-1964 was raised by general purposes taxes. Petitioner\u2019s annual report to the county superintendent of schools, of \u201ccurrent liabilities on June 30, 1964\u201d (i.e., the end of the fiscal year), lists the (apparently estimated) amount of $1,423,700 as a carry-over liability to pay \u201cOther Tuition\u201d debts, consisting primarily of those incurred for the 1963-1964 year under its interdistriet attendance agreements. As will be seen, the obligations under such agreements were not paid, however, until January 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Meantime, for the 1964-1965 school year petitioner had prepared its budget to include $1,183,375 for proposed expenditures for 1964-1965 interdistriet attendance services, of which it proposed to, and did, raise $782,497 by a section 25541.5 special tax (again levying the special tax at less than the authorized rate). This $782,497 had likewise become a part of petitioner\u2019s interdistriet fund (No. 75-63) prior to the January 1965 payment for the 1963-1964 services, and when added to the $729,310 raised by the 1963-1964 special tax, made a total of $1,511,807 in that fund. In January 1965 petitioner then ordered that $1,401,183.11 be paid from such fund to other junior college districts for 1963-1964 inter-district attendance services. Thus the payment for 1963-1964 services exceeded by $671,873.11 the $729,310 raised by the 1963-1964 special tax. Respondent county superintendent of schools thereupon caused a like amount ($671,873.11) to be transferred from petitioner\u2019s general purpose fund (No. 75-01) to its interdistriet attendance fund, thus bringing the payments and the two funds into conformity with petitioner\u2019s 1963-1964 budget. (See \u00a7\u00a7 21101 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">By this mandamus proceeding petitioner seeks to compel respondent (1) to transfer the $671,873.11 back to petitioner\u2019s general fund (and out of the interdistriet attendance fund) so that it will be available for other purposes;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) to examine and approve warrants drawn on the proceeds of the special tax to be levied during the 1965-1966 school year, which warrants are to pay the expenses of interdistriet attendance services performed during the previous (1964-1965) school year. (See \u00a7 21107.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Petitioner pleads that uncertainties in the year services are performed under the interdistrict agreements (i.e., the year of attendance by students), and which continue until after the beginning of the next school year, make impossible the settlement or payment of such accounts during the year of attendance,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that therefore it should be permitted to use section 25541.5 special tax revenues raised in a school year, in payment for interdistrict services of the prior year. This position is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Section 25541.5 (fn. 2, <em>ante) </em>authorizes imposition of the special tax only \u201cby such amounts as will produce the amount proposed to be expended ... as shown by the budget . .. for the current fiscal year, less any unencumbered balances ... at the end of the preceding fiscal year derived from the \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em>special tax. The section then specifically directs that \u201cIf at the end of any school year there remains an unencumbered <em>balance </em>derived from the revenue of the increase in tax rate hereby provided, such balance shall be <em>used exclusively in </em>the <em>following </em>school <em>year for </em>the payment of any obligation incurred under the terms of an <em>interdistricl attendance </em>agreement <em>for such </em>school <em>year.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) This language appears to demonstrate unmistakably the intent of the Legislature that section 25541.5 tax revenues be used first for special purpose obligations incurred in the year the funds are raised, and that any excess not required for such primary use may be used only to meet interdistrict attendance obligations incurred in the following school year. The use of such special tax revenues to pay obligations attributable to a prior school year is thus effectively forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Moreover, petitioner\u2019s argument that the uncertainties mentioned by it (fn. 5, <em>ante) </em>should permit it to use special tax revenues of a particular year in payment of interdistrict obligations incurred in the prior year, is shown to be a <em>non </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>sequitur </em>by the circumstances here. As already related, for the 1963-1964 school year petitioner while levying the special tax at less than the authorized rate actually budgeted and raised (by both special and general taxes) the total sum of $1,647,500 for special purposes (chiefly interdistriet attendance), although the interdistriet attendance expenses for that year turned out to be only $1,401,183.11. It obviously was not embarrassed by lack of funds to meet its 1963-1964 inter-district obligations nor does it claim to the contrary, but seemingly simply attempted to divert certain of the general purposes tax receipts from the special purposes for which they were raised pursuant to the 1963-1964 budget, and to replace them with special section 25541.5 revenues raised during the succeeding (1964-1965) school year. (Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 17202, 20951-20953, 21001, 21051-21053, 21102, 21401-21402.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Petitioner also suggests that sections 20201 et seq. authorize the levying of a special tax in any county in which there is no junior college, to pay the prior year\u2019s tuition charges of students from such county who attend junior college elsewhere, and that therefore petitioner should in like vein be permitted to levy its special tuition tax under section 25541.5 to meet the prior year\u2019s obligations under interdistriet attendance agreements. Suffice it to say that even if petitioner\u2019s construction of sections 20201 et seq. be correct, a point which we do not reach, nevertheless the Legislature has not undertaken to bestow upon junior college districts the authority which petitioner seeks to exercise with respect to its own inter-district tuition tax receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider respondent\u2019s further contention that section 18 of article XI of the state Constitution<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> bars petitioner\u2019s attempted use of this year\u2019s tax receipts in payment of last year\u2019s interdistriet attendance obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The alternative writ heretofore issued is discharged and the peremptory writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Traynor, C.
