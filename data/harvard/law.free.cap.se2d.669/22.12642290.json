We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Factual Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 4 December 2006 plaintiff filed a complaint pursuant to Chapter 50B seeking a domestic violence protective order (\"DVPO\"). The complaint alleged that on 3 December 2006 defendant \"grabbed [plaintiff] by [the] neck and dug into [her] with his fingernails\" and that defendant had physically and emotionally abused plaintiff throughout their forty-eight year marriage. Furthermore, the complaint alleged that defendant had \"several guns\" and had threatened plaintiff with a gun in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Judge Lawrence C. McSwain found that plaintiff had been \"placed in fear of imminent serious bodily injury\" and entered an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   DVPO against defendant. The order prohibited defendant,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   from threatening plaintiff, visiting plaintiff's residence or workplace, and\n   <em>\n    \"possessing, owning, ... or purchasing a firearm for the effective period of th[e] Order.\"\n   </em>\n   (Emphasis added.) However, the order did not specifically direct that defendant surrender his firearms to the sheriff. Guilford County Deputy Sheriff B.K. Henderson served the DVPO upon defendant on 4 December 2006. At Deputy Henderson's request, defendant surrendered seven (7) firearms. The\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   DVPO was dissolved on 13 December 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 5 April 2007, defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Motion for Return of Weapons Surrendered Under Domestic Violence Protective Order. Defendant filed an amended motion prepared by his counsel, which included a listing of the firearms in the Sheriff's custody, on 25 April 2007. The motion was heard on 29 August 2007. The Sheriff was represented by counsel at the hearing and opposed the motion, offering evidence that defendant had been committed to a mental institution in 2004 and arguing that he was thus precluded from receiving the firearms. The trial court entered an order on 31 August 2007 directing the Sheriff to return defendant's firearms. The Sheriff appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. Legal Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the Sheriff argues that the trial court erred by (1) finding that the Sheriff improperly seized defendant's firearms, (2) failing to conduct an inquiry as required by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-3.1(f) before ordering return of the firearms, and (3) ordering the return of the firearms to a person who was prohibited by the law from possessing them. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The appeal of an order for the return of firearms pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-3.1(f)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   appears to be one of first impression. Therefore, our first task is to determine the appropriate standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When the trial court sits as factfinder without a jury: \"it must (1) find the facts on all issues joined in the pleadings; (2) declare the conclusions of law arising from the facts found; and (3) enter judgment accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Stachlowski v.

Findings of fact are binding on appeal if there is competent evidence to support them, even if there is evidence to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Sessler v.

However, rather than comply with the statute and squarely address the only substantive issue raised by the motion, the trial court made findings on the legality of the Sheriff's seizure of the firearms, an issue which was not raised by defendant's motion and on which no relevant evidence was presented.\n   <em>\n    See McDevitt v. Stacy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9366530\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/148/448/#p451\">\n    148 N.C.App. 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=559%20S.E.2d%20201\">\n    559 S.E.2d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205 (2002) (\"[A] pleading must give sufficient notice of the events or transactions which produced the claim to enable the adverse party to understand the nature of it and the basis for it, to file a responsive pleading, and to get any additional information he may need to prepare for trial.\" (Citation, quotation marks and ellipses omitted.)). Indeed, defendant did not challenge the propriety of the Sheriff's seizure of his firearms in either of his two motions for return and as best we can tell from the record, he voluntarily turned them over to the deputy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There was highly persuasive evidence in the record that defendant had been committed to a mental institution in 2004, which under federal law would have precluded defendant from receiving a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4) (2006). Furthermore, there was no evidence in the record to indicate that the seizure of defendant's firearms by the Guilford County Sheriff's Department was illegal. Because the trial court did not make the findings required by the statute, and because the findings that it did make were not raised in the motion and were not supported by any relevant evidence, we reverse and remand in order for the trial court to conduct a proper inquiry as required by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-3.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Judges McGEE and McCULLOUGH concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The Sheriff filed a motion to dismiss this appeal as moot on 06 August 2008 because defendant died during the pendency of this appeal. However, the trial court must conduct the statutorily required inquiry for return of firearms to either the defendant, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-3.1(f), or to a third party, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-3.1(g). The Sheriff must still comply with the provisions of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50B-3.1 in either returning the firearms to defendant's estate or heirs or in obtaining permission of the court for other disposition of the firearms. Thus, because the sheriff continues to hold the firearms, defendant's death does not moot the issue raised in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2.\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    The court shall determine whether the defendant is subject to any State or federal law or court order that precludes the defendant from owning or possessing a firearm.
