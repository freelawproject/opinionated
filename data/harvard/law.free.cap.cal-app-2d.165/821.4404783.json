The complaint charged the defendant with sale of and offer to sell a ticket admitting one to a Los Angeles Coliseum event, conjoining in the charges all the circumstances proscribed within 250 feet of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum \u201cupon and along a public street, sidewalk, alley, and publicly owned park and place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">(1) It is asserted that this a valid police regulation to prohibit the practice of ticket scalping. On its face, the ordinance does not purport to do so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-12\">(a) It makes no distinction between sales of tickets above the quoted price, and those below it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-13\">(b) It makes no distinction between the private individual who passes his 11 spare ticket \u201d to a friend and receives the price while on public property, and those who are doing business of selling tickets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">Appellant\u2019s counsel urges, that under selective enforcement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>this would never happen. It is damning that it could.  \u201cIt does not answer the charge that the act in question is unconstitutional to say that a person clothed with such power may not see fit to use the power. The rule in determining whether the act is in conflict with constitutional guaranties is whether or not the act is broad enough to authorize such unconstitutional act.\u201d <em>(In re Application of Blanc </em>(1927), 81 Cal.App. 105, 113 [252 P. 1053], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Pace </em>(1925), 73 Cal.App. 548, 560 [238 P. 1089].)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">(c) It leaves legal ticket sales or scalping at every club, newsstand, pool hall or other place in the city, and picks out the 250 feet zone for application of the ordinance. In this latter aspect, it is clearly invalid: <em>cf. Justesen\u2019s Food Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Tulare </em>(1938), 12 Cal.2d 324 [84 P.2d 140].</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">(d) The control of amusement ticket sales or resales has been held not to fall within the legitimate scope of municipal police power, in the State of California. Counsel acknowledge the holdings and dicta of <em>Ex parte Quarg </em>(1906), 149 Cal. 79 [84 P. 766, 117 Am.St.Rep. 115, 9 Ann.Cas. 747, 5 L.R.A.N.S. 183], and <em>In re Dees </em>(1920), 46 Cal.App. 656 [189 P. 1050] (to which may be added <em>Tyson &amp; Bro. etc. Offices </em>v. <em>Banton </em>(1926), 273 U.S. 418 [47 S.Ct. 426, 71 L.Ed. 718, 58 A.L.R. 1236]; and later California cases on the basic private right involved: <em>Pollak </em>v. <em>Staunton </em>(1930), 210 Cal. 656 [293 P. 26]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lesser </em>(1932), 123 Cal.App. 489, 493 [11 P.2d 668]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pace, supra, </em>73 Cal.App. 548; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1937), 21 Cal.App.2d 292, 297 [69 P.2d 862]).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Since the case of <em>Ex parte Quarg, supra, </em>149 Cal. 79, it is true that the limits of the police power over the general welfare in price-fixing etc. have been redefined. <em>(Max Factor &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Kunsman </em>(1935), 5 Cal.2d 446 [55 P.2d 177], aff\u2019d. 299 U.S. 198 [57 S.Ct. 147, 81 L.Ed. 122] ; <em>Clemons </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1950), 36 Cal.2d 95, 102 [222 P.2d 439].) But in all of the controversies engendered, while <em>Ex parte Quarg, supra, </em>149 Cal. 79, has been frequently cited, it has never been overruled. The principles here involved are well-stated in <em>State Board of Dry Cleaners </em>v. <em>Thrift-D-Lux Cleaners, Inc. </em>(1953), 40 Cal.2d 436 [254 P.2d 29], both as to the police power, legislative limits, and reasonableness of restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">(2) Appellant\u2019s counsel, conceding the force of the California decisions, has asserted that the ordinance in question was drawn to accomplish the same purpose by emphasizing the municipal control over the place of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>If the ordinance is to be sustained, it must be upon the ground that sale is not prohibited absolutely, but that the place of sale is reasonably restricted. <em>(Cf. Hart </em>v. <em>City of Beverly Hills </em>(1938), 11 Cal.2d 343, 345, 350 [79 P.2d 1080].)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Is it reasonable to prohibit all of the acts specified in the ordinance upon public streets and in public places? These are for the common use of all the people and for all common uses, save those which are restricted in the interests of the public health, safety and welfare; and when restrictions are imposed, there must not be discrimination. In connection with the latter, many considerations apropos of the present controversy are embraced within the dicta of <em>McKay Jewelers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bowron </em>(1942), 19 Cal.2d 595 [122 P.2d 543, 139 A.L.R 1188],</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">It seems patently. discriminatory to hold that sales may be made at a ticket booth on the public grounds, but cannot be made in a single instance from a citizen\u2019s pocket. The former will give rise to the accumulation of crowds, the impedance of passage; the latter would do neither. Peanuts, popcorn, chewing gum, programs, or newspapers could be sold but a ticket cannot. This clearly is the type of discrimination which invalidates an ordinance, whose restrictions must have a reasonable and nondiscriminatory relationship to the public\u2019s right of user of streets and public grounds, and where the classification is not based on any inherent differences relating thereto. <em>(Cf. Justesen\u2019s Food Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Tulare, supra, </em>12 Cal.2d 324.) Conduct of members of the public upon public streets and ways can be regulated, only if there is some valid basis in restricting their activities, in furthering the general public user. If the general public user is not affected one way or the other by the proscribed activity, it cannot validly be proscribed. <em>(McKay Jewelers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bowron, supra, 19 </em>Cal.2d 595, 601, 602, 604-605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The orders sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the complaint are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Bishop, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
