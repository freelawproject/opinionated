J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anr\">By an amended information, defendant was charged with the crime of \u201cpetty theft with a prior conviction of a felony, to wit, forgery of fictitious name, in violation of Section 667,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Penal Code of California, a felony ...\u201d Then follows a statement of the facts constituting the theft and the time and place of defendant\u2019s prior conviction of \u2018 \u2018 forgery of fictitious name, a felony,\u201d and the fact that he served time therefor in the state prison. It was also alleged that defendant had suffered another prior conviction in Illinois for larceny, for which he had served a term in the penitentiary. Defendant was represented by James S. Fitzpatrick, Esq. Upon arraignment, with counsel present, defendant entered a plea of guilty to \u201cthe crime of petty theft with a prior conviction of a felony.\u201d Probation was denied and defendant was sentenced to state prison. No finding was made as to any prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">A plea of guilty is an admission of every element of the offense charged and is a conclusive admission of guilt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>140 Cal.App.2d 618, 622 [295 P.2d 449] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 353, 356 [266 P.2d 566].)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Defendant argues that since the court did not make a finding that either alleged prior conviction was true, and since he did not admit either of them, he was improperly sentenced to the state prison for a felony; that he should have been sentenced at most, to the county jail for a misdemeanor\u2014 petty theft. In making this argument, defendant misconceives the nature of the charge to which he pled guilty and the effect of such plea. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Such a plea is the equivalent of a verdict of a jury. <em>(People </em>v <em>Williams, </em>27 Cal.2d 220, 228 [163 P.2d 692].) After a plea of guilty, it is unnecessary to take any evidence on any of the elements of the crime charged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>121 Cal.App.2d 651, 655 [263 P.2d 850] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitton, </em>112 Cal.App.2d 328, 333 [246 P.2d 60].)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The Legislature, by providing for imprisonment in the state prison, had made a violation of section 667 a felony. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Defendant was not charged merely with petty theft, which is a misdemeanor. Count three of the amended information states that the defendant is accused by the district attorney of \u201cthe crime of petty theft with a prior conviction of a felony, to wit, forgery of fictitious name, in violation of Section 667, Penal Code of California, a felony, committed as follows: ...\u201d Then follows a statement of the facts on which these allegations are based.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The prior felony conviction for forgery of a fictitious name was alleged as part of the substantive offense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>147 Cal.App.2d 477, 480 [305 P.2d 654]; <em>People </em>v. <em>McKinley, </em>2 Cal.2d 133, 135 [39 P.2d 411].) It is clear from the foregoing that defendant was charged with the commission of a felony.  To constitute the crime here charged, two elements must be alleged and established. These are (1) commission of petty theft, and (2) a prior conviction of a felony and service of a term therefor in a penal institution. By his plea of guilty, defendant admitted the facts (that he had stolen the clothing in question and that he had suffered a prior felony conviction for forgery of fictitious name for which he had served time)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which established these two elements, and hence his violation of section 667. Since, by his plea of guilty, defendant admitted his prior felony conviction for forgery of fictitious name, it was unnecessary for the People to present any evidence with respect thereto. It follows that it was not necessary for the court to make any finding on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Defendant also argues that the trial court, by making no finding as to the prior conviction, in effect dismissed or struck the allegations thereof and he was therefore im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>properly sentenced to the state prison for a misdemeanor\u2014 petty theft. There is no merit whatever in this argument. Since defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction for forgery of fictitious name was charged as a part of the substantive offense under section 667 and admitted by his plea of guilty, the court was not called upon, as we pointed out above, to make any finding on that question in order to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Defendant contends also that his constitutional rights were violated in that he was denied due process and equal protection of the laws and that he was twice put in jeopardy for the same offenses. It has been uniformly held that statutes that provide for an increased penalty for subsequent offenses do not result in double jeopardy or cruel or unusual punishment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Millwood, </em>150 Cal.App.2d 154, 155 [309 P.2d 495], involving Pen. Code, \u00a7 644; <em>People </em>v. <em>Quiel, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 674, 680 [157 P.2d 446], involving Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.) Nor do such statutes violate the due process or equal protection provisions of either the federal or state Constitutions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dutton, </em>9 Cal.2d 505, 507 [71 P.2d 218] ; <em>In re Rosencrantz, </em>205 Cal. 534, 537-540 [271 P. 902]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Floth, </em>8 Cal.App.2d 600, 602 [47 P.2d 817]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>136 Cal.App. 201, 209 [28 P.2d 695].)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Ashburn, J., and Herndon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-11\">Penal Code, section 667 reads: \u201cEvery person who, having been convicted of any felony either in this State or elsewhere, and having served a term therefor in any penal institution, commits petty theft after such conviction, is .punishable therefor by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in the State prison not exceeding five years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The prior conviction here alleged was in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County on August 7, 1951.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b303-11\">The unworthiness of defendant\u2019s position is revealed during the course of his personal plea to the trial judge for leniency at the hearing on his application for probation. He then stated in open court: \u201cI just came back from prison. I haven\u2019t been out 2 years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
