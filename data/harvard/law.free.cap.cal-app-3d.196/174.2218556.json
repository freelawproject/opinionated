Analysis *</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">C. <em>Waiver of Rights to a Speedy Preliminary Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">Penal Code section 859b gives a defendant a right to a preliminary hearing within 10 days of arraignment or plea,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> unless the \u201cdefendant personally waives his or her right\u201d or the \u201cprosecution establishes good cause for a continuance.\u201d Defendant argues he did not personally waive this right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>rather counsel did it over his objection. He concludes he was therefore denied his 859b rights and the complaint should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The facts behind this issue are particularly helpful to its resolution. Defendant was arraigned on complaint No. 702871 on June 7, 1985. Because he refused to waive time, the preliminary hearing was set for June 21st. By June 17th two counsel had withdrawn, citing lack of time to prepare. At this point defendant stated he would rather represent himself than waive time.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">On June 18th a new complaint (No. 821342) alleging additional charges was filed. Defendant pled not guilty and again refused to waive time. Attorney O\u2019Neil was appointed on a no-time-waiver basis for the new charges. However, defendant continued to ask for counsel for the June 21st hearing. The magistrate attempted to locate counsel and even gave defendant a partial copy of the yellow pages so he too could try. No attorney would agree to take the case. On June 21st the magistrate indicated he was going to find defendant had given up his right to counsel. Instead the prosecutor suggested she would dismiss and then refile the charges in complaint No. 702871, to see if defendant could get Attorney O\u2019Neil to agree to take the whole case.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Defendant was arraigned on the refiled felony complaint on June 24th. He entered his plea of not guilty on June 26th. Attorney O\u2019Neill, instead of agreeing to take the whole case, asked to withdraw as counsel, claiming a personality conflict had developed between him and defendant. The court refused to allow him to withdraw until Attorney Friedman agreed to take the case. He got defendant to agree to waive his 859b rights until June 28th.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">On June 28th the two complaints were consolidated. At this time defendant again demanded his right to a preliminary hearing within 10 days. However Attorney Friedman asked for more time to prepare, believing he could not adequately represent defendant within this time period given the complexity of the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant refused to waive time to allow him to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>so. After a lengthy discussion the magistrate found that defendant\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel outweighed his statutory right to a preliminary examination within 10 days. The hearing was continued to August 5th.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Defendant subsequently brought a Penal Code section 995 motion to dismiss arguing his rights under section 859b had been violated. The motion was heard on August 2nd and denied. Defendant then sought a writ of prohibition and an order of dismissal in the superior court, and then in the appellate court, all of which were denied. At trial he moved to dismiss on these same grounds, and again the motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Was defendant erroneously denied his right to a preliminary hearing within 10 days?  We recognize that \u201c[S]ection 859b establishes an absolute right in favor of persons in custody charged with felonies to have the preliminary examination commenced within 10 court days after they have been arraigned upon, or entered a plea of not guilty to, the criminal complaint, whichever occurs later . . . .\u201d <em>(Serrato </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 459, 464 [142 Cal.Rptr. 882].) \u201cSection 859b reflects a clear legislative intention to prevent prolonged incarceration prior to a preliminary hearing.\u201d <em>(Landrum </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 1, 12 [177 Cal.Rptr. 325, 634 P.2d 352].) Furthermore, a <em>personal </em>waiver of these rights by the defendant is required or the case must be dismissed. <em>(Irving </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 596, 600 [155 Cal.Rptr. 654].)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">However, we cannot hold that under the above facts the court erred in extending the date for the preliminary hearing. Defendant refused to proceed without counsel, yet the court had been unable to find an attorney who would take the case without a waiver, thereby assuring the necessary time to prepare the case. Three counsel had already withdrawn. The judge himself stated for the record that the discovery matters which would have to be reviewed before the hearing amounted to over 600 pages. Also, counsel wished to find a handwriting expert and hire an investigator. As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Powell </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 107 [115 Cal.Rptr. 109], \u201c[T]he trial court was confronted with the difficult problem of procedurally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>navigating this case to avoid the Scylla of delay and the Charybdis of ineffective and inadequate representation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 148.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Defendant has the right to effective assistance of counsel at his preliminary hearing, this being a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the proceedings. <em>(Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 1, 11 [26 L.Ed.2d 387, 397, 90 S.Ct. 1999].) And counsel must actually be prepared and effective. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fontana </em>(1982) 139 Cal.App.3d 326 [188 Cal.Rptr. 612].) Defendant also has a right to a speedy trial and section 859b implements this right. (Cf. <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 83, 88-89 [106 Cal.Rptr. 786, 507 P.2d 90].) If the time period is violated the information must be dismissed. <em>(Landrum </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at p. 6.) However, defendant\u2019s statutory rights are \u201c \u2018merely supplementary to and a construction of the Constitution. [Citations.]\u2019 They do not carry the force of weight of constitutionally mandated imperatives.\u201d <em>(Townsend </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 774, 781 [126 Cal.Rptr. 251, 543 P.2d 619].) We therefore hold that when a defendant asserts both his right to a preliminary hearing within 10 days and his right to counsel, the constitutional right must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">No court has addressed this precise issue in the context of section 859b. However, we find support for our position in <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 221 [141 Cal.Rptr. 884], which managed to avoid the \u201cmandatory\u201d language of section 859b.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In <em>Curry </em>the appellate court was faced with an issue analogous to the one here. Defendant wished to <em>waive </em>his right to counsel. The trial judge was concerned with defendant\u2019s competence to make this election and felt a psychiatric examination was necessary. He therefore extended the time for the preliminary hearing beyond the 10-day limit, balancing the need for a knowing and intelligent waiver against defendant\u2019s rights under the statute. The appellate court agreed with the trial judge\u2019s decision, stating the time necessary to determine defendant\u2019s mental capacity was to be excluded in computing the 10 days. The court went on to state \u201cWithout the rule we announce herein tolling the 10-day period, the results are potentially ludicrous. As an extreme example, a defendant in custody could wait until the tenth day to make a motion for self-representation, leaving the court without adequate time to conduct a hearing and make a ruling on the Faretta<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> motion. To hold that Penal Code section 859b requires discharge of the defendant in such a case would be disastrous in an already overloaded criminal justice system. Penal Code section 859b must therefore be subordinated to the constitutional right of self-representation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 226.) The result would be equally ludicrous if defendant could play his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>right to effective assistance of counsel against his statutory right to a preliminary hearing within 10 days. Furthermore, a more serious violation of defendant\u2019s rights would result if defendant had a preliminary hearing within 10 days but failed to have effective representation at that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Defendant relies on <em>Irving </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d 596. However, we find that case to be distinguishable. There the prosecution was not ready to proceed and defense counsel, over his client\u2019s objection, agreed to a continuance. The court did not have before it a conflict between defendant\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights. (See <em>Serrato </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.3d at p. 464, fn. 3 recognizing \u201cthe mandatory 10-day period of section 859b could be tolled because of a constitutional requirement as was the case in <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 221, 225-226 [141 Cal.Rptr. 884].\u201d) Also here the prosecution was at all times ready to go ahead with the hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Further support is found in those cases dealing with this issue in the context of Penal Code section 1382. This section provides that a defendant must be brought to trial within 60 days after the finding of the indictment or the filing of the information, unless he requests a later date, <em>impliedly or expressly gives his consent, </em>or fails to appear. Although these cases do not deal with section 859b which requires a <em>personal </em>waiver, their reasoning seems applicable because they address the situation in which the express consent of the defendant was not given, and thus a balancing of his rights was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">For example, in <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 774, defendant refused to \u201cwaive time\u201d and demanded he be brought to trial within 60 days. However, his counsel requested continuances to adequately prepare because of calendar conflicts. The Supreme Court held the court did not err in granting the continuances over defendant\u2019s objections, but cautioned that its holding was \u201ccarefully circumscribed.\u201d The court went on to state, \u201cWe do not suggest that counsel possesses carte blanche under any and all conditions to postpone his client\u2019s trial indefinitely. Counsel\u2019s power in this regard is not unlimited. \u2018[A] criminal defendant may not be deprived of a speedy trial because the prosecution\u2014or the defense\u2014is lazy or indifferent, or because the prosecution seeks to harass the defendant rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>than bring him fairly to justice . . . <em>(Id. </em>at p. 784.) This reasoning was then applied in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 762 [161 Cal.Rptr. 249] in which the court concluded \u201c[U]nder proper circumstances counsel\u2019s inability to prepare for trial may be an adequate justification for a continuance even in the face of the defendant\u2019s urging of an earlier trial date.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 770.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">This issue was addressed again in <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255]. There the Supreme Court limited the reach of <em>Townsend </em>and concluded that counsel cannot postpone a trial date over defendant\u2019s objection merely to resolve a calendar conflict. (See also <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 15, 24 [167 Cal.Rptr. 608].) However, it reaffirmed that such action would be permissible if defense counsel was \u201c \u2018pursuing his client\u2019s best interests in a competent manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at p. 567.) (See also <em>Eshaghian </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 1070 [214 Cal.Rptr. 712].) The court also reiterated its statement in <em>People </em>v. <em>Floyd </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 694, 707 [83 Cal.Rptr. 608, 464 P.2d 64] (overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 [148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748]) that \u201c \u2018. . .a criminal defendant may not juggle his constitutional rights in an attempt to evade prosecution. He may not demand a speedy trial and demand adequate representation, and, by the simple expedient of refusing to cooperate with his attorney, force a trial court to choose between the two demands, in the hope that a reviewing court will find that the trial court has made the wrong choice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 570, fn. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In the present case counsel was not attempting to postpone the hearing indefinitely, but merely for 30 days. Nothing in the record suggests he was being \u201clazy or indifferent.\u201d Rather he was \u201cpursuing his client\u2019s best interests in a competent maimer.\u201d Nor is this a case in which the prosecution was attempting to stall. The People were ready to proceed at all times. Lastly, defendant was putting himself in a situation in which either choice invited error  By continuing to request counsel defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing within 10 days.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>D.-K.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The two misdemeanor counts of contracting without a license regarding Alex Sandler and Robert Novelli are stricken from the judgment.

I mean, I could sit here and go through a hearing tomorrow not knowing what I am doing.
