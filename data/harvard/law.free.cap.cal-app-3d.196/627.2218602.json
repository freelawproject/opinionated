C</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Teachers are placed in a column according to their level of academic preparation and proceed up the steps as they accumulate years of service. In 1968, a board of education resolution established \u201ca career increment (equal to a normal increment) after three complete school years at the maximum salary (Rating 12 Classification III).\u201d In 1974 a second such increment was added, and in 1981, a third. The 1983-1986 collective bargaining agreement added to section 18.3.2 the provision that \u201cIn accordance with past practice a member of the bargaining unit who has completed rating 11 or higher of Column B7 and becomes eligible for Column B8 shall be entitled to placement at rating 12 of Column B8.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The underlying issue in all five cases consolidated herein is placement at column B8, step 12 of teachers who acquire 60 semester hours of academic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>credit after reaching column B7, step 12 or 13. In four cases the issue was brought before an arbitrator, whose award the trial court confirmed. In the fifth case, the association petitioned for a writ of mandate which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">*</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">I-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In June 1984, the association petitioned for a writ of mandate compelling reclassification of teachers moved from column B7 to column B8, allegedly in violation of Education Code section 45028, both before (first cause of action) and during (second cause of action) the term of the 1983-1986 collective bargaining agreement. The trial court found the district\u2019s placement practice did not violate section 45028\u2019s uniformity requirement. Additionally, as to the second cause of action the court found Government Code section 3543.2, subdivision (d), and section 18.3.2 of the collective bargaining agreement superseded section 45028. Finally, the court found the res judicata effect of its own same-day confirmation of the Randall arbitration award barred the second cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The association contends the trial court erred in holding the district\u2019s salary schedule placement policy complied with Education Code section 45028. Questions of law such as construction and applicability of the statute <em>(Dean W. Knight &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Transportation </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 300, 305 [202 Cal.Rptr. 44]), though beyond the scope of review of the related arbitration awards <em>(City of Oakland </em>v. <em>United Public Employees </em>[(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 356 at pp. 363-364 (224 Cal.Rptr. 523)]), are appropriately addressed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">In the lead case of <em>Palos Verdes Faculty Assn. </em>v. <em>Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 650, 661 [147 Cal.Rptr. 359, 588 P.2d 1155], the Supreme Court held the 1969 amendment of Education Code section 45028 (then 13506) \u201chad the twofold purpose of (1) <em>requiring </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>teachers be classified for salary purposes, and (2) establishing that such classification proceed <em>wholly </em>on a uniform basis of years of training and years of experience.\u201d (Italics in original.) However, while the Legislature expressly intended \u201c \u2018to establish <em>a uniform base salary schedule </em>in each school district,\u2019\u201d it did not intend \u201c\u2018to limit a school district governing board in developing <em>pay incentive </em>programs.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 658, quoting Stats. 1969, ch. 1314, \u00a7 3, p. 2651, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Thus, the <em>Palos Verdes </em>court interpreted the amended statute to allow a district\u2019s attempt to improve its staff\u2019s academic attainment level by setting up \u201cspecial salary categories for those undertaking advanced training.\u201d <em>(Palos Verdes, supra, </em>at p. 660, fn. 5, citing <em>San Diego Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 758 [31 Cal.Rptr.146].) \u201cBy the same token no conflict would occur should a district decide to subclassify its top \u2018experience\u2019 classification in order to encourage the retention or recruitment of extremely experienced teachers.\u201d <em>(Palos Verdes, supra, </em>at p. 660, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Nor does the statute preclude establishment of maximum credit for outside experience, so long as it is applied uniformly to all teachers, regardless of their seniority within the system. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 661, fn. 6, distinguishing <em>Lawe </em>v. <em>El Monte School Dist. </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 20 [72 Cal.Rptr. 554].) \u201cBy the same token, we do not read the new statute to preclude a district from making reasonable determinations as to the level and quality of \u2018training\u2019 or \u2018experience\u2019 which is to qualify for particular level of credit within its boundaries.\u201d <em>(Palos Verdes, supra, </em>at p. 661, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The trial court in the instant case found \u201cRespondent has decided \u2018. . . to sub-classify its top \u201cexperienced\u201d classification in order to encourage the retention or recruitment of extremely experienced teachers,\u2019 \u201d as expressly allowed by <em>Palos Verdes, supra, </em>at page 660, footnote 5. The court also noted \u201cthe core requirement of Education Code section 45028 is that the rules or standards for movement, particularly those contained in the collectively negotiated agreement, be applied uniformly to all teachers in the district, <em>as they are here.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Here, however, the subclassifications are not uniformly applied. According to the district, \u201cCareer increments were intended as a \u2018bonus\u2019 to highly trained teachers who had been serving the District for years.\u201d But the district\u2019s practice distinguishes\u2014among equally highly-trained teachers, who have served the district an equal number of years\u2014on the sole basis of the order in which years of training and years of service accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>As the court explained in <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 826, 830-831 [181 Cal.Rptr. 432] (hereinafter <em>Whittier), </em>such a distinction may well be \u201ca reasonable salary classification made in order to encourage teachers to obtain additional educational credits early in their careers and thereby give more students the benefits of the teachers\u2019 increased education.\u201d However, the <em>Palos Verdes </em>court specifically concluded \u201cone of the lawmakers\u2019 aims in enacting the [1969 amendment] was to break away from past reliance on judicial assessments of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 in the classification of teachers and establish a more certain standard of its own.\u201d <em>(Palos Verdes, supra, </em>at p. 661.) Thus, like the <em>Whittier </em>court, we are \u201cconstrained by the requirement of \u2018uniform allowance . . . for . . . years of experience\u2019 . . . and must look only to whether District\u2019s rule precludes teachers from receiving credit for experience solely due to their seniority within the system.\u201d <em>(Whittier, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.3d at p. 831.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">And here, as in <em>Whittier, </em>it does. \u201cThe rule places teachers in a similar position to the teacher in <em>Lawe </em>v. <em>El Monte School Dist., supra, </em>267 Cal.App.2d 20, a position disapproved in <em>Palos Verdes. </em>Under District\u2019s rule, just as in <em>Lawe, </em>a teacher\u2019s failure to take the additional education credits (in <em>Lawe, </em>the leave of absence) by the time he or she reaches a certain level of seniority with the system results in the denial of credit for experience to which he or she would otherwise he entitled. Therefore, District\u2019s rule does not provide \u2018uniform allowance . . . for . . . years of experience,\u2019 as required by Education Code section 45028.\u201d <em>(Whittier, supra </em>129 Cal.App.3d at p. 832.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Although the salary schedule in <em>Whittier, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.3d at page 828, differs in certain details from the one considered here\u2014every column contains more steps than the one before and additional steps are not labeled \u201ccareer increments\u201d\u2014the court\u2019s reasoning applies here as well. On the other hand, <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 476 [165 Cal.Rptr. 655], which upheld a collective bargaining agreement provision granting annual advancement to the next step on the salary schedule only to teachers who received satisfactory performance evaluations, is easily distinguishable. As the court later explained, \u201cEssentially, that holding was premised upon the conclusion that it was logical to define experience as satisfactory experience.\u201d <em>(Wygant </em>v. <em>Victor Valley Joint Union High School Dist. </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 319, 329 [214 Cal.Rptr. 205]. See also, <em>Palos Verdes, supra </em>21 Cal.3d, at p. 661, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">It is not logical, however, to define experience as \u201cexperience in a certain column of the salary schedule,\u201d since a teacher\u2019s duties, e.g., lesson preparation, classroom instruction, grading, parental counseling, supervision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>extracurricular activities (Wygant, <em>supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at p. 327), do not vary in accordance with placement on the salary schedule. In <em>Wygant </em>the court invalidated a program requiring teachers receiving vertical step advancement to complete a specified number of \u201cprofessional growth units\u201d for each four years, because \u201cteachers with uniform years of training and years of experience are impermissibly penalized by being denied credit for experience for failure to obtain professional growth units that are not <em>necessarily </em>related to either training or professional experience,\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 329, italics added) despite the \u201csubjectively arguable benefit\u201d of what the court called an \u201cadmirable . . . attempt to broaden teachers as human beings.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 328.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Thus the district\u2019s placement policy violates the uniformity requirement of Education Code section 45028 as interpreted in <em>Palos Verdes </em>and its progeny.  The trial court also erred in holding Government Code section 3543.2, subdivision (d) supersedes section 45028 as to the association\u2019s second cause of action. On its face subdivision (d) \u201chas eroded the mandatory rigidity\u201d of section 45028 only to the extent of allowing <em>\u201cadditional compensation </em>based upon criteria <em>other than </em>years of training and years of experience.\u201d (Italics added.) For example, <em>Wyganfs </em>professional growth policy employs criteria \u201cother than years of training and years of experience,\u201d e.g., attendance and participation in conferences, workshops or forums, travel, organizational leadership, publication, business experience <em>(Wygant, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at p. 326), although it does not provide \u201cadditional compensation\u201d therefore.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">As another example, Government Code section 3543.2, subdivision (d), would allow a negotiated one-time <em>equal </em>distribution among all teachers (regardless of years of training and years of experience) of \u201cextraordinary funds\u201d (e.g., lottery receipts) as a bonus <em>in addition </em>to the remuneration authorized by the base salary schedule, notwithstanding Education Code section 45028. (69 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 268 (1986).) By contrast, the policy at issue here satisfies neither the \u201cadditional compensation\u201d nor the \u201cother criteria\u201d prong of Government Code section 354212, subdivision (d), and is thus governed by Education Code section 45028.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Finally, the trial court\u2019s simultaneous confirmation of the Randall arbitration award has no res judicata effect since it does not constitute a final judgment on the merits of the issue presented by the writ petition: whether the district\u2019s placement policy violates Education Code section 45028. <em>(Sartor </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 322, 327 [187 Cal.Rptr. 247].) A judgment is not final while an appeal is pending or until the time for appeal has expired. (7 Witkin Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Judgment, \u00a7 212, p. 649.) Nor would our later affirmance of the trial court\u2019s judgment confirming the award constitute a judgment on the merits, since the arbitrator\u2019s construction of the relevant statutes was not reviewable by either the trial court or this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The anomolies produced, insofar as placement of individual teachers on the salary schedule is concerned, by affirming the arbitration awards and reversing the judgment denying mandamus result unavoidably from the posture in which these cases were brought before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The judgments confirming each of the four arbitration awards are affirmed. The judgment denying the writ of mandate is reversed and the matter remanded with directions to issue a writ compelling the district to place certificated employees on its salary schedule in compliance with Education Code section 45028 as construed herein, with appropriate backpay and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Low, P. J., and Haning, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b570-11\">See footnote <em>ante, </em>page 627.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Contrary to the association\u2019s assertion, <em>Wygant </em>did not hold unlawful \u201ca salary placement policy very similar to the District\u2019s in the instant case.\u201d As it happens, the salary <em>schedules </em>in both <em>Mayer </em>and <em>Wygant </em>are similar to San Francisco\u2019s in that they apparently premise vertical movement beyond a certain step on a given number of years\u2019 service at the prior step. <em>(Mayer, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.3d at p. 479, <em>Wygant, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at p. 325.) However, the salary placement <em>policy </em>governing movement from the last step of one column to the next column was not even at issue in those cases and remains unknown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The <em>Wygant </em>court expressly omitted consideration of Government Code section 3543.2, subdivision (d). <em>(Wygant, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at pp. 323, fn. 1, 328, fn. 2.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
