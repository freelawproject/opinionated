Myers and National Farmers Union Property and Casualty Company appeal from a declaratory judgment rendered against them by the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota. The district court held that the automobile liability policy issued by plaintiff, Western Casualty and Surety Company, to Theodore R. Myers, Randall\u2019s father, does not provide coverage for injuries sustained by Randall in a July 23,1976, accident. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">Western Casualty and Surety Company issued an automobile liability policy, effective from September 5, 1975, through September 5, 1976, insuring a 1966 Chevrolet owned by defendant Theodore R. Myers. Under the policy, the Company is obligated to pay when the <em>insured </em>becomes liable for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the automobile. The word \u201cinsured\u201d is defined in the omnibus clause of the policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag7\">[T]he unqualified word \u201cinsured\u201d includes the named insured and, if the named insured is an individual, his spouse and also includes <em>any person while using the automobile </em>and any person or organization legally responsible for the use thereof, provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named insured or spouse or with the permission of either. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">On July 23, 1976, Randall Myers took the insured automobile to the premises of Dodge Towne, Inc., a commercial garage located in Devils Lake, North Dakota, to perform certain mechanical work on it with the help of Harley J. Crawford. Harley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Crawford is the son of John Crawford, owner of Dodge Towne. Harley was an employee of Dodge Towne, and had his father\u2019s permission to use the facilities of the garage for his personal purposes. Myers was allegedly injured while he and Crawford were repairing the insured vehicle. Myers brought suit against Crawford in state court, alleging <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">That * * * defendant * * * Crawford, knew or should have known that parts of the premises of Dodge Towne, Inc., and certain of the tools and equipment therein were dangerous and unsafe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">IV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">That on * * * the 23rd day of July, 1976, * * * Crawford, who had access to the premises during evening hours and after the close of usual business hours, invited * * * Randall Myers to Dodge Towne, Inc., for the purpose of repairing or mechanically altering an automobile owned by the defendant, Hal Crawford, and for the purpose of gratuitously repairing or mechanically altering plaintiff\u2019s automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">V.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">That plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was placed on a hydraulic hoist, and lifted above the floor and that * * * Crawford * * * improperly positioned two metal stands under the rear of the frame of said vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">VI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">That at all times, such use of said metal stands was dangerous and was known or should have been known by defendant to be dangerous and that unknown to plaintiff * * * Crawford had negligently, carelessly and recklessly positioned the hoist and metal stands beneath plaintiff\u2019s vehicle and thereafter * * * Crawford, negligently operated said hoist in lifting plaintiff\u2019s vehicle off the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-15\">VII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-16\">That as a direct and proximate result of defendant\u2019s negligence, * * * plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was caused to fall off the hoist and metal stands onto plaintiff\u2019s body and permanently injuring plaintiff and trapping him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">Western Casualty and Surety Company subsequently filed this diversity suit in federal court, seeking a determination that it was not obligated to defend Harley Crawford in the state court action or to pay any judgment entered against him. The case was tried to the court on stipulated facts; the Myer\u2019s state court complaint was a part of the stipulation. Judgment was entered for Western Casualty.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-18\">The issue before us on appeal is whether the district court correctly decided that Harley Crawford was not \u201cusing\u201d the automobile with the permission of the named insured and was, therefore, not an \u201cinsured\u201d under Western Casualty\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court concluded that at the time of the accident, Harley J. Crawford was \u201cmaintaining\u201d or \u201crepairing\u201d the insured vehicle. It held, in accord with a line of cases from foreign jurisdictions, that such activities do not constitute \u201cuse\u201d of the vehicle. <em>See Yandle v. Hardware Mut. Ins. Co., </em>314 F.2d 435, 437 (9th Cir. 1963); <em>Commercial Standard Ins. Co. v. Bacon, </em>154 F.2d 360, 364 (10th Cir. 1946); <em>Graf v. Bloechl, </em>36 Wis.2d 635, 154 N.W.2d 340, 343 (1967); <em>Frye v. Angst, </em>28 Wis.2d 575, 137 N.W.2d 430, 434 (1965); <em>Gullickson v. Western Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>17 Wis.2d 220, 116 N.W.2d 121, 124 (1962). The court acknowledged that there was no North Dakota law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>directly on point, but considered its result consistent with the North Dakota Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cuse:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">\u201c[U]se,\u201d to result in liability on the part of the insurance carrier, must be such use as arises out of the inherent nature of the automobile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><em>Norgaard v. Nodak Mutual Ins. Co., </em>201 N.W.2d 871, 874 (N.D.1972). The district court determined that the inherent use of an automobile is its operation in the providing of transportation, not its repair in a garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">We believe that our decision should be no broader than necessary to decide the case before us. Thus, we do not consider it necessary to limit the term \u201cuse\u201d to the actual operation of a vehicle in the providing of transportation. As we have noted, the term \u201cuse,\u201d when used in an omnibus clause such as the one involved in this case, is a word of broad import. The courts have properly refused to read \u201cuse\u201d in any narrow sense such as \u201cmechanical operation\u201d or \u201cwhile driving,\u201d but have accorded the term \u201cflexible and unabsolute content as occasion has arisen to evaluate [it] in the light of the circumstances of varying factual situations.\u201d <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Steenberg Construction Co., </em>225 F.2d 294, 297 (8th Cir. 1955). It is sufficient for purposes of this appeal to hold that, under the factual circumstances alleged in the Myers\u2019 complaint, the North Dakota court would find that Harley Crawford was not \u201cusing\u201d the insured vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">According to the allegations of Myers\u2019 complaint, the accident that caused his injuries occurred while the insured vehicle was in a commercial garage for repairs. Although Crawford\u2019s assistance in the repair work was gratuitous, he was an employee of the garage and had his father\u2019s permission to use the facilities at all times. The car had come to rest on the hoist and metal stands. The motor was not engaged and no one was behind the wheel of the vehicle. The negligence alleged did not relate to work actually done to the vehicle itself, but rather involved the use of the garage equipment. Under these circumstances, the district court correctly concluded that Harley Crawford was not \u201cusing\u201d the Myers\u2019 vehicle at the time of the accident and, therefore, is not an \u201cinsured\u201d entitled to coverage under the policy issued to Theodore Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">The cases cited by the appellants do not persuade us to the contrary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Board v. Clifton, </em>117 N.J.Super. 5, 283 A.2d 350 (1971), the court did not reach the question of whether the permittee was \u201cusing\u201d the insured vehicle at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, the negligent activity alleged in <em>Clifton </em>could more reasonably be considered \u201cuse\u201d of the insured vehicle. The accident in <em>Clifton </em>apparently occurred while the vehicle, which had been left at a service station for repairs, was being guided to a hydraulic lift. It had not come to rest and the repair work was not in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\"><em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. O\u2019Rourke, </em>122 N.J.Super. 68, 298 A.2d 725 (1973), is also factually distinct. In that case, the insured vehicle stalled as the insured\u2019s spouse was driving home. Two residents of the neighborhood attempted to restart the vehicle by priming the carburetor. An explosion occurred, injuring the insured\u2019s son. The court held that the attempt to restart the engine was a \u201cuse\u201d of the automobile within the meaning of the standard omnibus clause. That holding is not inconsistent with our present ruling. In this case, the repairs were not made in order to resume an interrupted journey. We express no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>view as to whether repair work clearly incident to continued travel would be \u201cuse\u201d of an insured vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">To the extent that these and other cases cited by the appellant indicate that any repair of a vehicle constitutes \u201cuse\u201d of the vehicle, we feel that the results reached would not be followed by the North Dakota court. We note that since this is a diversity case, governed by North Dakota law, the opinions of an experienced local district judge with respect to that law are entitled to great weight. <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Samson, </em>596 F.2d 804, 807 (8th Cir. 1979). The judgment for Western Casualty is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-12\">. The parties have stipulated that defendant Randall Myers had the permission of Theodore Myers to operate the insured vehicle and, therefore, is an insured under the policy. Randall Myers, as permittee, could allow a third party to use the named insured\u2019s automobile without precluding coverage under the omnibus clause if the second permittee (here, Harley Crawford), in using the vehicle, was serving some purpose of the original permittee. <em>See American Motorists Ins. Co. v. Samson, </em>596 F.2d 804, 808 (8th Cir. 1979); <em>National Farmers Union Property &amp; Cas. Co. v. Lukins, </em>329 F.2d 564, 565-566 (8th Cir. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">. Much of the case law cited by the parties construes the phrase \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the automobile.\u201d This phrase describes the accidents for which coverage would be afforded an <em>insured </em>under the policy. Since we hold that Crawford was not an insured of Western Casualty, we do not reach the question of whether Myers\u2019 injuries \u201carose out of\u201d a covered activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"acq-dedup-0\">. The court held that an exclusionary clause denying coverage to a permittee using a vehicle \u201cwhile employed or otherwise engaged in the automobile business\u201d was an invalid attempt to limit the insured\u2019s protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
