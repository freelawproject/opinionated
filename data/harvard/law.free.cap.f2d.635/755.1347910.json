Having considered the response, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">After Paul Arendt, an employee of Combustion Engineering, Inc., brought this suit for bodily injuries alleging negligent conduct by defendants United Power Association, Cooperative Power Association, and others, these defendants filed a third-party complaint for contribution or indemnity against Combustion Engineering and Wallace Power Company, two of the subcontractors on the project on which Arendt was injured. Wallace Power Company, in turn, cross-claimed against Combustion Engineering, alleging that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-10\">[t]he plaintiffs damages, if any, were caused and contributed to by Combustion Engineering, Inc., under circumstances that entitle Wallace Power Company to recover by way of contribution or indemnity, as the law allows, against Combustion Engineering, Inc., in the event that the third party plaintiffs obtain judgment against Wallace Power Company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ar7-dedup-0\">On a motion for summary judgment, the district court dismissed all claims for contribution against Combustion Engineering. Wallace Power Company appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">In its response to this court\u2019s show cause order, Wallace Power relies on the <em>Cohen </em>rule, as discussed in <em>Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, </em>417 U.S. 156, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974), and <em>Federal Trade Commission v. Texaco, Inc., </em>517 F.2d 137 (D.C. Cir. 1975), as establishing its right to appeal the merits of the district court\u2019s order. The <em>Cohen </em>rule makes appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 certain orders that do not fully and finally determine the controversy between the parties. <em>See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949); 9 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 110.10, at 133 (2d ed. 1980). Wallace Power asserts that because its only claim against Combustion Engineering was a claim for contribution and the order granting partial summary judgment has eliminated that claim, this court should afford the finality requirement of a practical rather than technical construction and decide the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">Initially, we note that under the <em>Cohen </em>rule an order must bear three characteristics before it can qualify as a \u201cfinal decision:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-14\">(1) the order must be a final determination of a claim of right \u201cseparable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action;\u201d (2) it must be \u201ctoo important to be denied review,\u201d in the sense that it \u201cpresents a serious and unsettled question\u201d; and (3) its review cannot, in the nature of the question that it presents, await final judgment because \u201c[w]hen that time comes, it will be too late effectively to review the . . . order, and the rights conferred . .. will have been lost, probably irreparably.\u201d [9 Moore\u2019s <em>Federal Practice, supra, </em>\u00b6 110.10, at 133, quoting <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., supra, </em>337 U.S. at 546-47, 69 S.Ct. at 1225-1226.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">In its response to the show cause order, Wallace Power alleges the existence of only the first characteristic, namely that the district court\u2019s order determined a separable claim of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Second, <em>Eisen </em>involved a completely different situation. The Supreme Court in <em>Eisen </em>ultimately, upheld the appealability of a district court order that required the respondents to pay the costs of notice. In the instant case, the assertion of liability against Combustion Engineering, whether based on indemnification or contribution, relates to several liability issues and those issues remain for disposition at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ruling sought by Wallace Power at this time amounts to no more than an advisory opinion, not a collateral matter under <em>Eisen </em>and <em>Cohen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Thus, the district court\u2019s order does not constitute a final decision upon which the jurisdiction of this court may be invoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Further, no appeal of an interlocutory order has been sought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) nor has this appeal been brought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without prejudice to the right of Wallace Power to bring a timely appeal upon the entry of a final judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-13\">. Before the cross-claim allegations against Combustion Engineering are ripe for disposition, plaintiff Arendt must recover damages against the defendants and, additionally, the defendants as third-party plaintiffs must establish a right to recover against Wallace Power Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
