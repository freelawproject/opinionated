It alleged that Kane\u2019s former employer, Douglas, Elliman, Hollyday &amp; Ives, had discriminated against Kane on the basis of her gender in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>On January 11, 1980, the EEOC sent Kane a \u201cNotice of Right to Sue.\u201d The Notice informed Kane that the EEOC had decided not to sue Douglas Elliman on Kane\u2019s behalf, and that if Kane wished to sue her former employer, she had 90 days from receipt of the Notice to do so. Kane received the Notice on January 28, 1980. She filed her complaint 91 days later, on April 28, 1980. The 90th day, April 27, was a Sunday, and Kane filed the complaint the following day-Monday. The district court dismissed her suit as time-barred under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Rule 6(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB2\">In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by the local rules of any district court, by order of court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Under Rule 6(a), the 90-day period for filing Kane\u2019s complaint did not end on Sunday, April 27; instead, it ran \u201cuntil the end of the next day,\u201d Monday, April 28. Thus Kane\u2019s complaint was properly filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Appellee contends that Rule 6(a) does not apply to this case because Rule 1, Fed.R.Civ.P., provides: \u201cThese rules govern the procedure in the United States district courts in all suits of a civil nature . . . \u201d The argument is that, until a complaint is properly filed, there is no \u201csuit of a civil nature,\u201d and thus the Rules, including Rule 6(a), do not apply. The argument has been almost uniformly rejected in Title VII actions. In <em>Pearson v. Furnco Constr. Co., </em>563 F.2d 815, 818-19 (7th Cir. 1977), for example, the 90th day after the EEOC Notice was Sunday, September 29. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint was filed on Monday, September 30. The court stated that the spirit of Rule 6(a) governed, and held the filing timely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">We think that in the light of the purposes intended to be served by Title VII, it is a sound interpretation of congressional intent that the party plaintiff is to have a full span of ninety days in which to file his action, and that accordingly, when the ninetieth calendar day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the period does not expire until the end of the next day which is none of these three.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-8\"><em>Accord, Bailey v. Boilermakers Local 667, </em>480 F.Supp. 274, 282 (N.D.W.Va.1979) (90th day Sunday; complaint filed on Monday held timely); <em>Menn v. Amstar Corp., </em>476 F.Supp. 303, 306 (D.Md.1979) (90th day Labor Day; complaint filed next day held timely); <em>Jordan v. Lewis Grocer Co., </em>467 F.Supp. 113, 115 (N.D.Miss.1979) (90th day Sunday; complaint filed Monday held timely); <em>Burks v. Vann\u2019s Baking Corp., </em>3 FEP Cases 620 (W.D.Tenn.1971) (under 30-day deadline applicable before 1972 amendment creating 90-day deadline) (30th day Sunday; complaint filed Monday held timely). <em>Cf. Tavernaris </em>v. <em>Beaver Area School District, </em>454 F.Supp. 355, 357 (W.D.Pa.1978) (90th day Monday; complaint filed on Wednesday held timely because Title VII \u201cshould be liberally construed\u201d). <em>See Haire v. Calloway, </em>385 F.Supp. 309, 310 (E.D.Mo. 1974) (under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16) (30-day limit ends Saturday; complaint filed Monday held timely), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>537 F.2d 318 (8th Cir. 1976); <em>contra, Smith v. Bailar, </em>22 FEP Cases 1378 (N.D.Ga. Feb. 15, 1980) (under \u00a7 2000e-16) (30th day Saturday; complaint filed on Monday held not timely).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">In view of the broad remedial purposes of Title VII, <em>see Love v. Pullman Co., </em>404 U.S. 522, 527, 92 S.Ct. 616, 619, 30 L.Ed.2d 679 (1972), we decline to extend the dictum of <em>Joint Council Dining Car Employees, Local 370 v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co., </em>157 F.2d 417, 420 (2d Cir. 1946), to bar this action. Unlike the statute at issue in <em>Dining Car, </em>Title VII was passed by a Congress with Rule 6(a) firmly in mind. <em>See Simon v. CIR, </em>176 F.2d 230, 232 (2d Cir. 1949); <em>Rutledge v. Sinclair Refining Co., </em>13 F.R.D. 477, 478 (S.D.N.Y.1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
