This Court, therefore, certifies the following questions of law to the Supreme Court of Georgia for instructions concerning them based on the facts found by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">I. STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"aid-dedup-0\">After a three week trial, the district judge entered an opinion reported in--F.Supp. - (S.D.Ga.1977). Findings of fact appear throughout the opinion; abridged findings appearing at the end of the opinion are to be considered along with those appearing in the opinion itself. <em>Id. </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">While the record, consisting mainly of exhibits, is voluminous, the testimony was not transcribed, and the appellant does not contend that the district judge was clearly erroneous as to any finding of fact he made. Therefore, all findings of fact are accepted as supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">II. QUESTIONS TO BE CERTIFIED</p>\n<p id=\"AxAh\">1. Did the United States owe a duty of care to employees of Thiokol, either (a) properly to classify the illuminants initially and to inform Thiokol of their proper classification or (b) to communicate the change in classification to Thiokol?</p>\n<p id=\"b562-13\">We recognize that a negative answer to both parts of this question would be determinative of this case. However, if the answer to either or both parts of it is affirmative, then the question of proximate cause remains. In our opinion, this question cannot be resolved in advance of the determination whether Georgia law imposes a duty and the definition of that duty because resolution of the proximate cause question depends, at least in part, on the nature of the duty, the breach of which is alleged to have caused harm. Therefore, we certify the following question in addition:</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">2. If the answer to either or both parts of question 1 is affirmative, then accepting the findings of fact made by the trial judge, was it erroneous as a matter of law for him to conclude that the United States\u2019 breach of the duty you have defined in answering question 1 was a proximate cause of the explosion?</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">We transmit herewith copies of the briefs of the parties. Without in any way qualifying our acceptance of the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact, we respectfully refer the Georgia Supreme Court to the following documents that were introduced in evidence and supply the court with the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7c\">Plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 1, transmitted herewith, contains the Award, the Solicitation Offer and Award, and Appendices thereto. We respectfully invite the court\u2019s attention to p. 163 (as marked in lower right corner), incorporating Armed Services Procurement Regulation 7-104.79. A copy of this Regulation (32 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.104-79) is forwarded herewith. It requires the contractor to comply with DOD Contractors Safety Manual for Ammunition Explosives and Related Dangerous Materials. A copy of the Manual (plaintiff\u2019s exhibit 2) is transmitted herewith. We respectfully invite the court\u2019s attention to the Foreword, \u00a7\u00a7 100-103, 707, 709.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-17\">Drawings and specifications were supplied to Thiokol in the Technical Data Package; drawings therein identified the illuminant material as Class 2.
