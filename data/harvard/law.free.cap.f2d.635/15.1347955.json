The issues are whether the district court erred in finding substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision that the claimant was- hot disabled after December 6, 1974, and whether the Secretary\u2019s determination that Schena\u2019s refusal to have a spinal fusion operation was unreasonable is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">Schena suffered a ruptured lumbar disc in an accident on a construction site, and was determined to be disabled within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d) from May 22, 1973, to December 6, 1974. He claims that he is entitled to disability benefits through the time he returned to work in March, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">Schena\u2019s benefits were initially terminated because of his alleged willful refusal to undergo spinal surgery. The Secretary, after reconsideration, determined that this decision was proper. Schena then asked for a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) which was held on December 1,1976. The ALJ affirmed the reconsideration decision, finding that Schena \u201cno longer met the definition of disability . . . both due to his failure to follow a prescribed course of treatment and also because he then [after December 6, 1974] had the capacity to perform sedentary work.\u201d The Appeals Council affirmed the decision of the ALJ on October 3, 1977. The case was next before the district court. Determining that there was substantial evidence to support the finding that Schena could perform sedentary work in a substantial gainful activity, the court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-17\">A. <em>Whether substantial evidence supports the denial of disability benefits after December 6, 1974, on the basis of Sche-na\u2019s capacity to engage in a substantial gainful activity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">Schena\u2019s first claim is that substantial evidence does not support the Secretary\u2019s decision that he could engage in a substantial gainful activity after December 6, 1974, and was, therefore, not disabled after that date. We find that the record fails to establish whether Schena could perform sedentary work, given his physical limitations, in the period between December 6, 1974 (when he was determined to be no longer disabled), and December 1, 1976 (the date of the hearing).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It must be reiterated that Schena\u2019s benefits were first terminat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ed not because of a finding that he was able to work, but on the grounds that he had willfully failed to undergo prescribed surgery. Substantial evidence only supports a finding that <em>at the time of hearing, </em>Schena could do sedentary work of a nature to enable him to engage in a substantial gainful activity. But the evidence cannot substantiate a finding that Schena was capable of such work for the two years previous. Rather, a specific inquiry with respect to that time period has to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In reviewing the finding of substantial evidence that Schena could perform sedentary tasks in a substantial gainful activity, at least as of December 1, 1976, we note first the testimony of the vocational expert. He stated that work existed in the economy for a person of Schena\u2019s age, education and job experience, for someone who was able to stand for fifteen minutes at a time, walk for two blocks, sit with the opportunity to shift position, and lift ten pounds from a table though unable to stoop or bend. Schena, the vocational expert testified, could work as a self-service parking lot attendant, self-service gasoline station attendant, bench assembly worker or daytime shopping center security officer. Neither Schena nor his counsel suggested that he was unfit for such employment. Counsel only inquired as to whether the jobs took account of his client\u2019s requirements for warm weather; the vocational expert responded that Schena could reasonably expect that he would be shielded from inclement weather while performing such work.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Although we find that there was substantial evidence that Schena could work at the time of the hearing, we disagree with the district court\u2019s view that claimant\u2019s responses about his fitness to work bolster the conclusion of the AU. Although Schena\u2019s testimony was not always clear, we think it was a mistake to equate his expressions of willingness to try to work with capacity to work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">B. <em>Whether the Secretary erred in determining that Schena\u2019s refusal to have spinal surgery barred a finding of disability.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Because the district court found substantial evidence that Schena could work, it did not reach the other basis for the Secretary\u2019s denial of benefits-the claimant\u2019s alleged willful refusal to have back surgery \u201cwas not shown to be medically justifiable.\u201d That basis would serve as an independent ground for sustaining the Secretary\u2019s decision, even if it were determined on remand that Schena could not perform substantial gainful activity for the period in question. For the reasons discussed below, however, we reverse the Secretary\u2019s decision barring Schena\u2019s disability benefits because of his rejection of a spinal operation. Thus, on remand, if it is determined that Schena could not undertake substantial gainful activity between December 6, 1974, and December 1,1976, he must be awarded disability benefits for that time interval.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">The pertinent regulation with respect to the denial of benefits for willful failure to follow treatment states: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1507 (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus a claimant\u2019s disability benefits cannot be terminated unless it is determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>An individual with a disabling impairment which is amenable to treatment to restore his ability to work shall be deemed to be under a disability if he is undergoing therapy prescribed by his treatment sources but his impairment has nevertheless continued to be disabling or can be expected to be disabling for at least 12 months. However, an individual who willfully fails to follow such prescribed treatment cannot by virtue of such failure be found to be under a disability. Willful failure does not exist if there is justifiable cause for failure to follow such treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>(1) The impairment must have been amenable to treatment .. . [that could be expected] to restore the claimant\u2019s ability to work ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">(2) The treatment must have been prescribed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">(3) The treatment must have been refused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">(4) The refusal must have been willful; willfullness [sic] does not exist where there is a justifiable excuse for the refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\"><em>Smith v. Weinberger, </em>394 F.Supp. 1002, 1008 (D.Md. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">In the case at hand, the ALJ failed to develop the facts necessary to sustain his findings. He did not explicitly determine that the rejected back surgery could be expected to restore Schena\u2019s ability to work. The medical reports upon which the AU relied suggest that surgery would improve the claimant\u2019s condition, but did not deal with the question of whether the treatment \u201ccould be expected to restore his ability to work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Further, the denial of benefits because of Schena\u2019s alleged \u201cwillful refusal to follow a <em>recommended </em>course of treatment\u201d (emphasis added) disregards the language of the regulation which specifically speaks in terms of the willful failure to follow \u201cprescribed\u201d treatment. That various physicians suggested the operation does not necessarily mean that they prescribed it. Schena\u2019s physician, though suggesting an operation, stated in his report that he did not \u201curge him to undergo surgery which he is fundamentally opposed to\u201d and noted in an earlier letter that since the patient \u201cwishes to try physical therapy, I have no objection and he is going to continue with this for a relatively indefinite period if he wishes to do so.\u201d In any case, it is not the \u201cclaimant\u2019s burden to undergo any and all surgical procedures suggested by [his or] her physician lest [he or] she is barred from disability benefits.\u201d <em>McCarty v. Richardson, </em>459 F.2d 3, 4 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">\u201cIn determining whether a claimant\u2019s refusal to undergo treatment is reasonable-i. e. supported by justifiable cause under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1507-several factors must be considered.\u201d <em>Nichols v. Califano, </em>556 F.2d 931, 933 (9th Cir. 1977). Certainly, an assessment should be made in light of such variables as the risks involved, the likelihood of success, the consequences of failure and the availability of alternative treatment. \u201cA patient may be acting reasonably in refusing surgery that is painful or dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 933. A patient\u2019s refusal to submit to an operation when the surgeon suggesting the surgery \u201cconsidered the attitude of the patient a reasonable one, cannot be held to be a refusal to cooperate in remedial treatment.\u201d <em>Ratliff v. Celebrezze, </em>338 F.2d 978 (6th Cir. 1964). A reasonable fear may justify the refusal of treatment. <em>See Martin v. Ribicoff, </em>195 F.Supp. 761, 772 (E.D. Tenn. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">We cannot accept the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Schena\u2019s refusal to submit to surgery was unsupported by justifiable cause. Schena testified that none of the .physicians provided percentages indicating the likelihood of success. He stated that he was wary of surgery because several of his relatives had undergone such operations, but were worse off than before. One of the specialists who recommended an operation noted in his report that Schena refused surgery \u201csince the other man injured in the same accident became paralyzed in the lower extremities and remained so in spite of having surgery in \u2019 order to help him.\u201d Schena\u2019s treating physician supported surgery but stated that \u201cit is certainly reasonable to refuse this sort of treatment if one is particularly upset by the thought of it.\u201d He sanctioned alternative treatment, and the record shows that Schena underwent extensive physical therapy and wore a back brace. <em>Cf. Blankenship v. Califano, </em>598 F.2d 1041, 1045 (6th Cir. 1975) (significant that appellant willing to undergo alterna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>tive treatment involving considerable pain). In view of all this, Schena\u2019s decision to refuse surgery and to choose alternative treatment was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u201cIt is common knowledge that spinal surgery is often dangerous and entails much pain and suffering.\u201d <em>Ratliff v. Celebrezze, </em>338 F.2d at 981. In reviewing this case, we are moved to ask as did the Sixth Circuit in a similar context: \u201cWhat kind of surgical operation entailing what danger to life, and pain, must an applicant undergo at the behest of a surgeon who does not suggest any certainty of cure or remedy?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 981. Given the uncertain (and sometimes adverse) consequences of spinal surgery, we have difficulty faulting Schena for choosing other treatment. The fact that he has returned to work suggests that his decision to pursue another mode of treatment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Finally, we note that the Social Security Act was intended \u201cto ameliorate some of the rigors that life imposes.\u201d <em>Miracle v. Celebrezze, </em>351 F.2d 361, 374 (6th Cir. 1965). It was a commitment by the nation to serve the individual needs of its people. The perfunctory determination of the- Secretary here, the apparent disregard for the concerns that moved Schena to reject back surgery are at odds with the underlying premises of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the Secretary\u2019s decision that Schena\u2019s rejection of spinal surgery barred him from disability benefits under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1507. We reverse in part the decision of the district court, and remand to the Secretary to determine whether the claimant could engage in \u201cany substantial gainful activity\u201d from December 6, 1974, to December 1, 1976.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-20\">. All that the ALJ found was that claimant <em>\u201chas </em>sufficient functional capacity to engage in sedentary work,\u201d not that from December 6, 1974, to December 1, 1976, he had such capacity (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-6\">. The court\u2019s view was based on the following exchanges between the ALJ and Schena:</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">AU: Tell me in your own words why you couldn\u2019t work right now?</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Schena: (Inaudible) I can\u2019t work-what kind of work.</p>\n<p id=\"AN\">Q: Could you do your work back there with the construction company right now?</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">A: I don\u2019t think my-</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">Q: How about if you had an easier job? ....</p>\n<p id=\"AoO\">A: I could try it. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b95-11\">. The identical regulation is now found at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1518.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
