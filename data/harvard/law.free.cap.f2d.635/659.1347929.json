Plaintiffs argue that the provisions should also have covered families placed in need due to theft of cash, eviction for nonpayment of rent, termination of utility services, or loss or delay of AFDC checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Plaintiffs first assert that the special needs provisions burden a fundamental \u201cright to survive\u201d without compelling justification. There is no constitutional right to obtain welfare from government. <em>Lavine v. Milne, </em>424 U.S. 577, 584, n.9, 96 S.Ct. 1010, 1015 n.9 47 L.Ed.2d 249 (1976); <em>Wein-berger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 771-72, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2469-2470, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Plaintiffs next argue that the provisions create an arbitrary classification or are otherwise contrary to the equal protection of the laws. The provisions need merely be rational to be constitutional. <em>Califano v. Aznavorian, </em>439 U.S. 170, 174-75, 99 S.Ct. 471, 473-474, 58 L.Ed.2d 435 (1978); <em>Jefferson v. Hackney, </em>406 U.S. 535, 546, 92 S.Ct. 1724, 1731, 32 L.Ed.2d 285 (1972); <em>Dan-dridge v. Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 485-86, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1161-1162, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970). We find them to be rational. Loss due to theft of cash is not covered because it is often impossible to verify. Loss due to non-payment of rent or utility bills is excluded because those payments are to be made from the family\u2019s basic AFDC check and not from a special needs grant. Loss due to delayed or lost AFDC checks is covered elsewhere in the Illinois AFDC program. Other special needs are not covered because Illinois desires to apportion its welfare budget so that grants actually made will be sufficient to alleviate the need for which they are given. <em>See Quern v. Mandley, </em>436 U.S. 725, 746, 98 S.Ct. 2068, 2080, 56 L.Ed.2d 658 (1978); <em>cf. Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 479-80, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1158-1159, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970). Accordingly, the provisions are constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second contention is that assistance under the special needs provisions must be furnished \u201cforthwith\u201d to comply with 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.120(a)(5) (1978). The district court correctly held that that regulation applies to emergency assistance aid, as provided for by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 603(a)(5) &amp; 606(e) (1976), and not to special needs provisions administered as part of an AFDC program. <em>See generally Quern v. Mandley, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 735-36, 98 S.Ct. at 2074-2075.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-16\">Plaintiffs appear to make certain related contentions. To the extent that they argue that the \u201creasonable promptness\u201d standard of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(10) applies to Illinois\u2019 special needs payments, both HEW and IDPA have conceded that this is the case. To the extent that they further contend that \u201creasonable promptness\u201d necessarily means \u201cforthwith\u201d when applied to special needs payments, we disagree. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>also hold that \u00a7 602(a)(10)\u2019s reasonable promptness requirement does not impose rigid time limits applicable to all special needs grants. What is and what is not \u201creasonable promptness\u201d must be decided on a case by case basis in light of the particular facts with which IDPA is faced; it cannot be decided in a vacuum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To the extent that plaintiffs argue that Illinois has not administered its special needs payments in compliance with the reasonable promptness standard, we find the record to be devoid of evidence on the question. Accordingly, no concrete controversy has here been presented on that issue. Finally, to the extent that plaintiffs ask this Court to remand the case for further hearings, we believe no useful purpose would be served by further inquiry into the legality of IDPA programs no longer in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees is denied. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\">. For the history of this litigation, see <em>Mandley v. Trainor, </em>523 F.2d 415 (7th Cir. 1975) <em>(Mand-ley I); Mandley v. Trainor, </em>545 F.2d 1062 (7th Cir. 1976) <em>(Mandley II), rev\u2019d and remanded sub nom. Quern v.

The provisions here at issue have been superseded by new special needs provisions and a new emergency assistance program which plaintiffs do not challenge in this litigation. We may, nevertheless, proceed to pass on the legality of the prior provisions. <em>See Quern v. Mandley, </em>436 U.S. 725, 733-34 n.7, 98 S.Ct. 2068, 2073-2074 n.7, 56 L.Ed.2d 658 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A_vP\">.

For example, as defendants have noted, a family ordered to be evicted in a week is not in need of aid within the hour. A family presently without shelter, however, may require aid \u201cforthwith.\u201d Reasonable promptness is entirely dependent on the circumstances of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
