During that period he had filed four workmen\u2019s compensation claims and one lawsuit against his employer. In addition, he had been unable to work for almost four months during this period. It is the petitioner\u2019s position that all the claims were \u201cof dubious validity.\u201d One of his claims alleged injuries to his shoulder sustained when he entangled his arm in a stair rail at work, and another claim was for neck and back injuries, which occurred when he fell over backwards in a swivel chair. His final claim on July 27, 1978 related to chest pains allegedly experienced by him at work, which he claimed were due to conditions in his working environment. At this point, the personnel director or the petitioner investigated Boggs\u2019 latest complaint and his accident and claims record, as well as his working conditions. Following this, Boggs was discharged. The reason assigned by the petitioner for the discharge was that Boggs, by his record as an employee, had shown a careless attitude towards safety and \u201ca preoccupation with filing claims for compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>A complaint under the Act was then issued by the National Labor Relations Board, and, after a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge concluded that \u201c[petitioner herein] violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act on July 31, 1978, by discharging Terry Boggs because of his expressed intention to file a workmen\u2019s compensation claim\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on account of his complaints on July 27, 1978, and \u201cthat Boggs\u2019 refusal to forebear from filing a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation falls within the protected ambit of Section 7 and * * * for that reason violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act.\u201d Those conclusions of the Administrative Law Judge were accepted by the Board, which, on that basis, entered the order challenged by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"AD2\">The issue posed by petitioner\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s order is whether, as a matter of law under the Act, discharge of an individual employee for refusing to forego a workmen\u2019s compensation claim constitutes protected \u201cconcerted activity\u201d authorizing the issuance of a cease-and-desist order under Section 7 of the Act. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157). For purposes of this appeal only it may be considered as undisputed that Boggs\u2019 discharge was as found by the Board. There is thus no factual issue, only a legal issue requiring a judicial construction of the term \u201cconcerted activity\u201d in the Board\u2019s authorization statute. If such a discharge for the reason assigned is not \u201cconcerted activity,\u201d enforcement should be denied. Conversely, if it is, enforcement should be ordered. On that basis we proceed to a construction of the term \u201cconcerted activity\u201d under Section 7 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">So far as this proceeding is concerned, Section 7 protects an employee from retaliation by his employer only on account of employee action which may be found to be \u201cconcerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d \u201cConcerted activity,\u201d under the statute, read literally, would appear to require more than a single participant. And some authorities have held just that. <em>N. L. R. B. v. C &amp; I Air Conditioning, Inc., </em>486 F.2d 977, 978, (9th Cir. 1973); <em>N. L. R. B. v. Northern Metal Company, </em>440 F.2d 881, 884 (3d Cir. 1971); <em>see, </em>Note, <em>Constructive Concerted Activity and Individual Rights: The Northern Metal-Interboro Split, </em>121 U.Pa.L.Rev. 152, 153 (1972).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">There are, however, other cases, supported by scholarly comments, which find too narrow and artificial this construction of the term \u201cconcerted activity,\u201d a term which they characterize as more \u201ca term of art rather than a factual description.\u201d <em>An-chortank, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., </em>618 F.2d 1153, 1160 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>cf., </em>Note <em>The Requirement of \u201cConcerted\u201d Action under the NLRA, </em>53 Colum.L.Rev. 514, 517 (1953). These decisions point to the words in the statute which qualify, or make clear the scope of, the term \u201cconcerted activities\u201d (\u201cfor the purpose of * * * mutual aid or protection\u201d) and, taking the two phrases together (\u201cconcerted activities\u201d and its qualifying phrase \u201cfor the purpose of * * * mutual aid or protection\u201d), conclude that it is the sense and intent of the statute that an action by a single employee may be treated as \u201cconcerted activity,\u201d even though participated in by a single employee, <em>provided, </em>but only <em>provided, </em>the action looks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>group rather than mere individual action, and includes \u201csome element of collective activity or contemplation thereof,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or it is shown \u201cthat the individual in fact was acting on behalf of, or as a representative of, other employees rather than acting for the benefit of other employees only in a theoretical sense.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">It will not satisfy this condition for Board action under Section 7 that an employee\u2019s complaint may be directed at working conditions which affect all employees; \u201c[i]t is . .. necessary ... that the employee\u2019s actions themselves at least contemplate such group activity [in order to support Board jurisdiction]. As was explained in <em>Indiana Gear Works v. NLRB, </em>371 F.2d 273, 276 (7th Cir. 1967), \u201cin order to prove a concerted activity under Section 7 of the Act, it is necessary to demonstrate that the activity was for the purpose of inducing or preparing for group action to correct a grievance or a complaint.\u201d <em>Pelton Casteel, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., </em>627 F.2d 23, 28 (7th Cir. 1980). This construction of the statutory language determinative of when the action of a single employee will be deemed \u201cconcerted activity\u201d within Section 7, is illustrated by <em>Mushroom Transportation Company v. N. L. R. B., </em>330 F.2d 683, 685 (3d Cir. 1964):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqKh\">It is not questioned that a conversation may constitute a concerted activity although it involves only a speaker and a listener, but to qualify as such, it must appear at the very least that it was engaged in with the object of initiating or inducing or preparing for group action or that it had some relation to group action in the interest of the employees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">This definition of \u201cconcerted activity,\u201d as applied to the action of a single employee was recently reaffirmed in <em>Pelton Casteel, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., </em>627 F.2d at 28, in which the finding of the Board that the conduct of an employee complaining of working conditions in that case constituted \u201cconcerted activity\u201d within the meaning of Section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">We appear to have adopted this same construction of the statutory language. Thus, in <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation v. N. L. R. B., </em>407 F.2d 1357 (4th Cir. 1969), we enforced an order of the Board finding \u201cconcerted activity\u201d in the action of two employees in preparing and seeking from fellow employees signatures on a petition complaining of working conditions. In doing so, however, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-13\">Their activity (i. e., that of the two employees) both prior and subsequent to the actual signing of the petition was <em>plainly intended to enlist the support and assistance of other employees for the purpose of correcting what the workers thought to be an inadequacy in working conditions. </em>The activity of a single employee <em>in enlisting the </em>support of his fellow employees for their mutual <em>aid and protection </em>is as much \u201cconcerted activity\u201d as is ordinary group activity. The one seldom exists without the other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1365 (Italics added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>This distinction under Section 7 between individual action \u201cintended to enlist the support and assistance of other employees\u201d and action \u201cfor the benefit of other employees only in a theoretical sense\u201d is illustrated by the different results in our cases of <em>Joanna Cotton Mills Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Bd., </em>176 F.2d 749 (4th Cir. 1949) and <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. N. L. R. B., supra. </em>In <em>Joanna Mills, </em>it was said that it is \u201cthe \u2018purpose\u2019 of the activity\u201d of the employee that determines whether the complaint of the employee is within Section 7 and that such \u201cpurpose\u201d \u201cmust be the mutual aid or protection of the employees.\u201d 176 F.2d at 153. Because it concluded that the complaint of the employee, though involving working conditions, represented a personal grievance asserted as such and was not \u201cfor the purpose of inducing or preparing for group action to correct a grievance or a complaint,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Court in that case found that there was not \u201cconcerted activity\u201d within Section 7. In <em>Owens-Corning Fiberglas, </em>on the other hand, the action of the employees was \u201cplainly intended to enlist the support and assistance of other employees for the purpose of correcting ... an inadequacy in working conditions.\u201d 407 F.2d at 1365. Under those circumstances, the Court did find \u201cconcerted activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The Board in effect concedes that there is no evidence that the action of the solitary employee in this case intended or contemplated any group activity or that he was \u201cin fact . . . acting on behalf of or as representative of, other employees;\u201d at most his action can be said to have been \u201cfor the benefit of other employees only in a theoretical sense.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, his actions did not satisfy the requirements as stated in <em>Mushroom, Owens-Corning Fiberglas </em>and similar cases as a basis for a finding of \u201cconcerted activity\u201d in the instance of a complaint by a single employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">It is true, as the Board argues, that a number of courts, following the rule announced in <em>N. L. R. B. v. Interboro Contractors, Inc., </em>388 F.2d 495 (2d Cir. 1967), have held \u201cthat complaints by an individual employee in an effort to enforce provisions of a collective bargaining agreement amounted to concerted activity under \u00a7 7 of the Act, even in the absence of interest by fellow employees in the complaints.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The rationale for this rule, as stated by the Court both in <em>ARO, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., </em>596 F.2d at 716, and in <em>N. L. R. B. v. C &amp; I Air Conditioning, Inc., </em>496 F.2d at 976, as well as by the Board itself in <em>Bunney Bros. Construction Co., </em>139 NLRB 1516, 1519 (1962), is that individual action seeking to implement the terms of a collective bargaining agreement is merely an extension of the concerted activity which gave rise to the agreement in the first place (constructive concerted activity).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This reasoning, however, has not been accepted by all courts. In <em>N. L. R. B. v. Northern Metal Company, </em>440 F.2d at 884-85, the Court, branding the finding of \u201cconstructive concerted activity\u201d in <em>Interboro </em>as a pure \u201cle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>gal fiction,\u201d said it was \u201cunwilling to adopt such a fiction.\u201d And in <em>Buddies Supermarkets, Inc., supra, </em>at 719-20, the Court declared \u201cthat the <em>Interboro </em>decision has not received wide acceptance.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is, however, unnecessary for us to determine in this case\"wHetHer <em>Interboro </em>is to be applied in this Circuit, since there is no collective bargaining agreement and, therefore, no foundation for a finding of \u201cconstructive concerted activity\u201d under the rationale adopted in <em>Interboro.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">And the Board recognized that this case did not qualify under <em>Interboro </em>because of the absence of a collective bargaining agreement, but it asked that we extend the fiction of \u201cconstructive concerted activity\u201d found in <em>Interboro </em>by holding that an individual employee is engaged in \u201cconcerted activity\u201d whenever he or she acts in a matter which arises out of an employment relationship and may be of common interest to other employees since it is reasonable to presume that other employees, if they know of the complaint, would have joined in, thereby supporting the essential element of group or concerted action. It would apply this holding which relies on a presumption!/ of group conduct and participation, particu-' larly in situations where the employee\u2019s complaint relates to federal or state work safety or employment compensation statutes. It argues that the adoption of such a rule would create a presumption, which had the effect of merely shifting the burden of proof. It is significant, though, that the Board confesses in its brief in this court that no proceeding in which it has proposed this theory has the Board suggested \u201cthe precise manner whereby an employer might obtain evidence to rebut the presumption\u201d that other employees identified with the complaint. It follows, therefore, that the Board would set up a presumption which in practical effect it would be impossible.for an employer to rebut and thus would constitute an irrebuttable presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The Board cites no circuit decision supporting its theory of presumed \u201cconcerted activity\u201d in this case. The only courts which have considered it have flatly rejected any rule that where the complaint of a single employee relates to an alleged violation of federal or state safety laws and there is no proof of a purpose enlisting group action in support of the complaint, there is \u201cconstructive concerted action\u201d meeting the threshold requirement under Section 7. <em>N. L. R. B. v. C &amp; I Air Conditioning, Inc., supra </em>(complaint covering safety on the job site). <em>See, also, N. L. R. B. v. Dawson Cabinet Co., Inc., supra </em>(viola-tive of the Equal Pay Act). Thus, in <em>N. L. R. B. v. Bighorn Beverage, </em>614 F.2d 1238, 1242 (9th Cir. 1980), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-14\">We disagree that the filing of a safety complaint in the circumstances of the case constituted a protected concerted activity. The Board found that Mortensen had acted alone in filing the complaint; however, it relied upon <em>Alleluia Cushion Co., Inc., </em>221 N.L.R.B. 999 (1975), to find concerted activity. In <em>Alleluia Cushion </em>the Board found that when an employee acts alone in filing a safety complaint, the consent of the other employees will be implied and the activity will be deemed concerted. This is an extension of the principle established in <em>NLRB v. Interboro Contractors, Inc., </em>388 F.2d 495 (2d Cir. 1967), that \u201cactivity engaged in by an individual employee acting alone which was directed to enforce or implement the terms of a collective bargaining agreement will be deemed concerted activity within the meaning of \u00a7 7.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Dawson Cabinet Co., Inc., </em>566 F.2d 1079, 1082 (8th Cir. 1977). The rationale of the decision was that the implementation of the agreement by the employee was an extension of the concerted activity giving rise to the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-15\"><em>NLRB v. C &amp; I Air Conditioning, Inc., </em>486 F.2d 977 (9th Cir. 1973) governs the disposition of this issue. It involved, as this case does, the filing of a safety com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>plaint. Although it predated <em>Alleluia Cushion, </em>without deciding the validity of <em>Interboro, </em>we refused to extend it to situations where there was no collective bargaining agreement involved. Such an agreement is essential because it is the source of the employee\u2019s claimed rights. <em>NLRB v. C &amp; I Air Conditioning, Inc., </em>486 F.2d at 979. Therefore, we must reject the Board\u2019s finding that Mortensen engaged in protected concerted activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arz\">And this conclusion as stated in <em>Bighorn Beverage </em>is easily understood. \u201cConcerted activity\u201d is an essential predicate, in effect a jurisdictional requirement, fop Board action under the Act in a case sucfTas this. The burden of establishing by proof such essential predicate to quasi-jurisdiction rests on the Board. It would be odd, indeed, if this essential quasi-jurisdiction predicate might be supplied by a presumption admittedly resting on no factual base but predicated on a purely theoretical assumption. In essence, what the Board would do under its argument would be to reverse the trial procedure in this context by requiring the employer in any proceedings under the Act to rebut the Board\u2019s authority to act before the Board would be required to prove its quasi-jurisdictional basis for the proceeding. We cannot accept such a novel argument which goes far beyond the rationale on which <em>Interboro </em>was grounded. In our opinion, the Board completely failed to establish \u201cconcerted activity\u201d in this case and enforcement is accordingly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\n<em>ENFORCEMENT DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-19\">. 245 NLRB No. 135 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AhB\">. There was some contention that Boggs\u2019 discharge was related to his supposed union activities. The Administrative Law Judge found no basis for this claim and dismissed it.
