Appellee was awarded costs of $1,326.53.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-22\">For reversal appellant argues that the award of costs was an abuse of the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>court\u2019s discretion. Having failed to oppose the grant of costs below, appellant may prevail in this court only if the award was plain error. <em>See Morrow v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., </em>541 F.2d 713, 724 (8th Cir. 1976). We find no plain error. An award of costs is certainly within the discretion of the district court. Even if we were to agree with appellant that the exercise of that discretion is limited to cases where the action is frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we cannot say on this record that the district court could not have found against appellant under that standard. Appellant obtained dismissal of the action on the day of trial without giving prior notice to appel-lee and did not present to the district court any objection to an award of costs in the amount appellee claimed to be required in preparation for trial. We do not find substantial injustice has occurred in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-12\">. The Honorable William L. Hungate, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-13\">. The cases are divided on the proper standard for an award of costs to defendants in Title VII cases. <em>Compare Dual v. Cleland, </em>79 F.R.D. 696 (D.D.C.1978), <em>and Jaspers v. Alexander, </em>15 Fair Empl.Prac. Cases 1234, 1238-39 (D.D.C.1977), <em>with Jones v. City of San Antonio, </em>568 F.2d 1224, 1226 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>and EEOC </em>v. <em>Johnson Co., </em>18 Fair Empl.Prac.
