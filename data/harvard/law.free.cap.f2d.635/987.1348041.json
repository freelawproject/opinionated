Defendants-appellants Diamond Shamrock Corporation, Monsanto Company, Thompson Hayward Chemical Company, Hercules Incorporated and the Dow Chemical Company were the manufacturers of various herbicides including \u201cAgent Orange\u201d (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cAgent Orange\u201d) for use by the military as defoliants in the Vietnam War. The plaintiffs, veterans of that war and their families, allege that they have sustained various physical injuries by reason of the veterans\u2019 exposure to Agent Orange. Plaintiffs seek redress of those injuries under federal common law, and have invoked the \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction of the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) (1976). Defendants contest the existence of a federal common law cause of action, and moved below to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, George C. Pratt, Judge, denied their motion. Defendants obtained certification of the jurisdiction issue and took this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">We agree with defendants that there is no federal common law right of action under the circumstances of this litigation. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">The present litigation began in late 1978 and early 1979, when several individual veterans and their families commenced actions in the Northern District of Illinois and the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, claiming injury from the veterans\u2019 exposure to Agent Orange and purporting to represent several classes of injured persons and persons allegedly \u201cat risk\u201d of injury. The plaintiffs in most of these actions were represented by the same attorney, who filed substantially identical complaints in all actions, naming the same defendant manufacturers. By order of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, thirteen such actions, involving thirty named plaintiffs, were transferred to the Eastern District of New York and assigned to Judge Pratt for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407 (1976). Subsequently, additional actions were filed and were transferred to the Eastern District. It appears that there are presently more than 800 named plaintiffs in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\">After the transfer plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the action that the district court had designated as the lead action for purposes of pretrial proceedings. Defendants moved to dismiss on various grounds, and by opinion dated August 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>1979, the district court dismissed a number of claims<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and directed that a new complaint be filed. The second amended complaint was filed on August 20, 1979, asserting causes of action under the federal common law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and premising subject matter jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The motion was argued on October 3, 1979, and after argument but prior to decision plaintiffs proffered a third amended complaint. Defendants consented to the filing of the new complaint, and the district court, at the urging of the defendants, treated defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as having been made with respect to that complaint. Accordingly, it is the third amended complaint (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the \u201cComplaint\u201d) that is before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">A. <em>The Third Amended Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">The basic thrust of the Complaint is relatively simple: defendants manufactured a \u201cphenoxy herbicide,\u201d Agent Orange, for use by the military in Vietnam. The herbicide was allegedly contaminated with certain toxic organic chemicals, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (\u201cdioxin\u201d), which plaintiffs describe as \u201cone of the most toxic substances ever developed by man.\u201d (Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief on Appeal at 2.) The plaintiff veterans assert that they were exposed to Agent Orange, and thus to the dioxin it contained, while serving in Vietnam. They claim to have sustained various physical injuries, or to be \u201cat risk\u201d of such injuries, by reason of that exposure. Plaintiffs seek relief on a number of theories, including strict product liability, negligence, and breach of warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-12\">What marks these proceedings as somewhat extraordinary are the size of the plaintiff class and the scope of the relief that is sought. Plaintiffs purport to represent the 2.4 million veterans who served as combat soldiers in Southeast Asia from 1962 through 1971, as well as most of the families or survivors of those veterans. Fifteen plaintiff subclasses are identified; many of these subclasses consist of persons who are \u201cat risk\u201d of, but have yet to sustain, various physical injuries. Plaintiffs have alleged that \u201cthe combined liquid assets of the \u2018corporate defendants\u2019 will be insufficient to fully compensate the entire class of plaintiffs.\u201d (Complaint 1 15.) Plaintiffs therefore seek, in addition to unspecified damages,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a decree requiring defendants, upon a determination of liability, to establish</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1065-13\">a trust fund out of the current earnings of the defendants in the nature of a reserve against the claims of all the individual members of the plaintiff class to insure that the compensation of any group of individual plaintiffs will not impair the rights of those not before the Court at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1065-14\">(Complaint H 9.) Plaintiffs also seek a permanent injunction against further manufacture of Agent Orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>Defendants deny that there is any causal connection between exposure to Agent Orange and the injuries that plaintiffs claim to have sustained, and vigorously contest the propriety of the various remedial measures that plaintiffs seek to impose on them. This case, however, is still at the pleading stage, and for purposes of deciding the jurisdictional question before us, plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations must be accepted as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">B. <em>The Decision of the District Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Plaintiffs argue that federal common law should be applied to their claims principally because of the unique federal nature of the relationship between the soldier and his government, relying chiefly on <em>United States v. Standard Oil Co., </em>332 U.S. 301, 305, 67 S.Ct. 1604, 1606, 91 L.Ed. 2067 (1947) (\u201cPerhaps no relation between the Government and a citizen is more distinctively federal in character than that between it and members of its armed forces.\u201d). They contend that this interest brings the case within the doctrine of <em>Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 363, 366, 63 S.Ct. 573, 574, 87 L.Ed. 838 (1943), which held that, in order to ensure uniformity and certainty, \u201c[t]he rights and duties of the United States on commercial paper which it issues are governed by federal rather than local law.\u201d Plaintiffs argue that the government similarly has an interest in having all of its veterans compensated by government contractors who manufactured or marketed Agent Orange, and that application of the respective state laws would impede recovery on a uniform basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">The district court rejected the contention that <em>Clearfield Trust </em>stated the controlling principle, recognizing that the United States, a party to <em>Clearfield Trust, </em>is not party to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, the court recognized that since the present action involves only private parties, the federal common law issue is controlled by the principles set forth in <em>Miree v. De-Kalb County, </em>433 U.S. 25, 97 S.Ct. 2490, 53 L.Ed.2d 557 (1977), and <em>Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., </em>384 U.S. 63, 86 S.Ct. 1301, 16 L.Ed.2d 369 (1966). After reviewing the latter decisions, the district court applied a three-factor test to determine whether federal common law governs plaintiffs\u2019 claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-10\">(1) the existence of a substantial federal interest in the outcome of a litigation; (2) the effect on this federal interest should state law be applied; and (3) the effect on state interests should state law be displaced by federal common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">Slip op. at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">With respect to the first factor, the district court recognized two principal federal interests that may be affected by the present lawsuits: the federal government\u2019s interest in its relations with members of the armed forces, and its interest in its relations with suppliers of war materiel. As to the government\u2019s interest in the welfare of its veterans, the court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-13\">Soldiers serving in the armed forces are government charges, entitled to government protection. Torts committed by war contractors against soldiers in action constitute \u201charms inflicted\u201d on the soldiers and \u201cinterference\u201d with the relationship between soldiers and the government. Such harms and interferences implicate federal interests identified in <em>[United States v. Standard Oil, supra].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlE\"><em>Id. </em>at 18. The court rejected defendants\u2019 contention that these interests were already protected by the Congressionally-enacted scheme of veterans\u2019 benefits, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 310 <em>et seq. </em>(1976),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> opining that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC8\">[t]he limited nature of compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 310 <em>et seq. </em>makes it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>an insufficient guardian of the rights at stake in this litigation, <em>viz. </em>the rights of soldiers to be protected from \u201charms inflicted by others\u201d and to be compensated for harms already inflicted. The existence and extent of these contested rights necessarily are intertwined with the relationship between government and soldier and thereby implicate federal interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aop-dedup-0\">Slip op. at 18-19. Finally, the court reasoned that because of the large number of veterans claiming injury, and the large potential liability of the five defendants, the foregoing federal interests were \u201csubstantial\u201d for purposes of the federal common law analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-4\">The estimated number of involved veterans ranges from thousands to millions, and the estimated potential liability of the five war contractors ranges from millions to billions of dollars. As the number of veterans and the size of the claims against the war contractors increase so the federal interest in this litigation expands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">As to the government\u2019s interest in its relations with its military suppliers-the court referred to a number of \u201cspeculative\u201d ways in which lawsuits such as the present ones might adversely affect that interest, pointing out that in response to any increase in their potential liability, military suppliers might raise their prices, attach conditions to the use of their products, or stop dealing with the government altogether.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8zG\">government relations with war contractors might well be drastically altered by changes in the rules governing liability of war contractors to soldiers for injuries caused by inherently \u201cdangerous\u201d war materials.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">Turning to the second part of its test, the court found that the federal interest it had identified would be adversely affected if the issues in these lawsuits were adjudicated under state law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-11\">Application of varying state laws would burden federal interests by creating uncertainty as to the rights of both veterans and war contractors. It would also be unfair in that essentially similar claims, involving veterans and war contractors identically situated in all relevant respects, would be treated differently under different state laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-13\">Finally, as to the third part of its test, the court determined that application of federal common law would not have any significant adverse impact on state interests. While noting that \u201c[tjort claims are traditionally matters for state law, which has developed comprehensive substantive and procedural rules to govern them,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 22, the court distinguished the instant tort actions, finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-14\">state law has not considered the complex question of a war contractor\u2019s liability to soldiers injured by toxic chemicals subject to federal regulation while engaged in combat and serving abroad.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 23. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-16\">Because state law is no more or less developed as to such claims than federal common law, application of federal common law thereto would not significantly displace state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-17\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-18\">Having found substantial federal interests that would be adversely affected by application of state law to the instant claims, and having determined that there were no substantial state interests in having state law applied, the district court ruled that plaintiffs had stated valid causes of action under the federal common law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>The court therefore held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the case, and denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-4\">Both plaintiffs and defendants accept the three-part test that the district court applied to the federal common law issue, and for purposes of discussion we accept that framework. But, focusing our consideration chiefly on the first factor of the test, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthe existence of a substantial federal interest in the outcome of the litigation,\u201d we disagree with the district court\u2019s analysis and conclude that the court gave insufficient weight to the Supreme Court\u2019s repeated admonition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-5\">[i]n deciding whether rules of federal common law. should be fashioned, normally the guiding principle is that a <em>significant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of state law in the premises must first be specifically shown</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\"><em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Pan American Petroleum Corp., supra, </em>384 U.S. at 68, 86 S.Ct. at 1304, <em>quoted with emphasis in Miree v. DeKalb County, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 31, 97 S.Ct. at 2494. Principally we reject the district court\u2019s conclusion that there is an identifiable federal policy at stake in this litigation that warrants the creation of federal common law rules.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">In considering plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, it is essential to delineate precisely the relation of the United States to the claims here at issue. These claims are brought by former servicemen and their families against private manufacturers; they are not asserted by or against the United States, and they do not directly implicate the rights and duties of the United States. They are thus unlike the claims in <em>United States v. Standard Oil Co., supra, </em>in which the government brought suit to recover for its payments to a soldier injured as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence, and <em>Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States, supra, </em>in which the government brought suit to enforce its rights in commercial paper issued by it. In each of those cases the government was a party seeking to enforce its own asserted rights, and analysis reveals two federal concerns which are inherent in such cases. First, the government has an interest in having uniform rules govern its rights and obligations. Second, the government has a substantive interest in the contents of those uniform rules. The first interest prizes uniformity for its own sake and is content-neutral; it does not dictate the substance of the federal common law rule to be applied. Thus, in <em>United States v. Standard Oil Co., supra, </em>the Court applied federal common law, recognizing the government\u2019s interest in uniformity, but refused to impose the liability argued for by the United States as the substance of that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">The present litigation is fundamentally different from <em>Standard Oil </em>and <em>Clearfield Trust </em>with respect to both uniformity interest and substantive interest in the content of the rules to be applied. Since this litigation is between private parties and no substantial rights or duties of the government hinge on its outcome, there is no federal interest in uniformity for its own sake.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number><em>See e. g., Miree v. DeKalb County, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 28, 97 S.Ct. at 2493. The fact that application of state law may produce a variety of results is of no moment. It is in the nature of a federal system that different states will apply different rules of law, based on their individual perceptions of what is in the best interests of their citizens. That alone is not grounds in private litigation for judicially creating an overriding federal law. Indeed, even where a federal statutory program governs the rights of private litigants and Congress has left gaps to be filled by the courts, uniformity is not prized for its own sake. For example, in <em>Auto Workers v. Hoosier Corp., </em>383 U.S. 696, 701-05, 86 S.Ct. 1107, 1110-1113, 16 L.Ed.2d 192 (1966), the Court dealt with a suit under \u00a7 301 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185 (1976), to which federal common law applied. Yet in determining the timeliness of such suits, the Court ruled that the appropriate state statutes of limitations should apply, and refused to impose a uniform federal period of limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-4\">[Tjimeliness ... is clearly a federal question, for in \u00a7 301 suits the applicable law is \u201cfederal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws.\u201d <em>Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, </em>353 U.S. 448, 456, 77 S.Ct. 912, 917, 1 L.Ed.2d 972.... We are urged instead [of referring to state laws,] to devise a uniform time limitation to close the statutory gap left by Congress. But the teaching of our cases does not require so bald a form of judicial innovation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">383 U.S. at 701, 86 S.Ct. at 1110. Thus, the prospect of uniformity is insufficient reason to invoke federal common law in private litigation; and if federal common law were invoked, it would not ensure uniformity since frequently that law takes its substance from local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">The second fundamental difference between the present litigation and the <em>Clear-field Trust </em>type of case is that in the latter, the government\u2019s substantive interest in the litigation is essentially monothetic, in that it is concerned only with preserving the federal fisc, whereas here the government has two interests; and here the two interests have been placed in sharp contrast with one another. Thus, the government has an interest in the welfare of its veterans; they have given of themselves in the most fundamental way possible in the national interest. But the government also has an interest in the suppliers of its materiel; imposition, for example, of strict liability as contended for by plaintiffs would affect the government\u2019s ability to procure materiel without the exaction of significantly higher prices, or the attachment of onerous conditions, or the demand of indemnification or the like. As plaintiffs\u2019 counsel has observed, \u201cthis litigation will have a direct and lasting impact on the relationship between the federal government and war contractors . .. and between the federal government and veterans.\u201d (Letter dated October 21, 1980, V. J. Yannacone, Jr. to A. D. Fusaro.) It is obvious that the government is interested. But unlike a simple uniformity interest, neither the government\u2019s interest in its veterans nor its interest in its suppliers is content-neutral. Each interest will be furthered only if the federal rule of law to be applied favors that particular group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">The extent to which either group <em>should </em>be favored, and its welfare deemed \u201cparamount\u201d (see dissent of Chief Judge Fein-berg, post), is preeminently a policy determination of the sort reserved in the first instance for Congress. The welfare of veterans and that of military suppliers are clearly federal concerns which Congress should appropriately consider in setting policy for the governance of the nation, and it is properly left to Congress in the first instance to strike the balance between the conflicting interests of the veterans and the contractors, and thereby identify federal policy. Although Congress has turned its attention to the Agent Orange problem,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>has not determined what the federal policy is with respect to the reconciliation of these two competing interests. Thus, this case is unlike <em>Owens v. Haas, </em>601 F.2d 1242 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 980, 100 S.Ct. 483, 62 L.Ed.2d 407 (1979), or <em>Ivy Broadcasting Co. v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>391 F.2d 486 (2d Cir. 1968), in which the court was asked to supplement with federal common law a federal statutory program which itself embodied Congressional policy determinations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Owens, </em>as Chief Judge Feinberg observes, <em>post, </em>the Court \u201cdiscerned a \u2018federal regulatory scheme\u2019 \u201d for the protection of prisoners. It is one thing to <em>discern </em>a federal regulatory scheme from the statutes Congress has enacted, as in Owens; it is another to <em>devise </em>such a scheme in the face of inaction by Congress. The dissent finds it anomalous that federal common law may apply to prisoners but not to veterans. We suggest that the anomaly lies not with the court in declining to devise a scheme, but with Congress which has made specific provision for protection of the government\u2019s prisoners but not for its soldiers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">We conclude that in the present case, while the federal government has obvious interests in the welfare of the parties to the litigation, its interest in the <em>outcome </em>of the litigation, <em>i.e., </em>in how the parties\u2019 welfares should be balanced, is as yet undetermined.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The teaching of <em>Wallis </em>and <em>Miree </em>is that before federal common law rules should be fashioned, the use of state law must pose a threat to an \u201cidentifiable\u201d federal policy. <em>Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., supra, </em>384 U.S. at 68, 86 S.Ct. at 1304; <em>Miree v. DeKalb County, supra, </em>433 U.S. at 31-33, 97 S.Ct. at 2494, 2495. In the present litigation the federal policy is not yet identifiable. We conclude, therefore, that the district court erred in ruling that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were governed by federal common law. The order denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">.

Co. v. </em>Mottley, 211 U.S. 149, 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1066-14\">. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 310 <em>et seq., </em>entitled \u201cCompensation for Service-Connected Disability or Death,\u201d establishes for veterans a basic entitlement to compensation from the government for injuries resulting from military service, and sets rates of compensation for specific types and degrees of disability.

The district court correctly determined that there is no private right of action under FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 135 <em>et seq. </em>(1970). The current statute is the result of two principal enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>ments: the original FIFRA, Pub.L.No.80-104, 61 Stat. 163 (1947) (codified at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 135-135K (1976)), and the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act (\u201c1972 Act\u201d), Pub.L.No.92-516, 86 Stat. 973 (1972) (codified at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 136-136y (1976)), which amended, and has now superseded, the original Act. <em>See </em>Pub.L.No.92-516, \u00a7 4(b), 86 Stat. 998 (1972). Following the four-pronged analysis set forth in <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975), we conclude that neither enactment gives rise to a private right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"A0B\">The four factors to be considered under <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Ash </em>are (1) whether the plaintiff is \u201cone of the class for whose <em>especial </em>benefit the statute was enacted,\u201d (2) whether there is \u201cany indication of legislative intent, explicit or. implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one,\" (3) whether a right of action would be \u201cconsistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme,\u201d and (4) whether the cause of action is \u201cone traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78, 95 S.Ct. at 2087.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">As to the original FIFRA, which was in effect during the entire period that plaintiff veterans served in Vietnam, we see no essential satisfaction of any of the <em>Cort v. Ash </em>tests. First, there is no indication that the bill was enacted for the especial benefit of military men. It is clear that Congress\u2019s intent was to protect the public in general, with perhaps some special consideration for \u201cagricultural producers and other users\u201d of pesticides and rodenticides. <em>See </em>[1947] U.S.Code Cong.Serv. pp. 1200, 1202 (quoting the Report of the House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture). FIFRA makes no special mention of soldiers; and the House report, which states that the bill was considered by the United States Departments of Agriculture and the Interior, does not indicate that the bill was considered by any military or defense agency. <em>Id. </em>As to the second (and most important, <em>see Leist v. Simplot, </em>638 F.2d 283 (2d Cir. 1980)) of the Cort factors, we see no clear indication of legislative intent to create a private remedy. Plaintiffs have cited no legislative history on this point, nor have they presented any detailed statutory analysis. The Act itself is primarily concerned with establishing an administrative scheme of labeling, registration and enforcement; there are indications that Congress expected that scheme to be the exclusive means of enforcement. <em>See </em>[1947] U.S.Code Cong.Serv. <em>supra, </em>at 1202. We conclude that this factor cuts against the plaintiffs. The third <em>Cort </em>factor is of little assistance here. While a private right of action might enhance enforcement of the Act\u2019s substantive provisions to some extent, it would also increase the burden on manufacturers (without commensurately increasing protection of <em>injured </em>persons who can recover damages under state product liability law), something which the administrative scheme of registration was specifically intended to avoid. <em>See </em>[1947] U.S.Code Cong.Serv., <em>supra </em>at 1202. Finally, the fourth <em>Cort </em>factor cuts strongly against the plaintiffs. The area of product liability has been \u201ctraditionally relegated to state law,\" and this is no less true of the products regulated by the FIFRA. <em>See, e. g., Muncy </em>v. <em>Magnolia Chemical Co., </em>437 S.W.2d 15 (Tex.Civ.App.1968). Thus, we conclude that the district court was correct in ruling that there is no private right of action under the original FIFRA.</p>\n<p id=\"AWB\">As to the 1972 Act, the unavailability of a private right of action is even clearer. We find no more positive indications in the first, third and fourth <em>Cort </em>factors. More importantly, we find a negative indication as to the second Cort factor, <em>i.e., </em>legislative intent, since Congress considered and explicitly rejected amendments that would have authorized citizen suits to enforce the 1972 Act\u2019s prohibitions. See <em>People for Environmental Progress v. Leisz, </em>373 F.Supp. 589, 592 (C.D.Cal.1974) (discussing legislative history); <em>see also Kelly v. Butz, </em>404 F.Supp. 925, 940 (W.D.Mich.1975). It is not for us to override that Congressional determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">. The court also denied defendants\u2019 motion to strike portions of the Complaint relating to plaintiffs' demand that defendants be required to establish a trust fund. The court premised the denial on its conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVH\">defendants are not prejudiced by allowing these requests for relief to remain in the [Complaint], since defendants have no obligation to admit or deny plaintiffs\u2019 requests for relief, which therefore place no pleading burden on defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">at 24. In addition, it appears that the court declined to rule on a motion to strike portions of the Complaint relating to class members who have not yet been injured, but are said to be merely \u201cat risk\u201d of injury by reason of a veteran\u2019s exposure to Agent Orange. Defendants argue here, as they have in moving for reargument below, that the district court should have granted both motions to strike. We decline to reach these questions. The district court, in granting certification under \u00a7 1292(b) was primarily concerned with the question of subject matter jurisdiction; the certification mentions only that issue. While we are not restricted by the district court\u2019s limited certification, <em>see Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., </em>519 F.2d 974, 994-95 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. de-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number><em>nled, </em>423 U.S. 1018, 96 S.Ct. 453, 46 L.Ed.2d 389 (1975), and may review the entire order of the court below, <em>Capital Temporaries, Inc. v. Olsten Corp., </em>506 F.2d 658, 660 (2d Cir. 1974), we conclude that review now of the trust fund and \u201cat risk\u201d issues would be inappropriate. First, our ruling on subject matter jurisdiction may end the federal court litigation. (It is unclear whether any plaintiffs will seek to proceed on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.) More importantly, the district judge did not assess the merits of either motion to strike, and we note that he has reserved decision on defendants\u2019 motion for reargument of these questions, pending decision of this Court on the question of jurisdiction. In all, we think the wiser course is for this Court not to pass on them at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1069-11\">.

Many aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 case are troublesome, because plaintiffs seek unusual relief, both procedural and substantive, as to which I express no view. But the issue now before us is far narrower, and raises more familiar considerations. That issue is whether a federal district court has federal question jurisdiction over the action, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a), because the action arises under federal common law. I agree with District Judge Pratt that this case should be tried in federal court under rules of federal common law. I therefore dissent from the opinion of the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-12\">That the present case is <em>sui generis, </em>and national in its proportions, is evident from the complaint itself. The defendants in this action are five of the largest chemical companies in the nation, all of which admittedly manufactured \u201cAgent Orange,\u201d a defoliant, for use by our nation\u2019s armed forces in Vietnam between 1962 and 1971. Plaintiffs\u2019 suit is brought on behalf of veterans, living and dead, and their parents, wives, widows, orphans, and children, living, dead, and stillborn. Plaintiffs allege that the Agent Orange supplied by the defendants was \u201ccontaminated with . . . polychlorinat-ed dibenzo-p-dioxins . .. and polychlori-nated dibenzo furans . . . including 2,3,7,8,-tetra-chloro dibenzo p-dioxin (. . . \u201cDiox<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>in\u201d), one of the most toxic substances ever developed by man.\u201d Plaintiffs further allege that as a result of exposure to Agent Orange, they incurred, or have suffered an increased risk of incurring, cancer, genetic damage, and an early death. Judge Pratt noted that the defendants are \u201cfacing aggregate claims which may eventually amount to billions of dollars.\u201d As the majority notes, the complaint identifies fifteen groups of plaintiffs, totalling over 800 plaintiffs who, we are told, have filed complaints in 25 judicial districts all across the country. By this time it is probable that 30 to 40 districts are affected, since additional plaintiffs appear daily; plaintiffs\u2019 counsel assures us that many more complaints would already have been filed, but for the request of Judge Pratt not to do so until the question of class certification has been resolved. How many plaintiffs will ultimately come forward is unclear. Present plaintiffs assert that as many as 2,400,000 men and women who served in the armed forces could be eligible to sue defendants-not to mention their parents, dependents, and dead or stillborn children. The national dimensions of the case as pleaded are too obvious to escape notice. Identical complaints have been filed, <em>inter alia, </em>in Massachusetts and California, in Illinois and Texas, and we are informed that the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has ordered all Agent Orange cases consolidated before Judge Pratt. The plaintiffs in these cases complain of injuries sustained as the result of service in our nation\u2019s military, in a national endeavor in a foreign land. To the non-legal mind, it would be an odd proposition indeed that this litigation, so patently of national scope and concern, should not be tried in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">As for the legal mind, all involved in this case-the parties, Judge Pratt, and the panel on appeal-appear to agree that federal question jurisdiction depends upon whether a federal common law rule of product liability should be applied. See <em>Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, </em>406 U.S. 91, 98-101, 92 S.Ct. 1385, 1390-1391, 31 L.Ed.2d 712 (1972); <em>Ivy Broadcasting Company v. American Telephone and Telegraph Company, </em>391 F.2d 486, 492-93 (2d Cir. 1968). Whether a federal rule should be applied, in turn, depends on three factors, as discerned in <em>Miree v. DeKalb County, </em>433 U.S. 25, 97 S.Ct. 2490, 53 L.Ed.2d 557 (1977), and <em>Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corporation, </em>384 U.S. 63, 86 S.Ct. 1301, 16 L.Ed.2d 369 (1966):</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">(1) the existence of a substantial federal interest in the outcome of the litigation;</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">(2) the effect on this federal interest should state law be applied; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">(3) the effect on state interests should state law be displaced by federal common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">Judge Pratt, in his thorough and able opinion, analyzed all these factors and concluded that the fashioning of a federal common law rule was warranted on the facts of the present case. In a closely analogous case, <em>Owens v. Haas, </em>601 F.2d 1242 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 980, 100 S.Ct. 483, 62 L.Ed.2d 407 (1979), this court recently arrived at the same result. <em>Owens </em>is instructive because it represents the most recent examination by this court of the \u201cfederal interest\u201d doctrine discussed in <em>Miree </em>and <em>Wallis. </em>A review of the <em>Owens </em>facts and holding shows that Judge Pratt\u2019s analysis of the factors set forth above was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">In <em>Owens, </em>plaintiff was a federal prisoner who was injured by county jail officials who were working under contract with the federal government. Plaintiff sued for damages as, <em>inter alia, </em>a third-party beneficiary of that contract. On that theory, the \u201cfirst question\u201d before this court was whether plaintiff\u2019s claims were \u201ca matter of federal law or of state law\u201d; the question was posed \u201cboth as a guide to contract interpretation and as an alternate basis for jurisdiction in the district court.\u201d 601 F.2d at 1248. Writing for the panel, the late Judge Smith noted that \u201cthe federal government owes a duty of reasonable care to safeguard the security of prisoners under its control,\u201d and discerned a \u201cfederal regulatory scheme\u201d for maintaining the health and well-being of such prisoners. <em>Id. </em>at 1249. Judge Smith then concluded that this regulatory scheme generated \u201ca federal interest in assuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>uniform treatment of federal prisoners,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that that interest, combined with the government\u2019s duty of reasonable care, meant that \u201cfederal rights and obligations [did] \u2018hinge on the outcome\u2019 of litigation in this area,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1249-50. As a result, the court held that federal common law should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">Looking, as the <em>Owens </em>court did, to <em>Miree </em>and <em>Wallis, </em>the first question we must answer is whether the federal government has a \u201csubstantial interest\u201d in the outcome of this litigation. It is plain that this question must be answered affirmatively. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Company, </em>332 U.S. 301, 67 S.Ct. 1604, 91 L.Ed. 2067 (1947),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1073-6\">Perhaps no relation between the Government and a citizen is more distinctively federal in character than that between it and members of its armed forces. To whatever extent state law may apply to govern the relations between soldiers or others in the armed forces and persons outside them or non-federal governmental agencies, the scope, nature, legal incidents and consequences of the relation between persons in service and the government are fundamentally derived from federal sources and governed by federal authority. See <em>Tar-ble\u2019s Case, </em>80 U.S. 397, 13 Wall. 397, 20 L.Ed. 597; <em>Kurtz v. Moffitt, </em>115 U.S. 487, 6 S.Ct. 148, 29 L.Ed. 458. So also we think are interferences with that relationship such as the facts of this case involve. For, as the Federal Government has the exclusive power to establish and define the relationship by virtue of its military and other powers, equally clearly it has power in execution of the same functions to protect the relation once formed from harms inflicted by others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a3l-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>332 U.S. at 305-06, 67 S.Ct. at 1606-1607 (footnotes omitted). This obviously federal relationship does not depend primarily upon any particular statute, but rather inheres in the federal government\u2019s exclusive capacity to wage war. But in the case before us this relationship can also be analyzed in terms of <em>Owens. </em>In <em>Owens, </em>the federal government was found to owe \u201ca duty of reasonable care\u201d to federal prisoners, a duty stemming from statutory enactment, specifically 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Similarly, the federal government here is under a statutory obligation to provide \u201can improved and uniform program of medical . . . care for members [of the uniformed services] and certain former members of those services, and for their dependents.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1071. Further, in <em>Owens </em>this court discerned in \u201cthe scheme of regulation of federal prisons [an indication of] congressional intent to provide some general protections for federal prisoners.\u201d 601 F.2d at 1249. Similarly, in the present case there is a statutory scheme to provide \u201cgeneral protections\u201d for members and veterans of the uniformed services. See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1071-87 (program of medical care for members of uniformed services and dependents); 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 310-15 (schedule of compensation to veterans and dependents for wartime disabilities); \u00a7\u00a7 321-22 (schedule of compensation to survivors of veterans for wartime death); \u00a7\u00a7 331-35 (same, peacetime disabilities); \u00a7\u00a7 341-42 (same, peacetime death); 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 454(a) (requiring adequate provision of shelter, sanitary facilities, water supplies, heating and lighting arrangements, medical care, and hospital accommodations before persons can be inducted into military service). See also the various regulations governing the welfare of soldiers, all of which are, of course, promulgated under authority granted by Congress. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 121 (President\u2019s power to prescribe regulations); \u00a7 3012(g) (Secretary of Army\u2019s power to prescribe regulations).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Secretary of the Army is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>quired by statute to be responsible for the \u201cwelfare, preparedness, and effectiveness of the Army.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3012(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">The majority concludes that on the facts of this case \u201cthere is no federal interest in uniformity for its own sake,\u201d and that there is no federal \u201csubstantive interest in the content of the rules to be applied.\u201d I disagree on both counts. As to uniformity of treatment, this court noted in <em>Owens </em>that \u201c[bjecause there is a federal regulatory scheme, there is a federal interest in assuring uniform treatment of federal prisoners.\u201d 601 F.2d at 1249. It is anomalous for this court to hold, on the one hand, that the federal government has an interest in \u201cuniform treatment\u201d of its <em>prisoners </em>sufficient to warrant the use of a federal rule of recovery, and, on the other hand, that the federal government has no such interest in \u201cuniform treatment\u201d of its <em>soldiers. </em>The majority suggests that the anomaly here lies \u201cwith Congress, which has made specific provisions for the protection of the government\u2019s prisoners but not for its soldiers.\u201d But a review of the statutory and regulatory provisions cited above, especially 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1071-87 (medical care), \u00a7 3012(bXl) (Secretary of Army\u2019s responsibility for \u201cwelfare\u201d of Army personnel), and 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 310-15, 321-22, 331-35, 341-42 (veterans\u2019 and survivors\u2019 compensation), as well as myriad, detailed Army Regulations, demonstrates beyond doubt that Congress has made specific provisions for the protection of its soldiers, both directly and by delegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">The majority also concludes that because the government has arguably conflicting substantive interests in the outcome of the litigation, \u201cthe federal policy is not yet identifiable.\u201d The allegedly conflicting federal interests are in the welfare of veterans and in the welfare of suppliers of war materiel. But that the plaintiff veterans and the defendant contractors have opposing interests in this litigation hardly means that the paramount federal interest is somehow divided or self-contradictory. The United States has a clear interest in the protection of its soldiers from harm caused by defective war materiel. What other interests does the United States arguably have that might conflict with this clear interest? One such interest might be in seeing that defendants, as suppliers of war materiel, are treated fairly. But that interest cannot be said to conflict with the government\u2019s interest in the safety of its soldiers. Another such interest might be in preventing defendants from being driven to bankruptcy by large damage awards to Agent Orange plaintiffs, who have already made claims assertedly greater than defendants\u2019 combined liquid assets. This, I take it, is what the majority means by its reference to the federal interest in the \u201cwelfare\u201d of defendants. But this interest lies in the future, and in the realm of speculation. There will be time enough to deal with the potential impact of defendants\u2019 financial liability if and when they incur any, if it is truly in the interest of the United States to do so. By contrast, plaintiffs\u2019 injuries-assuming for the moment that plaintiffs have a viable cause of action-lie in large part in the present, and in the realm of the concrete. The conclusion seems inescapable to me that the United States\u2019 interest in the \u201cwelfare\u201d of defendants cannot approach, either in magnitude or in quality, its interest in the welfare of the Agent Orange plaintiffs. In short, in the case before us the paramount interests of the United States are in the welfare of its veterans and in their fair and uniform treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">Having discerned a significant federal interest, we are next required to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>whether or not a \u201csignificant conflict\u201d exists between that interest and the application of state law. This factor is not reached by the majority. But that such a conflict does exist in the present case can hardly be disputed. Given the \u201cdistinctively federal\u201d character of the relationship between the federal government and its soldiers, there is an inherent federal interest in the uniform definition of the aspects of that relationship involved in this case. As noted earlier, this inherent interest in uniformity was observed by this court in <em>Owens, </em>601 F.2d at 1249. The application of state law to the present case would severely frustrate this federal interest: If state law is applied in the present litigation, and assuming again that the allegations in the complaint are true, then veterans may well be subjected to sharply differing rules of law in the pursuit of their remedies. For example, the law of the various states is in flux, diverging widely in the definition of what constitutes a \u201cdefective\u201d product-especially with respect to defectively designed products- and in the availability of defenses based on the \u201cstate of the art\u201d and technological feasibility. See United States Department of Commerce, Interagency Task Force on Product Liability, Product Liability: Final Report II-6-10 (1977) (varying state law respecting \u201cdefectiveness,\u201d especially in design-defect cases); <em>id. </em>at 11-11-12 (same, respecting defense of \u201cstate of the art\u201d). As a result, if the laws of 30 or 40 state jurisdictions are separately applied, veterans\u2019 recoveries for Agent Orange injuries will vary widely-despite the fact that these soldiers fought shoulder to shoulder, without regard to state citizenship, in a national endeavor abroad. In sum, the federal interest here in uniformity would be defeated by the application of discrete and differing state laws. It is thus not necessary to reach the question whether the other federal interest present in this case-in seeing that soldiers are not harmed by defective war materiel-would be frustrated by the application of state law. Because the federal interest in uniformity would be defeated by such an application, I conclude that the first two requirements of <em>Miree </em>and <em>Wallis, </em>as interpreted by this court in <em>Owens, </em>are satisfied, as Judge Pratt concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">The third and last factor involves the extent to which state interests would be affected, if state law were to be \u201cdisplaced\u201d by federal common law in the present case. This factor is also not reached by the majority. I agree with Judge Pratt\u2019s conclusion that the claims made by plaintiffs in this unique and unprecedented litigation do not fall within the developed area of state tort law. As noted above, the states\u2019 product liability law is in flux; with respect to a case as novel as the one before us, a consistent and established body of state law is even less discernible. Accordingly, I think that Judge Pratt was correct in holding that the application of federal common law to the case before us would not \u201cdisplace\u201d state law, because there is no substantial body of state law on this point to be displaced. I thus conclude that all three factors, accepted by the majority as the proper analytical framework, point to the use of a federal common law rule in the present case, giving rise to federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">Because I conclude that the district court does have jurisdiction over the case before us, I dissent from the opinion of the majority.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4042 provides, in pertinent part, that the \u201cBureau of Prisons . .. shall ... provide for the safekeeping, care, ... subsistence, ...
