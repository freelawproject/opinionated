On March 17, 1978 Cherry petitioned the district court for writ of habeas corpus alleging among other grounds that his retrial following a mistrial unconstitutionally placed him twice in jeopardy for the same offense. The district court denied relief but a panel of this court reversed. 613 F.2d 1262 (5th Cir. 1980). On consideration by the court en banc we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-24\">I. THE TRIAL AND REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b491-25\">Armed and wearing a mask, Cherry and two accomplices abducted William Strickland at gunpoint and ordered him into a stolen automobile as Strickland left his job for the evening. They took him back to his place of employment and forced him to open its door and safe. They then stole over $11,000 in cash and left Strickland tied up by the safe. Although he could not positively identify Cherry\u2019s face because of the ski mask Strickland made a positive identification of his shoes and voice and testified that Cherry\u2019s build and facial shape were identical to that of one of the robbers. An eyewitness positively identified Cherry as a passenger in the stolen getaway vehicle. Cherry\u2019s fingerprints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>were found in the getaway car when it was located abandoned an hour later. At the time of Cherry\u2019s subsequent arrest he and his wife were carrying $1,230 in cash. After his arrest he offered his cellmate $2,000 to \u201ctake the rap\u201d and described to the cellmate how the robbery occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">During Cherry\u2019s first trial in October 1963 the trial judge received information that a juror\u2019s mother had just died.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge had the jury retire to the jury room, called counsel to the bench and informed them of the development. He inquired as to whether the state and defense would agree to dismiss that juror and continue with eleven. After some discussion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cherry\u2019s counsel informed the court that he desired to continue the trial with the original twelve jurors as prescribed by law. The judge then proceeded to disperse the jurors with the instructions given in a capital case and directed them to return to court at 9:30 o\u2019clock the following morning. During the overnight recess the court confirmed that the juror\u2019s mother had in fact died. He excused the juror from further participation in the case and on the next morning when court reconvened he declared a mistrial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His written order is set out as an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">When he was retried in November 1963, Cherry was convicted of armed robbery on the basis of overwhelming evidence. He appealed to the Supreme Court of Georgia which held that he had not sufficiently presented the issue of double jeopardy to require review. It rejected Cherry\u2019s various other contentions and affirmed his conviction. <em>Cherry v. State, </em>220 Ga. 695, 141 S.E.2d 412 (1965). Ten years later in a state habeas corpus petition Cherry raised only the double jeopardy issue. The trial court denied the writ and the state supreme court denied a certificate of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Cherry currently is incarcerated in Texas under a life sentence for a state conviction there. Georgia has lodged a detainer for his challenged sentence to commence upon his release by Texas. <em>See Braden v. Thirtieth Judicial Circuit Court, </em>410 U.S. 484, 488-89, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 1126-27, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Cherry filed this federal habeas petition in 1978 challenging his conviction on the basis of double jeopardy and claiming errors involving a police officer\u2019s testimony, prose-cutorial misconduct, the disqualification of jurors, and the state\u2019s failure to disclose a plea bargain with his cellmate in violation of <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). The district court found against Cherry on the merits of each of his contentions except for the <em>Giglio </em>issue which it declined to consider, finding that Cherry had purposefully bypassed his available state remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">Cherry produced no transcript of the proceedings leading up to the mistrial in his first ease. When his petition was filed in district court, the magistrate issued a routine order directing respondent to file a transcript. Six weeks later the magistrate issued a second order specifically requiring that the transcript of the October 1963 proceedings which ended in a mistrial be furnished. Because of the passage of fifteen years, deaths and changes in personnel, neither a transcript nor the court reporter\u2019s notes could be located. When the case reached the district judge, he issued a further order requiring that an exhaustive search be conducted. The search was accomplished but produced no results. At this point respondent urged that the petition be dismissed under Rule 9(a) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases because the lapse of time obviously had prejudiced his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ability to comply with the court\u2019s directive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cherry conceded that a diligent search had been made. Countering respondent\u2019s assertion of prejudice he urged that the absence of a transcript not be held against respondent alleging \u201cthe only pertinent part of the record relating to the mistrial is transcribed within the trial court\u2019s Order of Mistrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We adopt that portion of the panel decision which holds that because Cherry had not exhausted his state remedies as to the <em>Giglio </em>issue it was not necessary to consider the bypass question. The panel majority also correctly concluded that this court is not foreclosed from considering Cherry\u2019s double jeopardy claim since the district court reached the merits of an exhausted claim in this mixed petition, <em>Galtieri v. Wainwright, </em>582 F.2d 348, 362 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc). We have also considered the other contentions presented by Cherry\u2019s petition which were not considered by the panel and find that they present no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">II. MISTRIAL ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"AGZ\">Cherry relies on an application of the constitutional principle that the Supreme Court explicated over 150 years ago in <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">We think, that in all cases of this nature, the law has invested courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABs\">Absent prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, a defendant\u2019s motion or consent to mistrial ordinarily is assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution. Where, as here, the mistrial does not result from defendant\u2019s motion, the <em>Perez </em>doctrine of manifest necessity controls. <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 485, 91 S.Ct. 547, 557, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971) (plurality opinion); <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 606-07, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 1078-80, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">At the critical moment during Cherry\u2019s first trial there was a manifest necessity that the trial judge do something. Common experience teaches that the sudden death of a juror\u2019s parent would so emotionally incapacitate the juror as to make his uninterrupted service impractical. It is unlikely that he could continue to serve in a manner that would insure a fair trial to either party. The question on which our attention focuses, therefore, is not that the trial judge took some action, but on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>nature of the specific action and the manner in which such action was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The necessity for some action does not automatically justify the granting of a mistrial. <em>United States v. Jorn </em>and <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 469-70, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 1072-73, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973), demonstrate that before granting a mistrial it is incumbent on the trial judge to consider available alternatives. The circumstances in the case before us are in marked contrast with those in <em>Jorn, </em>however, where the trial judge abruptly declared a mistrial without discussion with the attorneys so that witnesses in the case might consult counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKN\">[I]t seems abundantly apparent that the trial judge made no effort to exercise a sound discretion to assure that, taking all the circumstances into account, there was a manifest necessity for the <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of this mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. at 487, 91 S.Ct. at 558. Here, the action of the trial court was not abrupt, but was taken only after inquiry and overnight deliberation, after at least some consultation with counsel during which Cherry\u2019s counsel rejected one available alternative, and after Cherry\u2019s counsel was afforded but declined the opportunity to make a motion. The present situation does not involve any prosecutorial or judicial overreaching. Cherry\u2019s particular contention is that the trial judge erred in selecting the alternative of a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Recent amplification of the controlling principles is found in <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">The state trial judge\u2019s mistrial declaration is not subject to collateral attack in a federal court simply because he failed ... to articulate on the record all the factors which informed the deliberate exercise of his discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 517, 98 S.Ct. at 836 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, a trial judge does not err for failing to consider or adopt a specific alternative for a mistrial. <em>Grooms v. Wainwright, </em>610 F.2d 344 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 953, 100 S.Ct. 1605, 63 L.Ed.2d 789 (1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pridgeon, </em>462 F.2d 1094, 1095 (5th Cir. 1972). This circuit held in <em>Grooms,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">Even though other trial judges might have used cautionary instructions or other measures short of a mistrial to correct prejudice to the jury, a judge need not expressly consider these alternatives to satisfy the fifth amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 346. While <em>Jorn </em>requires that alternatives to a mistrial be considered, we think it also clear that the Constitution does not require canvassing of specific alternatives or articulation of their inadequacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">Manifest necessity does not mean absolute necessity that a judge declare a mistrial; \u201cwe assume that there are degrees of necessity and we require a \u2018high degree\u2019 before concluding that a mistrial is appropriate.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 506, 98 S.Ct. at 830 (footnote omitted). In reviewing such an action by a state trial judge, we must accord \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the trial judge\u2019s \u201c \u2018sound discretion\u2019 in declaring a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514, 98 S.Ct. at 834.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A trial judge has acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>within his sound discretion in rejecting possible alternatives and in granting a mistrial, if reasonable judges could differ about the proper disposition, even though \u201c[i]n a strict, literal sense, the mistrial [is] not \u2018necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 511, 98 S.Ct. at 833. This great deference means that the availability of another alternative does not without more render a mistrial order an abuse of sound discretion. <em>See United States v. Pridgeon, </em>462 F.2d at 1095; <em>Jones v. Anderson, </em>404 F.Supp. 182, 187-88 (S.D.Ga.1974), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>522 F.2d 181 (5th Cir. 1975). Deference to the judge\u2019s sound discretion also precludes a reviewing court from assuming, in the absence of record evidence, that the trial judge deprived a defendant of constitutional rights or of federal statutory protections. <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 314-15, 83 S.Ct. 745, 757-58, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963); <em>see Norvell v. Illinois, </em>373 U.S. 420, 424, 83 S.Ct. 1366, 1368, 10 L.Ed.2d 456 (1963); <em>e. g., Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 516-17, 98 S.Ct. at 835-36; <em>Gori v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 364, 367, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 1525, 6 L.Ed.2d 901 (1961).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the habeas corpus petitioner carries the burden of establishing a prima facie deprivation, his self-serving assertions, without record support, do \u201cnot alone cast sufficient doubt on the fairness of that [mistrial] to warrant . . . the granting of the requested relief.\u201d <em>Clayton v. Blackburn, </em>578 F.2d 117, 120 (5th Cir. 1978). <em>See also Norvell </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>373 U.S. at 424, 83 S.Ct. at 1368; <em>Bowen v. United States, </em>192 F.2d 515, 517 (5th Cir. 1951), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 943, 72 S.Ct. 1036, 96 L.Ed. 1348 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">We do not have here a situation like <em>Jorn, </em>\u201cwith action by a trial judge that can fairly be described as erratic.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. at 469, 93 S.Ct. at 1072. On the contrary, the judge in Cherry\u2019s case was acting in accord with the common practice of declaring a mistrial when, for good reason, a judge or juror ceases to attend, <em>see e. g., Smith v. Mississippi, </em>478 F.2d 88 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1113, 94 S.Ct. 844, 38 L.Ed.2d 740 (1973) (juror bias); <em>United States v. Lynch, </em>598 F.2d 132 (D.C.Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 939, 99 S.Ct. 1287, 59 L.Ed.2d 498 (1979) (illness of judge); <em>United States v. Potash, </em>118 F.2d 54 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>313 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 1103, 85 L.Ed. 1540 (1941) (illness of juror). The proposition that the legitimate unavailability of a juror is \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d permitting retrial has been widely accepted, in varying formulations, e. <em>g., Whitfield v. Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>486 F.2d 1118, 1121 (4th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 876, 95 S.Ct. 139, 42 L.Ed.2d 116 (1974); <em>Oelke v. United States, </em>389 F.2d 668, 671 (9th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 1029, 88 S.Ct. 1420, 20 L.Ed.2d 286 (1968); <em>Larios v. Superior Court, </em>24 Cal.3d 324, 330, 594 P.2d 491, 494, 155 Cal.Rptr. 374, 377 (1979); <em>State v. Critelli, </em>237 Iowa 1271, 1278, 24 N.W.2d 113, 117 (1946); Comment, <em>Retrial After Mistrial: The Double Jeopardy Doctrine of Manifest Necessity, </em>45 Miss.L.J. 1272, 1282 (1974); 21 Am.Jur.2d <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 203 (1965); for older cases see <em>Stocks v. State, </em>91 Ga. 831, 18 S.E. 847 (1893); Annot., 53 A.L.R. 1062 (1928).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Recent Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>preme Court cases have cast no doubt on the vitality of the basic proposition, <em>see Gori v. United States, </em>367 U.S. at 372-73, 81 S.Ct. at 1528 (Douglas, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In short, we are faced with a trial judge who discussed the matter with the attorneys, confirmed the information regarding the death, and ruled in accordance with a proposition voiced by both federal and state courts. There is no indication of judicial or prosecutorial overreaching, nor even any evidence that the prosecution profited at all by the declaration of mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Although another judge may have granted a continuance when faced with the emergency which arose in Cherry\u2019s first trial, a reasonable judge might have ordered a mistrial, <em>see Smith v. Mississippi, </em>478 F.2d at 96. Even without a transcript we know that the trial judge considered other alternatives. We do not know all the alternatives he may have considered because of the absence of any transcript, but his actions amply demonstrate the exercise of sound discretion in the face of manifest necessity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. at 514, 98 S.Ct. at 834; <em>United States v. Prid-geon, </em>462 F.2d at 1095; <em>Jones v. Anderson, </em>404 F.Supp. at 188 (When \u201cthe trial judge . . . was presented with a situation of no realistic alternative to a mistrial as a result of ... the petitioner\u2019s insistence on a twelve-person jury . . . \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 required a mistrial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">The following is the full text of the mistrial order:</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">THE STATE OF GEORGIA ) ) vs. ) ) JAMES WALTER CHERRY ) _)</p>\n<p id=\"ANd\">No. 84458</p>\n<p id=\"Avj\">FULTON SUPERIOR COURT</p>\n<p id=\"AVy\">(ROBBERY)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-16\">ORDER OF MISTRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"Ag-\">At approximately 4:30 P.M. yesterday afternoon while on a recess in the trial of this case, the Court received a message from the Clerk of this Court informing it that the mother of one of our jurors [had died], the juror being Mr. Royce Terry, and having been selected in the trial of this case and actually serving on the jury, two witnesses having been examined on the witness stand and the third witness being on the witness stand at the time of the recess. The Court made a preliminary telephonic investigation confirming the tragedy during the recess to determine the veracity of the message relating to the death of the juror\u2019s mother, and the Court concluded at that time that Mrs. Terry, the mother of the juror had passed away in Fulton County, the same being in the jurisdiction of this Court, a short time prior to the calling of the recess and during the trial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-17\">In coming back into the courtroom, the Court informed counsel for the defendant and counsel for the State about the death of the mother of one of the jurors, at which time the Court asked counsel for the defendant as to whether or not he would waive the presence of the juror; namely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Mr. Royce Terry, and whether or not he would be willing to proceed with the trial of the case with eleven jurors, at which time counsel for the defendant informed the Court that he wished to proceed with the trial of the case with the twelve jurors previously selected, at which time the Court proceeded to disperse the jurors with proper instructions in a capital case and directed them to return to the Court at 9:30 o\u2019clock this morning, the same being October 24, 1963, the second day of said trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Counsel for the defendant did not make any motion in the presence of the jury or objection in the presence of jury to their being dispersed and since the jury was dispersed yesterday afternoon, the Court has definitely confirmed that the mother of Mr. Royce Terry did pass away at the previously stated time during the trial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">This Court at the present time feels that it would be inhuman, indecent, inappropriate, cruel and an injustice to require Mr. Royce Terry to have been in Court this morning. Therefore, after absolute confirmation by the Court, the Court has excused Mr. Terry from further jury service in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">It is the opinion of this Court that this is a providential cause and that this case should not proceed further at this time, and, therefore, at this time, before any further examination of witnesses, or any further action in this case, this Court hereby declares a mistrial in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">This the 24th day of October, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">/s/ Luther Alverson</p>\n<p id=\"AVS\">JUDGE, S.C.A.J.C.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\">. The information was received by the trial judge at around 4:30 p. m. on the first day of trial while the third witness was testifying.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">. Cherry\u2019s petitions for habeas corpus reflect that at this point there was some discussion between court and counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-12\">. The record before us does not indicate that Cherry\u2019s counsel offered any suggestion, proposal or motion, and, except for his objection to proceeding with eleven jurors, it does not indicate that he made any objection. The Order of Mistrial discloses that his counsel was given an opportunity to make a motion before the jury was dispersed on October 23, 1963.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\">. Although the district court did not rule on the state\u2019s motion, we note that Cherry\u2019s petition may well have been subject to dismissal under Rule 9(a). There are two requirements for 9(a) dismissal: the petitioner must have unreasonably delayed filing his petition, without good justification or excuse, and the state must demonstrate that it has suffered actual prejudice from the delay. <em>Mayola v. Alabama, </em>623 F.2d 992, 999 (5th Cir. 1980). Cherry\u2019s conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia on March 3, 1965. The state petition for habeas corpus, with which he exhausted his state remedy, was filed on April 4, 1975, a delay of ten years. The federal petition before us was not filed until March 17, 1978. Making all allowances for the difficulties facing a pro se petitioner, Cherry\u2019s lateness is simply not adequately explained. The prejudice claimed by the state is the absence of a transcript of the first trial. The Advisory Committee Note to Rule 9 explicitly deals with this situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">The petitioner . .. may at some date, perhaps ten or fifteen years after conviction, decide to challenge the state court judgment.... When [claims] are asserted after the passage of many years, both the attorney for the defendant and the state have difficulty in ascertaining what the facts are .... The court reporter\u2019s notes may have been lost or destroyed, thus eliminating any exact record of what transpired.... As a consequence, there is obvious difficulty in investigating petitioner\u2019s allegations. The interest of both the petitioner and the government can best be served if claims are raised while, the evidence is still fresh.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\">. Although not required, it is probably desirable for the trial judge to make as complete a record as possible. The desirability of such practice, however, could not have been fully appreciated by the judge who presided over Cherry\u2019s first trial which predated <em>Jorn </em>by eight years and <em>Arizona </em>by fifteen. Indeed, at the time of the trial the fifth amendment guarantee against double jeopardy had not yet been held applicable to the states under the fourteenth amendment. <em>Compare Palko v. Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937) <em>with Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969). Had the trial judge looked to federal law for guid-anee anyway, he would have observed that in the most recent Supreme Court decision on point, <em>Gori v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 364, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 6 L.Ed.2d 901 (1961), the court upheld a <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of mistrial under the doctrine of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d when the trial judge not only failed to discuss all the factors involved in his decision, but neglected even to state the grounds for the mistrial. That the judge in Cherry\u2019s trial nevertheless took the trouble to review as much of the circumstances as he did in his order of mistrial demonstrates a high degree of care and prudence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b494-14\">.

However, it must be borne in mind that we sit as a federal court reviewing state procedures. A state supreme court can impose more rigorous standards under its own constitution that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the federal constitution demands, <em>see generally Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>447 U.S. 74, 80, 100 S.Ct. 2035, 2040-41, 64 L.Ed.2d 741 (1980).

RUBIN and KRAVITCH, Circuit Judges, join, concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">In 1978, the petitioner Cherry sought federal habeas review of a 1963 state conviction. In my opinion, our original panel opinion, 613 F.2d 1262, correctly held that the state trial judge\u2019s sua sponte grant of a mistrial was violative of standards applicable to the grant of a mistrial for \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d, as enunciated in 1971 by <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543. Nevertheless, I concur in the majority\u2019s result, which denies habeas relief, because I do not believe that <em>Jorn </em>retroactively applies to the 1963 mistrial so as, in the face of a silent record, to require an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">My chief reservations as to the majority\u2019s articulation are (a) that, in terms, it does not restrict its justification of the mistrial to those that occurred <em>pre-Jorn, </em>nor (b) does it in terms restrict its standard of double-jeopardy review of sua sponte mistrials to those collaterally attacked by post-conviction petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b497-18\">The petitioner Cherry was convicted of robbery in 1963. The conviction resulted after a second trial, the trial judge having declared a mistrial after the first day .of the first trial. The basis of the trial judge\u2019s declaration of a mistrial was the death of a juror\u2019s mother. On the morning of the trial\u2019s second day, the judge dismissed the juror from the trial because it would have been inhumane and inappropriate to require that juror to be present in court that morning. Under the record before us, the judge did so ex parte and without giving counsel for the defendant an opportunity to suggest an alternative to mistrial, such as a recess for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-19\">Given the circumstance that the trial occurred in 1963, the trial judge\u2019s ex parte grant of a mistrial for such reason, without consulting the defendant\u2019s counsel, was in accord with the usual practice, <em>Gori v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 364, 81 S.Ct. 1523, 6 L.Ed.2d 901 (1961), before the decision of our Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971). There, however, the nation\u2019s highest tribunal in enunciating Fifth Amendment rights of an individual not \u201cto be twice put in jeopardy of life and limb\u201d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>pointed out that the Perez doctrine permitting declaration of a mistrial because of manifest necessity</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">stands as a command to trial judges not to foreclose the defendant\u2019s option until a scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion [is made].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">400 U.S. at 485, 91 S.Ct. at 557. The court emphasized an accused\u2019s \u201c \u2018valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal\u2019 \u201d, and continued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">If that right to go to a particular tribunal is valued, it is because, independent of the threat of bad-faith conduct by judge of prosecutor, the defendant has a significant interest in the decision whether or not to take the case from the jury when circumstances occur which might be thought to warrant a declaration of mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Had the present ex parte grant of mistrial happened after <em>Jorn, </em>in my opinion, it would constitute an unquestionable violation of the accused\u2019s double jeopardy rights as articulated by <em>Jorn. </em>That decision qualified the former view (see <em>Gori, supra) </em>that a constitutional issue arose as to the exercise of the broad discretion only if there was an abuse in the exercise of that discretion. Unless restricted to the present factual context, the majority\u2019s methodology of review (as to whether a sua sponte declaration of mistrial offends the accused\u2019s double jeopardy rights) in effect reinstates <em>Gor\u00ed </em>and disregards <em>Jorn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">As I read <em>Jorn, </em>before a defendant may be deprived of his constitutional right under the double jeopardy clause to have his trial completed by the particular tribunal first seated, the district judge must take into consideration the defendant\u2019s significant interests by affording him an opportunity to suggest consideration of consequences less severe to him than a mistrial. Only where, <em>after </em>that, \u201ca scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion leads to the conclusion that the ends of public justice would not be served by a continuation of the proceedings\u201d, <em>Jorn, </em>400 U.S. at 485, 91 S.Ct. at 557, should the trial court foreclose the defendant\u2019s option to have the trial completed before the tribunal first chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">In <em>United States v. Starling, </em>571 F.2d 934 (5th Cir. 1978), after exhaustive and scholarly analysis of the double jeopardy-\u201cmanifest necessity\u201d mistrial issue, this circuit adhered to the interpretation above expressed. There, on appeal from a conviction on second trial following a mistrial on the first, the second trial and conviction was reversed, as offending Fifth Amendment double jeopardy principles. We there noted the reviewing court\u2019s obligation to satisfy itself that sound discretion was exercised in accord with constitutional principles and, in reversing, did so because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aab\">[a]ppellant\u2019s trial was terminated and the jury dismissed after only a brief and confusing exchange between the court and jury. The court did not give counsel for either side an opportunity to address the possibility of bias or the need for a mistrial. No alternatives to a mistrial were considered. Indeed, \u201chad . . . the defendant [been disposed] to object to the discharge of the jury, there would have been no opportunity to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. at 487, 91 S.Ct. at 558. The record reflects a total lack of awareness of the double-jeopardy consequences of the court\u2019s action and of the manifest necessity standard. Moreover, it shows a crucial failure to consider the appellant\u2019s protected interest in having the trial concluded in a single proceeding. Under these circumstances, the very basis for appellate deference to the court\u2019s determination that a mistrial was required is diminished beyond the point of significance. See <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>435 U.S. [497] at 510 and n. 28, 98 S.Ct. 824 [at 832, 54 L.Ed.2d 717].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">571 F.2d 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">I assume the majority\u2019s opinion is not intended to modify <em>Starling\u2019s </em>interpretation of the controlling Supreme Court jurisprudence, because this leading circuit authority on the issue is not cited in its opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Further, six other circuits have likewise recently held that, in evaluating manifest necessity, a judge must give the defendant an opportunity to object and must explore all feasible alternatives before declaring a mistrial, otherwise a second trial violates the double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Harris v. Young, </em>607 F.2d 1081 (4th Cir. 1979); <em>U. S. v. Pierce, </em>593 F.2d 415 (1st Cir. 1979); <em>U. S. v. Sanders, </em>591 F.2d 1293 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>U. S. v. McKoy, </em>591 F.2d 218 (3d Cir. 1979); <em>U. S. v. Horn, </em>583 F.2d 1124 (10th Cir. 1978); <em>Dunk-erley v. Hogan, </em>579 F.2d 141 (2d Cir. 1978). If the majority\u2019s rationale is expanded beyond application to the present factual context alone before us, it is in conflict not only with the <em>Jorn </em>interpretations of these other six circuits, as well as with what until now has been regarded as our own controlling Fifth Circuit precedent in <em>Starling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">My difficulty with the majority opinion is that its language (viewed outside of its limited factual context) seems to justify a sua sponte declaration of mistrial by a trial judge under present circumstances, not only in the present <em>pre-Jorn </em>1963 trial, but also in <em>post-Jorn </em>trials, including those conducted after we hand down this opinion. Here, because we determine the trial judge <em>might </em>reasonably have dismissed the juror and have therefore declared a mistrial, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s constitutional protection against double jeopardy was not offended \u2014 even though the record does not show that the trial court seriously considered alternatives to a mistrial (other than attempting to secure the defendant\u2019s consent to continuance of the trial before eleven jurors), or that he articulated reasons for foregoing these alternatives; and even though (so far as the record shows) defense counsel did not have an opportunity to object to the mistrial before it was granted, or to suggest alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">With respect, I think the majority paints too broadly. As articulated, its rationale is contrary to <em>Jorn, </em>if applied outside of the present factual context. If applied as the criteria for constitutional violation in mistrials for manifest necessity granted in the present day, the majority\u2019s rationale has effectively eroded the <em>Jorn </em>-mandated requirement that the defendant\u2019s interest be consulted before the trial judge declares a mistrial because of an alleged manifest necessity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">I do not read <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), as exempting from habeas review for double jeopardy violation all mistrials where the record shows formal concern and consideration by the district judge, and a supportable reason for his granting a mistrial, unless he act \u201cirrationally and irresponsibly\u201d, 434 U.S. at 515, 98 S.Ct. at 835. The decision on its face does not question <em>Jorn, </em>which it reaffirms; indeed, the Court found that the record evidenced careful consideration of the accused\u2019s contrary arguments and the exercise of sound discretion by the trial judge in handling a sensitive problem of possible juror bias, a matter peculiarly addressed to his ability to evaluate the prejudicial impact created by improper counsel comment. It held that, therefore, the mistrial order was supported by the \u201chigh degree\u201d of necessity that is required in a case of this kind. 434 U.S. at 516, 98 S.Ct. at 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">The holding that no <em>Jorn </em>mistrial violation occurred under <em>its </em>facts in <em>Arizona v. Washington </em>is not dispositive of the <em>present </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>issue of whether a sua sponte declaration of a mistrial, without consulting the interests of the defendant or exploring reasonable alternatives, offends double-jeopardy rights as enunciated by <em>Jorn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The majority may well not have intended its articulation and holding to extend beyond the present facts of a <em>post-Jorn </em>federal habeas attack upon a <em>pre-Jorn </em>state conviction. If so, I can live with the opinion as articulated. Nevertheless, the broad language of the majority opinion may later be urged as applying to decision of double-jeopardy mistrial issues beyond the scope of the narrow issue before us. The writer must therefore respectfully note these reservations to the majority\u2019s articulation of its rationale.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-12\">. As to the latter (or (b) objection), 1 do not read <em>Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 98 </em>S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978), where habeas review of a state conviction was involved, as modifying <em>Jorn </em>requirements were this matter before us on direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\">. <em>Grooms </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>610 F.2d 344 (5th Cir. 1980), a federal habeas attack upon a state conviction, is not authority to the contrary; in fact, it cites <em>Starling </em>with approval. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>Grooms, </em>while the jury was deliberating, a bailiff had permitted his pistol to be examined by the jury in the jury room. The judge, after deliberating, declared a mistrial on the first trial because \u201cthe make, shape, and size of the pistol were a very critical part of the testimony presented at trial,\u201d 610 F.2d at 345. As in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, supra cit. </em>note 1, the ineradicably prejudicial effect on the entire trial jury (a matter peculiarly within the trial judge\u2019s ability to evaluate) admitted of no reasonable alternatives to a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d mistrial; therefore, the circumstance that the district court did not expressly for the record canvass alternatives did not, for purposes of federal habeas review, require the state conviction to be set aside on federal habeas review, where all the <em>Jorn </em>requirements were otherwise met.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
