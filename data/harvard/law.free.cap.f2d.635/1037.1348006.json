Plaintiff Fairdale Farms, Inc. appeals from the summary dismissal of its claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, that defendants Yankee Milk, Inc. and Regional Cooperative Marketing Agency, Inc. (RCMA) illegally fixed raw milk prices. Yankee and RCMA appeal from the denial of their summary judgment motions to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s claim that defendants monopolized and attempted to monopolize trade in raw milk in violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-15\">We affirm that part of the order granting defendants summary judgment on the section 1 claim. We vacate that portion of the order dealing with the section 2 claim and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-16\">Plaintiff Fairdale is both a producer and dealer-processor of milk. It is located near Bennington, Vermont and buys and sells in the Vermont, New York, and Massachusetts area. Yankee is a milk producers cooperative with a membership of approximately 6,000 New England farmers. In 1973 minimum dairy prices for the northeastern United States, set by the government under the Agricultural Marketing Agreements Act of 1937, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c(5), were not providing an adequate return to the farmers. In order to secure prices with which their members could live, Yankee and six other area cooperatives organized RCMA as an agricultural cooperative marketing cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>poration, whose primary function was to establish prices for the member farmers\u2019 milk. Between 1973 and 1975, these prices were usually higher than the federal order prices. Since August 1975, RCMA has not established an over-order price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Until 1974, Fairdale bought a large portion of its milk from Yankee members. However, in 1974 Fairdale objected to paying the over-order price and, when negotiations with defendants proved fruitless, discontinued its purchases from Yankee farmers. In 1976, Fairdale brought this suit charging defendants with price fixing, monopolizing, and attempting to monopolize. Defendants alleged as an affirmative defense that the Capper-Volstead Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 291-292, protected them against liability for the conduct of which Fairdale complained.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The adequacy of this defense is the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">\n<em>The Section 1 Count</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-8\">Price fixing arrangements are generally held to be <em>per se </em>violations of section 1 of the Sherman Act. <em>White Motor Co. v. United States, </em>372 U.S. 253, 260, 83 S.Ct. 696, 700,9 L.Ed.2d 738 (1963). The CapperVolstead Act provides, however, that farmers may act together in associations in collectively marketing their goods, and the associations may make the necessary contracts to effect this purpose.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fairdale does not contest Yankee\u2019s right under the Act to fix the prices its members charge. Confronted with Justice Black\u2019s opinion in <em>Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers </em>As<em>sociation v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 458, 80 S.Ct. 847, 4 L.Ed.2d 880 (1960), Fairdale does not have much choice. Examining the legislative history of Capper-Volstead, Justice Black found that Congress intended to permit farmers to organize together to \u201cfix prices at which their cooperative will sell their produce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 80 S.Ct. at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-13\">Fairdale contends, however, that RCMA does not have the same price-fixing right as does Yankee, and advances two arguments in support of its contention. It asserts first that Capper-Volstead gives only single cooperatives, not associations of cooperatives, the right to fix prices. Second, it contends that a cooperative association organized for the sole purpose of fixing prices is not entitled to Capper-Volstead protection. The district court rejected both contentions for reasons with which we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-14\">The Capper-Volstead Act permits the formation of \u201cassociations\u201d which may perform marketing functions and which may have \u201cmarketing agencies in common.\u201d The district court concluded that RCMA was one or the other of these organizations and that \u201cgrave legal consequences\u201d should not be visited upon it as the result of a <em>de minimis </em>organizational distinction. <em>Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler &amp; Smith Citrus Products Co., </em>370 U.S. 19, 29, 82 S.Ct. 1130, 1135, 8 L.Ed.2d 305 (1962). <em>See Treasure Valley Potato Bargaining Association v. Ore-Ida Foods, Inc., </em>497 F.2d 203, 213-17 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 999, 95 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>314, 42 L.Ed.2d 273 (1974). Fairdale\u2019s first argument is based upon a misreading of the Act and was properly rejected by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Fairdale\u2019s second argument is predicated upon a hyper-technical reading of the statute. Capper-Volstead provides that farmers may act together in associations in collectively \u201cprocessing, preparing for market, handling, and marketing\u201d their products. Fairdale contends that RCMA must do more than just fix prices in order to get the benefit of this statute. In the only two prior proceedings in which this argument was made, it was rejected. <em>Northern California Supermarkets, Inc. v. Central California Lettuce Producers Cooperative, </em>413 F.Supp. 984, 992 (N.D.Cal.1976), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>580 F.2d 369 (9th Cir. 1978) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1090, 99 S.Ct. 873, 59 L.Ed.2d 57 (1979); <em>Central California Lettuce Producers Cooperative, </em>[1977] Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) \u00b6 21,337 (FTC). The establishment of price is an integral part of marketing. <em>Id. </em>at 21,237. It would be strange indeed if participation in this portion of the marketing process, standing alone, would subject a cooperative to antitrust liability, when the exercise of the full range of activities covered by Capper-Volstead would not. <em>Northern California Supermarkets, Inc. v. Central California Lettuce Producers Cooperative, supra, </em>413 F.Supp. at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">We agree with the district court that Fairdale had no section 1 claim against the defendants. The district court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">\n<em>The Section 2 Count</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it unlawful for any person to monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or conspire with another to monopolize, trade. There is an inherent conflict between this provision and those of Capper-Volstead which legitimize the collective action of farmers in the marketing of their products. By exempting farmers from Sherman Act limitations on the ability to combine into cooperatives, Capper-Volstead gives farmers the right to combine into cooperative monopolies. The Act places no limits on combination; it does not forbid farmers from combining after their cooperative reaches a certain size. For a court to impose such limits and hold cooperatives liable for treble damages if they run afoul of a judicial standard would discourage the growth of these cooperatives. The Capper-Volstead Act recognizes that farmer cooperatives may grow into monopolies and includes precautions to prevent abuse of monopoly power. Section 2 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 292, permits the Secretary of Agriculture to order a cooperative to cease and desist if it monopolizes or restrains trade <em>\u201cto such an extent </em>that the price of any agricultural product is <em>unduly enhanced </em>by reason thereof. . . . \u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">The district judge \u201c[disagreed] with defendants\u2019 assertion that the Capper-Vol-stead Act adds to the elements of a monopoly claim when it is brought against a qualified cooperative,\u201d and stated that \u201ca plaintiff claiming an agricultural cooperative has violated section 2 has no greater burden than if he sued a corporation.\u201d Disregarding the fundamental differences between a cooperative and a corporation, the district judge subscribed to the corporate monopolization test of <em>United States v. Grinnell Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 1703, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966), which proscribes the willful acquisition of monopoly power that is not the result of \u201ca superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.\u201d We believe that the district court misconstrued the congressional intent evidenced in Capper-Volstead.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-10\">Although agricultural cooperatives have existed in the United States since the early 1800\u2019s, until the twentieth century they were mostly small local organizations with little power to bargain effectively on behalf of their members. Moreover, their growth was inhibited by both state and federal antitrust laws. <em>Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association v. United States, supra, </em>362 U.S. at 464, 80 S.Ct. at 852. <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>Trust Busting </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number><em>Down on the Farm: Narrowing the Scope of Antitrust Exemptions for Agricultural Cooperatives, </em>61 Va.L.Rev. 341 (1975). When the Sherman Act was under consideration in 1890, an amendment was proposed that would have exempted agricultural cooperatives from the proscriptions of the Act. Although Senator Sherman did not believe that his bill applied to farmers\u2019 associations, he apparently was willing to accept the amendment. However, without explanation, it was deleted from the bill as enacted. <em>See </em>1 Kintner, <em>Federal Antitrust Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4.8, 4.9, 4.12 (1980). Whatever the reason for deletion, the Sherman Act, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, <em>see Loewe v. Lawlor, </em>208 U.S. 274, 301, 28 S.Ct. 301, 309, 52 L.Ed. 488 (1908), was a strong deterrent to the development of large agricultural cooperatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">The tremendous growth of the California fruit industry brought about a drastic change in the merchandising of farm commodities. When California growers discovered the advantages of collectively processing and marketing their perishable fruit, large-scale, single commodity cooperatives quickly assumed a dominant role in the industry. <em>See, e.g., Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler &amp; Smith Citrus Products Co., supra, </em>370 U.S. at 28-29, 82 S.Ct. at 1135. Shortly after World War I, the concept of large-scale, cooperative commodity marketing began to spread to other parts of the country. Wheat, cotton, and tobacco growers, in particular, became involved in the regional commodity cooperative movement. Knapp, <em>The Advance of American Cooperative Enterprise </em>7-12 (1973). <em>See Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Burley Tobacco Growers\u2019 Co-Operative Marketing Association, </em>276 U.S. 71, 48 S.Ct. 291, 72 L.Ed. 473 (1928). Legislatures in many states enacted enabling statutes excepting organizations of this type from the coverage of state antitrust laws. <em>Tigner </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>310 U.S. 141, 145-47, 60 S.Ct. 879, 881, 84 L.Ed. 1124 (1940). The American Cotton Association was organized in 1919, and in 1920 a plan for the organization of state marketing cooperatives was adopted. An essential element of this plan, and one of the \u201c \u20188\u2019 commandments of \u2018commodity cooperative marketing\u2019 \u201d, was that each cooperative should \u201ccontrol a sufficient proportion of the entire crop to be a dominant factor in the market. .. . \u201d Knapp, <em>supra, </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">Congress was not unaware of what was taking place. Senator Walsh, the most vociferous opponent of Capper-Volstead\u2019s anti-Sherman features, directed the attention of his colleagues specifically to the fact that 93 per cent of California\u2019s raisin growers were members of the Sun Maid Raisin Growers Association. <em>See </em>62 Cong.Rec. 2164 (1922). Senator Capper pointed to the 1,100 member California Fruit Growers Exchange as the \u201ctype of cooperative that would find \u2018definite legalization\u2019 \u201d under Capper-Volstead. <em>Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler &amp; Smith Citrus Products Co., supra, </em>370 U.S. at 28, 82 S.Ct. at 1135. Clearly, cooperatives \u201cof such size and general activities\u201d were contemplated by the proposed Act. <em>Id. </em>at 29, 82 S.Ct. at 1135. Proponents of Capper-Volstead, the prototype of which was introduced in 1919, <em>see </em>H.R. 7783 and S. 845, 66th Cong., 1st Sess. (1919), were convinced that farmers needed congressional help and, if there was any doubt on this score, it was dispelled by the severe agricultural depression of 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">In the presidential election of 1920, both party platforms stressed the need for legislative protection of the cooperative movement. In 1921, Congress organized a Joint Commission of Agricultural Inquiry to investigate, among other things, the causes of the agricultural depression and the reason for the difference between the prices paid farmers and costs to consumers. Among the Commission\u2019s recommendations was the enactment of legislation to strengthen the legal position of cooperatives. Knapp, <em>supra, </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">A national Agricultural Conference was convened by the Secretary of Agriculture in January 1922, at which President Harding spoke. He assured the conferees that they would be afforded \u201cample provision of .law under which they [might] carry on in cooperative fashion those business operations which lend themselves to that method... . \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 23. The Conference\u2019s Committee on the Marketing of Farm Products recommended \u201cthe formation of strongly organized cooperative associations of farmers, preferably on a commodity basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">It is little wonder, then, that Capper-Volstead and the major pieces of farm legislation that followed it strongly supported the cooperative movement. In Capper-Volstead, Congress did not simply broaden the scope of section 6 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 17, so as to bring cooperatives issuing capital stock within that section\u2019s antitrust exemptions. Where section 6 spoke only in terms of cooperative purposes, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cmutual help\u201d, Capper-Volstead spelled out the broad range of activities in which the cooperative might engage, /. e., \u201cprocessing, preparing for market, handling, and marketing.\u201d <em>See National Broiler Marketing Assn. v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 816, 824\u201425, 98 S.Ct. 2122, 2128, 56 L.Ed.2d 728 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">In the Cooperative Marketing Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 802 (1926) (current version at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 451-457), Congress authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a division of cooperative marketing. 44 Stat. 802. That division was to render services to agricultural cooperatives, to confer and advise with producers desirous of forming cooperatives, and to promote the knowledge of cooperative principles. <em>Id. </em>at 802. Cooperative associations were also authorized to exchange and disseminate market and economic information among themselves. <em>Id. </em>at 803.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">The declared policy of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929, 46 Stat. 11 (1929) (current version at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1141-1141j), was to promote the effective merchandising of agricultural commodities \u201cso that the industry of agriculture [would] be placed on a basis of economic equality with other industries... . \u201d 46 Stat. 11. This would be accomplished in part \u201cby encouraging the organization of producers into effective associations or corporations under their own control for greater unity of effort in marketing and by promoting the establishment and financing of a farm marketing system of producer-owned and producer-controlled cooperative associations and other agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Federal Farm Board, created by the Act, was authorized to make loans to cooperatives to assist them in \u201cextending\u201d their membership by educating producers in the advantages of cooperative marketing. <em>Id. </em>at 14. If, in the judgment of the Board, the producers of any commodity were \u201cnot organized into cooperative associations representative of the commodity\u201d, the Board was authorized to make the benefits of the Act available to other cooperatives dealing in the same commodity. <em>Id. </em>at 18.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-11\">The Farm Credit Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 257 (1933), authorized the creation of twelve \u201cBanks for Cooperatives\u201d, which were authorized to make loans to cooperative associations for most of the purposes set forth in the Agricultural Marketing Act. 48 Stat. 257. Specifically included within these purposes was the \u201ceffective merchandising of agricultural commodities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-12\">As late as 1968, with the enactment of the Agricultural Fair Practices Act, Pub.L. No. 90-288, 82 Stat. 93 (1968) (current version at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301-2306), Congress continued to recognize the need for stronger and more effective marketing and bargaining associations of farmers. <em>See </em>[1968] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News pp. 1867, 1869. Congress declared that the \u201cmarketing and bargaining position of individual farmers will be adversely affected unless they are free to join together voluntarily in cooperative organizations as authorized by law\u201d, 82 Stat. 93, and forbade any coercive practices by handlers which would interfere with the farmers\u2019 exercise of this right. <em>Id. </em>at 94. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number><em>See Butz v. Lawson Milk Co., </em>386 F.Supp. 227, 235 (N.D.Ohio 1974).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\">It is apparent from these statutes that agricultural cooperatives were \u201ca favorite child of Congressional policy.\u201d 5 Toulmin, <em>Antitrust Laws </em>\u00a7 6.1, at 334 (1950); <em>Stark v. Brannan, </em>82 F.Supp. 614, 617 (D.D.C.1949). \u201cMoreover, there is persuasive evidence that Congress\u2019 concern for protecting contract growers vis-a-vis processors and handlers has not abated.\u201d <em>National Broiler Marketing Assn. v. United States, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 837, 98 S.Ct. at 2134 (Brennan, J., concurring). The consistent tenor of the enactments shows that Congress wanted and expected farmers to be represented by strong and effective cooperatives, so extensively organized as to be representative of individual commodities. Unity of effort was encouraged in order to give farmers the same \u201cunified competitive advantage\u201d available to businessmen acting through corporations. <em>Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association v. United States, supra, </em>362 U.S. at 466, 80 S.Ct. at 853. As Senator Capper himself expressed it, when he successfully opposed Senator Walsh\u2019s proposed amendment to Capper-Volstead that would have prohibited the creation of cooperative monopolies, <em>see </em>S.Rep.No. 236, 67th Cong., 1st Sess. (1921), \u201cno association can efficiently operate that does not control and handle a substantial part of a given commodity in the locality where it operates.\u201d 62 Cong.Rec. 2058 (1922).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-11\">In short, when Congress enacted the Cap-per-Volstead Act, it did not intend to prohibit the voluntary and natural growth that agricultural cooperatives needed to accomplish their assigned purpose of effective farmer representation. That farmers\u2019 legitimate desires for unity of effort would incorporate of necessity a concept of corporate aggrandizement did not <em>per se </em>make this method of cooperative growth illegal. <em>See United States v. Rock Royal Co-Operative, Inc., supra, </em>307 U.S. at 560, 59 S.Ct. at 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-12\">This is the interpretation that has been placed upon Capper-Volstead by practically every scholar in the antitrust field.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This is how those courts which have directly addressed the issue have construed the Act. In <em>Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. Winckler &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number><em>Smith Citrus Products Co., supra, </em>370 U.S. at 24, 82 S.Ct. at 1133, the Court noted with apparent approval that portion of the district court\u2019s charge which stated that cooperatives could lawfully have a monopoly of the fruit and products in which they dealt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association v. United States, supra, </em>362 U.S. at 465, 80 S.Ct. at 852, the Court said that farmers might act together in cooperative associations without the associations as such being illegal under the antitrust laws \u201cas they otherwise might have been.\u201d Justice White expressed the same thought when he said that \u201c[t]he assistance offered farmers by the Capper-Volstead Act was to allow combination in a way that would otherwise violate the antitrust laws,\u201d and concluded that the end result was a \u201cbilateral monopoly\u201d that benefited both the producer and the consumer. <em>National Broiler Marketing Assn. v. United States, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 842, 98 S.Ct. at 2137 (White, J., dissenting). <em>See also Treasure Valley Potato Bargaining Association v. Ore-Ida Foods, Inc., supra, </em>497 F.2d at 216 n.11; <em>Sunkist Growers, Inc. v. F.T.C., </em>464 F.Supp. 302, 309 (C.D.Cal.1979); <em>Shoenberg Farms, Inc. v.

King, </em>250 F. 908, 910 (D.Mass.1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">Even the Federal Trade Commission, ever in the vanguard of the attack on monopolization, has stated that if an agricultural cooperative attains a monopoly position (even 100 percent) \u201cwithout resort to predatory or anti-competitive practices, but through natural growth or the voluntary affiliation with or attraction of new members, no illegality would attach.\u201d <em>See Hearings on Antitrust Aspects of Food Price Increases Before the Sub-Comm. on Monopolies and Commercial Law of the House Comm, on the Judiciary, </em>93rd Cong/, 1st Sess. 715 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-7\">Of course, a cooperative may neither acquire nor exercise monopoly power in a predatory fashion by the use of such tactics as picketing and harassment, <em>Otto Milk Co. v.

Neither may it use its legitimately acquired monopoly power in such a manner as to stifle or smother competition. <em>Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association v. United States, supra, </em>362 U.S. at 463, 80 S.Ct. at 851.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-8\">\u201c[M]any anticompetitive actions are possible or effective only if taken by a firm that dominates its smaller rivals. A classic illustration is an insistence that those who wish to secure a firm\u2019s services cease dealing with its competitors. Such conduct is illegal when taken by a monopolist because it tends to destroy competition, although in the hands of a smaller market participant it might be considered harmless, or even \u2018honestly industrial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>603 F.2d 263, 274 (2d Cir. 1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>100 S.Ct. 1061, 444 U.S. 1093, 62 L.Ed.2d 783 (1980) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">In refusing to dismiss the section 2 claims, the district court relied on <em>Grinnell v. United States, supra, </em>which stated the following requirements for a monopolization claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>The offense of monopoly under \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARQ\">384 U.S. at 570-71, 86 S.Ct. at 1703. Our review of the above authorities persuades us that the effect of Capper-Volstead is to prevent the full application of the second element of this test to agricultural cooperatives. Capper-Volstead permits the formation of such cooperatives and places no limitation on their size. As the cooperative grows, so, normally, does its power over the market. Thus, while the formation, growth and operation of a powerful cooperative is obviously a \u201cwillful acquisition or maintenance of such power,\u201d and will rarely result from \u201ca superior product, business acumen, or historic accident,\u201d <em>id., </em>it is exactly what Capper-Volstead permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">We conclude that <em>Grinneil </em>does not apply to monopoly power that results from such acts as the formation, growth and combination of agricultural cooperatives, but applies only to the acquisition of such power by other, predatory means. It is not a violation of the Sherman Act for the members of an agricultural cooperative to carry out the legitimate objectives of their association which follow naturally from their attempts to achieve unity of effort and the voluntary elimination of competition among themselves. <em>Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers Association v. United States, supra, </em>362 U.S. at 465, 80 S.Ct. at 852. <em>See Con-nell Construction Co. v. Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local 100, </em>421 U.S. 616, 635, 95 S.Ct. 1830, 1841, 44 L.Ed.2d 418 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">That part of the district court\u2019s order which granted defendants summary judgment on plaintiff\u2019s claim of a section 1 Sherman Act violation is affirmed. Because it is not clear whether the district court denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing the section 2 count on the premise that the mere accretion of power from formation of a cooperative is sufficient to violate that section or on the ground that predatory acts had been sufficiently shown, that part of the order is vacated, and the matter is remanded to the district court for reconsideration consistent with the principles set forth in this opinion. We express no opinion concerning the district court\u2019s ultimate resolution of this portion of defendants\u2019 summary judgment application.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">.
