Specifically it has two claims; one, that the cost of installation and other post-delivery services were subject to the Act\u2019s surcharge, and two that a greater surcharge rate should have been applied to the foreign bid. If both of these adjustments were made to Hitachi\u2019s bid, Allis-Chalmers asserts they submitted the lowest bid and therefore the contract was awarded to Hitachi America unjustly.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">We uphold the award of the contract to Hitachi America as within the discretion of the government purchasing agent and find that in the context of hydroelectric turbines the cost of installation and other post delivery expenses should not be subject to the Buy American Act\u2019s surcharge. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction and sustain the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">1. FACTUAL SETTING</p>\n<p id=\"AlT\">A. <em>The Bidding Process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The contract for the construction of the Amistad power plant involves the procurement of two massive hydroelectric turbines used to generate electricity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The purchasing agent for the government was the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (hereinafter the \u201cSection\u201d). The Section retained the Army Corps of Engineers (hereinafter the \u201cCorps\u201d) to orchestrate the contract bidding process and serve as its engineering representative for the project. Traditionally, the Corps solicits offers for the turbines from one manufacturer while a general contractor, retained under a separate bidding process, installs the turbines and builds the power plant. In the Amistad project these two segments manufacture of the turbines and installation at the power plant-were contained in a single bid solicitation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under this combined system, one company bids on both stages, and the success of its bid depends on the combined price. The two stages, manufacture and installation, are separate line items within the bid, but each company bids on both even if it is not a general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">In response to this bid solicitation, the sole domestic bidder, Allis-Chalmers, submitted an unadjusted bid of $4,005,800. The lowest foreign bidder, Hitachi America, Ltd., submitted an unadjusted bid of $3,400,000. These lump sum figures were then modified to reflect any applicable discounts and surcharges. The Corps deducted $38,070.50 (prompt payment discount) and $198,750 (testing) from Allis-Chalmers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>bid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, its final adjusted bid was $3,768,979.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">As a foreign manufacturer bidding on a government contract Hitachi America\u2019s bid was subject to the Buy American Act and its implementary regulations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute provides that American made articles and supplies be preferred in government construction contracts \u201cunless the head of the department or independent establishment concerned shall determine it to be inconsistent with the public interest, or the cost to be unreasonable.. . . \u201d 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 10a (1976). As interpreted by the federal procurement regulations, the price of domestic goods is considered \u201cunreasonable\u201d and hence the Act\u2019s preference for domestic goods does not apply when their cost is six percent greater than that of foreign goods. 41 C.F.R. l-6.104-4(b) (1979). Further, a twelve rather than six percent surcharge is taxed to the cost of foreign goods if the domestic bidder operates in an area of substantial unemployment (\u201clabor surplus concern\u201d). <em>Id. </em>After consulting with the United States Department of Labor, the Corps found that Allis-Chalmers\u2019 manufacturing plant in York, Pennsylvania, was in an area of substantial unemployment making Allis-Chalmers a labor surplus concern and therefore applied the twelve percent Buy American surcharge to Hitachi\u2019s bid. The Corps subtracted the cost of installing the turbines ($983,800) and the services of an erecting engineer ($15,750) from Hita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>chi\u2019s bid and then applied the twelve percent surcharge to the balance. The cost of installation and engineering services were then added back into the total price as well as an additional $60,000 for foreign inspections. This made Hitachi\u2019s final adjusted bid $3,748,054, or approximately $20,000 less than Allis-Chalmers\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">B. <em>The Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On June 18, 1979 the Corps informed Allis-Chalmers that the cost of installation and engineering services would be excluded from the amount of Hitachi\u2019s bid that was subject to the Act\u2019s surcharge. The Section then reviewed the Corps\u2019 recommendation that the contract be awarded to Hitachi and upon independent examination concluded that the six percent rather than twelve percent surcharge should have been imposed on Hitachi\u2019s bid. The Section found that the East Berlin plant of Allis-Chal-mers was located, not in the City of York, but rather in nearby Manchester Township which is not an area of substantial unemployment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">In light of these findings Allis-Chalmers protested the anticipated award of the contract to the Corps and the Comptroller General of the General Accounting Office (hereinafter \u201cGAO\u201d). It asked that no final action be taken on the contract until its protest was resolved. On September 9, 1979 the Section informed the GAO of its decision to award the contract to Hitachi notwithstanding Allis-Chalmers\u2019 protest. After reviewing the contract and the bid solicitation, the Comptroller General denied Allis-Chalmers\u2019 protest and upheld the award of the contract to Hitachi. <em>In re Allis-Chalmers Corporation, </em>B-195311 (Dec. 7, 1979) (Opinion of the Comptroller General).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Allis-Chalmers sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania to enjoin the Section\u2019s award of the contract to Hitachi. On September 28, 1979, Hitachi moved to intervene as defendant with the Section. The court granted this motion and permitted South Texas and Medina Electric, two privately owned electrical cooperatives which had contracted to purchase the electricity generated by the project, to intervene as defendants. The court also allowed Local Union, 1400, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, the union at Allis-Chalmers\u2019 East Berlin plant, to intervene as plaintiffs. After a hearing on this issue the district court granted a restraining order staying the award of the contract until Allis-Chal-mers\u2019 protest was resolved. The TRO was then extended until December 7, 1979 when the district court ruled against Allis-Chal-mers on the merits and awarded the contract to Hitachi. <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Friedkin, </em>481 F.Supp. 1256 (M.D.Pa.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The two prongs of Allis-Chalmers\u2019 complaint have remained consistent throughout the administrative hearings and earlier litigation; one, the Corps erred in not applying the Buy American surcharge to the installation and engineering services portion of Hitachi\u2019s bid; and two, contrary to the Section\u2019s discussion, the twelve percent surcharge rate is applicable to Hitachi\u2019s bid. Allis-Chalmers must succeed on both of these claims if it is to have the lowest bid and hence the contract. A six percent differential applied to the entire bid of Hitachi or a twelve percent differential applied without the cost of installation and engineering services included in the bid would be insufficient to make Allis-Chalmers\u2019 adjusted bid lower than Hitachi\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">II. APPLICATION OF THE BUY AMERICAN ACT SURCHARGE.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Our review of the agency\u2019s purchasing decision-including its interpretation of the procurement regulations-is quite limited. Judicial intrusion into government pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>chases necessarily delays completion of the contract and increases costs, with little measurable benefit to the public. We recognized this problem in <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Brown, </em>600 F.2d 429, 435 (3d Cir. 1979), and stated that a court should not substitute its judgment for that of the contracting agency. Rather the court should determine whether the procurement decision was a rational one; if so the agency\u2019s decision must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">While courts do have an obligation to ensure agency compliance with the applicable statutes and regulations, several factors enter into the analysis. As we noted in <em>Sea-Land:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">When jurisdiction is exercised in the field of governmental procurement, there are three interests that must be weighed: the practical considerations of efficient procurement of supplies for continuing government operations; the public interest in avoiding excessive costs; and the bidder\u2019s entitlement to fair treatment through adherence to statutes and regulations .... A showing of clear illegality is an appropriate standard to impose on an aggrieved bidder who seeks relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA\"><em>Id. </em>at 434. <em>See also M. Steinthal &amp; Co. v. Seamans, </em>455 F.2d 1289, 1301 (D.C.Cir.1971) (\u201cIf the court finds a reasonable basis for the agency\u2019s action, the court should stay its hand even though it might, as an original proposition have reached a different conclusion as to the proper administration and application of the procurement regulations.\u201d)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">12. Applying the first criterion of <em>Sea-Land </em>-the practical considerations for the efficient procurement of supplies-we note initially, that any delay in the award or performance of the contract will necessarily delay the completion of the entire project. Delay in the completion of the plant will result in an increase in the consumption of finite energy resources while forcing the consumers to pay higher rates required by the greater cost of non-hydroelectrie power.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This factor supports the affirmance of the Corps\u2019 contract award so that further delay in the construction of the hydroelectric plant, and the expense that entails, can be minimized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">The second criterion-public interest in avoiding excessive costs-also militates toward affirming the award of the contract to Hitachi. Government contracts are awarded under a competitive bidding process to reward the most cost efficient manufacture and thereby save public funds. Hitachi\u2019s unadjusted bid was almost one million dollars less than Allis-Chalmers\u2019. Even after adjustments that included a twelve percent surcharge on portions of Hitachi\u2019s bid, Allis-Chalmers\u2019 proposal still exceeded Hitachi\u2019s by approximately $20,000. Public funds would be saved by awarding the contract to Hitachi.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">The third criterion-the bidder\u2019s entitlement to fair treatment through agency adherence to statutes and regulations-is most important for our analysis and the primary focus of Allis-Chalmers\u2019 complaint. Because we hold that the cost of installation at the damsite and the services of an erecting engineer were properly excluded from the Act\u2019s Surcharge, we do not reach the issue of the surcharge rate and therefore uphold the Section\u2019s award of the contract to Hitachi.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">Allis-Chalmers challenges Hitachi\u2019s treatment under the Act on several grounds. Initially, appellants claim that both the Executive Order and the regulations implementing the Buy American Act, require that once a bid is determined to be \u201cforeign\u201d the entire bid -price is subject to the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore all of Hitachi\u2019s bid, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ing installation and engineering, should have been subject to the surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">As support for this interpretation, appellant cites section 2(b) of the Executive Order which provides that the \u201cbid or offered price\u201d of foreign materials is subject to the Act\u2019s surcharge.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The phrase \u201cbid or offered price\u201d is then defined by section 1(c) of the Executive Order to be the \u201cprice of such materials delivered at the place specified in the invitation for bid including applicable duty and all costs incurred after arrival into the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus according to Allis-Chalmers, once a bid is classified as foreign, section 2(b) applies the Act\u2019s surcharge to the entire bid or offered price which section 1(c) defines as \u201call costs incurred after arrival into the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Allis-Chalmers also relies on the federal procurement regulations that require all foreign bids to be adjusted by a surcharge.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These regulations define a foreign bid as the \u201cbid or offered price for a foreign end product,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and end products are defined as items \u201cto be delivered to the government, as specified in the contract. ...\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Hence, appellant contends that because turbines are a foreign end product under the contract their costs must be adjusted by the surcharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-15\">We cannot accept this interpretation. To apply the surcharge automatically to the entire price of a foreign bid once it is determined that the bid is foreign, ignores the implementary regulation that requires the surcharge to be applied to a foreign bid on a line-by-line basis. Specifically 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 1-6.104-4(b) directs the procuring agency to parse the foreign bid into taxable and non-taxable segments. It states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-16\">When more than one line item is offered in response to an invitation for bids or request for proposals, the appropriate factor shall be applied on an item-by-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>item basis, except that the factor may be applied to any group of items as to which the invitation for bids or request for proposals specifically provides that award is to be made on a particular group of items.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">This provision undercuts Allis-Chalmers contention that once a bid is determined to be foreign the entire total is subject to the Act\u2019s surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Additionally, as the Section argues, the Executive Order and implementary regulations do not subject the entire bid to the Act\u2019s surcharge but rather exclude all post-delivery expenses. Specifically section 1(c) of the Executive Order states that the \u201cbid or offered price of foreign origin means the bid or offered price of such materials delivered at the place specified in the invitation for bid. .. . \u201d This reference to the delivered price is reinforced by the definition of end products contained in 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 1-6.-101(a): \u201cAs to a given contract, the end products are the items to be delivered to the government, as specified in the contract .. .. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The focal point of this interpretation is the determination of when materials are \u201cdelivered\u201d under the contract; if costs occur before delivery they are subject to the surcharge, if they are incurred after delivery they are exempt. The expenses of an erecting engineer and installation occur after delivery and therefore are exempt from the surcharge. \u201cDelivered\u201d is defined by the invitation for bids to mean F.O.B. railroad cars, Del Rio, Texas. <em>In re Allis-Chalmers Corporation, </em>B-195311 at 3 (Dec. 7, 1979) (Decision of Comptroller General). Appellants contend that an end product is not delivered under the contract until it is completely assembled and operational. We refuse to accept this and find instead that the turbine sub-assemblies were delivered, as the invitation for bids states, when they arrived F.O.B. at Del Rio, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Under the strict standard of review set out by this court in <em>Sea-Land </em>we cannot hold the Section\u2019s construction of the federal procurement regulation to be \u201cclearly illegal.\u201d <em>Sea-Land, </em>600 F.2d at 3450. Indeed, the Corps\u2019 invitation for bids underscores the Section\u2019s construction of the Act. General Conditions 3.2 and 3.3 of the invitation for bid stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">3.2 End Products are the items to be delivered to the Government, as specified in the contract, including supplies to be acquired by the Government for public use in connection with service contracts, <em>but excluding installation and other services to be performed after delivery.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">3.3 When the services of erecting engineers are specified in the bid amount in the Schedule for Services of Erecting Engineers will be subtracted [sic] from the bid amount before application of the Buy American Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">General Conditions 3.2 and 3.3 (emphasis added). <em>See Allis-Chalmers, </em>481 F.Supp. 1256, 1260 (M.D.Pa.1980). The conditions of the bid solicitation, gave bidders notice of how the Section would interpret the Act. While such statements are not a binding construction of the procurement regulations, they do evidence a consistency of treatment throughout the bidding process and add support to the Section\u2019s construction of the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">Finally we consider it important that the Comptroller General has addressed this precise issue and excluded installation and other post-delivery expenses from the Act\u2019s surcharge. <em>In Re Allis-Chalmers, </em>B-195311, (Dec. 7, 1979) (Decision of the Comptroller General). While his opinion is not controlling as a matter of law, it is material to our decision. <em>Wheelabrator Corporation v. Chafee, </em>455 F.2d 1306, 1313 (D.C.Cir.1971). <em>Cf. Gladstone, Realtor v. Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U.S. 91, 105-06 n.15, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1611, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979) (non-judicial relief for housing violations described as more expeditious and less burdensome method of resolving housing complaints). In this case the Comptroller General affirmed the Section\u2019s interpretation of the Act and award of the contract to Hitachi. His opinion stated \u201c[T]he Act, the E.O. and F.P.R. [do] not prohibit the exclusion of installation costs and other services incurred or provided after delivery to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>government of the end product before application of the Buy American Act differential.\u201d <em>In re Allis-Chalmers Corporation, </em>B-195311 at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">This exclusion of post-delivery expenses is consistent with earlier constructions of the Act by Comptroller General. In <em>Westinghouse Electric Corporation, </em>53 Comp. Gen. 259, 261-62 (1973), appellant argued that the services of an installation engineer were part of the end product and hence not subject to the Act\u2019s surcharge. The Comptroller General disagreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">We are inclined to the view that under the provisions of the Buy America Act, as implemented by Executive Order No. 10582 and FPR 1-6.2, computation of the differential should be based on the cost of the foreign supplies or materials delivered at destination, and that additional costs involved in installation or other services to be performed after delivery should be excluded from the computation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATU\"><em>Id. </em>at 261 <em>(quoting from </em>a transmittal letter to the Secretary of the Interior involving Fairbanks Morse &amp; Company). Thus the Comptroller\u2019s application of the Act\u2019s surcharge to the delivered cost of Hitachi\u2019s turbines conformed with prior interpretations of the Act\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Allis-Chalmers also contends that \u201cend products\u201d in this case means two fully assembled hydroelectric turbines that have been installed into the power plant. If the turbines in this contract had not been so large, appellant contends, they would have been shipped completely assembled from the point of foreign manufacture, and the Act\u2019s surcharge would have applied to the entire bid price. Allis-Chalmers claims that Hitachi should not be treated differently under the Act simply because the size of the turbines requires the shipment of unassembled parts with final assembly performed at the damsite. It is error, appellant argues, to speak of an unassembled turbine as an \u201cend product\u201d when the contract calls for two functioning hydroelectric generators. Hence, the final assembly of the turbines at the damsite is not installation at all but rather the final stage of manufacturing and the Act\u2019s surcharge should apply to this activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">We find this logic unpersuasive, as did the Comptroller General. While shipping constraints may cause the hydroelectric turbines to be delivered in sections, the sum of these pieces is not a collection of useless parts, but rather the materials that comprise a functioning turbine. As the Comptroller General emphasized, it is not possible to install a large turbine or generator as a fully assembled unit.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The assembly/installation of the various sections of a turbine must be done in stages as the construction of the powerhouse progresses. Hence Hitachi\u2019s installation/final assembly cost is excluded from the Act\u2019s surcharge not because the size of the turbine required unas-sembled shipping, but rather because the various stages of powerhouse construction dictate the delivery of disassembled turbine parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">As noted earlier, the Corps has historically awarded separate contracts for the manufacture of the turbines and the installation of these turbines during the powerhouse construction. The Corps\u2019 decision to combine the two stages into a contract for the Amistad damsite is no reason to blur the distinction between manufacturing, which is subject to the Act\u2019s surcharge and installation which is not.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Finally, Allis-Chalmers contends that limiting the Act\u2019s surcharge to cost of foreign goods will encourage unbalanced bidding. Unbalanced bidding occurs when companies use foreign manufactured goods and materials that are subject to the surcharge, but then perform the bulk of manufacturing on these materials in the United States to minimize the impact of the Act\u2019s surcharge. This type of unbalanced bidding, it is contended, undercuts the protection afforded American labor by the Buy American Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">This analysis presents several problems. First, while unbalanced bidding may exist, there is no indication that Hitachi\u2019s bid was unbalanced. Second, we believe that materially unbalanced bids can be detected and adjusted by the procuring agency. Finally, we fail to appreciate the problem of \u201cunbalanced\u201d bidding. The central purpose of the Buy American Act was to protect the American worker.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the foreign firms make their bids unbalanced by performing a disproportionate amount of manufacturing at the American jobsite, then the purpose of the Buy American Act-protection of the American worker-has been largely achieved. Foreign firms will employ American workers to perform the assembly/installation on the domestic job-site and minimize their foreign manufacturing subject to the Act\u2019s surcharge. The Buy American Act protects American labor, not specific employers who seek contracts. To the extent firms submit \u201cunbalanced\u201d bids by having the majority of the work performed on the domestic jobsite with a minimum of the bid subject to the Act\u2019s surcharge the Buy American Act has served its purpose American workers perform the jobsite manufacturing and the cost of foreign goods and materials is subject to the Act\u2019s surcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">We find therefore that the Section\u2019s award of the contract to Hitachi America was not clearly illegal and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-13\">.

The federal procurement regulations declare the price of a domestic bid to be \u201cunreasonable\u201d if it is either six percent greater than the lowest foreign bid or, if the lowest American bidder is a small business concern or operates in an area of substantial unemployment, its bid is unreasonable if it is twelve percent above the lowest foreign bid. 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 1 6.104 4 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-14\">.

The legislative history of the Act is sparse and confusing: however, protection of the American worker is a dominant theme. <em>See, e. g., </em>Remarks of Senator Davis on the floor of the Senate typifies the legislator\u2019s concern that the American worker should benefit from the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-14\">The adoption of this amendment will mean work for our workers.

National Association of Securities Dealers, </em>422 U.S. 694, 718-19, 95 S.Ct. 2427, 2442, 45 L.Ed.2d 486 (1975); <em>Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 626-27, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 1097, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971). At least as early as 1973, the Comptroller General concluded that when the Government seeks to procure items that will not be assembled until after delivery at the job-site, that portion of the bid of a foreign corporation attributable to on-site assembly and installation costs is not subject to the differential provided by the Buy America Act. <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>53 Comp.Gen. 259 (1973). The Comptroller General has not retreated from this interpretation of the statute, as illustrated by his application of the principles of <em>Westing</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>house Electric </em>to the present case. <em>See In re Allis-Chalmers, </em>B-195311 (Dec. 17,1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Were it not for this line of precedent from the Comptroller General, I would have considerable difficulty holding that the contract in the present case was properly awarded to Hitachi. The legislative history of the Buy American Act suggests that at least some of its supporters intended to include within the sweep of the Act products whose parts were manufactured abroad and then assembled in the United States. When the Act was debated on the floor of the Senate, an amendment was proposed that would have exempted from the Act\u2019s coverage \u201carticles of the growth, production, and/or manufacture of the United States.\u201d Senator Johnson, the sponsor of the Act, objected to the proffered amendment on the following grounds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">From my standpoint, the vice of this amendment is that from outside, from a foreign country, could be brought into this country the material which could be manufactured as seen fit, and then it would not be within the prohibition of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">For instance, as I have repeatedly stated upon the floor, the impelling cause of this measure was the situation at the Boulder Dam, where it was expected that the lowest bid would be from Germany for the turbines or generating machinery and the like-a transaction involving about $6,000,000. Now, assume that they brought over from Germany part of the machinery, and assume that they brought over then in another ship another part of it, and in another ship another part of it, and then, in some factory in this country, it was assembled and manufactured. Then, there would be no prohibition upon it such as I desire to put in this bill upon bids of that sort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">76 Cong.Rec. 3267 (Feb. 3, 1933). It is troubling, to say the least, that the situation sought to be protected against by the sponsor of the Buy American Act-the production abroad of parts for hydro-turbines which would later be assembled in the United States-is now asserted to be outside the ambit of the Act\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">As the majority points out, the legislative history also reflects a concern for the protection of American workers. I am not so confident as the majority, however, that the award of the contract to Hitachi will have no effect on American labor. There is no indication in the record that American engineers and technicians will be employed for the installation of the hydroturbines in the same numbers in which they would have been employed had the contract been awarded to Allis-Chalmers. To the extent that they are replaced with foreign technical experts, American labor will have been displaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">The Comptroller General\u2019s interpretation of the Act and the attendant award of the contract to Hitachi are not, in this case, so \u201cclearly illegal\u2019\u2019-the standard set forth in <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Brown, </em>600 F.2d 429, 435 (3d Cir. 1979)-that they should be overturned by this Court. But I have serious doubts whether the interpretation of the Comptroller General is the one that comports best with the underlying purposes of the Buy American Act.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
