Odegaard, </em>416 U.S. 312, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 1705, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1975). Appellant\u2019s attempt to establish a case or controversy by attacking the constitutionality of the enforcement power granted to the Internal Revenue Service under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7602 fails to raise a substantial question as it has been unequivocally settled that this section properly authorizes the issuance of a summons in an investigation that is likely to lead to civil liability as well as to criminal prosecution. <em>Couch v. United States, </em>409 U.S. 322, 93 S.Ct. 611, 34 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973); <em>Donaldson v. United States, </em>400 U.S. 517, 91 S.Ct. 534, 27 L.Ed.2d 580 (1971); <em>United States v. Joseph, </em>560 F.2d 742 (6th Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. Cleveland Trust Co., </em>474 F.2d 1234 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 866, 94 S.Ct. 48, 38 L.Ed.2d 118 (1973). It is also beyond cavil that a summons directed to a third party bank or credit union does not violate the Fourth Amendment rights of a depositor under investigation since the records belong to the financial institution and not to the depositor. See <em>United States v. Miller, </em>425 U.S. 435, 440-444, 96 S.Ct. 1619, 1622-1624, 48 L.Ed.2d 71 (1976); <em>United States v. Weingarden, </em>473 F.2d 454, 458 f.n.4 (6th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>600 F.2d 248, 256 (10th Cir. 1979) and cases cited therein. Further determining that oral argument is not needed in this case, Rule 34, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure,</p>\n<p id=\"b964-17\">It is ORDERED that the motion to dismiss be and hereby is granted and this case is hereby remanded to the district court so as to allow it to vacate the enforcement order. <em>Great Western Sugar Co. v. Nelson, </em>442 U.S. 92, 99 S.Ct. 2149, 60 L.Ed.2d 735 (1979).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
