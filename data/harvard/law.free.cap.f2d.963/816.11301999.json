GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b900-30\">This appeal arises from an action filed by Diane Deckert against First Wachovia Student Financial Services, Inc., now known as Wachovia Student Financial Services, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>(Wachovia),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in federal court after she had filed a similar action in Texas state court. The district court, relying on the prior Texas state court judgment and principles of res judicata, dismissed Deckert\u2019s lawsuit. Deckert appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Asserting various causes of action in connection with Wachovia\u2019s servicing of her Texas Guaranteed Student Loan, Deckert initially filed suit against Wachovia in Texas state court. Wachovia made a special appearance in the state court lawsuit and, in June 1989, the state court dismissed Deckert\u2019s lawsuit, finding that \u201cneither Defendant nor Defendant\u2019s property are amenable to process issued by the courts of this state.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">In January 1991, Deckert filed suit in federal district court, again asserting causes of action against Wachovia. Indeed, the allegations in Deckert\u2019s federal complaint \u2014 with the exception of one additional claim for breach of contract<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 arise out of the same set of facts forming the basis of the state court lawsuit and are the same as the allegations in Deckert\u2019s state court petition. Wachovia filed a motion to dismiss Deckert\u2019s lawsuit under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which the district court granted, on the grounds that the doctrine and principles of res judicata barred relitigation of the personal jurisdiction issue. Accordingly, the district court dismissed Deckert\u2019s action against Wachovia. Subsequent to filing a motion for new trial, which the district court denied, Deckert timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b901-15\">The issue on appeal is whether the district court properly gave res judicata effect to the Texas state court\u2019s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. Deckert contends that the district court erred in dismissing her lawsuit because (1) the state court\u2019s order of dismissal for want of jurisdiction was not a decision on the merits and (2) the federal district court\u2019s ruling prevents her from pursuing her claim in North Carolina. Wachovia, on the other hand, argues that Deckert is barred from relitigating the claims brought in the first lawsuit because of the doctrines of (1) res judicata, (2) direct estoppel, or (3) collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-16\">In a federal diversity action,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[a] nonresident defendant is amenable to personal jurisdiction ... to the extent permitted by a state court in the state in which the federal court resides.\u201d <em>Bullion v. Gillespie, </em>895 F.2d 213, 215 (5th Cir.1990), <em>citing Cycles, Ltd. v. W.J. Digby, Inc., </em>889 F.2d 612, 616 (5th Cir.1989); <em>DeMelo v. Toche Marine, Inc., </em>711 F.2d 1260, 1264 (5th Cir.1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, as the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>court properly recognized, federal courts must give the same preclusive effect to state court judgments that such judgments would be afforded in the courts of the state from which the judgment originated. <em>See Kremer v. Chemical Const. Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 466, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1889-90, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982); <em>Superior Oil Co. v. City of Port Arthur, </em>726 F.2d 203, 206 (5th Cir.1984), <em>quoting Kremer, supra; Folsom Inv. Co. v. Moore, </em>681 F.2d 1032, 1035 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Coastal States Marketing v. Hunt, </em>694 F.2d 1358, 1373 (5th Cir.1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\">Our next analytical step is, therefore, to examine the preclusive effect of the state court\u2019s order dismissing Deckert\u2019s lawsuit. Under Texas law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-4\">\u2018[t]he doctrine of res judicata states that a cause of action once finally determined, without appeal, between the parties, on the merits, by a competent tribunal, cannot afterwards be litigated by new proceedings either before the same or any other tribunal.\u2019 <em>Texas Water Rights Commission v. Crow Iron Works, </em>582 S.W.2d 768, 771 (Tex.1979). \u2018The doctrine of collateral estoppel differs in that it precludes relitigation of only those issues actually and finally decided in a prior action.\u2019 <em>Hanrick v. Gurley, </em>93 Tex. 458, 56 S.W. 330 (Tex.1900).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-16\"><em>Boyne v. Harrison, </em>647 S.W.2d 82, 85 (Tex.App.\u2014Austin 1983, no writ) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-17\">As Deckert points out, Texas courts, <em>have </em>held, in various contexts, that a dismissal for \u201cwant of jurisdiction\u201d is not a determination of the merits of the action. <em>See Fullerton v. Holliman, </em>730 S.W.2d 168, 171 (Tex.App.\u2014Eastland 1987, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.); <em>Brown v. Prairie View A &amp; M Univ., </em>630 S.W.2d 405, 408 (Tex.App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1982, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These cases are not persuasive, however, because they deal with a judgment\u2019s preclusive effect when the case was dismissed due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We are concerned with the preclusive effect of a judgment dismissing an action for lack of personal jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-18\">We must determine, therefore, the preclusive effect of the Texas state court\u2019s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction. Because the state court\u2019s order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>dismissal is an adjudication of the issue of Wachovia\u2019s amenability to suit in Texas, Deckert may be precluded from relitigating this issue by the. doctrine of collateral estoppel. In Texas, collateral estoppel precludes the relitigation of any ultimate issue actually litigated and essential to the judgment in the prior suit. <em>See Suber v. Ohio Medical Products, </em>811 S.W.2d 646, 652 (Tex.App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ requested), <em>citing Bonniwell v. Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>663 S.W.2d 816, 820 (Tex.1984). We find that the issue of Wachovia\u2019s amenability to suit in Texas is an issue that was \u201cactually litigated ... and essential to judgment in [the state] suit.\u201d <em>Cf. id.; see generally Eaton v. Weaver Mfg. Co., </em>582 F.2d 1250, 1255 (10th Cir.1978) (applying Oklahoma law, court held that \u201cthe merits of the issue of personal jurisdiction ... was decided by the unappealed state court judgments and that they bar relitigation of the jurisdictional issue\u201d in federal court).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">Here, Deckert filed suit in Texas state court in 1989. Wachovia made a special appearance in the lawsuit, questioning its amenability to the jurisdiction of the Texas courts. The parties, therefore, actually litigated the question of personal jurisdiction and the Texas state court determined that Texas courts lacked personal jurisdiction over Wachovia. Deckert could have appealed the state court\u2019s decision to a Texas court of appeals, but she chose not to do so. She instead waited and then filed another lawsuit in federal court. The federal district court recognized the Texas state court judgment\u2019s effect and dismissed Dec-kert\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The Texas state court expressly held that Texas courts do \u201cnot have jurisdiction over the Defendant\u2019s person and property....\u201d In light of the state court\u2019s finding, Deckert cannot now seek to relitigate in federal court the personal jurisdiction issue which was the basis of the state court\u2019s order of dismissal. <em>See Boyne, </em>647 S.W.2d at 87 (\u201c \u2018It appears to be a recognized principle of law that where, in a former suit, an essential issue of fact has been determined and adjudicated, the judgment therein will stop the parties from relitigating the same issue in a subsequent suit....\u2019 \u201d), <em>quoting Kirby Lumber Corp. v. Southern Lumber Co., </em>145 Tex. 151, 196 S.W.2d 387, 388 (1946). Therefore, we find the district court properly dismissed Deckert\u2019s lawsuit.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-7\">.

In her Complaint, Deckert sets forth two bases for the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction \u2014 diversity of citizenship and federal question jurisdiction. Deckert contends federal question jurisdiction exists because Wachovia \"works under contract with and as agent of the United States Government.\u201d Wachovia\u2019s General Manager submitted an affidavit, stating that defendant \u201cdoes not work under contract with or as an agent for the United States government. Instead [Wachovia] services student loans and these servicing activities may be subject to regulation by the United States government.\u201d The district court found that federal question jurisdiction did not exist, which finding Deckert does not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b901-18\">. At the outset, we note that the addition of the breach of contract claim in Deckert\u2019s federal complaint does not by itself invoke the Texas long-arm statute and therefore does not provide another basis for personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-19\">A Texas court may exercise jurisdiction over a non-resident if: (1) the Texas long-arm statute authorizes the exercise of jurisdiction; and (2) the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with federal <em>and </em>state constitutional guarantees. <em>Schlobohm v. Schapiro, </em>784 S.W.2d 355 (Tex.1990); Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 17.-041-\u00a7 17.042 (Vernon 1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number><em>General Elec. v.

Satisfaction of this statute is only the first inquiry and, even assuming Wachovia engaged in any of section 17.042's enumerated activities, a Texas court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over Wachovia still \u201crequires minimum contacts with the forum state and fairness.\u201d <em>General Electric, </em>804 S.W.2d at 530, <em>citing Schlobohm </em>784 S.W.2d at 357; <em>Escalona v.

The motion asserted that the issue of the Texas courts\u2019 jurisdiction over Wachovia had been resolved in an earlier suit between the same parties in a Texas court which was dismissed in June 1989 for lack of personal jurisdiction. The motion, was accompanied by an affidavit of Wachovia\u2019s general manager to the effect that, in the two years since the Texas court had dismissed Deckert\u2019s suit, Wachovia\u2019s contacts and activities with the State of Texas had not materially changed. The district court granted the motion, holding that \u201cthe plaintiff is estopped from relit-igating the issue of personal jurisdiction, at least as of the date of the state court order, in this action.\u201d The district court went on to rely, for information as to subsequent events, on the general manager\u2019s affidavit and on the failure of Deckert to file a controverting affidavit. Having granted Wachovia\u2019s motion to dismiss pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Rule 12(b)(2), the district court entered a judgment dismissing the suit <em>with </em>prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">All that Deckert seeks on appeal is a modification of the district court\u2019s judgment so that the dismissal will be without prejudice, thereby enabling her to proceed in North Carolina. Deckert is entitled to that, and Wachovia\u2019s 12(b)(2) motion concluded by saying that \u201cif Plaintiff wishes to sue Student Financial, she has that right, only she must do so in North Carolina.\u201d In short, all are agreed (or, at least, all were agreed) as to what should be done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The district court\u2019s opinion contained, in one sentence, some unfortunate confusion, extant in the Texas cases as well, over the issues of res judicata and collateral estop-pel, or claim preclusion and issue preclusion, under the circumstances that obtain here. Wachovia tries to turn that confusion to its advantage and argues, for the first time on appeal, that principles of res judicata support the dismissal of Deckert\u2019s claim on the merits. The panel opinion tees up the issue on appeal as \u201cwhether the district court properly gave res judicata effect to the Texas state court\u2019s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction,\u201d but goes on to decide the case on a collateral estop-pel basis without distinguishing or even citing the Texas case that formed the basis for the district court\u2019s confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Rather than modify the district court\u2019s judgment, and as so modified, affirm it, the panel perpetuates the confusion by affirming the flawed judgment and disposes of the flaw in a footnote by saying that our affirmance should not be construed to prevent Deckert from pursuing her claim in the appropriate forum. I hope and trust that it will not be so construed, but there was a shorter, simpler way to get there.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
