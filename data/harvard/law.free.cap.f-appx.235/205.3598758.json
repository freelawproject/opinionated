He argues that he accepted responsibility for his offense and challenges the district court\u2019s decision to deny him a three-point downward adjustment in his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-24\">Becerra failed to truthfully admit all of the conduct comprising his offense of conviction when he refused to reveal the source of the marijuana he possessed. <em>See United States v. Tellez, </em>882 F.2d 141, 143 (5th Cir.1989). In addition, Becerra acted in a manner inconsistent with an acceptance of responsibility by refusing to discuss his offense or relevant conduct with the probation officer who prepared his presentence report. <em>See United States v. Nevarez-Arreola, </em>885 F.2d 243, 245-46 (5th Cir.1989). The district court\u2019s decision to deny the adjustment was not without foundation. <em>See United States v. Hooten, </em>933 F.2d 293, 297-98 (5th Cir.1991). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
