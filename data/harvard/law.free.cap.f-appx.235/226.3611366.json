Amos was convicted pursuant to his guilty plea of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. He appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence as being time-barred. The district court granted a certificate of appealability as to this issue. Notwithstanding his assertions to the contrary, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is not retroactively applicable to his motion. <em>See United States v. Gentry, </em>432 F.3d 600, 604-05 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Cir.2005). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
