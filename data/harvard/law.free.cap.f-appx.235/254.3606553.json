Haughton asserts that the district court abused its discretion by admitting at trial evidence of a booking sheet from Haughton\u2019s prior marijuana arrest. He argues that the document was written as part of an adversarial booking process and constituted hearsay that did not fit within the public records exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-21\">Because Haughton\u2019s booking information was taken in a routine, nonadversarial setting, it was admissible under the public records exception to the hearsay rule, and thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>114 F.3d 520, 525-26 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Quezada, </em>754 F.2d 1190, 1194 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-22\">Haughton also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying a motion to depose Haughton\u2019s mother. Haughton has not shown that the district court abused its broad discretion in denying the motion. <em>See United States v. Dillman, </em>15 F.3d 384, 389 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-23\">Haughton\u2019s pro se motions requesting either the appointment of new counsel or an order allowing him to file an amended pro se brief, a pro se reply brief, and a motion to add an exhibit to his pro se reply brief are denied. <em>See United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902-03 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-24\">AFFIRMED; ALL OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
