Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), in which he claimed that Special Investigative Agent Derric Wilson retaliated against him for exercising his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Cruz contends that the district court erred by granting summary judgment because he created a genuine issue of material fact. Cruz argues that he has demonstrated a \u201cchronology of events\u201d establishing that Wilson assigned him to the prison\u2019s Special Housing Unit (SHU) in retaliation for exercising his right to remain silent during an interrogation. Cruz also argues that he has demonstrated that Wilson acted with a retaliatory motive. There is no dispute that Cruz was placed in the SHU before he exercised his right to remain silent. Agent Wilson provided competent summary judgment evidence establishing that Cruz remained in the SHU pending an investigation into a conspiracy to introduce drugs into the prison and that Cruz was released from the SHU once the investigation into his involvement ended. Cruz offered only his personal belief as to Wilson\u2019s motivation along with affidavits from several other inmates, who offered no relevant, admissible testimony relating to the investigation of Cruz. Cruz\u2019s assertions remain too conclusional to establish either a \u201cchronology of events\u201d or a retaliatory motive. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1165 (5th Cir.1995). Thus, Cruz has not shown that the district court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Cruz also has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in relation to discovery. <em>See King v. Dogan, </em>31 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.1994). Although Cruz requested leave to conduct discovery, he did not make any discovery requests that were denied, nor has he identified any particular documents that he wished to obtain through discovery. Cruz\u2019s conclusional allegations to the contrary are insufficient to show an abuse of discretion. <em>See Macklin v. City of New Orleans, </em>293 F.3d 237, 241 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">The judgment of the lower court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
