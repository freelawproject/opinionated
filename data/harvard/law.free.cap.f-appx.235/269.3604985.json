Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cTherefore, if the district court concludes that the summary judgment record raises a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether ... qualified immunity is applicable, then that decision is not immediately appeal-able .... \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 351 (5th Cir.1999). The only authority Thomas cites to the contrary is <em>Petta v. Rivera, </em>143 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir.1998), a case in which the district court denied summary judgment without any explanation. In this case, the district court explained its decision in a written opinion, concluding that the evidence presented \u201cclearly establishes fact issues\u201d as to the First Amendment claims. The court deferred a decision on the Fourth Amendment claims, noting that it was disinclined to ultimately allow them to proceed. Even if this deferral is assumed to constitute a final order, the court\u2019s decision was also based solely on whether there were \u201ctriable jury issues regarding plaintiffs Fourth Amendment claims against Thomas.\u201d We therefore DISMISS THE APPEAL for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
