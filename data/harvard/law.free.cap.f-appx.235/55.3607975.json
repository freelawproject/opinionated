In our initial decision, we affirmed Husband\u2019s convictions and 696-month sentence for eight counts of coercing or using a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a videotape of that conduct, which was then transported in interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Husband, </em>119 Fed.Appx. 475 (4th Cir.2005). In compliance with the mandate of the Supreme Court that vacated our decision, <em>see Husband v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 802, 126 S.Ct. 322, 163 L.Ed.2d 30 (2005), we affirmed Husband\u2019s convictions, but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Husband, </em>No. 03-4630, 2006 WL 4468334, 235 Fed.Appx. 54 (4th Cir. June 1, 2006) (unpublished). On remand, the district court sentenced Husband to thirty years of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. We now affirm Husband\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">On appeal, Husband contends that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence and erred in departing upward from the guidelines range. In imposing a sentence after <em>Booker, </em>the district court must first correctly determine, after making appropriate findings of fact, the applicable guidelines range. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d 118, 122 (4th Cir.2007). \u201cNext, the court must \u2018determine whether a sentence within that range ... serves the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and, if not, select a sentence [within statutory limits] that does serve those factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006)). The district court must then articulate the reasons for the sentence imposed, particularly explaining any departure or variance from the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe explanation of a variance sentence must be tied to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and must be accompanied by findings of fact as necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-16\">We review the resulting sentence for reasonableness, considering \u201cthe extent to which the sentence ... comports with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>various, and sometimes competing, goals of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). A sentence is unreasonable if the \u201ccourt provides an inadequate statement of reasons or relies on improper factors in imposing a sentence outside the properly calculated advisory sentencing range....\u201d <em>Hernandez-Villanueva, </em>473 F.3d at 123. \u201cThe district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) \u2018in checklist fashion;\u2019 \u2018it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 432 (quoting <em>United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Based on our review of the record, we find that the district court properly sentenced Husband after considering and examining the sentencing guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as instructed by <em>Booker. </em>The district court recalculated the sentencing guidelines based on the previous findings of this court and then proceeded to thoroughly examine the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded that the factors supported an upward departure from the guidelines range. We find that the resulting sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">We therefore affirm Husband\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
