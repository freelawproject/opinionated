Arreola-Hernandez argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by characterizing her state felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Because Arreola-Hernandez has completed the confinement portion of her sentence, any argument that the term of incarceration should be reduced is moot, and the only portion of the sentence remaining for consideration is her term of supervised release. However, Arreola-Hernandez has been removed from the United States. Because Arreola-Hernandez is barred from returning to the United States, and there is no indication that she has waived her right to be present for resentencing, Arreola-Hemandez\u2019s challenge to the validity of her sentence is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). The appeal is therefore DISMISSED as to Arreola-Hernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">For the first time on appeal, ArreolaHernandez also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Arreola-Hernandez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Arreola-Hernandez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Arreola-Hernandez properly concedes that her argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but she raises it here to preserve it for further review. Accordingly, ArreolaHernandez\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED; MOTION TO FILE SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEF DENIED AS UNNECESSARY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
