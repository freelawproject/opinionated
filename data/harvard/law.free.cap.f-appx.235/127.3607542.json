We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Harrison v. Moketa, </em>485 F.Supp.2d 652 (D.S.C.2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
