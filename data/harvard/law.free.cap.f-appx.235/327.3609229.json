Gareia-Gonzalez contends that his sentence was unreasonable because the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>trict court failed to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a), punished him based on the erroneous belief that he was wealthy, and implicated Eighth Amendment concerns by issuing a sentence that was unduly harsh without reason. Garcia-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence is within a properly calculated sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines and is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (permitting presumption of reasonableness for sentences within properly calculated guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">His sentence was imposed with sufficient consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, was not assessed under the erroneous belief that he was wealthy, and is not unreasonable. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468-69; <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. May 21, 2007) (No. 06-11834); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Garcia-Gonzalez\u2019s Eighth Amendment challenge to his sentence is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Garcia-Gonzalez also contends that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by not specifically objecting to the district court\u2019s failure to provide a reasoned analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although this court generally does not review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal because the record will rarely be developed sufficiently to allow a fair evaluation of the merits of the claim, <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 245 (5th Cir.2007), the record here provides sufficient detail to allow this court to decide Garcia-Gonzalez\u2019s claim. <em>See United States v. Saenz-Forero, </em>27 F.3d 1016, 1021 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Rosalez-Orozco, </em>8 F.3d 198, 199-202 (5th Cir.1993). Garcia-Gonzalez\u2019s claim fails because the district court adequately addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
