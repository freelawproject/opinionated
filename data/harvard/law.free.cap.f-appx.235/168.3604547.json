Garner appeals, contending that his predicate state conviction for conspiracy to sell and deliver methamphetamine was not a \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d under \u00a7 922(g)(1). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-24\">Garner asserts that the maximum sentence for the crime based on his individual criminal history and North Carolina\u2019s structured sentencing scheme was less than twelve months. However, as Garner concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246-47 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because it is undisputed that a sentence of over twelve months could be imposed on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>defendant convicted of conspiracy to sell and deliver methamphetamine in North Carolina, the district court properly considered Garner\u2019s prior conviction as a predicate felony for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Garner\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-16\"> Garner urges us to reexamine <em>Harp </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 856, 860, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007) (holding that California\u2019s determinate sentencing law violated the Sixth Amendment by \"assign[ing] to the trial judge, not to the jury, authority to find the facts that expose a defendant to an elevated 'upper term\u2019 sentence\u201d). Nothing in <em>Cunningham </em>affects the analysis in <em>Harp. </em>Moreover, \u201ca panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court. Only the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can do that.\u201d <em>Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 272 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
