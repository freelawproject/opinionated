Silva appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of his former employer on Silva\u2019s claim of retaliatory discharge. We have reviewed the record <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the court at the hearing held on January 22, 2007. <em>See Silva v. Bowie State Univ., </em>No. 8:04-cv-01984-RWT (D. Md. Jan. 22, 2007; filed Jan. 24, 2007 &amp; entered Jan. 25, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b150-12\"> Silva presents on appeal a letter dated April 15, 2002, that was not before the district court. \"It is well established that affidavits and exhibits not before the [district] court in making its decision are not to be considered on appeal.\u201d <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>981 F.2d 136, 140 (4th Cir.1992). In any event, we have reviewed the letter and conclude that it does not warrant relief on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
