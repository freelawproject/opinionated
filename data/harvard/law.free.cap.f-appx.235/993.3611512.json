Martinez argues that the district court erred by increasing his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) on the ground that his 2005 Texas cocaine-possession conviction was an aggravated felony. We review Martinez\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), this court decided <em>United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 259-61 (5th Cir.2007), and vacated in part and remanded for resentencing based on the appellant\u2019s challenge to the treatment of his prior Texas felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance as a drug-trafficking offense and, thus, an aggravated felony. <em>Estrada-Mendoza </em>directly controls the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-10\">Although the Government does not contest Martinez\u2019s contention that his 2005 conviction was not a drug-trafficking offense, it argues that Martinez\u2019s argument \u201cignores the recidivist possession exception noted by the Supreme court in <em>Lopez.\u201d </em>Under \u00a7 844(a), simple possession of a controlled substance, if such offense is committed \u201cafter a prior conviction\u201d is punishable as an aggravated felony. <em>Lopez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 630 n. 6. The Government\u2019s argument is factually flawed, however, because Martinez\u2019s marijuana-possession conviction was in 2006, which was after the 2005 cocaine-possession conviction. Thus, the conviction that formed the basis for the enhancement did not occur \u201cafter a prior conviction\u201d under \u00a7 844(a). Martinez\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for resentencing, consistent with <em>Lopez </em>and <em>Estrada-Mendoza.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1028-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
