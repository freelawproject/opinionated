He argues that the district court used information protected by an immunity agreement to calculate his sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines in violation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-24\">The Government argues that Smith\u2019s appeal is barred by an appeal waiver included in Smith\u2019s written plea agreement. In the absence of the transcripts necessary for a review of the voluntariness of Smith\u2019s waiver, this court will not consider this issue. <em>See Powell v. Estelle, </em>959 F.2d 22, 26 (5th Cir.1992) (party raising an issue has duty to provide the record relating to that issue); <em>United States v. Dunham Concrete Prods., Inc., </em>475 F.2d 1241, 1251 (5th Cir.1973) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"A02\">In view of the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing on remand, Smith has not shown that the district court clearly erred in finding that the Government established that the evidence used to calculate Smith\u2019s offense level was obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>from legitimate, independent sources-Smith\u2019s own admissions prior to the agreement, wiretap evidence, and an interview with an individual who purchased crack cocaine from Smith. <em>See United States v. Gibson, </em>48 F.3d 876, 879 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
