We affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">1. Anderson presented no evidence to the district court that tended to establish that the reason given for his termination was pre-textual. Even the unsubstantiated feelings of fellow employees that Anderson\u2019s supervisor, Andrus, was prejudiced\u2014 which Anderson did not present in his memorandum in opposition to summary judgment \u2014 are no evidence that Monsanto\u2019s reason for terminating Anderson was a mere pretext for discrimination. <em>See Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415, 1429 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc) (\u201cconclusory allegations, speculation, and unsubstantiated assertions are inadequate\u201d); <em>see also Bryant v. Bell Atl. Md., Inc., </em>288 F.3d 124, 135 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201c... affidavits [of other employees], however, amount to no more than subjective beliefs, and such evidence, without more, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to any discriminatory conduct on [defendant\u2019s] part.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">2. Anderson did not proceed on a mixed-motive theory in the district court and only raised the issue after the fact of the summary judgment in a motion for reconsideration, so we do not consider his arguments on appeal that Andrus\u2019 alleged prejudice played a meaningful role in his termination. <em>See Trust Co. Bank v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>950 F.2d 1144, 1152 n. 16 (5th Cir.1992). Similarly, Anderson did not argue in the district court until his motion for reconsideration that Andrus, as opposed to Supervisor Zamora and Business United Leader Pires, was the actual decision maker. <em>See id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">3. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Anderson\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the summary judgment. Anderson\u2019s use of the motion to 1) rehash arguments already presented at summary judgment, 2) insert a new theory \u2014 mixed-motive\u2014into the case, and 3) introduce evidence previously available were not grounds for granting the motion. <em>See Templet v. HydroChem Inc., </em>367 F.3d 473, 478-79 (5th Cir.2004).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b289-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
