Marlin, federal prisoner # 08387-003, has filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The district court denied Marlin\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Marlin is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Marlin\u2019s Federal Tort Claims Act and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims are deemed abandoned because he has failed to brief them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Beaumont, </em>972 F.2d 553, 563 (5th Cir.1992). Because the district court failed to address Marlin\u2019s Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) claim, we grant his motion for IFP. However, his allegations fail to state a claim upon which relief under the ADA can be granted. Marlin\u2019s arguments reflect that the alleged actions were at best retaliatory acts due to his writ writer reputation rather than discrimination based upon disability. Having reviewed Marlin\u2019s brief, the record, and the opinions below, we find no reversible error. Therefore, we dispense with further briefing and affirm the dismissal of Marlin\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Marlin\u2019s suit counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Marlin is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">IFP GRANTED; AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
