Moser presents two contentions of error in this appeal: first, that the written statement he made to federal agents following his 2005 arrest in Maryland was involuntary and thus inadmissible; and second, that the trial court\u2019s instruction concerning the statutory term \u201ccontrol\u201d on Count Three constituted reversible error. As explained below, we reject Moser\u2019s contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">The events leading to Moser\u2019s arrest began on May 26, 2005, when Postal Inspector Clayton Gerber (\u201cInspector Gerber\u201d) entered an existing Yahoo! chat room on the Internet using the assumed identity of a woman named \u201cKelly Mason.\u201d Under the screen name \u201ckelly_mason76,\u201d Inspector Gerber posed as the mother of two young daughters with hobbies including family time and \u201cvideos.\u201d Not long after he entered the chat room (whose title included the word \u201cincest\u201d), Inspector Gerber received an unsolicited message from Moser. Moser used the screen name \u201ctomassjr6969\u201d to communicate with Kelly, and his accompanying profile indicated that he was a single thirty-six-year-old man living in Pennsylvania. During this first chat session, Kelly asserted that she had two daughters, ages twelve and fourteen. Moser, in response, indicated that he had two children of his own, asked Kelly if she came to the chat room looking for some fun, and indicated an interest in making videos with Kelly and her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-15\">Over the next four months, Moser and Inspector Gerber (posing as Kelly Mason), continued to converse online. During <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>their conversations, Moser offered to visit Kelly\u2019s Maryland home and engage in a variety of sexual activities with her daughters. Moser also asked if he could videotape the encounters and inquired whether he could be alone with Kelly\u2019s children during those activities. In approximately fifteen online conversations and in various emails, Moser related in graphic detail the sexual activities that he wished to engage in with Kelly\u2019s daughters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moser also sent letters by mail to Kelly\u2019s fictitious daughters, Lisa and Jessie. In these letters, Moser described the sexual education he planned to provide the girls and asked Lisa, the purported fourteen-year-old, if he could be alone with her when he came to Maryland. In his conversations with Kelly and in his letters to Lisa and Jessie, Moser discussed bringing his own eleven-year-old daughter with him to Maryland so that she could also receive a \u201csex education.\u201d Mos-er also advised Kelly that he was accustomed to being awake at night because he often worked the night shift.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Inspector Gerber, still posing as Kelly Mason, arranged to meet Moser at a restaurant in Frederick, Maryland, on September 9, 2005. Moser believed he was meeting Kelly to spend the weekend making pornographic videos with her daughters. To this end, Moser took condoms, lubricant, video and digital cameras, and X-rated movies to Maryland with him in his pickup truck. Moser drove approximately three hours from northeastern Pennsylvania to Maryland and arrived for the meeting in Frederick at about 6:45 p.m. on September 9. He was promptly arrested by the authorities (at 6:50 p.m.), and transported to the Frederick County Law Enforcement Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">After being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moser agreed to be questioned without an attorney, and he signed a written <em>Miranda </em>warning and waiver of rights form at 7:10 p.m. Inspector Gerber and federal Immigration and Customs Agent Augustus Aquino (\u201cAgent Aquino\u201d) interviewed Moser until about 10:15 p.m. During this time, Moser gave the agents an oral statement, agreed to give them a written statement, and signed a second <em>Miranda </em>warning and waiver of rights form.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moser completed and signed his written statement (the \u201cStatement\u201d) at 3:55 a.m. on September 10, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Accordingly, from the time of his arrest until the completion of the Statement, Moser was with the agents for nearly nine hours. During this time, Moser was encouraged to eat and drink, he was given breaks to compose himself, and he was allowed several trips to the restroom. Indeed, one such break lasted approximately thirty minutes. Although Moser asserted later that he was emotionally drained, \u201cvery, very tired,\u201d and not in the \u201cright train of thought\u201d when he began preparing the Statement, J.A. 71-72, Inspector Gerber and Agent Aquino both testified that Moser never requested that the interview be terminated, never indicated he was too tired to continue, and did not otherwise demonstrate any reluctance to be inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>viewed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Before writing the Statement, Moser signed the advice of rights portion of the statement form, indicating that Inspector Gerber had advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights at 10:15 p.m. This portion of the form reflects that Moser understood his rights, that he was willing to give a statement and answer questions, that he did not desire the assistance of a lawyer, that no promises or threats had been made to him and no pressure or coercion had been used against him, and that he was voluntarily making the Statement. Similarly, the form indicates that Moser had read the Statement and that it was true and correct, that he had been given an opportunity to make changes to it, that he had not sought the advice or presence of a lawyer in its preparation, and that he did not at any time request that his interview be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In the body of the Statement, Moser explains that he began chatting with Kelly in a Yahoo! chat room at some point during the previous year. Moser stated that during the preceding several months, he had chatted online with Kelly once or twice a week. The two discussed Kelly\u2019s daughters, Lisa and Jessie, whom he believed to be fourteen or fifteen and twelve or thirteen, respectively. Specifically, Moser and Kelly discussed providing \u201csafe sex education\u201d to the girls, which would consist of Moser engaging in oral, vaginal, and anal intercourse with them. S.J.A. 3-4. Moser asserted that he was planning to help Kelly with her children\u2019s education in the hope that he could start a relationship with her. At the end of the Statement, Moser thanked the agents for arresting him before he could make the biggest mistake of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Moser was indicted by the grand jury on September 22, 2005, and he filed a motion to suppress the Statement on October 7, 2005. On November 21, 2005, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Mos-er\u2019s suppression motion and denied it from the bench. In so ruling, the court concluded that the Statement \u201cwas voluntary, made after the appropriate advice of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and that [Moser\u2019s] will to make those statements was not in [any] way overborne or his capacity for self-determination critically impaired by any type of coercive Government conduct.\u201d J.A. 97-98. The court also determined that Moser was \u201cclearly ... advised of his right to stop,\u201d that he had failed to show any proof of intimidation, and that he was not \u201ccredible [in] indicating that he was overly pressured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">The Statement was introduced into evidence at Moser\u2019s jury trial in Baltimore. On January 9, 2006, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all three counts of the Indictment. Thereafter, on March 31, 2006, Moser was sentenced to a total of 360 months of imprisonment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He timely noted this appeal on April 7, 2006, and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">In assessing a district court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, \u201c[w]e review ... factual findings for clear error and ... legal determinations de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Jarrett, </em>338 F.3d 339, 343-44 (4th Cir.2003) (citations omitted). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u201c[i]n reviewing the denial of [a] motion to suppress, we must accept the factual findings of the district court unless clearly erroneous, but we review de novo the conclusion of the district court that ... statements were voluntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Mashburn, </em>406 F.3d 303, 306 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">When an assertion of appellate error is made concerning a trial court\u2019s unobjeetedto instruction, we review that contention for plain error only. In so doing, we apply the principles of <em>United States v. Olano, </em>assessing: (1) whether there was error; (2) whether it was plain; and (3) whether it affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these conditions are satisfied, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously a\u00a3fect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). On plain error review, \u201c[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The issue of whether Moser\u2019s Statement was properly admitted into evidence turns on whether the district court properly ruled that he gave it to the agents voluntarily. Under the Fifth Amendment, \u201c[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ... without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend V. A statement of an accused, however, is \u201cinvoluntary under the Fifth Amendment only if it is \u2018involuntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>United States v. Braxton, </em>112 F.3d 777, 780 (4th Cir.1997) (en banc) (citing <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 304, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985)). We assess such a voluntariness issue by examining de novo the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d including the \u201ccharacteristics of the defendant, the setting of the interview, and the details of the interrogation.\u201d <em>United States v. Pelton, </em>835 F.2d 1067, 1071 (4th Cir.1987) (citing <em>United States v. Wertz, </em>625 F.2d 1128, 1134 (4th Cir.1980)). Under the totality of the circumstances, a statement is involuntary if the accused\u2019s will was \u201coverborne\u201d or his \u201ccapacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>\u201ccoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntar/ within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.\u201d 479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Moser contends on appeal that, when he gave the Statement, his will was overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired due to the length of his interview, because he ate insufficiently during it, and because he had only slept a few hours prior to his arrest. Moser also contends that the agents pressured him into giving the Statement by telling him that Kelly and her daughters had already given statements. Accordingly, Moser asserts that the district court erred in concluding that the Statement \u201cwas voluntary, made after the appropriate advice of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and that [Moser\u2019s] will to make those statements was not in [any] way overborne or his capacity for self-determination critically impaired by any type of coercive Government conduct.\u201d J.A. 97-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Under the totality of the relevant circumstances, Moser has failed to demonstrate any coercive Government conduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>During his interview, Moser was permitted to take numerous restroom breaks and to compose himself, and he was encouraged to eat and drink. Moser was not intoxicated, sick, or hurt during the interview and, under the circumstances, its duration was not excessive. Indeed, Moser never indicated that he was too tired to continue, and he acknowledged that he was accustomed to being awake during the late night hours. Importantly, it is undisputed that Moser was fully advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and signed two forms spelling out his understanding of those rights and his desire to give a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Moser also maintains that he was pressured into giving his Statement when Inspector Gerber and Agent Aquino asserted that Kelly and her daughters had already made statements. The district court, however, concluded that Moser was not \u201ccredible [in] indicating that he was overly pressured.\u201d J.A. 96-97. We are, of course, obliged to accept the court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pelton, </em>885 F.2d at 1072 (citations omitted). Under these circumstances, those facts are not clearly erroneous, and the agents thus did not utilize any coercive tactics, violence, improper threats, or promises to elicit Moser\u2019s challenged Statement. Accordingly, we reject his contention that the Statement was made involuntarily and sustain its admission against him at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Moser next contends that his conviction on Count Three is invalid because the district court erroneously instructed the jury on the meaning of the term \u201ccontrol\u201d under the statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251A(b)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, Moser maintains that the instructions erroneously conflated the element of control, on the one hand, and the element of sexual intent, on the other, impermissibly reducing the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">On Count Three, the court instructed the jury that, in order for the prosecution to sustain its burden of proof, it was obliged to prove six essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt. J.A. 832. This list of essential elements began: \u201cOne, that the defendant offered to obtain control over a minor. Two, that he did so with the intent to promote the engaging in of sexually explicit conduct by a minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After listing the other four essential elements, the court also instructed the jury, in relevant part, that \u201c[cjontrol means the power to manage, command, direct or restrain another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court instructed the jury \u201cthat engaging in sexually explicit conduct with a minor is in fact obtaining control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 833. It cautioned the jury, however, that if \u201cyou find that the Government has not proved that the defendant intended to engage in such conduct, then you must find him not guilty of the charge in Count III.\u201d <em>Id. </em>More specifically, the court instructed the jury that if it found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABC\">that Mr. Moser did offer to obtain control over persons he believed to be either a 14-year-old named Lisa Mason or a 12-year-old named Jessie Mason as I have defined obtaining control <em>and </em>that he did so with the intent to promote the engaging in of sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of creating a visual depiction thereof, then you may find him guilty of the offense charged in Count III even though he did not actually engage in sexually explicit conduct with a minor as long as you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>has proven <em>all </em>the elements of the offense as I have outlined them for you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkO\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Moser failed to object to these instructions at trial, and we thus assess this appellate contention for plain error only. In reviewing for plain error, we first assess whether any error occurred at all. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770. This assessment implicates our decision in <em>United States v. Buculei, </em>where we had the opportunity to examine the statutory term \u201ccustody or control,\u201d recognizing that the term is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256(7) as \u201cincluding temporary supervision over or responsibility for a minor whether legally or illegally obtained.\u201d 262 F.3d 322, 331-32 (4th Cir.2001). In <em>Buculei, </em>we observed that \u201ccontrol\u201d under \u00a7 2251A need not be synonymous with parental consent or knowledge, but \u201cinvolves something more than mere persuasion, inducement, or coercion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332. There, as here, the trial court had instructed the jury that \u201ccontrol\u201d is \u201cthe power to manage, command, direct or restrain another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332 n. 9. We found no error in that instruction, and concluded that it fairly represented the pertinent language of the relevant statute. Because the instructions to Moser\u2019s jury also defined \u201ccontrol\u201d as \u201cthe power to manage, command, direct or restrain another person,\u201d this aspect thereof was entirely proper. J.A. 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The district court in this case also instructed Moser\u2019s jury, however, \u201cthat engaging in sexually explicit conduct with a minor is in fact obtaining control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 833. Moser contends that this aspect of the instructions renders them plainly erroneous, in that the court conflated the element of control with the separate element of sexual intent. Additionally, Moser asserts that, because the evidence reflects that all involved were willing participants, he did not offer to assume the statutorily requisite control.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">When viewed in isolation, this aspect of the instructions arguably runs afoul of our conclusion in <em>Buculei </em>that \u201ccontrol\u201d involves more than mere persuasion. It is well settled, however, that \u201cwe do not examine jury instructions in isolation.\u201d <em>United States v. Ryan-Webster, </em>353 F.3d 353, 364 n. 17 (4th Cir.2003); <em>see also Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 391, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999) (cautioning that \u201cinstructions must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the entire charge,\u201d and noting that \u201cinstructions that might be ambiguous in the abstract can be cured When read in conjunction with other instructions\u201d). Instead, \u201cin reviewing jury instructions, we \u2018accord the district court much discretion and will not reverse provided that the instructions, taken as a whole, adequately state the controlling law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wills, </em>346 F.3d 476, 492 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Teague v. Bakker, </em>35 F.3d 978, 985 (4th Cir.1994)). Accordingly, \u201c[o]n appeal, we examine whether the jury instructions and verdict form, considered as a whole, were sufficient so that the jurors understood the issues and were not misled.\u201d <em>United States v. Poirier, </em>321 F.3d 1024, 1032 (11th Cir.2003) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Having carefully examined as a whole the trial court\u2019s instructions relating to Count Three, we are unable to conclude that they were plainly erroneous. Before giving the jury the specific instruction that Moser complains of, the court properly defined control as the \u201cpower to manage, command, direct or restrain another person.\u201d <em>See </em>J.A. 832; <em>Buculei, </em>262 F.3d at 332 n. 9. It also instructed the jury that, in order to convict on Count Three, it was obliged to find that the prosecution had satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt all six elements of the offense charged. These elements included the separate elements of control and sexual intent. The court fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ther instructed that, in order <em>to </em>find Moser guilty of Count Three, the jury had to find that he offered to obtain control over Lisa and Jessie and that he did so with the intent to promote the engaging in of sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of creating a visual depiction thereof. Viewed as a whole, the instructions on Count Three identified control and sexual intent as two separate and distinct elements and, accordingly, the instructions complained of were not plainly erroneous. This appellate contention thus fails and we need not address the other <em>Olano </em>factors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we reject Moser\u2019s contentions of error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-5\">. In addition to the communications described above, Moser emailed several photographs to Kelly with the request that she show them to her daughters.
