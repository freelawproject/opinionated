Summary judgment is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Evans v. Technologies Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 958 (4th Cir.1996). We have thoroughly reviewed the briefs and joint appendix and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Holloman v. City of Myrtle Beach, </em>No. 4:04-cv-01868-TLW (D.S.C. June 8, 2006).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b194-10\"> Subsequent to the filing of Holloman's notice of appeal, the district court granted Holloman\u2019s motion to correct the judgment. The district court entered an amended judgment declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Holloman\u2019s state law claims and remanding those claims to state court. That order is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
