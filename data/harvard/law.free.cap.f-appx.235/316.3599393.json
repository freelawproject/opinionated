Herrera argues that his confession to possession of the firearm was uncorroborated and that \u00a7 922(g)(1) cannot constitutionally be construed as criminalizing intrastate possession of a firearm merely because the firearm had traveled in the past from another state or country. This court does not review Herrera\u2019s argument that his confession was uncorroborated because Herrera, as the appellant, has failed to provide a complete record on appeal of the evidence relevant to that argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(1), (2); <em>United States v. Narvaez, </em>38 F.3d 162, 167 (5th Cir.1994). Even if Herrera\u2019s argument were considered, the evidence before this court demonstrates that independent evidence exists sufficient to justify a jury\u2019s inference of the truth of his confession. <em>See United States v. Deville, </em>278 F.3d 500, 506-07 (5th Cir.2002). The firearm in question was found by police inside a car in which Herrera was a passenger, within arm\u2019s reach of Herrera, after police had observed Herrera moving in such a way as to suggest that he was hiding something.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Herrera\u2019s argument that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
