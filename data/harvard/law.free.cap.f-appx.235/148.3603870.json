Rochelle\u2019s petition challenges a February 15, 2007 order from the Eastern District of North Carolina. That order denied a pro se motion filed by Rochelle in which he (1) requested that his August 6, 2007 civil commitment hearing be held, not by video conference, but in open court; (2) requested copies of the discovery motion in his underlying criminal case; (3) requested the Public Defenders\u2019 Office to be removed from his case; (4) challenged the adequacy of his evaluations at the Federal Medical Center at Butner, North Carolina; and (5) requested that he be released from the Federal Medical Center so that he could acquire resources to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>hire private counsel and mount his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Rochelle\u2019s mandamus petition reasserts claims raised in his pro se motion. With respect to his request to be released from Butner Medical Center, Rochelle fails to demonstrate a clear entitlement to a writ of mandamus on this request. <em>See In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Finally, Rochelle\u2019s remaining claims are not cognizable in a petition for writ of mandamus. Accordingly, although we grant Rochelle\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny his petition for writ of mandamus. We also deny Rochelle\u2019s motion to stay the civil commitment hearing. In light of this disposition, Rochelle\u2019s motion to expedite is denied as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and oral argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
