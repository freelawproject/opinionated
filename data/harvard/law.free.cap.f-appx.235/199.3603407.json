Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Lahmuddin fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Lahmuddin cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-27\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.
