The district court sentenced Ellison to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Ellison did not file a notice of appeal after the court entered judgment. On June 22, 2006, Ellison filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), asserting his trial counsel failed to file a notice of appeal on his behalf. The district court granted the motion and entered an amended judgment from which Ellison could appeal. Ellison filed a timely notice of appeal from the second judgment. On appeal and after Ellison\u2019s counsel filed a brief, Ellison filed a pro-se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Ellison\u2019s counsel first argues that the district court erred by enhancing Ellison\u2019s sentence based on its factual findings that Ellison possessed a gun and that the manufacture of methamphetamine in this case created a substantial risk of harm to the environment. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), (6) (2004). Ellison contends the Government failed to submit evidence supporting these findings. When, as here, the district court relies on information in the Presentence Report in making findings, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the information relied on by the district court is incorrect; mere objections are insufficient. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990). \u201cWithout an affirmative showing the information is inaccurate, the court is 'free to adopt the findings of the [presentence report] without more specific inquiry or explanation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). After thoroughly reviewing the record, we find Ellison has not met his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">Ellison\u2019s counsel also argues that Ellison\u2019s sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the court merely mentioned without articulating its consideration of the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). This Court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, making any appropriate factual findings. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The court then should consider the resulting advisory guideline range in conjunction with the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a), and determine an appropriate sentence. \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">\u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3044, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2007). \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable, if the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s explanation should provide some indication (1) that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with respect to the particular defendant; and (2) that it has also considered the potentially meritorious arguments raised by both parties about sentencing.\u201d <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 380 (citations omitted). \u201c[I]n determining whether there has been an adequate explanation, [this Court does] not evaluate a court\u2019s sentencing statements in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381. Rather, \u201c[t]he context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation may imbue it with enough content for [this Court] to evaluate both whether the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and whether it did so properly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Here the court sentenced Ellison at the bottom of the properly calculated guidelines\u2019 range. Ellison fails to provide any reason why he should have been sentenced below the guidelines\u2019 range. Although the court did not articulate any substantive explanation of the sentence, it specifically noted its consideration of the <em>Booker </em>decision and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing its sentence. Because Ellison can not overcome the presumption of reasonableness, and the sentence is the minimum recommended by the sentencing guidelines range, we find the sentence to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Finally, we have reviewed the issues raised in Ellison\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and find them without merit. Based on the foregoing, we grant Ellison\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief and affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
