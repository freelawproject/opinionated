Appellee has <em>not </em>filed a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-21\">On 22 December 2006, Florance removed the underlying state-court action to district court, relying, <em>inter alia, </em>on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (federal-question jurisdiction). The State of Texas did <em>not </em>move for remand. Within 30 days of such removal, however, on 19 January 2007, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>remanded the action due to Florance\u2019s failure to attach to his removal notice a copy of the underlying state-court pleadings, in violation of local court rule. In so doing, the district court cited <em>Corry v. City of Houston, </em>832 F.Supp. 1095 (S.D.Tex.1993), for the proposition that a \u201cdistrict court may <em>sua sponte </em>remand a case for procedural defects within thirty days of removal\u201d. The district court did <em>not </em>provide any other basis <em>for </em>remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-22\">\u201cOur standard of review as to determinations of jurisdiction is plenary.\u201d <em>Bogle v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>24 F.3d 758, 760 (5th Cir.1994). Along that line, \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). Our court \u201cha[s] construed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\u00a7 1447(d) prohibition against appellate review of remand orders as being limited to those situations where the district court\u2019s remand order is grounded upon either subject matter jurisdiction or a timely filed [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1447(c) motion asserting a defect in removal\u201d. <em>Albarado v. S. Pac. Transp. Co., </em>199 F.3d 762, 764 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Because, as noted, the only stated remand basis was a procedural 'defect, \u00a7 1447(d) does not prohibit our reviewing the remand order. <em>See Albarado, </em>199 F.3d at 764; <em>see also Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London v. Warrantech Corp., </em>461 F.3d 568, 572 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201cfor a remand order to be renewable on appeal, the district court must \u2018clearly and affirmatively\u2019 state a non \u00a7 1447(c) ground for remand\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Moreover, our court has held a \u201cdistrict court aet[s] without statutory authority when it <em>sua sponte </em>remand[s] ... on procedural grounds\u201d. <em>In re Allstate Ins. Co., </em>8 F.3d 219, 221 (5th Cir.1993) (vacating district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>procedural-defect-based remand order); <em>see also Schexnayder v. Entergy Louisiana, Inc., </em>394 F.3d 280, 284 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201c[Without a motion from a party, [a] district court\u2019s [proeedural-defect-based] remand order is not authorized by \u00a7 1447(c)\u201d.). The district court\u2019s remand order, therefore, exceeded its authority. Accordingly, the order is vacated, and this matter remanded to district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
