Walters argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>that the district court erred by increasing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) after finding that the offense \u201cinvolved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d Even after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The record reflects that Walters was driving a tractor-trailer carrying five illegal aliens. Three of the aliens were hiding in a compartment under the bunk in the tractor\u2019s sleeper area from which they could not easily extricate themselves. The district court did not err in concluding that these circumstances qualified as intentional or reckless creation of a \u201csubstantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 401-03 (5th Cir.2006); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1, comment.(n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
