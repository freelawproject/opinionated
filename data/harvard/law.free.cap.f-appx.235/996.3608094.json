He contends that pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005), sentences, including those imposed upon revocation of supervised release, are reviewed under the reasonableness standard. Further, he argues that the sentence imposed was unreasonable because it substantially exceeded the recommended range and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the sentence were insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">The Government has moved for dismissal of the appeal or for summary affirmance on the ground that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Castaneda\u2019s appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Castaneda cannot prevail on the merits of his appeal, we pretermit consideration of the jurisdictional issue. <em>See United States v. Weathersby, </em>958 F.2d 65, 66 (5th Cir.1992). The Government\u2019s motion for dismissal of the appeal or for summary affirmance is therefore denied. The Government\u2019s alternative request for an extension of time to file an appeal brief is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">This court need not decide the appropriate standard of review for a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release in the wake of <em>Booker </em>because Castaneda has not shown that his sentence was either unreasonable or plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1083, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). Castaneda was subject to a three year statutory maximum sentence upon revocation of his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii), 3559(a)(2), and 3583(e)(3). The Sentencing Guidelines recommended a prison term between three and nine months based on Castaneda\u2019s Grade C violations and his criminal history category of I. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Castaneda\u2019s sentence, while in excess of the recommended range, was within the statutory maximum sentence that the district court could have imposed. Further, a review of the record demonstrates that the district court considered the advisory guideline sentencing range and the relevant sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, the sentence was neither unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable. <em>See Hinson, </em>429 F.3d at 120. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1030-33\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
