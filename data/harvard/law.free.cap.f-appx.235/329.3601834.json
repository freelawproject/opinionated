The district court sentenced Wesley to 120 months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-27\">Wesley asserts that the district court erred in assessing two criminal history points for his 1999 domestic violence conviction. As Wesley concedes, this issue will be reviewed for plain error only. To demonstrate plain error, the defendant bears the burden of showing that (1) there is an error, (2) the error is plain, and (3) the error affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these conditions are satisfied, this court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-28\">The record does not demonstrate a lack of representation for Wesley\u2019s 1999 domes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>tic violence conviction. Wesley has not sustained his burden to show that his 1999 domestic violence conviction was constitutionally invalid. <em>See United States v. Osborne, </em>68 F.3d 94, 100 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, Wesley has not shown plain error in the assessment of two criminal history points for his 1999 domestic violence conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Wesley also asserts that the 120-month sentence was an abuse of discretion and unreasonable. Based on an offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of IV, Wesley\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 84 to 105 months of imprisonment. The district court determined that pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), both an upward departure and a variance were warranted. Using an offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of V, the district court sentenced Wesley to 120 months of imprisonment. An upward departure is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). A non-guidelines sentence is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The district court upwardly departed under \u00a7 4A1.3, finding that Wesley\u2019s criminal history category under-represented the seriousness of his criminal history. The. district court also considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), such as the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. The district court\u2019s reasons for departing advance the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a) and are justified by the facts of the case. <em>See United States v. Zunigar-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006). The district court\u2019s decision to depart and the extent of the departure were not an abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Wesley further contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider and address certain mitigating circumstances. The district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Wesley\u2019s sentence. Because the district court did not fail to account for a factor which should have received significant weight, give significant weight to an improper factor, or make a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors, Wesley\u2019s sentence is reasonable. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 707-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
