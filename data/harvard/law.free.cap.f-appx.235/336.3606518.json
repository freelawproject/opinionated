Gomez argues that the district court erred in finding that his prior Florida conviction for armed burglary under Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.02(2) was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of imposing the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Specifically, he contends that the Florida definition of burglary is broader than the \u201c \u2018generic contemporary meaning\u2019 of the term \u2018burglary of a dwelling\u2019 \u201d because it \u201cexpressly includes the curtilage that the modern definition of \u2018dwelling\u2019 has abandoned.\u201d He also contends that the Florida armed burglary statute \u201cdoes not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-21\">To decide whether Gomez\u2019s prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense, we must determine the scope of the prior conviction, examining the statute and certain adjudicative records if necessary. <em>See United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 339-40 (5th Cir.2006). The Florida statute under which Gomez was convicted and the criminal information to which he pleaded guilty both include entry into a dwelling\u2019s curtilage. This court has recently determined \u201cthat the ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of burglary of a dwelling does not extend to the grounds around the dwelling, but actually requires unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, the dwelling itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>301, 304 (5th Cir.2007). (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (construing Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.02(2), which is in relevant part identical to the statute at issue here). Thus, Gomez was not convicted of the enumerated offense of \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, the Florida armed burglary statute, which required that Gomez merely possess a dangerous weapon during the burglary, does not have \u201cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the <em>person </em>of another.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. l(B)(iii) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d 345, 348 (5th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the district court erred in applying the 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Gomez also argues that, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 70-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Gomez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Gomez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve if for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the conviction, VACATE the sentence, and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\">. The information to which Gomez plead guilty stated that he \u201cdid unlawfully enter or remain in a structure, to wit: a dwelling located at 8201 Northwest 7th Street....\u201d The information to which Gomez-Guerra plead guilty stated that he \"did enter or remain in a structure, to-wit, a dwelling or the curtilage thereof, the property of [the victim] .... \u201d Even though Gomez\u2019s information did not include the \"curtilage\u201d language contained in Gomez-Guerra's information, Gomez's information does not eliminate the possibility that he merely entered the curtilage because Florida defines \"dwelling\u201d itself to include curtilage. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 810.011(b); <em>Gomez-Guerra, 485 </em>F.3d at 303.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) provides an eight-level increase for prior commission of an \"aggravated felony,\u201d which after a few twists and turns is defined to include a slightly different definition of \"crime of violence\u201d-that of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, which includes crimes that have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force against the person <em>or property </em>of another or crimes involving substantial risk that such force against person <em>or property </em>may be used during the commission of the offense. We do not decide whether this enhancement might apply on remand. This is true even though <em>United States v. Diaz-Diaz, </em>327 F.3d 410, 414 (5th Cir.2003), held that mere possession of a gun did not involve a substantial risk of force in commission of the crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), because the crime of conviction here was possession of a gun during a burglary, not just possession of a gun by itself, and possession of a gun during a burglary <em>may </em>include as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force against property under \u00a7 16(a) or <em>may </em>involve a substantial risk of force against person or property during the commission of <em>the </em>offense, even though possession of a gun by itself does not, under \u00a7 16(b). We say nothing about that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
