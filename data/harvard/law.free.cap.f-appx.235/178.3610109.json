Mark Shafer seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing Shafer\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The notice of appeal was received in the district court shortly after expiration of the appeal period. Because Shafer is incarcerated, the notice is considered filed as of the date it was properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1);. <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). The record does not reveal when Shafer gave the notice of appeal to prison officials for mailing. Accordingly, we remand the case for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to obtain this information from the parties and to determine whether the filing was timely under Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) and <em>Houston v. Lack. </em>The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-21\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
