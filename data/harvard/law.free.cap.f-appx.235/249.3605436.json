The district court enhanced Zamorano\u2019s sentence based upon its determination that his prior California conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor was a conviction for a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). Zamorano argues that the enhancement was improper because the statute under which he was convicted sets the legal age for consent to sexual activity at 18 years of age while the Model Penal Code and the majority of the states set the legal age of consent for sexual activity at 16 years of age or younger.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">Zamorano\u2019s prior conviction was under CaLPenal Code Ann. \u00a7 261.5. Under a common sense approach, Zamorano\u2019s conviction was for the enumerated offenses of statutory rape and sexual abuse of a minor and, accordingly, a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). See \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(b)(iii)); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-23\">Zamorano asserts that his 46-month guidelines sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and is unreasonable. He also asserts that his sentence is unreasonable under the current regime of reasonableness review because the district court failed to consider his arguments based on cultural assimilation and family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ties that warranted a sentence below the advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The presumption of reasonableness afforded a sentence within a properly calculated advisory guidelines range is consistent with <em>Booker. See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The record reflects that the district court considered Zamorano\u2019s objections and arguments, the recommendations of the presentence report, the applicable guidelines range, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because the district court exercised its discretion to impose a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence was presumptively reasonable, and we may infer that the district court considered all the factors for a fair sentence. <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2463-68; <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Zamorano did not demonstrate that his sentence was unreasonable. See <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(May 21, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Zamorano also contends that the felony and aggravated felony provisions contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Zamorano contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Zamorano properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
