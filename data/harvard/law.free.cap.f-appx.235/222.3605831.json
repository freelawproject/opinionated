The petition for review is thus dismissed as to the claims concerning asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We will uphold the conclusion that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal if that conclusion is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the decision be based on the record evidence and that the decision be substantially reasonable. Car<em>bajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Under this standard, we will affirm the decision unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a sole attack by school classmates, when Siagian was in sixth grade, failed to establish past persecution. This decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See, e.g., Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 584 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Fleurinor v. INS, </em>585 F.2d 129, 133-34 (5th Cir.1978). Substantial evidence also supports the conclusion that Siagian has not shown that he will be singled out for persecution if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1),(2); <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 307 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
