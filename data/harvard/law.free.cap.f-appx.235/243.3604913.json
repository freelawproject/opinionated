Pazzi-De Hoyos\u2019 supervised release with respect to a prior conviction was also revoked. Pazzi-De Hoyos appeals his conviction and revocation, arguing that (1) venue in the Northern District of Texas was improper with respect to his illegal reentry guilty plea conviction and (2) the district court erred when it used his prior aggravated felony conviction to enhance his illegal reentry sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-21\">Pazzi-De Hoyos\u2019 physical presence as well as the illegal status of his presence was discovered by immigration authorities when he was within the Northern District of Texas. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, venue was proper in the Northern District. <em>See United States v. Asibor, </em>109 F.3d 1023, 1037 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Santana-Castellano, </em>74 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-22\">Pazzi-De Hoyos also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Pazzi-De Hoyos\u2019 constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Pazzi-De Hoyos contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Pazzi-De Hoyos properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th C\u00edr.
