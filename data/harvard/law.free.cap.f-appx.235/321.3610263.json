Aranda argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>that the BIA abused its discretion by dismissing his motion to reopen as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">For an alien whose order of deportation became final before March 22, 1999, a motion to reopen for the purpose of seeking protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) \u201cshall not be granted\u201d unless the motion to reopen was filed by June 21, 1999. 8 C.F.R. 208.18(b)(2)(i). Aranda was ordered deported in April 1993. The motion to reopen at issue in this matter was filed in January 2005. The BIA thus did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Aranda\u2019s appeal to the extent that he sought reopening under \u00a7 208.18(b)(2). To the extent that Aranda argues that the BIA should have exercised its sua sponte authority to reopen his removal proceedings, we lack jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 248-50 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Aranda\u2019s PETITION FOR REVIEW is DENIED. All other OUTSTANDING MOTIONS are also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
