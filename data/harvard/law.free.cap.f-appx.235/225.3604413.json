He attempted to file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition challenging this conviction, but the district court dismissed his petition without prejudice pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for failing to comply with a court order to pay the filing fee or request leave to proceed in forma pauperis. Tones now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to challenge this dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-22\">Because a new petition filed by Tones would be barred by the limitations period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice operates as a dismissal with prejudice. <em>See Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 180, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001); <em>Gray v. Fidelity Acceptance Corp., </em>634 F.2d 226, 227 (5th Cir.1981). In his notice of appeal, and again before this court, Tones asserts that he submitted a timely request for withdrawal of his funds from his prison account and that this request was mailed in a timely manner. In light of this, there is no \u201cclear record of delay or contumacious conduct\u201d by Tones. <em>See Gray, </em>634 F.2d at 227 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Consequently, reasonable jurists would find it debatable that the district court erred in dismissing Tones\u2019s petition on procedural grounds. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). COA is therefore GRANTED on the question whether Tones attempted to comply in a timely manner with the district court\u2019s order for payment. This case is REMANDED for consideration of this issue in the first instance by the district court and for review of the prison records or an evidentiary hearing, if necessary. Tones\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal is likewise GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
