He argues that the sentence is unreasonable because it exceeds the sentencing range recommended by the relevant policy statements in the Sentencing Guidelines and because the district court failed to specify its reasons for the sentence. The Government moves to dismiss the appeal or for summary affirmance on the basis that we lack jurisdiction to consider it under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4). Wallace has served the entirety of his sentence and was released from prison on February 6, 2007. Because the issue raised in Wallace\u2019s appeal is moot, the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 15, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998). The Government\u2019s motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1032-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
