Martinez had raised a number of claims regarding a prison disciplinary hearing and various conditions of confinement. The district court dismissed without prejudice after Martinez failed to comply with an order to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-21\">Martinez\u2019s appellate brief fails to adequately address the district court\u2019s basis for dismissing his complaint. Although this court liberally construes pro se briefs, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, 985 </em>F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Martinez has failed to brief the relevant issue for appeal, his appeal is frivolous and is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Martinez\u2019s motion for production of documents also is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-22\">Martinez is cautioned that the dismissal of his appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). He is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent dan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">MOTION FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
