Casta\u00f1o argues that he should not have to exhaust his administrative remedies because he is entitled to an immediate release from prison and, thus, administratively exhausting his claim will delay his release from prison by months.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">A federal prisoner seeking credit on his sentence may \u201cfile his petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241, but he must first exhaust his administrative remedies through the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d <em>United States v. Gabor, </em>905 F.2d 76, 78 n. 2 (5th Cir.1990). Dismissal without prejudice of a federal prisoner\u2019s section 2241 suit for failure to exhaust administrative remedies is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Fuller v. Rich, </em>11 F.3d 61 at 62 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">\u201cExceptions to the exhaustion requirement are appropriate where the available administrative remedies either are unavailable or wholly inappropriate to the relief sought, or where the attempt to exhaust such remedies would itself be a patently futile course of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Exceptions to the exhaustion requirement apply only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d and Casta\u00f1o bears the burden of demonstrating the futility of administrative review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">Casta\u00f1o has failed to carry his burden. He has not shown that available administrative remedies are either unavailable or wholly inappropriate to the relief sought. Moreover, he has not shown that exhausting his claim administratively is futile in the sense that BOP routinely denies claims such as his.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Castano\u2019s \u201cfutility argument\u201d is essentially an assertion that his sentence-calculation claim is meritorious and that he should therefore not have to endure any delay caused by seeking administrative review of the claim. The documents provided by Casta\u00f1o, however, while not definitively showing that his claim is without merit, suggest that it likely is.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Even if Castano\u2019s claim is meritorious, however, and if he has to suffer a delay to his immediate release while his claim progresses through the administrative review process, that delay is one of his own making. Casta\u00f1o states in his appellate brief that he learned of the alleged erroneous sentence calculation when he first arrived at Bureau of Prisons, which, according to the documents presented by Casta\u00f1o, was in 1995. In addition, the \u201cSentence Monitoring Computation Data\u201d sheet submitted by Casta\u00f1o is dated August 2004. Casta\u00f1o did not file his section 2241 petition, however, until 2006. Given Castano\u2019s lack of diligence in pursuing this claim, he has not shown that his case presents \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d warranting an exception to the exhaustion requirement. <em>See Fuller, </em>11 F.3d at 62. <em>Cf. Deters v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 789, 796-97 (5th Cir.1993) (failure to exhaust state remedies); <em>Cox v. Jenkins, </em>878 F.2d 414, 419 (D.C.Cir.1989) (finding exhaustion [under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415] not futile where, <em>inter alia, </em>both parties contributed to delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Casta\u00f1o has not carried his burden of showing that an exception to the exhaustion requirement should be applied. The judgment is modified so that the dismissal is \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and as so modified is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
