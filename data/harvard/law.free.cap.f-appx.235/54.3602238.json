The district court sentenced Husband to eighty-seven months of imprisonment on each of the eight counts and ordered that the terms be served consecutively, for a total of 696 months. We affirmed his convictions and sentence. <em>United States v. Husband, </em>119 Fed.Appx. 475 (4th Cir.2005). Husband filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. On October 3, 2005, the Supreme Court granted the petition, vacated this Court\u2019s judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Husband v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 802, 126 S.Ct. 322, 163 L.Ed.2d 30 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-26\">On remand, Husband argues that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker. </em>In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, violated the Sixth Amendment. 543 U.S. at 233-34, 125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>S.Ct. 738 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2005) (requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence. within the applicable guideline range), and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 245-46, 125 S.Ct. 738. (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We vacate Husband\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with the <em>Booker </em>decision. Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in \u00a7 3553, and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Because the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order does not affect our rejection in our prior opinion of Husband\u2019s claims that the statute of limitations had expired, that his plea was not knowing and voluntary, that there was no adequate basis for accepting his plea, and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, we affirm Husband\u2019s convictions for the reasons set forth in the prior opinion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
