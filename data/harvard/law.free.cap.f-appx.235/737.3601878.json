For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-14\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b772-15\">Menendez filed a \u00a7 1983 action against Keefe Supply Company (\u201cKeefe\u201d); Keefe\u2019s canteen manager; Okeechobee Correctional Institution; Orlester Dickens, the prison warden; J.D. Anderson and John or Jane Doe of the Board of Inmate Grievance Appeals; and S. Montijo-Banasco and Marta Villacorta of the Florida Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d), alleging that the defendants had negligently failed \u201cto protect, and then replace\u201d his \u201cconstitutionally-protected property.\u201d Specifically, Menendez alleged that on February 26, 2005, a fellow inmate stole his prison identification card and used it to charge $47.82 worth of commissary items to his inmate account, even though he had personally warned canteen operators of the theft and was told that the card had been deactivated. Menendez further alleged that although he followed all of the grievance procedures outlined by the DOC, officials failed to restore the $47.82 to his account. In relief, he sought restitution of the $47.82, reimbursement of the costs incurred in filing the instant complaint, and other monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-16\">After performing the required screening under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, the magistrate court concluded that adequate remedies were available to Menendez under state law, and thus, the alleged deprivation was not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. The magistrate therefore recommended that Menendez\u2019s complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Menendez objected to the recommendation, asserting that the state had failed to provide an adequate post-deprivation remedy, as he had followed the DOC\u2019s grievance procedures and not obtained relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and dismissed the complaint. Menendez now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915A. <em>Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). Under \u00a7 1915A, the magistrate or district court is required to screen civil complaints filed by prisoners against governmental officers or entities, and shall dismiss the complaint if it is frivolous, fails to state a claim, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(1), (b)(2). A complaint fails to state a claim when \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Flint v. ABB, Inc., </em>337 F.3d 1326, 1328-29 (11th Cir.2003). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). Nonetheless, federal courts have discretion to dismiss <em>pro se </em>claims if they lack an arguable basis either in fact or in law. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 324-25, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 1831-32, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. \u201cProcedural due process rules are meant to protect persons not from the deprivation, but from the mistaken or unjustified deprivation of life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 259, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1050, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). \u201cIn this circuit, a \u00a7 1983 claim alleging a denial of procedural due process requires proof of three elements: (1) a deprivation of a constitutionally-protected liberty or property interest; (2) state action; and (3) constitutionally-inadequate process.\u201d <em>Grayden v. Rhodes, </em>345 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Cryder v. Oxendine, </em>24 F.3d 175, 177 (11th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">But \u201cliability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due proeess[,]\u201d as \u201cthe Constitution does not guarantee due care on the part of state officials.\u201d <em>Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998). Thus, mere negligent conduct does not \u201cwor[k] a deprivation in the constitutional sense.\u201d <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 330, 106 S.Ct. 662, 664, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). And although due process generally \u201centitles an individual to notice and some form of hearing before state action may finally deprive him or her of a property interest[,]\u201d <em>Cryder, </em>24 F.3d at 177, due process does <em>not </em>require a pre-deprivation hearing \u201cwhere the holding of such a hearing would be impracticable, that is, where the deprivation is the result of either a negligent or an intentional deprivation of property.\u201d <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1562-63 (11th Cir.1994) (citations omitted). \u201c[Ojnly when the state refuses to provide a process sufficient to remedy the procedural deprivation does a constitutional violation actionable under section 1983 arise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1577. \u201c[A]s long as some adequate post[-]deprivation remedy is available, no due process violation has occurred.\u201d <em>Lindsey v. Storey, </em>936 F.2d 554, 561 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">Here, Menendez alleges that the defendants were \u201cnegligent\u201d in their handling of the theft of his identification card, the unauthorized use of his inmate account, and the \u201csubsequent denials for relief\u2019 via the DOC\u2019s grievance procedures. But, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>stated above, \u201cliability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.\u201d <em>Levis, </em>523 U.S. at 849, 118 S.Ct. at 1718. As such, Menendez has failed to allege \u201ca deprivation in the constitutional sense,\u201d and his claim is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Daniels, </em>474 U.S. at 330, 106 S.Ct. at 664. Accordingly, the dismissal of his complaint was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\"><em>ll!. </em>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-4\">. We may affirm the judgment below \"on any ground that finds support in the record.\u201d <em>Lucas v. W.W.
