Ruston\u2019s motion is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (citation omitted). If the appeal is frivolous, this court may dismiss it sua sponte under 5th Cir. R. 42.2. <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-22\">Ruston has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice. Ruston is not entitled to habeas relief based on conclusional allegations that it is not possible to raise his claims in the pending criminal case due to fraud and judicial and prosecutorial misconduct. <em>See Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990). Ruston\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Ruston\u2019s motions for production, for contempt of court, for judicial notice, and to disqualify the judges of this court are also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-23\">IFP DENIED; MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
