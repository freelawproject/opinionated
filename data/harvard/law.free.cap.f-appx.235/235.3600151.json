Carbajal argues on appeal that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction, while Arcos argues that the district court erred by refusing to accept Arcos\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-21\">Although Carbajal moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief and again at the close of the defense evidence, he did not renew the motion at the close of the Government\u2019s rebuttal evidence. Accordingly, we review the evidence only to determine whether there has been a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Green, </em>293 F.3d 886, 895 (5th Cir.2002). Because the trial evidence supports the jury\u2019s determination that Carbajal conspired to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute it, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-22\">Because Arcos denied any involvement with illegal drugs at his rearraignment hearing, the district court did not err by refusing to accept his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Cano-Guel, </em>167 F.3d 900, 906 (5th Cir.1999); Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a)(1). Furthermore, Ar-cos has failed to show that acceptance of his guilty plea after trial commenced would have made him eligible for a reduction in offense level under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a)(l), 5C1.2(a); <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409, 414 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, any error resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the court\u2019s refusal to allow Arcos to enter a guilty plea after the jury was empaneled was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
