We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-23\">We note that while the sentence Weaver received is above the advisory sentencing guideline range of eighteen to twenty-four months, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 </em>7B1.4(a) (2006), it is within the applicable statutory maximum sentence. Moreover, our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court sufficiently considered the statutory factors and explained its reasons for imposing a sentence above the advisory guideline range. We therefore find that the sentence imposed upon revocation of super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>vised release is not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). We further grant the Government\u2019s motion to strike Weaver\u2019s reply brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
