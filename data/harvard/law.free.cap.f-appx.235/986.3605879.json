Rodriguez argues that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level based on its determination that Rodriguez\u2019s prior Texas conviction for attempted kidnapping was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2; however, he concedes in his reply brief that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Iniguez-Barba, </em>485 F.3d 790, 791-93 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-25\">Rodriguez also argues that his sentence is unreasonable in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), but he again concedes that his argument is foreclosed under our precedent. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-20 (5th Cir.2005) and <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court has rejected Rodriguez\u2019s contention that his sentence within the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Rodriguez\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">Rodriguez also argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and subsequent Supreme Court decisions. Rodriguez\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rodriguez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006); <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624 (5th Cir.2007). Rodriguez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1020-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
