Thiam challenges the Board\u2019s finding that she failed to qualify for withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-22\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Thiam fails to show that the evidence compels a finding that she qualified for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). In addition, we uphold the finding that Thiam failed to establish that it was more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to Senegal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-23\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
