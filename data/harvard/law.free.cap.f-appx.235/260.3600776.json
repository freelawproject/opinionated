The Huangs argue that their motion to reopen proceedings vacated the prior order that they voluntarily depart by a certain date. This argument lacks merit. <em>Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 387 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1874, 167 L.Ed.2d 363 (2007). The Huangs argue that the BIA\u2019s order reopening proceedings was an implicit holding that they were statutorily eligible for adjustment of status and that this comprises the \u201claw of the case.\u201d This argument is without merit. The referenced order expressly afforded both parties the opportunity to present evidence regarding the Huangs\u2019 statutory and discretionary eligibility for adjustment of status. There was no finding, implicit or otherwise, that the Huangs were statutorily eligible for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
