We review the district court\u2019s denial for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Boe, </em>117 F.3d 830, 831 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-24\">Millsaps\u2019s motion relies upon a sentencing guideline amendment that was enacted more than two years before his sentence was imposed. Millsaps\u2019s contention that he did not receive notice of his sentencing enhancement pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 is not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Millsaps\u2019s motion. <em>See Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-25\">Millsaps\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). We caution Millsaps that further frivolous filings may result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary penalties, and restrictions on his ability to file appeals in this court and actions in any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
