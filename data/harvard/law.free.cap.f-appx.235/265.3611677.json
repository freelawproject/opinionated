For the reasons explained below, we dismiss Schildkraut\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-14\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007); <em>see Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185, 186 (5th Cir.1994) (stating that \u201c[a] timely filed notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite\u201d to this court\u2019s review).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-19\">Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 3(a), \u201c[a]n appeal permitted by law as of right from a district court to a court of appeals may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4.\u201d In a civil case such as this one, the notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered. Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(A); <em>see 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-20\">Applying the rules for computing time set forth in Fed. R.App. P. 26(a), Schildkraut\u2019s notice of appeal, filed August 23, 2005, is untimely because it was filed more than 30 days after the entry, on July 21, 2005, of the district court\u2019s amended judgment. Because Schildkraut\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely, his appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Di-son, </em>20 F.3d at 186. All outstanding motions are denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED AS UNNECESSARY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
