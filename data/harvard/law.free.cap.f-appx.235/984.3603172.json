Rogers moves for appointment of appellate counsel, and he requests that this court hold the appeal in abeyance. Appellees Roach, Allen, and Brey have moved to strike Rogers\u2019s motion and brief, to dismiss the appeal, and for entry of an award of attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">The district court denied Rogers\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Rogers is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Rogers argues that the district court failed to recognize that his conviction violated the Fifth Amendment; that the defendants \u201choodwinked\u201d the district court by misrepresenting Rogers\u2019s claims; and that the denial of IFP will cause Rogers to suffer extreme financial hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Rogers has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his appeal would be frivolous. He has failed to brief a challenge to the basis for the district court\u2019s denial of IFP, and any such argument is not preserved. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Rogers\u2019s motions to proceed IFP on appeal and for appointment of counsel are denied, his motion to hold the appeal in abeyance is denied as moot, the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal is denied as moot, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The appellees\u2019 motion to strike is denied as moot and their motion for attorneys fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Rogers\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Rogers also accumulated a strike in <em>Rogers v. Young, </em>No. 3:95-CV-524 (N.D.Tex. Apr. 26, 1995). As Rogers has now accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP pursuant to \u00a7 1915 while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; ALL OTHER MOTIONS DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1018-38\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
