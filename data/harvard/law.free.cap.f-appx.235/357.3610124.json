Hartfield argues that he is actually innocent of the sentence enhancement because his prior attempted burglary conviction is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(e) and \u00a7 4B1.1 and further argues that his counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge the enhancement of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">In order to satisfy the criteria of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 savings clause, Hartfield must show that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that the claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when it should have been raised at trial, on appeal, or in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Hartfield has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hart-field\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
