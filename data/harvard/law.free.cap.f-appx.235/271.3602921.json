The district court denied Adeoshun\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP status, Adeoshun is challenging that certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Adeoshun\u2019s motion addresses only his asserted indigent status and does not brief any argument regarding the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal was not taken in good faith. Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are liberally construed, even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Adeoshun has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal is not taken in good faith is incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, the request for IFP status is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. We caution Adeoshun that the filing of frivolous pleadings of any kind may result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
