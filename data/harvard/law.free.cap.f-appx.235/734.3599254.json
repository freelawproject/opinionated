Williams filed her petition after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-132,110 Stat. 1214 (1996). Therefore, the provisions of the AEDPA govern this appeal. We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-13\">(1) Whether the district court erred in finding that Williams\u2019s resentencing in case nos. 99-41128-B and 00-20802 did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-15\">(2) If so, whether counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the double jeopardy issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">For the reasons set forth more fully below, we hold that the district court did not err in finding no Double Jeopardy Clause violation. We therefore do not reach the second issue in the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of Williams\u2019s habeas petition. <em>McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1073, 126 S.Ct. 1828, 164 L.Ed.2d 522 (2006). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and mixed questions of law and fact <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">.Habeas relief from a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court can only be granted if the state court\u2019s adjudication</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-19\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-20\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-21\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The state court\u2019s factual findings are presumed correct, unless rebutted by the petitioner with clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(1). Clearly established law is the law of the Supreme Court, as reflected in its holdings at the time of the relevant state court decision. <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1241 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-22\">A decision \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law contradicts the United States Supreme Court on a settled question of law or holds differently than did that Court on a set of materially indistinguishable facts-in short, it is a decision \u201csubstantially different from the [Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Court\u2019s] relevant precedent.\u201d A decision that unreasonably applies federal law identifies the correct governing legal principle as articulated by the United States Supreme Court, but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the petitioner\u2019s case, \u201cunreasonably extends [the] principle ... to a new context where it should not apply, or unreasonably refuses to extend [it] to a new context where it should apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><em>Gamble v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dept. of Corr., </em>450 F.3d 1245, 1247 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 510, 166 L.Ed.2d 381 (2006) (citations omitted) (alterations and omission in original). A conclusion is not contrary to federal law if no Supreme Court precedent is on point. <em>Washington v. Crosby, </em>324 F.3d 1263, 1265 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The state trial court summarily denied Williams\u2019s motion for post-conviction relief, in which Williams first raised her double jeopardy claim. The court\u2019s ruling was summarily affirmed by the District Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In her \u00a7 2254 proceeding, the district court found that Williams, who had pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement in cases 99-41128 and 00-20802 in August 2000, appeared in court on August 3, 2001 because she violated the plea agreement by committing the new offenses charged in case number 00-40836. At that time, Williams entered into a \u201cwraparound deal\u201d to include \u201ceverything\u201d from her three cases, and she reaffirmed that a violation of the agreement would result in a 20-year prison sentence. The court entered judgment in case numbers 99-41128 and 00-20802 that day, and entered sentences for time served in both cases. Williams next appeared in court on March 15, 2002, after being charged with additional offenses in case number 01-39515.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The district court found that the March 15, 2002 proceeding, in which Williams was sentenced on cases 99-41128, 00-20802, 00-40836 and 01-39515 to a total of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, was not a resentencing, but was occasioned by her violation of the August 2000 plea agreement. The district court found that the August 3, 2001 entry of sentences for time served in case numbers 99-41128 and 00-20802 \u201cwas tantamount to a clerical error.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded that no double jeopardy violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">On appeal, Williams argues that the trial court\u2019s action in vacating her original sentences of 224 days time served in cases 99-41128 and 00-20802, and resentencing her to a term of imprisonment, constituted a double jeopardy violation. She contends that, because she had finished serving her original sentence, she had a legitimate expectation of finality in her sentence, and that any resentencing would constitute a double jeopardy violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">The district court\u2019s finding that the entry of sentences for time served in case numbers 99-41128 and 00-20802 \u201cwas tantamount to a clerical error\u201d was not clearly erroneous. At the August 3, 2001 hearing, the record reflects that the parties had reached a \u201cwraparound deal\u201d that \u201chopefully will include everything\u201d and that Williams understood that she would receive 20 years\u2019 imprisonment if she did not fulfill her obligations. There was no discussion about a sentence being imposed in cases 99-41128 and 00-20802. Although a written judgment was entered for 224 days time served, the sentence was not \u201cpronounced in open court,\u201d as required by Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.700(b). Florida District Courts of Appeal have recognized that a sentence that was not pronounced in open court is invalid. <em>Adams v. State, </em>780 So.2d 955, 959 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2001) (\u201cWhere no oral sentence was pronounced, a written sentence is invalid.\u201d); <em>Sprankle v. State, </em>677 So.2d 307, 308 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>see also Armstead v. State, </em>612 So.2d 623, 624-25 (Fla.Dis.Ct.App.1993) (\u201cSince the record is clear that sentence was not pronounced on May 5,1992, it is reasonable to conclude that the written judgment and sentence of that date was inadvertent, and should be treated as clerical error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We next consider whether the state courts\u2019 rejection of Williams\u2019s double jeopardy challenge was contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. One of the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause is protection against multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 129, 101 S.Ct. 426, 433, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980). However, in this case, the decisions were not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. <em>Cf id. </em>at 137-39, 101 S.Ct. at 437-38; <em>Pollard v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 354, 355-56, 359-60, 77 S.Ct. 481, 482-83, 485, 1 L.Ed.2d 393 (1957). <em>Bozza v. United States, </em>330 U.S. 160, 165-67, 67 S.Ct. 645, 648-49, 91 L.Ed. 818 (1947); <em>In re Bradley, </em>318 U.S. 50, 51-52, 63 S.Ct. 470, 470-71, 87 L.Ed. 608 (1943); <em>Ex parte Lange, </em>85 U.S. 163, 174-76, 21 L.Ed. 872, 18 Wall. 163 (1873); <em>see also Jones v. Thomas, </em>491 U.S. 376, 383-84, 386-87, 109 S.Ct. 2522, 2526-28, 105 L.Ed.2d 322 (1989) (recognizing that <em>Lange </em>\u201cstands for the uncontested proposition that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits punishment in excess of that authorized by the legislature\u201d and declining to apply <em>Bradley </em>beyond its facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Williams claims a legitimate expectation of finality in her August 3, 2001 sentences. The state courts could discern the proposition from <em>DiFrancesco </em>that \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause respects the defendant\u2019s \u2018legitimate expectations\u2019 as to the length of [her] sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>722 F.2d 632, 637 (11th Cir.1983). Applying this principle to the facts of this case in order to reach the conclusion that Williams did not have such an expectation was not unreasonable. The entry of the August 3, 2001 sentences was tantamount to a clerical error. The sentences were not pronounced in open court. Instead, at the August 3, 2001 hearing, Williams\u2019s statement reflected an understanding that her failure to comply with her obligations would result in 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. The March 15, 2002 hearing further supports a finding that Williams\u2019s expectation was of a 20-year sentence in cases 99-41128 and 00-20802.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In light of the foregoing, we discern no clear err in the district court\u2019s finding that the August 3, 2001 entry of sentences for time served in cases 99-41128 and 00-20802 was tantamount to a clerical error. We further hold that the denial of Williams\u2019s double jeopardy claim by .the state courts was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
