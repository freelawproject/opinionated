Hayes asserts that the district court\u2019s upward deviation from the advisory sentencing range of 24 to 30 months was not proper or reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-17\">The record reflects that the district court calculated the applicable guidelines range, used that range as a frame of reference, and decided to upwardly deviate from that range. The district court addressed the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and cited fact specific reasons for the imposition of Hayes\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 527 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s consideration of victim impact was not in error. <em>See United States v. Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d 243, 250 (5th Cir.), <em>opinion modified, </em>479 F.3d 904 (2006). Because the district court did not fail to account for a factor which should have received significant weight, give significant weight to an improper factor, or make a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors, Hayes\u2019s sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-09 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-22\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
