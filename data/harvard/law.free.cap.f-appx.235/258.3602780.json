Both challenges were raised in district court. Its interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Fierro-Reyna, </em>466 F.3d 324, 326 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>First, Tejeda-Fuentes contends the district court erroneously imposed a 16-level enhancement pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) by mischaracterizing his prior Texas Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) assault conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d. In the light of <em>United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 880-82 (5th Cir.2006) (holding force is not an element of a \u00a7 22.01 offense because bodily injury may be achieved without use of force), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1351, 167 L.Ed.2d 144 (2007), which was issued after sentencing in this case, the enhancement was erroneous. Because the Government has not shown the error did not affect the district court\u2019s sentencing, the error was not harmless. <em>See United States v. LopezUrbina, </em>434 F.3d 750, 765 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1024, 126 S.Ct. 672, 163 L.Ed.2d 541 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Second, Tejeda-Fuentes claims \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony convictions as sentencing factors is unconstitutional in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Tejada-Fuentes concedes this challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Tejada-Fuentes\u2019 conviction; VACATE his sentence; and REMAND this matter to district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
