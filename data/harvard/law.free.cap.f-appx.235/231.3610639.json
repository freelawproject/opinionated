Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). The appellant\u2019s brief must contain an argument, which in turn must contain his \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d and \u201cfor each issue, a concise statement of the applicable standard of review[.]\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). General arguments giving only broad standards of review and not citing to specific errors are insufficient to preserve issues for appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Rice has not briefed adequately any of his arguments on appeal. Rice\u2019s appeal is without merit, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. ' R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
