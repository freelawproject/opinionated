On appeal, Pauley argues that the district court misunderstood the scope of its discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-15\">Prior to announcing Pauley\u2019s sentence, the district court made the following statements on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-16\">I do not have the authority to show mercy and impose any sentence that I want. I have to meet a very rigid and very inflexible standard in order to impose any sentence other than a sentence that is within the Sentencing Guidelines ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-17\">Now, if you were to interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Booker, </em>the remedial opinion ... then certainly a sentence less than 210 months would certainly be justified in this case as reasonable. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-18\">[But] I do not believe under the standard set by the Fourth Circuit that a sentence below this could be justified as reasonable. That is to say, I want to make clear on the record so you have it for appeal or any other purpose that I feel constrained by the guidelines. I feel very little difference exists between the advisory guidelines, so-called advisory guidelines as interpreted by our circuit and other circuits and the mandatory guidelines that were in effect prior to the decision in <em>Booker. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-19\">I have to make it clear ... that the guidelines control. They\u2019re still there. They\u2019re no different than they were before.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-20\">(J.A. at 79-81.)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-21\">After reviewing this record, it is obvious the district court misunderstood our precedents and its role in sentencing. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>therefore agree that the district court sentenced Pauley while operating under the erroneous belief that its discretion to sentence Pauley outside the guideline range was \u201calmost nonexistent.\u201d Under our <em>post-Booker' </em>cases, a district court may impose a sentence below the guidelines range if, after assessing the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3558(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), it believes such a sentence is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to achieve the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Although we do not accord district courts a free hand with respect to departures and variances, <em>see United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006), we also do not foreclose a sentence outside the properly calculated guidelines range if accompanied by an explanation that makes the final sentence a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Because the record indicates that the district court misunderstood our precedent, we vacate its judgment and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-10\"> Nothing in this opinion should be read to suggest that we have formed any view regarding the appropriate outcome of Pauley\u2019s re-sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
