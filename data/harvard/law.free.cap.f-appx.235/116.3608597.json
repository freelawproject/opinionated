The record reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>that, upon Nagy\u2019s motion, the district court conducted a hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(h) (2000). At the hearing, Dr. Corcoran testified that Nagy still suffered from delusional disorder, prosecutory type, and that Nagy was not taking antipsychotic medication because of side effects and Nagy\u2019s refusal to take such medication. Dr. Corcoran testified that Nagy\u2019s release in the United States was not advisable because his release would create a substantial risk of danger to others or to others\u2019 property. Following the hearing, the district court issued an order stating that Nagy continues to suffer from a mental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of others. Accordingly, the court ordered Nagy\u2019s continued commitment to the custody of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Based on our review of the record, the district court did not clearly err in its determination. We accordingly affirm the decision of the district court. We deny the motion to expedite and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court.and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
