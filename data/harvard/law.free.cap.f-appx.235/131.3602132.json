The district court sentenced Richardson to concurrent terms of twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment for Counts One, Two and Five and a consecutive term of sixty months on Count Three, the statutory minimum for that offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Richardson\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggesting that the district court erred in sentencing Richardson. Richardson was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-22\">This court reviews the imposition of a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 260-61, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). After <em>Booker, </em>a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. However, in imposing a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable Guidelines range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">First, the district court correctly calculated Richardson\u2019s advisory guideline range. Although Richardson questions whether one of the criminal history points was correctly assessed, even without this disputed point, Richardson would have remained in criminal history category III.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Moreover, the district court explicitly treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Richardson only after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and counsel\u2019s arguments. Although the district court did not recite facts to support each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, the court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. Richardson\u2019s eighty-four month sentence is presumptively reasonable, as it is within the appropriate guideline range, and below the statutory maximum sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> As neither Richardson nor the record suggests any information to rebut the presumption, we find that Richardson\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\"> Counts One, Two and Five carried statutory maximum terms of five and ten years\u2019 imprisonment, respectively.
