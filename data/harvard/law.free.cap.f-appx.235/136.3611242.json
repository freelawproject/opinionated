We have reviewed the record pertaining to the denial of Goraia\u2019s motion and find no abuse of discretion. <em>See Lendo v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 439, -, 2007 WL 1982038, *1 (4th Cir.2007) (setting forth standard of review). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Goraia, </em>A79-745-803 (B.I.A. Dec. 11, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
