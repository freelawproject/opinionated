He appeals his 360-month prison sentence, arguing that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence after finding that Valladares was a leader of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Valladares\u2019s sentence was reentered by the district court in the course of a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). He argues that the court should have conducted a formal resentencing hearing at that time. We have recently held that, in circumstances such as those present here, a formal resentencing is not necessary when the district court merely corrects a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Hadden, </em>475 F.3d 652, 667-69 (4th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the only issue before us is the district court\u2019s application of the role enhancement at Valladares\u2019s original sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">A district court\u2019s determination of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.2002). A four-level adjustment for role in the offense is appropriate when \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.1(a). We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s findings, and the briefs of the parties on appeal, and we conclude that the district court\u2019s application of the role enhancement was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Valladares\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
