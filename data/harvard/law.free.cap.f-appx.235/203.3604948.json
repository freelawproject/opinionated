Awad seeks review of the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denying his claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and denial of a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Because Awad did not file a separate petition for review of the BIA\u2019s July 25, 2005, order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief, and because he identified no factual or legal errors in the IJ\u2019s order in his motion to reopen, his claims regarding withholding of removal and CAT relief are not properly before the court. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Accordingly, we address only Awad\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. We decline the Government\u2019s invitation to decide whether an alien has a due process right to counsel in removal proceedings. <em>See Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, as amended by the REAL ID Act. <em>See id. </em>at 165. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 600 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Awad has failed to meet the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires that Awad establish both deficient performance and resulting prejudice. <em>In re Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 638 (BIA) (1988). With respect to Awad\u2019s contention that his counsel failed to put on evidence that Awad was either a United States citizen or national, the BIA correctly determined that Awad had failed to establish that he had completed the naturalization process. There was no evidence that the application had been approved, and Awad admitted that he had not taken a public oath of. citizenship, a prerequisite to naturalization. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448; <em>see also Okafor v. Gonzales, </em>456 F.3d 531, 533-34 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, counsel\u2019s failure to put on evidence of citizenship or nationality was neither deficient nor prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Awad\u2019s contentions regarding counsel\u2019s failure to request a private hearing, failure to object that the IJ did not consider a letter from Amnesty International, and withdrawal from representation during his appeal likewise fail. Awad offers nothing more than conclusory assertions that counsel\u2019s actions or omissions prejudiced him in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">For the foregoing reasons, Awad\u2019s petition for review is denied. His motion for production of his citizenship files is denied as this court is not the appropriate forum for such a motion. Awad\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; MOTION FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS DENIED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b238-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
