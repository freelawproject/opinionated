Kelley moves for permission to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP) from the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim. After pleading nolo contendere to charges of disorderly conduct and paying a fine, Kelley filed a complaint alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1986; the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242; the Americans With Disabilities Act; and various Mississippi statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The court held that Kelley\u2019s claims concerning his allegedly wrongful arrest and prosecution were barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and further held that, accepting as true all factual allegations in the complaint, Kelley was not entitled to relief as to any of his claims. The district court denied Kelley permission to appeal IFP because the court determined that the appeal was not taken in good faith. The court did not address Kelley\u2019s financial status.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-20\">We conclude that Kelley is financially eligible to appeal IFP; however, we concur with the district court\u2019s determination that Kelley cannot raise any nonfrivolous issues on appeal. Kelley wishes to argue on appeal that <em>Heck </em>does not bar his claims because he was only fined and not imprisoned. This contention is frivolous. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. The remainder of Kelley\u2019s arguments are unrelated to the district court\u2019s determination that his complaint failed to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-21\">Accordingly, Kelley has failed to establish a nonfrivolous ground for appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3). The motion to proceed IFP motion is denied. As the appeal contains no nonfrivolous issues, it is dismissed. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-22\">MOTION FOR IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
