Papaj argues that he established that he would face persecution if he returned to Albania because of a blood feud against the Papaj family instigated by the Mulia family. The record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s determination that Papaj had not established that he suffered past persecution, or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution, on account of his membership in a social group. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). There is no evidence in the record showing that the government sanctioned any persecution against the Papaj family or Papaj personally. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 n. 2 (5th Cir.1997). The BIA\u2019s determination that Papaj is not entitled to asylum is supported by substantial evidence and will not be disturbed. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). As Papaj cannot satisfy the standard for asylum, he cannot meet the more demanding standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Papaj\u2019s CAT claim is likewise unavailing, as he has failed to show that he will likely be tortured under government acquiescence if he is returned to Albania. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 907 (5th Cir.2002). Papaj\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has \u25a0 determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
