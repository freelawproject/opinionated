Femi claims reopening was warranted because he received insufficient instructions and notice by the immigration judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-20\">Our review of the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is extremely deferential, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor these motions. <em>Barry v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 741, 744-45 (4th Cir.2006), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1147, 166 L.Ed.2d 997 (2007). This Court will reverse the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen only if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-23\">We find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s affirmation of the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Femi\u2019s motion to reopen based on his defective application. We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
