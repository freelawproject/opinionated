The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the petition because Hammitt was neither incarcerated when his \u00a7 2241 petition was considered nor incarcerated at the time that he filed the petition. The district court held in the alternative that even if Hammitt were considered to be in custody, he had failed to raise any meritorious claims in his petition. Upon review of the record, we find that while the district court possessed jurisdiction over Hammitt\u2019s petition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hammitt\u2019s claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">A federal prisoner seeking to challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence must proceed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) in the district of conviction, while \u00a7 2241 petitions are generally reserved for challenges to the execution of a prisoner\u2019s sentence. <em>In re Vial, </em>115 F.3d 1192, 1194 n. 5 (4th Cir.1997). However, in limited circumstances, \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of the detention. In those cases, a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition in the district of his confinement to challenge his conviction. <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2000). In <em>Jones, </em>this court concluded that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, and \u00a7 2241 may be used:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">to test the legality of a conviction when: (1) at the time of conviction, settled law of this circuit or the Supreme Court established the legality of the conviction; (2) subsequent to the prisoner\u2019s direct appeal and first \u00a7 2255 motion, the substantive law changed such that the conduct of which the prisoner was convicted is deemed not to be criminal; and (3) the prisoner cannot satisfy the gatekeeping provisions of \u00a7 2255 because the new rule is not one of constitutional law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-12\"><em>Jones, </em>226 F.3d at 333-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">Hammitt\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenged the legality of his conviction, not the execution of his sentence; therefore, Ham-mitt\u2019s claims should have been presented in a motion under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Vial, </em>115 F.3d at 1194 n. 5. Additionally, Hammitt\u2019s petition failed to demonstrate that \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See Jones, </em>226 F.3d at 333. Therefore, Hammitt has failed to establish any proper grounds for relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>terials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\">. Hammitt\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition was originally filed with this court; however, we declined to exercise our authority to entertain the petition and transferred it back to the district court for consideration pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 22(a). <em>In re Hammitt, </em>No. 06-7877 (4th Cir. Jan. 22, 2007) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. A petitioner is not required to be subject to imprisonment to be regarded as in custody; rather, the relevant query is whether the petitioner\u2019s status subjects him to a restraint on his liberty, or the imminent threat of such a restraint. <em>See Jones v. Cunningham, </em>371 U.S. 236, 242, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963). For the purposes of relief under the federal habeas corpus statutes, probation constitutes custody, as a probationer is subject to restraints not shared by the public generally. <em>See Olson v. Hart, </em>965 F.2d 940, 943-44 (10th Cir.1992); <em>Tinder v. Paula, </em>725 F.2d 801, 803 (1st Cir.1984); <em>Hahn v. Burke, </em>430 F.2d 100, 102 (7th Cir.1970). In October 2006, Ham-mitt was sentenced to probation for a term of one year, with six months' home detention. Hammitt\u2019s status as a probationer at the time he filed his petition was sufficient to meet the \"in custody\u201d requirement for proceeding under \u00a7 2241(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
