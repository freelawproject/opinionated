Wilson, </em>316 F.3d 506 (4th Cir.2003), that case was later abrogated by the Supreme Court in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006) (holding that only a controlled substance violation that is punishable as a felony under the federal Controlled Substances Act can constitute an aggravated felony and finding that it is not enough that the crime is punishable as a felony under state law).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Because it appears that Torres-Segoviano was improperly classified as an aggravated felon,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we grant the petition for review and remand to the Board for further proceedings in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Lopez. </em>We dispense \u25a0with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\n<em>PETITION GRANTED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-27\">. We find that we have jurisdiction to consider this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005). <em>See Mbea v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 276, 278 n. 1 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-17\">.
