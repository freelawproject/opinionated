Ramirez-Juarez argues that the sentence imposed by the district court should not be afforded a presumption of reasonableness merely because it is within the properly calculated guidelines range. Ramirez-Juarez\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-27\">Ramirez-Juarez further contends that even if a presumption of reasonableness applies to his sentence, the presumption is overcome and the sentence is unreasonable when, as in his case, the district court \u201cis presented with nonfrivolous grounds for a below-Guidelines sentence that the court simply passed over in silence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-28\">The district court heard the arguments that Ramirez-Juarez had only one prior offense several years earlier and that he had reentered the United States for family reasons. The judge commented that, although Ramirez-Juarez had only one prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>offense, it was a serious offense. Based on that serious history, the court stated that a sentence within the guideline range \u201cwould be reasonable.\u201d Under <em>Rita, </em>the district court\u2019s statement of reasons was sufficient. 127 S.Ct. at 2469.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Ramirez-Juarez also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ramirez-Juarez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almen-. darez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ramirez-Juarez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
