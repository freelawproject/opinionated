The Government has moved for summary affirmance. (The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>tension of time to file its brief is DENIED as unnecessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Flores maintains his 210-month Guidelines sentence violates <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and is unreasonable. The presumption of reasonableness afforded a sentence within a properly calculated advisory Guidelines range is consistent with <em>Booker. See Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The record reflects the district court considered Flores\u2019 claims, the presentence investigation report\u2019s recommendations, the applicable Guidelines range, and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because the district court exercised its discretion to impose a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, the sentence is presumptively reasonable, and we may infer that the district court considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462-70; <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1056, 126 S.Ct. 718, 163 L.Ed.2d 615 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\n<em>SUMMARY AFFIRMANCE GRANTED; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
