He argues that the district court erred in determining that his 1991 New York conviction for attempted burglary was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). This argument, however, was inadequately briefed and is therefore waived. <em>See United States v. Valles, </em>484 F.3d 745, 758 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Torres also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). His constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Torres contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006); <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624 (5th Cir.2007). Torres properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
