Hicks argues that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective during sentencing. The Government argues that the claim should await collateral review or, alternatively, that it is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">This court generally will not consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal except in those \u201crare cases where the record allowed [this court] to evaluate fairly the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir.1987). We conclude that this is not one of those cases. Without prejudice to Hicks\u2019 right to file a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b304-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
