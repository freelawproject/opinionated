He was sentenced to 293 months of imprisonment, the top of his Sentencing Guidelines range of 235-293 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">On appeal, we affirmed Hinson\u2019s convictions, but vacated and remanded for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Cardwell, </em>433 F.3d 378, 391-93 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1061, 126 S.Ct. 1669, 164 L.Ed.2d 408 (2006). On remand, the district court heard arguments regarding the factors listed in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), understood that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory only, determined that the recommendations in the original presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) were correct, and again sentenced Hinson to 293 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">Hinson timely appeals, alleging that the district court erroneously calculated his offense level at resentencing. We review a district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and its legal conclusions, including its interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines, de novo. <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006). We find no reversible error in the calculation of Hinson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">We review a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence to determine whether the sentence is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). In a <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing, a court must calculate the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range and then consider whether that range serves the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and, if not, select a sentence that does serve those factors. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). A sentence within a properly-calculated advisory Sentencing Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-44 (4th Cir.2006). A defendant can only rebut the presumption of reasonableness by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>75 U.S.L.W. 3707 (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439). We find the district court\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable and Hinson has failed to rebut the presumption of correctness. The Supreme Court has recently held that such an appellate presumption is permitted. <em>Rita v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number><em>United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-67, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Hinson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
