The district court sentenced her to 235 months of imprisonment. Martin appeals her sentence on the ground that the district court erred in determining the amount of drugs attributable to her. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Martin asserts on appeal, as she did in the district court, that she should be held accountable only for twenty percent of the amount of crack cocaine sold to Anthony Brown over a four-year period at her mobile home because Brown dealt with her boyfriend, Brendon Steele (an indicted co-conspirator) the other eighty percent of the time. We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court did not clearly err in attributing more than 1.5 kilograms of crack to Martin. <em>See United States v. Fullilove, </em>388 F.3d 104, 106 (4th Cir.2004) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
