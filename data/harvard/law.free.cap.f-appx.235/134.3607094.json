Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Traore fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Having failed to qualify for asylum, Traore cannot meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999); <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Finally, we uphold the finding that Traore failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Cote d\u2019Ivoire. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
