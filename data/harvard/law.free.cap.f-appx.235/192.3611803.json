With respect to the \u00a7 924(c) conviction, the district court found Kale intentionally fired the firearm at the pursuing officer which makes him eligible for a mandatory minimum ten year sentence. On appeal, Kale argues the court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. Finding no error, we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>272 F.3d 260, 263 (4th Cir.2001). In order to disturb a court\u2019s factual findings, this court must be \u201cleft with definite and firm conviction that mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. May, </em>359 F.3d 683, 688 (4th Cir.2004). A court may properly make factual findings concerning sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 121, 166 L.Ed.2d 91 (2006). We find the district court did not clearly err in its factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b227-11\"><em> </em>Kale also argues that the district court erred finding that in order for the ten year statutory mandatory minimum sentence to apply under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii), the firearm\u2019s discharge did not have to be intentional on Kale\u2019s part. Because we find there was sufficient evidence of intent, we decline to reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
