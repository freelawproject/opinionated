Roche contends that the magistrate judge abused her discretion by denying his Rule 60(b) motion, insisting that he had exhausted the remedies that were available to him. Alternatively, he asserts that the exhaustion requirement should have been excused, because prison officials prevented him from filing timely grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-24\">Roche\u2019s appeal from the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion does not bring up the underlying judgment for review. <em>In re Ta Chi Navigation (Panama) Corp. S.A., </em>728 F.2d 699, 703 (5th Cir.1984). We review the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of Roche\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>See Warfield v. Byron, </em>436 F.3d 551, 555 (5th Cir.2006). Roche\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion did not indicate the statutory basis <em>for </em>reconsideration, and did he raise any new issues in the motion. Roche has not demonstrated that the magistrate judge abused her discretion by denying his Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Matter of Colley, </em>814 F.2d 1008, 1010-11 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
