The district court sentenced Simmons to an aggregate of 147 months\u2019 imprisonment, four years of supervised release on each count to run concurrently, and ordered payment of a $200 statutory assessment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Simmons\u2019 counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court complied with the requirements of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Simmons\u2019 plea, and whether the plea was knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Simmons was given an opportunity to file a <em>pro se </em>brief, but has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-21\">Simmons did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, therefore his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the Rule 11 hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>ing and find no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Simmons\u2019 guilty plea. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991). Moreover, Simmons is bound by the statements he made at the Rule 11 hearing, <em>see Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977), and we find no evidence that Simmons\u2019 plea was not knowing or voluntary. <em>See United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Simmons\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-17\">. The probation officer calculated an advisory sentencing guideline range for Simmons of 87 to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count 1, founded on a total offense level of 27 and a criminal history category of III, and a minimum consecutive sentence of 60 months' imprisonment on Count 3. After careful consideration of the facts and evidence, the district court made all the factual findings appropriate for that determination, and considered the advisory sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), prior to imposing sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1011-22\">. The plea agreement contained a provision in which Simmons agreed to waive his right to contest his conviction and sentence either on appeal or in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion, except for certain claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct not asserted or evident here, the Government has not asserted the waiver provision review of Simmons\u2019 conviction or sentence on appeal, decline to enforce the appellate waiver. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Brock, </em>211 F.3d 88, 90 n. 1 (4th Cir.2000)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
