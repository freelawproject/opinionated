Striss and Ragsdale filed separate civil complaints against the USPS, alleging they were the victims of gender and race discrimination and retaliation for protected conduct because they were denied certain details and positions. The USPS filed motions for summary judgment that stated its alleged reasons for denying Striss and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Ragsdale the details and permanent positions. A magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation recommending the district court grant the motions for summary judgment. Striss and Ragsdale noted their objections to the report, and the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and granted summary judgment to the USPS in each case. Striss and Ragsdale timely appealed and also have filed motions for jury trial. We deny the motions for jury trial and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment may only be granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">A plaintiff pursuing a claim under Title VII may either offer direct evidence of discrimination or, using indirect evidence, he may rely on the burden shifting framework that was adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>standard, the plaintiff bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case. <em>See Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). When a plaintiff makes a showing sufficient to support a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for the employment action. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. If the employer produces a legitimate reason for the action, the burden once again shifts to the plaintiff to show that the employer\u2019s rationale is a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817. We conclude the district court properly granted summary judgment to the USPS in Ragsdale\u2019s and Striss\u2019s actions because each failed to present a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the USPS\u2019s reasons for its employment actions were pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">We therefore deny the motions for jury trial and affirm the district court\u2019s judgments. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
