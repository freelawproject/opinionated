In No. 06-1915, Nkuo challenges the Board\u2019s order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Because the Board affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s order without opinion, we treat the immigration judge\u2019s reasoning as that of the Board\u2019s in our review. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2007); <em>Haoua v. Gonzales, </em>472 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-20\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Nkuo fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-21\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Nkuo\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3) [ (2000) ].\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Nkuo fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-22\">Nkuo challenges the immigration judge\u2019s denial of his claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We hold that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Nkuo failed to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To secure such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007). We find that Nkuo failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Finally, in No. 06-2262, Nkuo petitions for review of a decision of the Board denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Nkuo\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2007); <em>Barry v. Gonzales, 445 </em>F.3d 741, 744 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1147, 166 L.Ed.2d 997 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review for the reasons stated by the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
