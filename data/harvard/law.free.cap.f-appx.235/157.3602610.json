The plea agreement, however, included a waiver of Green\u2019s right to appeal the calculation of his advisory guideline range. We have reviewed the record and conclude that Green\u2019s argument falls within the scope of the waiver, and therefore dismiss this portion of his appeal. <em>See United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168-69 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-25\">Next, Green argues that the Government breached the plea agreement by not fully advising the court of the extent of Green\u2019s cooperation, and by arguing for a brandishing enhancement on the basis that Green personally brandished a firearm. Because Green did not raise this objection at sentencing, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (discussing standard). We find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the Government did relate to the court the nature of Green\u2019s cooperation, and that the plea agreement did not bar the Government from presenting evidence of Green\u2019s conduct. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in not finding that the Government breached the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">For these reasons, we affirm Green\u2019s convictions and dismiss the challenge to his sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
