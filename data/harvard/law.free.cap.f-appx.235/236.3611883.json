Nunez argues that the district court erred by enhancing his offense level four points for his being a leader or organizer under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. He also contends that the district court erred by failing to articulate reasons for the imposition of his sentence and that the court violated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8 by using statements Nunez made to a probation officer to determine Nunez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-24\">According to the presentence report and the factual basis, Nunez purchased a large amount of marijuana and recruited a driver to transport the marijuana to Miami. Following his arrest, Nunez instructed other individuals to take responsibility for the offense and offered money to these individuals if they complied. Based on these facts, we find that the district court did not clearly err in imposing the enhancement for Nunez\u2019s role as a leader in the offense. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-25\">Nunez\u2019s argument that the district court should have articulated reasons for the imposition of his sentence is without merit. Because the district court imposed a sentence within the properly calculated guidelines range, the court was not required to provide an explicit statements of its rationale under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-26\">The district court did not violate U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8 by using self-incriminating statements made by Nunez to determine his sentence. Nunez\u2019s plea agreement did not contain a cooperation provision. Therefore, \u00a7 1B1.8 is inappli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>cable. Regardless, the information provided to the probation officer by Nunez was only part of the information used by the court to determine Nunez\u2019s sentence. The district court\u2019s consideration of Nunez\u2019s statements does not constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b270-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
