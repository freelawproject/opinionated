The judge' below denied appellant waiting time, and no evidence was introduced with regard to the effects of appellant, and judgment was rendered in his favor for $15.04, fines assessed against him which had not been properly logged and were therefore not deductible from his pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Under the decision of the Supreme Court in Collie v. Fergusson et al., 281 U. S. 52, 50 S. Ct. 189, 74 L, Ed. 696, and of this court in the Lake Gaither, 40 F.(2d) 31; The Velma L. Hamlin, 40 F.(2d) 852, and The Corapeak, 46 F.(2d) 262, decided January 13, 1931, the rule is\u2019 well established that, in order to permit the recovery of waiting time by a seaman, refusal to pay his wages must not have -been \u201cin some reasonable degree morally justified.\u201d An examination of the record here shows no arbitrary or unjust action on the part of the master, but on the contrary, shows that he acted in a reasonable manner throughout. If there was any conduct that could not be justified, it is the conduct of the appellant himself and not that of the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The decree of the court below will accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
