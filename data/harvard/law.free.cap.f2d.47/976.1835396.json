A passenger vehicle provided with means for independently holding a plurality of passengers on the same seat thereof, comprising wholly independent flexible connections separately secured in position on the vehicle which are respectively, adapted to be fastened to or around passengers occupying the same seat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">\u201c4. A passenger vehicle having a passenger holding device comprising flexible holders arranged on the vehicle to^ be disposed in general horizontal position around the passengers\u2019 waist to retain the passenger on a seat of the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">The references cited are: Spencer, 942,-679, December 7, 1909; Leveau, 331,926, August 11, 1903 (French); Tyler, 1,368,466, February 15, 1921; Albano, 1,230,642, June 19, 1917; De Camp, 944,020, December 21, 1909; Prescott, 139,329, May 27, 1873; Knell, 91,453, June 15, 1869.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">Of these references, Leveau and Spencer were cited by the Examiner, and the additional references were cited by the Board of Appeals. Appellant did not ask the Board for reconsideration in view of the additional references cited by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">In discussing patentability of the claims here involved, the Board stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-15\">\u201cClaim 1 reads directly on Leveau unless it be held that his devices do not independently hold a plurality of passengers because the holding devices are secured to a common cross strap a b. In our opinion the claim is properly anticipated as there is a fastening device for each passenger and each of these is independently secured to the seat back. We also call attention to the patent to Scott, No. 855,139, May 28, 1907, in which there are independent fastening devices 4 for each passenger, see specification page 1, lines 54-70, which clearly meets this claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-17\">\u201cWhat we have said as to claim 1 applies also to claims 2 and 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-18\">\u201cClaim 6 specifies in addition that the flexible holding devices are adjustable but this is true of Leveau.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-19\">\u201cClaims 4 and 5 are slightly more specific in specifying that the holders are disposed in general horizontal position around the passenger\u2019s waist. The horizontal strap a b of Leveau extends across the machine in front of the passengers but not around their waists. There is nothing novel in such a construction, however, as shown in the patents to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-20\">\u201cTyler, 1,368,466, Feb. 15, 1921;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-21\">\u201cAlbano, 1,230,642, June 19, 1917;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-22\">\u201cDe Camp, 944,020, Dee. 21,1909;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-23\">\u201cPrescott, 139,329, May 27, 1873 and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-24\">\u201cKnell, 91,453, Juno 15, 1869.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-25\">\u201cThere would bo no invention in view of Scott, in using as many of those holding devices as desired on a single vehicle seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-26\">\u201cWe find nothing patentable in the claims over the references cited by the Examiner hut further rejection is given on the additional references cited under Rule 139.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-27\">We have carefully examined the references and concur in the conclusion of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-28\">Upon oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel earnestly contended that the court should find that the claims which, by their terms, contain the elem'ent of means for independently holding a plurality of passengers on the same seat, are patentable, even though the other claims be held to be unpatentable. We do not think there would be invention in multiplying the number of devices upon the same seat, as set out in claims 1, 2, and 3, for the reason that such use of the devices would bo clearly obvious and therefore does not constitute invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-29\">No useful purpose would be served by entering upon a detailed discussion of the applicability of the references to the claims here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-30\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-31\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
