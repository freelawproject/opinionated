The sole issue was that of his parentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-24\">The applicant is 33 years old, and arrived at the port of New York June 28, 1928. At the hearing before the Board of Special Inquiry, he, his alleged father, and an identifying witness, Soy Sing, testified. He failed to establish his right to enter to the satisfaction of the Board, and its decision denying him admission was- affirmed on appeal. The denial was based largely on disregarding the testimony of the alleged father as not worthy of belief because it was in conflict with some of the testimony he had given at Seattle the year before when his right to reenter this country from China was in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-26\"> As is apparently the custom in these hearings, the testimony took a wide range, and went into rather minute details concerning the Village from which the applicant came, the number of houses, rows of houses, location of the house in which he lived, number and location of rooms, windows, and doors, as well as the number; names, description, and relationship of occupants. This no doubt gave the examiners some basis for forming a judgment as to the truth or falsity of the testimony directly bearing on the ultimate fact in issue, for, by a comparison of the testimony given on subjects which each would be likely to know about if the claimed relationship was a fact, some indication could be obtained by the examiners as to the credibility of the witnesses. We are confined to a review which will determine whether or not the applicant has been accorded a fair hearing, United States ex rel. Fong Lung Sing v. Day (C. C. A.) 37 F. (2d) 36; yet this does not alone require that the applicant have an adequate opportunity to produce evidence in support of his claimed right to enter and to meet evidence to the contrary, but requires that all the evidence taken shall be fairly considered, weighed, and applied to decide the real issue rather than to put a premium on the ability to remember alike the inconsequential details of a Chinese village concerning which the examiners know nothing and have no means of knowing, in case of discrepancies, which witness was right and which was wrong. Of course, such discrepancies may have an important bearing on the credibility of witnesses and so weaken their testimony that the vital facts are left unproved and exclusion is warranted. Mason v. Tillinghast (C. C. A.) 27 F.(2d) 586. But we may pass over that part of this ease quickly, for the testimony of the witnesses at the hearing before the Board of Inquiry in New York was, as stated in the memorandum of the Board of Review, \u201cin practical agreement.\u201d The testimony of the identifying witness, Soy Sing, was of little consequence, for ho was born in California and first met the father of the applicant in Canton, China, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>witness was on a visit there in 1922, and testified that at that time the father introduced the witness to his two sons, one of whom was the relator-, in a fruit store in Canton.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Low Gui Tai, the alleged father, had been ' examined in Seattle in October, 1927, by a Board of Special Inquiry, when he was seeking readmission as an American citizen on his return from China.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">At New York he testified that he was bom in San Francisco June 23, 1875-, and, when it was called to his attention that he testified in Seattle that he was born June 4, 1874, said the latter date was correct. .At New York he testified that during his last trip to China (he had gone there first as a small \u25a0 boy and returned to this country in 1900) ' he had no occupation, and, when told that he had testified in Seattle that he had conducted a fruit stand in China which had \u2022failed said that was so, and explained his \u2022 answer that he had no occupation by saying: \u201cOur custom is, when we fail in a business, we do not mention it.\u201d He testified that his brother Low Gui Hoy, returned to China in C.- R. 8. When told that in Seattle he said that his brother returned in C. R. 6 he testified : \u201cI forgot the exact year, about whether it is one or the other.\u201d In New York, he testified that he had been married just once, and that his only wife was Jung Shee, a little over 50 years old, with natural feet, a native of Kar Heung Village; that he married her December 7, 1894; that they had three sons, of whom the applicant, Sheung Loy, is the oldest; and that he was at home when all three of his sons were bom.

A. I married her when I was 20 years old and had three sons before I came to this country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">\u201cQ. Did you ever have any other wife than Jung Shee? A. Yes, Jung Shee died and I married again. I was in this country when she died. It was a few years before I returned to China in R \u2014 5. She had bubonic plague.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201cQ. What family did you have by Jung Shee? A. Three sons, no daughters. Low Shung Low, 30 years old, bom 10th month and 10th day.

That is myself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">Although this witness testified at Seattle on his return from China in 1927 that none of his three sons were married and attributed that fact to financial trouble, he answered, when asked at New York in 1928 the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-17\">\u201cHow was this house occupied when you were last in China in 1927 (meaning the house his family occupied) ?

Yes, that is all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-37\">Of course all this does show without a doubt that Low Gui Tai did not tell the truth when he testified in Seattle that he had been married twice and described both of his wives;or, at New York when he testified that he had been married but once. Likewise he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>testified falsely at one place or the other when he said in Seattle, when on his way back from China where he must have learned the fact, that none of \"his sons were married and in New York that all were. At both hearings, however, he testified that he was the father of the applicant, and none of the contradictory evidence he gave directly indicates the contrary; yet it does indicate his general untruthfulness, his willingness to testify falsely, and leaves his credibility so impaired that to hold the Board of Inquiry unfair in failing to rely upon it would be an unwarranted invasion of the right of the examiners to be exclusive judges of the credibility of the witnesses who testify before them, and, having reasonable grounds for their conclusion, to decide that this witness was unworthy of belief. This left the testimony of the applicant virtually unsupported, and it is impossible to say that the Board was unfair in- holding it to be less than enough. See Ex Parte Jew You On (D. C.) 16 F.(2d) 153.- It should be remembered that this appeal is not a trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
