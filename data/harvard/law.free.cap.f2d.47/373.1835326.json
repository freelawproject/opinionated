that it had continuously used said trade-mark on its goods since long prior to the first use by appellee of the trade-mark \u201cSilkenese\u201d; that it had expended large sums of money in advertising its trade-mark throughout the United States; that it has maintained the highest standards in the manufacture of its goods; that it has built up and is maintaining a large and valuable business throughout the United States in the manufacture and sale of its goods under the trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d; that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties ; and that the mark \u201cSilkenese\u201d sought to be registered by appellee is confusingly similar to appellant\u2019s trade-mark \u201cCelanese.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-26\">Appellant pleaded ownership of the following trade-mark registrations: No. 178,-422, January 8, 1924, of the trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d for use en \u201cthreads made wholly or principally from cellulose derivatives\u201d; No. 179,796, February 39, 3924, for the trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d for use on \u201cfabrics made wholly or principally from cellulose derivatives\u201d; No. 186,516, July 22, 1924, for the trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d for use on \u201cLadies\u2019 knitted underwear \u2014 namely, knickers, and vests\u201d; No. 191,844, November 18, 3924, for the trade-mark \u201cGelnnese\u201d in combination with the word \u201cbrand\u201d for use on \u201cWomen\u2019s and children\u2019s outerwear \u2014 namely, dresses, sweaters, jumpers, suits, gowns, and coats\u201d; No. 207,622, January 5, 1926, for the trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d for use on \u201cmen\u2019s half hose\u201d; No. 225,285, March 15, 1927, for the trade-mark \u201cCelanese-locknit\u201d for use on \u201cknitted, netted, and textile fabrics made wholly or partially of cellulose derivatives\u201d; No. 226,304, April 5, 1927, o\u00a3 the trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d for use on \u201cpy-jamas, negligee shirts, undershirts of knitted fabric and textile fabric, collars, neckties, scarfs, mufflers, fabric gloves, cut-out linings for men\u2019s and women\u2019s coats and suits; men\u2019s underwear of knitted fabric and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>textile fabric; women\u2019s and children\u2019s hosiery\u201d; No. 229,356, June 28, 1927, for the trade-mark \u201cCelanese ninon\u201d for nse on \u201cwoven, knitted, netted, and textile fabrics, in the piece, made wholly or partially of cellulose derivatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">In its answer, appellee denied the material allegations contained in the notice of opposition and alleged that the opposer, appellant, was neither the originator nor the first to use a trade-mark which contained the \u201cprefix the syllable or the letters \u2018Cela\u2019 \u201d or the \u201csuffix, syllable, or letters \u2018nese\u2019 \u201d in a trade-mark for use on goods possessing the same descriptive properties as those upon which appellant used the trade-mark \u201cCela-nese.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Testimony was submitted by each of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">It appears from the evidence submitted by appellee that it has been engaged in the manufacture and sale of garments and piece goods composed of silk for many years prior to March, 1927, and that its goods were sold under the trade-marks \u201cVanity Fair\u201d and \u201cVanitysilk\u201d; that in March, 1927, ap-pellee added to its line of silk goods certain articles and fabrics composed of \u201cJapan silk and Bemberg synthetic yam,\u201d on which it decided to use the trade-mark \u201cSilkenese\u201d; that it expended approximately $15,000 in advertising its so-called artificial silk goods and the trade-mark \u201cSilkenese.\u201d It also appears that appellant\u2019s celanese yam was known to appellee as an artificial silk product. The witnesses for appellee admitted that the trade-mark \u201cSilkenese\u201d was never used on appellee\u2019s piece goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">It appears from the evidence offered by appellant that it expended from $200,000 to $300,000 in advertising its trade-mark \u201cCela-nese\u201d and its so-called celanese products; that it used its trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d on yarns, piece goods, and on the various garments referred to in registrations Nos. 186;-516, issued July 22, 1924, 191,844, issued November 18, 1924, and 207,622 issued January 5, 1926, long prior to the use by appellee of its mark \u201cSilkenese\u201d on its products. Appellant also introduced considerable testimony tending to establish that confusion already existed in the trade as to the goods bearing the marks \u201cSilkenese\u201d and \u201cCela-nese.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The Examiner of Interferences held that the goods of the respective parties possessed the same descriptive properties; that appellant had used its trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d long prior to the use by appellee of its trademark \u201cSilkenese\u201d; that the trade-mark \u201cSilk-enese\u201d so closely simulated the trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d as to be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public and, accordingly, sustained the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The Commissioner of Patents held that appellant had used its trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d on yam, piece goods, and garments long prior to the nse by appellee of the trade-mark \u201cSilk-enese\u201d; that appellant had a very extensive business; and that its trademark was a valuable asset. He then said:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">\u201cSince the goods are deemed to possess the same descriptive properties and since it is regarded as established that the opposer was first in the field with its mark upon its goods, the decision in this ease turns upon the question of similarity of the marks. * * * The only similarity to the applicant\u2019s mark resides in the suffix \u2018nese\u2019 or \u2018ese.\u2019 This suffix has a definite meaning in our language when used in connection with certain words as signifying of or pertaining to. In the words Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, etc., this suffix indicates the people of such countries or goods or customs of the respective countries. The word \u2018silken\u2019 of the applicant\u2019s mark is an ordinary descriptive word indicating a quality or the nature of the fabric or the goods. There is nothing similar in appearance, significance, or meaning between \u2018celan\u2019 and \u2018silken\u2019 and there is only a remote similarity in sound. The similarity between the two notations is regarded as residing substantially entirely in the suffix \u2018nese\u2019 or \u2018ese.\u2019 If the opposer were the first to adopt upon goods of this character a notation ending in these letters, its claim for the broad protec: tion it seeks might be more favorably considered. The applicant has, however, established that trade marks having these same letters as suffixes have been used and are still used upon goods of this same general character from a date long prior to the earliest date opposer entered the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">\u201cRegistration No. 135,857, issued Oct. 19, 1920, is for the notation \u201cPominese\u201d used upon woolen goods in the piece. Trade mark No. 174,132, registered Oct. 2,1923, is for the notation \u2018Bernese Swiss\u2019 used upon cotton goods in the piece. There is testimony of Charles Twining that this-last named mark is still in use. There is also testimony showing the mark \u2018Pominese\u2019 has been used in the trade. The testimony of H. L. Hoff and H. B. Snader is to the effect that the notation or trade name \u2018Milanese\u2019 has been quite widely used in connection with silk fabrics. In view of these established facts as to prior adoption and nse of marks upon this class of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u25a0goods, which marks have the same suffix which constitutes the only similar portion of the two marks here under review, <em>it is deemed the opposer is not entitled to such a breadth \u2022of protection as would preclude others from using any mark or notation however dissimilar from opposer\u2019s which has the same suffix.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Accordingly, the Commissioner of Patents reversed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, dismissed the opposition of appellant, and adjudged the applicant, appel-lee, entitled to the registration of its trademark \u201cSilkeneso.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">It is claimed by appellant that the goods of the respective parties possess the same descriptive properties; that the marks are confusingly similar; and that appellant will be damaged by the registration of appellee\u2019s mark \u201cSilkeneso.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Counsel for appellee, on the contrary, contends that the marks aro not confusingly similar; that appellant has never used the mark \u201cCelanese\u201d on garments in commerce, although it has registered its mark \u201cCelanese\u201d for use on such articles; and that, in view of the prior registrations of trademarks ending in \u201cneso,\u201d appellant is not the originator of a mark ending with those letters, and, therefore, is not entitled to broad protection in the use of its mark \u201cCelanese.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">It is not contended here that appellee was the first to adopt and use a trade-mark ending in the letters \u201cneso.\u201d It may be that appellant was not entitled to the registration of its mark \u201cCelanese.\u201d However, that question is not before us and will not be considered by this court in this proceeding.

A. 906; National Biscuit Company v. Joseph W. Sheridan, 44 F. (2d) 987, 18 C. C. P. A. -; Decker <em>&amp; </em>Cohn, Inc., v. S. Liebovitz Sons, Inc., 46 F.(2d) 179, 18 C. C. P. A.-.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">From a careful examination of the record we are Satisfied that the tribunals below were right in holding that appellant has used its trade-mark \u201cCelanese\u201d on yarn, fabrics, and garments since long prior to any use by appellee of its mark \u201cSilkeneso\u201d; and that the goods of the respective parties possess the same descriptive properties. It appears from the record that, prior to the year 1927, appellee had been engaged in the manufacture of piece goods and garments composed of silk; that it used the trade-marks \u201cVanity Fair\u201d and \u201cVanitysilk\u201d on those products; that it was not until March, 1927, that ap-pellee commenced the manufacture of so-called artificial silk products; and that, when it did so, it decided to advertise and sell them under the trade-mark \u201cSilkenese.\u201d At, and prior to, that time, appellant\u2019s products and its mark \u201cCelanese\u201d had been-extensively advertised and were generally known throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">The goods of the respective parties are sold in the same stores and to the same class of people. Furthermore, they are so nearly alike in appearance and texture that, if sold under similar trade-marks, confusion would likely result. Nevertheless, appellee selected a trade-mark closely simulating the trademark of appellant. It is true that the marks are not identical and that they differ to some extent both in sound and in appearance. However, the public should not be required to analyze trade-marks with scrupulous care, nor should it be compelled to resort to a study of etymology in order to avoid confusion and mistake.

A. 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">We are of opinion that the marks are confusingly similar, and that appellee is not entitled to have its mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
