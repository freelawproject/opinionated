He held, however, that, as appellee had not used the trade-mark \u201cSilkenese\u201d on the goods described in its application, it was-not entitled to have the mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-17\">It is claimed by appellant that, the commissioner erred in dismissing the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-18\"> Although we do not mean, to be understood as holding that, in all eases of this character, the opposition should be sustained, nevertheless, in view of the fact that this proceeding was consolidated in the Patent Office with the ease of the Celanese Corporation of America v. Vanity Fair Silk Mills (Cust. &amp; Pat. App.) 47 F.(2d) 373, involving the same parties, the same trade-marks, and goods of the same descriptive properties, and as the parties presented such evidence as-they desired relative to the issues raised by the notice of opposition and the answer thereto, including the similarity of their goods and' the involved trade-marks, we are of opinion that the parties were entitled to a decision on the merits of' the ease. Accordingly, on the-authority of our decision in the case of Celanese Corporation of America v. Vanity Fair Silk Mills, 47 F.(2d) 373, 18 C. C. P. A.-, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is modified, being affirmed in so far as it holds that appellee is not entitled to have its. trade-mark registered, and in all other respects reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-21\">Modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
