In fact, after stating that she \u201chas not sufficient funds to bear the expense of employment of skilled counsel\u201d\u2014a situation which naturally enlists our great sympathy\u2014appellant says that \u201cthis brief must therefore make its appeal more in the nature of a human document than by an exposition of legal talent.\u201d We cannot aid appellant, sympathize with her unfortunate situation as deeply as we may. <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> A judgment of a trial court must stand as a finality unless it be made to appear, by the party prosecuting an appeal from it, that some error has occurred in the proceedings leading to its rendition.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">Finlayson, P.
