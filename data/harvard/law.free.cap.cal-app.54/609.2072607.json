The appellant makes three points.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> 1. That the evidence is insufficient .to sustain a verdict of guilty in this, that the money embezzled belonged to the complaining witness and another person, while the charge is laid in the information that it belonged to the complaining witness alone. This witness testified that he gave the money to the appellant out of his own pocket. This, if believed by the jury, was sufficient. The evidence shows that the money in question was intrusted to the appellant to pay the wages of the laborers working under him and that, instead of executing his trust, he appropriated the money to his own use and absconded. He went from Stockton to Los Angeles and later to San Jose, at which place he was arrested by a policeman. The claim or statement in appellant\u2019s brief that he surrendered himself to the policeman is evidently a mistake. He ivas arrested while in the act of selling a kit of carpenter\u2019s tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> 2. The appellant stated to the district attorney that he had admitted to a party in Los Angeles the commission of a wrong of some sort in the northern portion of the state. The appellant objected to the testimony of the district attorney to this effect upon the ground that there was no evidence showing that this admission related to the present case. But it might have related to this case, and it was the province of the jury, in the light of all the facts and circumstances in evidence, to determine whether or not it so related. It is a common practice for courts to admit in evidence statements, acts, or material objects, such as weapons, in the absence of direct and positive evidence connecting them with the case on trial. There was no error in the ruling complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> 3. After a question as to whether or not the appellant was in an automobile when arrested, the district attorney asked this question: \u201cIs it not a fact that, when the policeman approached you, you told them you were going right to Stockton to straighten up about that car?\u201d The appellant objected to the question and assigned the act of the district attorney in propounding it as prejudicial misconduct ; and in that connection his attorney stated in court: \u201cThat car belonged to the defendant, who paid $700 for it.\u201d The court promptly sustained the objection and charged the jury that the matter should not have the slightest weight with them. This action of the court cured whatever error may have been committed. We are not disposed to commend the act of the district attorney in asking the question, but it is difficult to see how any injury to appellant could have resulted therefrom. Moreover, the evidence of the guilt of the appellant is so conclusive that the jury could not have failed to find him guilty, even though the alleged error had not been committed. We are satisfied that no miscarriage of justice arose by reason thereof. Section 4% of article VI of the constitution was enacted to meet cases of this class.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The order denying the motion of appellant for a new trial and the judgment are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Finch, P. J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
