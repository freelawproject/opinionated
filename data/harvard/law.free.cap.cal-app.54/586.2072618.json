J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFMf\">This appeal is from an order denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike out the memorandum of costs of certain defendants and taxing said costs at the sum of $82.65. At the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case the court granted a nonsuit g,s to those defendants and judgment was entered in their favor for their costs. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Appellants contend that a defendant is not entitled to recover his costs on the granting of his motion for a nonsuit. Section 581 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides : \u201cAn action may be dismissed, or a judgment of nonsuit entered ... by the court, upon motion of the defendant, when upon the trial the plaintiff fails to prove a sufficient case for the jury. \u2019 \u2019 Section 1024 provides: \u2018 \u2018 Costs must be allowed of\" course to the defendant upon a judgment in his favor in the actions mentioned in section ten hundred and twenty-two, and in special proceedings.\u201d Under these provisions of the code the defendants were clearly entitled to costs. In <em>Spinks </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>26 Cal. App. 793 [148 Pac. 798], it is held that when a plaintiff dismisses the action pursuant to section 581 of the Code of Civil Procedure the defendant is entitled to recover costs. No reason appears why a different rule should govern where a nonsuit is granted on motion of the defendant under the same section of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Respondents admit that the court, through inadvertence, allowed the defendants an item of costs in the sum of $2.50 to which they were not entitled and consent that their costs be reduced accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The order appealed from is modified by reducing the amount taxed as costs to the extent of $2.50, and, as so modified, the order is affirmed, the respondents to recover costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Burnett, J., and Prewett, J., <em>pro </em>tem., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
