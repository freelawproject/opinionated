The complaint alleges that the defendant refused to include in his estimate the work upon which the action is based. The answer denies that the plaintiff was entitled to have such work so included and this appeal is founded on the same contention. Under such circumstances a demand would have been futile and this court would not be justified in holding that there has been a miscarriage of justice because of failure to make a futile demand. <em>(Moreing </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>28 Cal.

It is not claimed that such work was unnecessary in the preparation of a proper subgrade on which to lay the concrete. Proposition \u201cB\u201d provides for the payment of a lump sum for the construction of the \u201cconcrete road <em>not including the grading.\u201d </em>The implication necessarily follows that compensation is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>received for the grading. Proposition \u201cC\u201d provides the measure of such compensation, sixty cents per cubic yard for \u201call excavation of <em>every </em>description without classification including all incidental work.\u201d No language could be clearer. It does not appear why excavations below the sub grade are any more incidental to the grading than those above.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is next argued that since the specifications provide specially for payment to the contractor at the agreed price per yard for excavating ditches \u201cthe idea that payment was to be made for any of the other incidentals mentioned under the heading of \u2018grading\u2019 \u201d is thereby excluded under \u201cthe rule <em>expressio u-nius est exclusio alterkis.\u201d </em>The specifications, however, do not purport to fix the compensation to be received and the reference therein to payment for excavating ditches cannot reasonably be held to limit the express provision of the contract that payment shall be made for \u201call excavation of every description.\u201d It is more probable that the provision was inserted in the specifications to guard against any controversy as to whether the term \u201cexcavation\u201d included the construction of ditches.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> Article IX of the contract provides: \u201cShould it appear that the work hereby intended to be done, or any of the matters relative thereto, are not sufficiently detailed or explained in the said plans, drawings, profiles, cross-sections and specifications when taken together, the contractor shall apply to the Engineer for such further explanation as may be necessary, and shall conform to the same as part of this contract, so far as may be consistent with the original specifications; and in the event of any doubt or question arising respecting the true meaning of the said plans, drawings, profiles, cross-sections and specifications, and each and every difference respecting the same shall be finally determined by the said Engineer, and it is understood that no advantage will be taken by either party hereto of any discrepancy that may be found in any plan or specification.\u201d In the specifications it is provided: \u201cBidders are cautioned to examine carefully the plans and specifications and form of proposal. If in doubt as to their meaning, the bidder should apply to the County Engineer for explanation. If any questions arise as to the meaning or intent thereof after' the bids are opened, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>opinion of the County Engineer shall he final and binding. Forms of proposal will be furnished by the County Engineer or the County Clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Appellant urges that, under the foregoing provisions of the contract, the decision of the engineer that the contract does not provide for payment on account of excavations below the subgrade is conclusive. The contract, however, does not evince any intention to make the engineer an arbitrator as to the amount due thereunder or as to whether payment shall be made for any item of work done. His decision is made final on questions arising, during the progress of the work, as to what is required by the contract and in what manner it is to be done. This is necessarily so, because it would not be practicable to cease operations and resort to a lawsuit every time a difference of opinion might arise. But when the contractor has followed the decision of the engineer and performed the contract in accordance with that decision, then it becomes a question of law whether the former is entitled to compensation for any particular item of work done. \u201cWhere the architect or engineer, acting under an erroneous construction of the contract, without authority to construe that instrument excludes work which should have been included in his estimate or includes work which should have been excluded, the error will be corrected. . . . So. also the estimates or the classifications are not binding where the contract fixes certain classifications of work, and the architect or engineer ignores such provisions in the contract.\u201d (9 C. J. 827; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Chicago etc. Ry. Co., </em>49 Fed. 708; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Chicago etc. Ry. Co., </em>112 Mo. 463 [34 Am. St. Rep. 403, 20 S. W. 631].) \u201cThe jurisdiction of the engineer relates to disputes arising in the performance of the work which might prevent the work from progressing unless determined on the spot. . . . The clause cannot be interpreted so as to deprive the parties of their rights to a judicial construction of the contract, so far as such construction involves matters of law relating to the present right of the plaintiff to maintain suit, and relating to the question whether the plaintiff has received such compensation as he was legally entitled to under the provisions of the contract.\u201d <em>(Gammino </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Town of Dedham, </em>164 Fed. 593 [90 C. C. A. 465], \u2018See, also, <em>Mercantile Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Hensey, </em>205 U. S. 298 [10 Ann. Cas. 572, 51 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>L.

Upon the completion of the work, the county surveyor must examine the same, and if completed in accordance with the specifications thereof, he must submit to the board of supervisors a certificate over his signature and official seal to the effect that such work by the contractor therefor, has been completed in accordance with the specifications therefor, and recommending its acceptance. The board shall thereupon audit the same and direct its payment out of the proper fund or funds.\u201d <bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> On the engineer\u2019s failure to include in his estimate work for which the contractor is entitled to compensation, <em>mandamus </em>is the proper remedy. <em>(Conn </em>v. <em>Board of Comrs., </em>151 Ind. 517 [51 N.
