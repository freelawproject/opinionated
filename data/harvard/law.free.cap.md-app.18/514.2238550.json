Wade, </em>U. S. 93 S. Ct. 705, and <em>Doe v. Bolton, </em>U. S. 93 S. Ct. 739,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> each decided 22 January 1973, and which, according to <em>Roe, </em>at 733, are to be read together. Whether our holdings govern the disposition of the case before us depends upon how <em>Roe </em>and <em>Doe </em>are to be applied to criminal prosecutions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">(3) the dictates of <em>Roe </em>and <em>Doe </em>are fully retroactive with respect to Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 139 (a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Therefore our holding that the provision of \u00a7 139 (a), designating certain acts as crimes if done other than in a hospital accredited and licensed by the State Board of Health and Mental Hygiene is unconstitutional on its face, applies to and is dispositive of the case here reviewed. The result is that we affirm the order of the Circuit Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Prince George\u2019s County passed 12 April 1973 concerning ERMO P. INGEL.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The order of 12 April 1973 was issued in a post conviction proceeding initiated by Ingel. On 16 December 1971 he came on for trial in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County in Criminal Appeals No. 14,786 under a warrant charging he had violated the abortion laws, Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 139. A ' verdict of guilty was rendered upon his plea of guilty,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and on 31 January 1972, according to the docket entries, he was sentenced \u201cto the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction for a period of 1 year. Sentence to incarceration is suspended and the Defendant is placed on probation under the Department of Parole and Probation for an indeterminate period of time.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On 25 January 1973 Ingel moved to vacate the judgment. The court below refused to consider the motion because the relief prayed was properly to be sought under post conviction procedures. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 645 A. Ingel filed a petition for post conviction relief on 8 February. He alleged that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional in the light of <em>Roe v. Wade, supra, </em>and Doe <em>v. Bolton, supra. </em>Upon hearing in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Couch, J., believed that the statute was unconstitutional and passed the order, which we now affirm, that the plea of guilty be stricken and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>that the sentence imposed be vacated and set aside. The State applied for leave to appeal. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 645-1; Maryland Rules BK45 c and BK46. We granted the application and ordered the case to be transferred to the regular appeal docket under procedures in conformity with Chapter 1000 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure. Rule BK47. Two questions were presented: (1) whether Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 139 was unconstitutional under <em>Roe </em>and <em>Doe </em>and (2) whether Roe and .Doe have retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">We give the reasons for our holdings regarding Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 139.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">\n<em>The Requirement as to a Licensed Physician</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The opinion of the Court in Roe held: \u201cThe State may define the term \u2018physician\u2019, ... to mean only a physician currently licensed by the State, and may proscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician as so defined.\u201d 93 S. Ct. at 732-733. This conclusion was arrived at upon consideration of constitutional rights. Thus, the \u201clicensed physician\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provision of the Maryland statute is constitutionally permissible. If other than a licensed physician performs the acts set out in Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 139 (a), he has committed a misdemeanor and upon conviction is subject to the punishment authorized by \u00a7 139 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>The Requirement as to a Hospital Accredited by the Joint Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals and Licensed by the State Board of Health and Mental Hygiene</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\"><em>Doe </em>dealt with procedural requirements contained in the Georgia Criminal Code, \u00a7\u00a7 26-1201 through 26-1203, formulated by Georgia Laws, 1968 Session, 1249, 1277-1280. That statute required, among other conditions, as does the Maryland statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that, for an abortion to be authorized or performed as a non-criminal procedure, it take place in a hospital licensed by the State Board of Health and also accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. \u00a7 26-1202 (b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\"><em>Doe </em>held flatly that the JCAH accreditation requirement \u201c. .. does not withstand constitutional scrutiny in the present context. It is a requirement that simply is not \u2018based on differences that are reasonably related to the purposes of the Act in which it is found.\u2019 Morey v. Doud, 354 U. S. 457, 465, 77 S. Ct. 1344, 1350, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1485 (1957).\u201d This holding is dispositive with respect to the JCAH accreditation requirement of the Maryland Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\"><em>Roe </em>held that a state criminal abortion statute that excepts from criminality only a <em>life saving </em>procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 93 S. Ct. at 732. It then established limits of regulation, idem:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">\u201c (a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman\u2019s attending physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">(c) For the stage subsequent to viability the State, in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life, may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\"><em>Doe </em>held that the requirement of the Georgia statute that an abortion must be performed in a hospital was invalid \u201cbecause it fails to exclude the first trimester of pregnancy. . . .\u201d 93 S. Ct. at 749. Because the Maryland criminal abortion statute contains a like requirement, it too is invalid for the same reason. We point out, however, that the Court in <em>Doe </em>explicitly expressed no opinion \u201con the medical judgment involved in any particular case, that is whether the patient\u2019s situation is such that an abortion should be performed in a hospital rather than in some other facility.\u2019\u2019Idem. It observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201cAppellants and various <em>amici </em>have presented us with a mass of data purporting to demonstrate that some facilities other than hospitals are entirely adequate to perform abortions if they possess these qualifications. The State, on the other hand, has not presented persuasive data to show that only hospitals meet its acknowledged interest in insuring the quality of the operation and the full protection of the patient. We feel compelled to agree with appellants that the State must show more than it has in order to prove that only the full resources of a licensed hospital, rather than those of some other appropriately licensed institution, satisfy these health interests.\u201d <em>Idem.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Because <em>Roe </em>and <em>Doe </em>were actions for declaratory and injunctive relief, the question of retroactivity was not before the Supreme Court. We are faced with the issue, however, in order to dispose of the case before us, and as we have indicated, we hold that the dictates of <em>Roe </em>and <em>Doe </em>are fully retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Broadly speaking, the Supreme Court has decided that some of its holdings are to be given fully retroactive effect, that others apply where the convictions have not become final, and that others are to be applied prospectively. It has viewed the retroactivity or nonretroactivity of such decisions as a function of three considerations. These were summarized in <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U. S. 293, 297:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u201cThe criteria guiding resolution of the question implicate (a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">It said in <em>Desist v. United States, </em>394 U. S. 244, 249: \u201cForemost among these factors is the purpose to be served by the new constitutional rule.\u201d When the purpose involved the reliability of the fact determining process of guilt or innocence, the Court accorded full retroactivity to the decision, without regard to the other two criteria.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>rationale of those decisions which accord full retroactivity to a holding clearly requires that a conviction based upon an unconstitutional statute not be permitted to stand no matter when obtained. A declaration that a statute prescribing conduct to be criminal is unconstitutional goes even beyond a question of the reliability of the fact determining process of guilt or innocence. The conduct unconstitutionally proscribed is not a crime; a conviction under it is not merely erroneous, it is illegal, and should not be the cause of punishment. <em>Ex Parte Siebold, </em>100 U. S. 371, 376-377. \u201cAn unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no rights; it imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office; it is, in legal contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed.\u201d <em>Norton v. County of Shelby, </em>118 U. S. 425, 442. We have no difficulty whatsoever in determining that a decision that a criminal statute is unconstitutional must be fully retroactive so that a judgment thereunder shall not stand. See <em>Greene v. State, </em>11 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Md. App. 106, 112. We so hold with respect to our decision regarding Code, Art. 43, \u00a7 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">As we have indicated, the immediate effect of our holdings is that the judgment against Ingel remains vacated. We deem it advisable, however, to discuss further the present status of the Maryland abortion statute, and particularly Art. 43, \u00a7 139 thereof. No person other than a licensed physician may perform an abortion and do the other acts set out in \u00a7 139 without incurring criminal responsibility. Without being criminally responsible, however, a licensed physician may perform an abortion, and do such other acts, without restraint as to reason, time, or place. The provisions of \u00a7 137 prescribing the conditions under which an abortion may and may not be performed, have no effect on \u00a7 139. Violations of the provisions of \u00a7 137 are not crimes and carry no criminal sanctions. As stated, <em>supra, </em>we express no opinion with regard to the constitutionality of \u00a7 137 because it is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Of course, the General Assembly may, if it chooses, enact legislation, within the dictates of <em>Roe </em>and <em>Doe, </em>regulating the performance of abortions and acts relating thereto, making violations of such regulations criminal offenses, and authorizing punishment upon conviction. But until such legislation is enacted and adopted, the criminal abortion law of this State must stand as tempered by the Supreme Court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\n<em>Order of 12 April 1973 of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirmed; costs to be paid by Prince George\u2019s County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Abp\">.

Two other sections are under the subtitle \u201cAbortion\u201d in Art. 43.

Subsection (c) provides for the keeping of records. Violation of \u00a7 137 is not designated a crime and no sanction is provided therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Section 138 gives protection from civil liability to persons and hospitals for refusing to perform, participate in, or submit to abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 137 and 138 is not before us, and we express no opinion thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\">.

It was held that abortion was a misdemeanor at common law, and that Art. 27, \u00a7 3 did not change the common law rule. <em>Worthington v. State, </em>92 Md. 222. Compare, however, <em>Roe v.
