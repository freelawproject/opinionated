He contends (1) the indictment should have been dismissed with prejudice because: (a) the State failed to bring him to trial within 180 days after his request for final disposition was \u201ccaused to be delivered\u201d to the Maryland authorities in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the requirements of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereafter referred to as IAD), (b) he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial; and (2) the evidence was legally insufficient to establish the market value of the stolen goods at $100 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The appellant was indicted by the Grand Jury for Cecil County on December 15, 1970, and arraigned on December 22, 1970. Soon thereafter he escaped from the Cecil County jail and was arrested in Delaware for criminal acts committed in that State. After his arrest the officials of Cecil County placed a detainer against him with the prison authorities in Delaware. While imprisoned awaiting trial, he wrote Judge H. Kenneth Mackey of the Circuit Court for Cecil County on February 16, 1971, requesting a speedy trial of the charges then pending against him in Maryland. Judge Mackey replied on February 18, 1971, and advised him to proceed under the IAD and that he could probably obtain the necessary forms to do so from the authorities at the Delaware institution where he was imprisoned. The State\u2019s Attorney for Cecil County was informed by the court of the contents of the correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">After the appellant was tried and sentenced on the Delaware charges, he executed the notice and request that is required by \u00a7 616D (a) of the IAD (form II). This form was dated July 13, 1971<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and addressed to the State\u2019s Attorney for Cecil County and to the Circuit Court for that County. The executed form identified the institution in Delaware where the appellant was imprisoned and requested that he be returned to Maryland and promptly tried on the charges here pending against him in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 616D (a). According to the understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>which he had with the Delaware authorities, they were to forward his executed form II, together with other necessary papers, to the Circuit Court and State\u2019s Attorney for Cecil County. The Delaware authorities failed to do so. On April 3, 1972 the appellant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment pending against him in Cecil County, claiming that the State of Maryland had failed to bring him to trial within 180 days from the date he executed and \u201ccaused to be delivered\u201d the notice and request on July 13, 1971, as required by \u00a7 616F (c) of the IAD. The time elapsing between July 13, 1971 and April 3,1972 was 264 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">At the preliminary hearing on the motion, the appellant testified that he had received a copy of a certified letter dated July 14, 1971, that appeared to have been sent by the Delaware authorities to the State\u2019s Attorney for Cecil County. He claimed the copy he received showed that form II executed by him and other papers executed by the Delaware authorities were enclosed with the letter. He did not produce his copy of the letter, however, and the copy that was proffered was not admitted in evidence because of a failure to establish its authenticity. The appellant further testified that he had a receipt signed by the secretary of the State\u2019s Attorney for the certified letter allegedly forwarded. No such receipt, however, was produced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The State\u2019s Attorney for Cecil County also testified at the hearing and categorically denied ever receiving any forms, notice, or request from the Delaware authorities or the appellant concerning disposition of the Maryland charges other than the appellant\u2019s letter to Judge Mackey in February 1971. He further denied any knowledge of the receipt by his secretary of a certified letter from the Delaware authorities. At the time of the hearing, the secretary was no longer employed by the State\u2019s Attorney and did not testify. A Deputy Clerk of the Circuit Court denied that office had ever received any notice or request from the appellant or the Delaware authorities in regard to the Maryland charges other than the letter to Judge Mackey.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">On June 5, 1972, the court denied the motion and on June 29-30,1972, the appellant was tried on the Maryland charges and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\n<em>MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE IAD</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Maryland adopted the IAD with supplemental provisions by Chapter 627 of the Acts of 1965 (Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 616A-R). At the time the appellant was imprisoned in Delaware, that State had also adopted the IAD. See 11 Del. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2540-2550 (1969). Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 616A-R provides in pertinent parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\n<em>Article III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">\u201c\u00a7 616D.

We think it clear from the language employed in \u00a7 616Q that the legislative intent in adopting it was to restrict and clarify the notice provision of \u00a7 616D (a). That is, to restrict this provision so that the 180 day period referred to therein should not begin to run until the prisoner\u2019s notice and request are <em>actually received </em>by the appropriate prosecuting officer and court in this State. Without such specification, the notice provision is unclear as to whether the 180 day period begins to run (1) when the prisoner delivers his notice and request to the warden of the institution where he is imprisoned in the party state, as required by \u00a7 616D (b), or (2) when the warden sends the notice and request to the prosecutor and the trial court in the State issuing the detainer, as also required by \u00a7 616D (b), or (3) when the notice and request are actually received by the prosecutor and the appropriate court in the State issuing the detainer. This supplemental section also prevents a prisoner from becoming entitled to a dismissal of charges against him in situations where the prosecutor and the trial court do not have actual notice of his request. A contrary result has been reached by the interpretations placed on the IAD in other jurisdictions that have not adopted supplemental provisions comparable to \u00a7 616Q.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The appellant\u2019s contention that his letter to Judge Mackey requesting a prompt trial constituted sufficient notice to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 616D (a) is without merit. At the date of this letter the appellant had not \u201centered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state\u201d, which is made a condition precedent to his eligibility to apply for the benefits of the IAD by the provisions of \u00a7 616D (a). As his letter of February 16, 1971 indicates, he was then confined in a Delaware prison \u201cawaiting trial.\u201d We therefore hold that the letter did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>constitute a notice and request as required by \u00a7 616D (a). See <em>State v. Long, </em>1 Md. App. 326, 333, 320 A. 2d 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">We conclude that the trial judge was not clearly in error in finding from the evidence that neither the prosecutor nor his secretary nor the Circuit Court actually received any notice or request from the appellant or the Delaware authorities that he be afforded a prompt trial in accordance with the requirements of the IAD. We further conclude that based on these findings, Judge Roney was not in error in denying the appellant\u2019s written motion to dismiss the indictment based on a failure to comply with the IAD.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\n<em>MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT BECAUSE OF DENIAL OF SPEEDY TRIAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The appellant also contends that he was'denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a basis for his motion to \u201cdismiss the indictment. At the beginning of the hearing, he made a verbal motion in open court to dismiss the indictment on this basis, in addition to his written motion to dismiss because of non compliance with the IAD. The trial judge ruled, however, that inasmuch as the appellant had not filed a previous written motion setting forth this contention, he would only hear the motion to dismiss in so far as it related to the IAD. Consequently, the issue involving the appellant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial was not decided by the trial court. Md. Rule 725 (c) allows a motion during a hearing to be made orally.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">While ordinarily this Court will not consider a question that was not decided below, it may do so where the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>was presented and a decision is deemed desirable to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal. Md. Rule 1085. Under the authority of this Rule, we deem a decision of the question of a denial of a speedy trial desirable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">In <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U. S. 514, 33 L.Ed.2d 101, 92 S. Ct. 2182 (1972), the United States Supreme Court recently enunciated the factors to be considered in determining the constitutional right of an accused to a speedy trial. The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Powell, said at 116-117:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">\u201c * * * The approach we accept is a balancing test, in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">A balancing test necessarily compels courts to approach speedy trial cases on an ad hoc basis. We can do little more than identify some of the factors which courts should assess in determining whether a particular defendant has been deprived of his right. Though some might express them in different ways, we identify four such factors: Length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\n<em>LENGTH OF DELAY NOT OF CONSTITUTIONAL DIMENSIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">In speaking of the \u201clength of delay\u201d factor, this Court said in <em>State v. Hunter, </em>16 Md. App. 306, 311, 295 A. 2d 779:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-10\">\u201c * * * [I]n order to calculate a constitutionally proscribed delay in bringing a matter to trial, we must look back to the date of the commencement of the prosecution by way of arrest, warrant, information or indictment, whichever shall first occur, and then forward to the date of trial or hearing. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">See also <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U. S. 307, 30 L.Ed.2d 468, 92 S. Ct. 455; <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>14 Md. App. 582, 287 A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>2d 791. In the case before us the greatest possible period of delay, assuming that the appellant was arrested the same day the crime was committed,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> would be from November 3, 1970 to the date of trial on June 29,1972, or nineteen months and twenty-six days. The evidence shows, however, that a relatively small portion of the delay included in this period can be attributed to the State of Maryland. .</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">This Court has repeatedly held that only the portion of the total delay period which is fairly attributable to this State is to be considered in determining the \u201clength of delay\u201d factor. See <em>State v. Dubose, </em>17 Md. App. 292, 295, 301 A. 2d 32; <em>State v. Lawless, </em>13 Md. App. 220, 230, 283 A. 2d 160; <em>Smith v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 631, 634, 276 A. 2d 228; <em>King v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 652, 667, 249 A. 2d 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The \u201ccertificate of inmate status\u201d (form III under the IAD), which was considered by the trial court at the hearing, showed that the appellant escaped from Cecil County on or about January 4, 1971 and was incarcerated in Delaware on January 6, 1971 for criminal acts committed in that State. The testimony adduced at the hearing showed that he remained incarcerated in Delaware from January 6, 1971 until he was returned to Cecil County sometime in May 1972 (the exact date was not shown) as a result of the filing of his motion on ' April 3, 1972 to dismiss the Cecil County indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">From our independent review of the record, we find that the portion of the delay period that was represented by the time the appellant was imprisoned in Delaware (16 months) was not caused by nor attributable to the State of Maryland. By the appellant\u2019s escape on or about January 4, 1971, he prevented this State from proceeding with the prosecution of the charges against him. Within two days thereafter he committed criminal acts in Delaware which resulted in his incarceration in that State and the ultimate imposition of a ten-year prison sentence. When he applied to the Circuit Court for Cecil County for a speedy trial of the charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>pending against him in that County in February 1971, he was promptly advised to proceed under the IAD. His failure to do so successfully was due to the neglect of the Delaware prison officials in forwarding his notice and request to the appropriate Cecil County officials, and was in no way due to any act of representatives of the State of Maryland. The Maryland prosecutor testified that when he failed to receive any notice of the appellant having initiated any proceeding under the IAD, in accordance with the suggestion of Judge Mackey, he assumed that the appellant had abandoned the idea. We think in the circumstances of this case that this assumption was a reasonable one. We therefore find that the 16 month period during which the appellant was incarcerated in Delaware was not chargeable to the State of Maryland. We also find, however, that this State was chargeable with the delay that occurred during the interval between the date of the appellant\u2019s arrest and his escape and the period between his return to Cecil County in May 1972 and the date of his trial, or for a period of approximately four months while he was physically present in Cecil County.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In <em>Barker, supra </em>at 117, the Supreme Court said: \u201cuntil there is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance.\u201d In <em>State v. Lawless, supra </em>at 231, this Court held that unless it appears that the time of the delay is \u201cbeyond that which is the obvious requirement of orderly procedure\u201d, there is no need to make further inquiry into the other pertinent factors. See also <em>Jones v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 420, 428, 270 A. 2d 827; <em>Brown v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 462, 466, 271 A. 2d 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Applying the above-enunciated principles to our independent findings of the facts heretofore related, we hold that the four months delay chargeable to Maryland is not \u201cpresumptively prejudicial\u201d nor \u201cbeyond that which is the obvious requirement of orderly procedure.\u201d We therefore conclude that the appellant has failed to show a delay chargeable to this State that was of constitutional dimensions. Consequently, there is no necessity to inquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>further into the other factors relevant to a determination of the right to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the delay attributable to this State was of constitutional dimensions, the appellant has nevertheless failed to show a deprivation of the right. That is, he has failed to show (1) a substantial \u201clength of delay\u201d, (2) any purposeful or oppressive acts by the State as the \u201creason for the delay\u201d, and (3) any prejudice to his person or to his defense. See <em>Barker, swpra </em>at 117-118; <em>Lawless, supra </em>at 243. Since by our holding in respect to the period of delay we have in effect said that it was \u201cnot substantial\u201d, the appellant has the burden of proof in regard to prejudice as well as the other factors. See <em>Lawless, supra </em>at 234-236; <em>Wilson v. State, 8 </em>Md. App. 299, 306, 259 A. 2d 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">We conclude therefore that the appellant has failed to establish that he was deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\n<em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The appellant\u2019s contention concerning the insufficiency of the evidence is confined to that offered to establish that the market value of the stolen tires was $100 or more at the time of the theft so as to constitute grand larceny under the statute (Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 340). The evidence on this point was confined to the testimony of Mr. Wilson, president and general manager of the corporation (Ford Agency) that owned the stolen tires. The State inquired of him \u201cas to what the value of these missing tires would be * * *.\u201d He replied, \u201cIn my opinion, it would be $164 at that time.\u201d There was no objection to this testimony and consequently its admissibility is not before us for review. Md. Rule 1085. We think it is implicit in Mr. Wilson\u2019s testimony as to the <em>value </em>of the tires that he was referring to <em>fair market value. </em>See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>Vucci v. State, </em>13 Md. App. 694, 701-702, 284 A. 2d 646; <em>Mason v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 61, 63, 262 A. 2d 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We therefore conclude that the evidence was legally sufficient to establish that the fair market value of the stolen tires was in excess of $100 at the time of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\n<em>MOTION TO CORRECT OMISSION IN RECORD</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s motion to correct an omission in the record filed pursuant to Md. Rule 1027. That part of the motion which relates to copies of the papers allegedly forwarded to the State\u2019s Attorney is granted for the reason that these copies were considered by the trial court. That portion of the motion is denied which relates to copies of the papers that were allegedly received by the Office of the Attorney General and a copy of the receipt of certified mail allegedly sent by the appellant to the State\u2019s Attorney. These last mentioned items were neither offered in evidence nor considered by the trial court and therefore do not constitute \u201comissions in the record\u201d within the scope of Rule 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">.
