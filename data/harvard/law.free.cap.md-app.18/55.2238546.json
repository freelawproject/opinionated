Each was sentenced to a term of eight years. In this appeal they contend that (1) their trial on the merits before the same judge who presided over their juvenile waiver hearing constituted a denial of due process, and (2) their judgments of convictions were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">Clement Anthony, an eighteen year old youth, testified that he arrived at the Backbone Mountain Forestry Camp, a detention center for young males, on May 19, 1972. According to Anthony, \u201cthat afternoon, I was asked to go to the gym to have \u2014 to give Robert Brumfield and McCarthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>a beat-off job and a blow job.\u201d When asked, \u201cwhat was your response to this?\u201d, he replied: \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t \u2014 at first, I didn\u2019t want to go over, but after \u2014 after about fifteen or twenty minutes, I did go over, and I was \u2014 was forced to do that.\u201d He stated that they showed him a card which indicated \u201c[t]hey could issue contracts for people to be killed.\u201d When asked what that meant to him, he replied: \u201cWell, that they could \u2014 that that would happen to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Upon arrival at the gym there were some nine boys gathered there and according to the victim, he was not only compelled to perform acts of masturbation and fellatio upon appellants McCarthy and Brumfield, but upon \u201call nine of them.\u201d Anthony explained: \u201cWell, they \u2014 they was acting like they was playing basketball, and one boy was watching \u2014 watching the door, and all \u2014 all along, they were taking turns. There was no way possible I could get out of the gym.\u201d He specifically exonerated the appellant Edmonds as a participant on this occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Anthony did not report this attack to the authorities because as \u201ca new boy at the camp\u201d, \u201cI was \u2014 I was scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The following week, according to Anthony, \u201cI was out by the back of the dorm, and a couple of the \u2014 couple of the boys came up and said give me a beat-off and up the \u2014 up the rectum, so \u2014 * * * And at that time, I did not give a beat-off job, but instead of a penis going up my rectum, the boys put a mop handle up my rectum.\u201d He could not identify the individual or individuals who wielded the mop handle.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">After this episode Anthony reported the attack to the authorities who initiated the investigation leading to these cases and Anthony was transferred to another detention center.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Derrick Moody, an inmate at the detention center, testified that on May 19, 1972, he and several other boys, including Anthony and Brumfield, were watching television when Brumfield \u201cgrabbed the boy by \u2014 by his neck and well, \u2014 told him to suck his privates, would he suck his privates for him that night.\u201d Moody did not accompany the boys to the gym. He continued to testify: \u201cThen \u2014 then the next time I saw something happen to Anthony was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Curley Edmonds, right over there, stuffed a mop handle up his rear.\u201d When asked: \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything to stop this?\u201d, he replied: \u201cNo, sir, \u2018cause there was a big crowd around there and everybody was jumping and laughing and hollering and everything, and then one of the counselors \u2014 they thought that Mr. Perry would come along and then everybody ran.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Jackie Wilmer, another inmate of the detention center, testified that he was not present at the first attack upon Anthony in the gym on May 19 but he was present the following week and observed the mop handle attack. \u201cThe only thing I seen was when he was on the side of the building * * * Somebody stuck a broomstick up his rectum.\u201d When asked who it was, he first replied: \u201cIt was Curley [Edmonds] there, I think.\u201d Later he was asked: \u201cAre you uncertain it was Curley?\u201d, he replied: \u201cIt was Curley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">While McCarthy and Brumfield did not testify, Edmonds took the stand and when asked: \u201cYou did not put a broom handle up Mr. Anthony\u2019s rectum?\u201d, he replied: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The appellants\u2019 first contention is not properly before us since no objection was interposed to the trial judge presiding at the trial below and he was not asked to disqualify himself on the ground that he had also presided at their waiver hearing. The issue simply was not preserved for review by this Court. Maryland Rule 1085. Moreover, the record of the waiver proceedings is not before us and we cannot speculate or presume that evidence produced at the waiver hearing in any way influenced the judgment of the presiding judge in reaching the guilty verdicts. See <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>260 Md. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">We can find no merit in the contention of McCarthy and Brumfield that the evidence was legally insufficient to sustain their convictions. The compelling testimony of the victim alone was amply sufficient to warrant a finding of their guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Nor are we persuaded that Edmonds could not be found guilty of an unnatural and perverted sex practice simply because the evidence showed that a broom stick or a mop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>handle rather than a sex organ was used to penetrate the victim\u2019s rectum. The statute under which Edmonds was convicted, Md. Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 554, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">\u201cEvery person who shall be convicted of taking into his or her mouth the sexual organ of any other person or animal, or who shall be convicted of placing his or her sexual organ in the mouth of any other person or animal, or who shall be convicted of committing any other unnatural or perverted sexual practice with any other person or animal, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or be imprisoned in jail or in the house of correction or in the penitentiary for a period not exceeding ten years, or shall be both fined and imprisoned within the limits above prescribed in the discretion of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The appellant Edmonds argues \u201cthat on the facts in this case, there was no conduct on his part, if the State\u2019s witnesses are believed, that amounted to a sex act.\u201d He contends that since there was no \u201cactual contact with sexual organs of either the victim or the Defendant\u201d, the act of inserting the mop or broom handle into the victim\u2019s rectum was not a proscribed act within the contemplation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">While appellant recognizes that in <em>Blake v. State, </em>210 Md. 459, the statute (then \u00a7 627) withstood attack upon its constitutionality as being vague and indefinite, he does not acknowledge that the Court of Appeals in <em>Blake </em>found \u201cin the language employed a clear legislative intention to cover the whole field of unnatural and perverted sexual practices.\u201d The Court of Appeals was unpersuaded that \u201cbecause the statute begins with a prohibition against \u2018oral\u2019 perversion, the words \u2018any other unnatural or perverted sexual practice\u2019 must be restricted accordingly, under the rule of <em>ejusdem generis.\u201d </em>It was pointed out that the \u201crule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>however, is merely a rule of construction, and cannot be invoked to restrict the meaning of words within narrower limits than the statute intends, so as to subvert its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>obvious purpose.\u201d The Court concluded: \u201cWe find in the language employed a clear legislative intention to cover the whole field of unnatural and perverted sexual practices. We think it was unnecessary to describe in detail practices which are matters of common knowledge. Moreover, the section provides that \u2018in any indictment for the commission of any of the acts, hereby declared to be offenses, it shall not be necessary to set forth the particular unnatural or perverted, sexual practice with the commission of which the defendant may be .charged, nor to set forth the particular manner in which said'unnatural or perverted sexual practice was committed, *\u25a0 * We quote this as an indication that the Legislature had in mind practices other than those in the oral category.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462-463.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">We cannot agree, as the appellant argues, that the anal passage may not be classified as a sexual organ within the meaning of the statute for it is well known that it has been the source of sexual gratification however perverted or distasteful such a method of gratification may be considered. In fact, the acts of sodomy or buggery specifically involve the penetration of the rectum. Had the appellant\u2019s penis been used to penetrate the victim\u2019s rectum, there would be no question that it would have amounted to an act of sodomy or buggery. That appellant elected to use a mop or broom handle certainly takes the act out of the category of sodomy or buggery. It does not, however, in the circumstances here, take the action outside the classification of an unnatural and perverted sex practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">It is true that there may be occasions when the act of penetrating a person\u2019s rectum with a broomstick or mop handle would be solely a cruel, torturous act with no sexual connotations or overtones. In the circumstances here, however, the whole atmosphere of the affair was that of an unnatural and perverted sex orgy. Boys were \u201claughing and hollering.\u201d Anthony had been forced to the side of the dorm for the announced purpose of buggery and as he put it: \u201c[Ijnstead of a penis going up my rectum, the boys put a mop handle up my rectum.\u201d We cannot find in light of the bizarre attitudes of those sadistically enjoying the Edmonds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>performance that the judge was clearly erroneous in finding that Edmonds was guilty of an unnatural and perverted sex act.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
