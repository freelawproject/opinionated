Ann. Code Art. 66A, \u00a7 19 (a) and to employ in its stead the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Act), in an effort to appeal from an order of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, (Ross, J.) which reversed a decision of the Board and required that a \u201cseal of approval\u201d be placed upon the film \u201cSin In 69.\u201d The State contends that this Court has jurisdiction over the appeal because of the provisions of Md. Ann. Code Art. 41, \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>256. We disagree, and dismiss the appeal for the reasons stated <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The Board was created by the Laws of 1916, Ch. 209, which then provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">\u201cSec. 19. If any elimination or disapproval of a film, reel or view is ordered by the Board, the person submitting such film, reel or view for examination will receive immediate notice of such elimination or disapproval, and if appealed from, such film, reel or view will be promptly re-examined, in the presence of such person, by two or more members of the Board, and the same, finally approved or disapproved promptly after such re-examination, with the right of appeal from the decision of the Board to the Baltimore City Court of Baltimore City.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The statute was silent as to any further right of appeal. In 1955,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Legislature repealed and re-enacted Md. Ann. Code Art. 66A, \u00a7 19 and added the following sentence thereto:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\">\u201cThere shall be a further right of appeal from the decision of the Baltimore City Court to the Court of Appeals of Maryland, subject generally to the time and manner provided for taking an appeal to the Court of Appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Thereafter the Act remained unchanged until the legislative session following <em>Freedman v. Md., </em>380 U. S. 51, 85 S. Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Freedman, </em>the Supreme Court declared that while the submission of a motion picture film to a censorship board is not <em>per se </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>unconstitutional, a prompt final judicial determination of obscenity must be assured. Because the Maryland Act failed to provide adequate safeguards against \u201cundue inhibition of protected expression,\u201d a judgment of conviction for violation of Art. 66A, \u00a7 2 \u2014 failure to submit film to the Board for the seal of approval \u2014 was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The Board argues that because it is an administrative agency, it, as a party aggrieved by the decision of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, may appeal, using as a vehicle the appellate provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. Md. Ann. Code Art. 41. The section of the Act concerned with appeals to the Court of Appeals is \u00a7 256. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\"><em>\u201cAn aggrieved party may secure a review of any final judgment of the circuit court or Baltimore City Court, as the case may be, under this subtitle by appeal to the Court of Appeals. </em>Such appeal shall be taken in the manner provided by law for appeals from law courts in other civil cases. This section shall not apply to cases arising under Article 66V2 of the Annotated Code of the Public General Laws of Maryland in which no right to appeal to the Court of Appeals is specifically provided.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">When the Administrative Procedure Act was adopted in 1957, Chs. 94 and 428, all State Boards, Commissions, and Departments, except the legislative and judicial branches, the Department of Parole and Probation, the State Industrial Accident Commission (now the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission), the State Insurance Department, the Public Service Commission, the Employment Security Board, and the State Tax Commission, were embraced within the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The State reads more into \u00a7 256 than we think the Legislature intended or enacted. The term \u201ccircuit court\u201d as used in \u00a7 256 is an obvious reference to the circuit courts of the several counties and does not include within its ambit as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>therein used the \u201cCircuit Court of Baltimore City,\u201d from where this appeal originates.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Ordinarily, an aggrieved party seeking initial judicial review of a decision of an administrative agency does so in accordance with the provisions of Md. Ann. Code Art. 41, \u00a7 255(b). That section mandates, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201cProceedings for review shall be instituted in the circuit court of the county or in the Baltimore City Court, as the case may be. . ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The quoted section does not confer jurisdiction upon the Circuit Court of Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">The Circuit Court of Baltimore City, an equity court, was created by Art. IV, \u00a7 27 of the Constitution of Maryland. Section 27 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">\u201cThere shall be in the Eighth Judicial Circuit [Baltimore City], six Courts, to be styled the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, the Superior Court of Baltimore City, the Court of Common Pleas, the Baltimore City Court, the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, and the Criminal Court of Baltimore.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Article IV, \u00a7 29 of the Constitution sets forth in unambiguous terms the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">\u201cThe Circuit Court of Baltimore City shall have exclusive jurisdiction in Equity within the limits of said city, and all such jurisdiction as the present Circuit Court of Baltimore City has; provided, the said Court shall not have jurisdiction in applications for the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in cases of persons charged with criminal offences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">Article IV, \u00a7 28 of the Constitution confers concurrent civil jurisdiction in all civil common law cases on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Superior Court of Baltimore City, the Court of Common Pleas, and the Baltimore City Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The method of appeal under the Act is limited, therefore, in the words of \u00a7 256, to \u201cthe manner provided by law for appeals from <em>law courts </em>in other civil cases.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied). Moreover, <em>the Administrative Procedure Act, at this time, authorizes appeals only to the Court of Appeals, not this Court.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">We conclude that the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act does not confer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals or this Court for cases arising out of Art. 66A.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In an obvious endeavor to correct the fault found by the Supreme Court in <em>Freedman, supra, </em>the Legislature, by the Laws of 1965, Ch. 598, repealed and re-enacted Art. 66A, \u00a7 19, so that the section read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">\u201c(a) Any film duly submitted to the Board for examination and licensing shall be reviewed and approved within five (5) days, unless the Board shall disapprove such film under the provisions of Section 6 hereof, in which event the Board shall, within not later than three (3) days thereafter, apply to the <em>Circuit Court for Baltimore City </em>for a judicial determination as to whether such film is obscene, or tends to debase or corrupt morals, or incite to crime, within the meaning of Section 6 hereof. Notice of such application shall be forthwith sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the person presenting such film for licensing. The <em>Circuit Court for Baltimore City </em>shall, within five (5) days after the filing of said application, conduct a hearing, and shall in connection therewith view such film; within two (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>days after such hearing said court shall enter its decree and order requiring that said film be approved and licensed or be disapproved if in violation of the provisions of said Section 6 hereof. If the decree and order disapproves said film as being in violation of the provisions of Section 6 hereof, then the person presenting such film for licensing may appeal such determination to the Court of Appeals of Maryland, in accordance with the Maryland Rules of Procedure, and said Court shall advance such case on its hearing calendar to the earliest practicable date; and, in reviewing the order appealed from, said Court shall view the subject film. The burden of proving that the film should not be approved and licensed shall rest on the Board.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">It is to be noted that for the first time the \u201cCircuit Court of Baltimore City\u201d appears in the statute and the \u201cBaltimore City Court\u201d is omitted. We must assume that the Legislature meant to eliminate the procedure for appeals from the Board, and in its place to confer upon the <em>Circuit Court for Baltimore City, </em>to the exclusion of all other courts of the State, the duty to make a judicial determination, whether or not requested by the person presenting the film, as to whether such film is obscene, or tends to debase or corrupt morals, or to incite to crime, whenever the Board has disapproved any film. It follows, therefore, that while the Legislature, by the enactment of Ch. 598, Laws of 1965, also codified as Art. 66A, \u00a7 19, did not explicitly exclude the Maryland State Motion Picture Censor Board from the ambit of the Administrative Procedure Act, it, by providing a special method of judicial review to the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, effectively did exclude the Board from the Act insofar as appeals from the Board\u2019s decisions are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">In the instant case, the Board is endeavoring to avoid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>pellucid provisions of Md. Ann. Code Art. 66A, \u00a7 19(a) which deny to the Board the right of appellate review from the trial court\u2019s decision. Section 19(a) provides in part that when a motion picture film that has been submitted to the Board for examination, and licensing is disapproved by the Board, the Board shall, not later than three days thereafter, \u201capply to the Circuit Court of Baltimore City for a judicial determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The significant language of Art. 66A, \u00a7 19 (a) is, for the case at bar, the provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201cIf the decree and order [of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City] disapproves said film as being in violation of the provisions of \u00a7 6 hereof,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> then the person presenting such film for licensing may appeal such determination to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland, in accordance with the Maryland Rules of Procedure.. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">It is apparent from a reading of the above quoted provision that before there be an appeal to this Court, two prerequisites must be satisfied: (1) the Circuit Court of Baltimore City must <em>disapprove </em>the film, and (2) <em>the person who presented the film </em>to the Board for licensing must appeal. In the present case the film was approved by the Circuit Court, and the \u201cperson presenting the film\u201d did not appeal. Neither of the two criteria for appeal has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">As the Maryland law now stands, the Board has no right to appeal from a decision of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, for that is the clear, definite and unambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>meaning of Md. Ann. Code Art. 66A, \u00a7 19(a). If the General Assembly did not mean what it said, it should say so. \u201cIf the General Assembly wishes to change the effect of the present language, it sits annually and may readily do this.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Even if we were to assume that the Board has a right of appeal to this Court, our independent constitutional reflective judgment is that the film is not hardcore pornography within the meaning of <em>Dillingham v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 669, 267 A. 2d 777 (1970); <em>Lancaster v. State, </em>7 Md. App. 602, 256 A. 2d 716 (1969); <em>Donnenberg v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 591, 232 A. 2d 264 (1967); <em>Levin v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 139, 228 A. 2d 487 (1967), <em>cert. denied </em>389 U. S. 1048 (1968). The Board presented no evidence that the motion picture \u201cSin In 69\u201d was obscene. It did nothing to establish that the film was \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d <em>Jacobellis v. Ohio, </em>378 U. S. 184, 84 S. Ct. 1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In so holding, we note that on oral argument appellee <em>pro se </em>advised us that when the subject film was shown, a number of persons demanded a return of their money. Suffice it to say, we readily can understand their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by the Maryland State Board of Motion Picture Censors.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-10\">. This provision was first codified as Md. Ann. Code (1918, Bagby Ed.) Art. 66A, \u00a7 19 and remained so numbered and without change through Md. Ann.
