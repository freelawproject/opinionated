Shearin, of soliciting for \u201cpurposes of prostitution, lewdness and assignation\u201d in violation of Article 27, Section 15 (e). The appellant mounts two constitutional attacks upon his conviction:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">(1) That Section 15 (e), either on its face or as applied to the particular facts of this case, is an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment; and</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">(2) That Section 15 (e) is unconstitutional under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because of vagueness and overbreadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\n<em>The Facts in this Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">On Sunday, May 2, 1971, there appeared, under the category \u201cHelp Wanted,\u201d the following classified ad in <em>The Washington Post:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">Receptionist</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">Single, attractive age 20-25, to schedule and coordinate office activities. Call 585-7508. 8750 Georgia Ave. Suite 140E. S.S.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">On the following Monday, Miss Virginia Rice, a 24-year-old cashier for People\u2019s Hardware, called the listed number and made an appointment for the following day. On Tuesday, May 4, she appeared at 1 p.m. at 8750 Georgia Avenue for an interview. After filling out an application blank, Miss Rice was ushered into the office of the appellant where she was interviewed for approximately an hour and a half. The nature of the appellant\u2019s business operation was never specifically established. After routine preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>questioning, the appellant volunteered that Miss Rice \u201cdidn\u2019t have a very glamorous life\u201d and \u201chad been pushed around\u201d and \u201cneeded a little bit more money to make [her] life more glamorous and interesting.\u201d The appellant indicated that Miss Rice\u2019s work would require \u201centertaining clients.\u201d The interview terminated shortly thereafter. Miss Rice was told that she might be contacted at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">At 7 p.m. that evening, the appellant called Miss Rice and requested her to return to the office for a further interview. She agreed to do so, arriving back at 8750 Georgia Avenue at approximately 7:30 p.m. The appellant repeated that Miss Rice would have to \u201centertain his clients\u201d and added that everything must be \u201cvery confidential.\u201d He then got up, closed the blinds to the picture window behind him, and asked Miss Rice to undress. She declined. He then asked specifically whether Miss Rice \u201cwould consider going out with clients and entertaining them.\u201d She asked for a further explanation. He explained that he meant \u201cgoing to bed with them and dinner and dancing, you know, going to motels and things like that.\u201d Somewhat flabbergasted, Miss Rice could only come up with the reply that she preferred \u201cgoing out with men my own age.\u201d The appellant then asked, \u201cWould you consider going down on me?\u201d Miss Rice replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The appellant then inquired if Miss Rice understood the terminology and was assured that she did. The appellant added, \u201cSome of our other clients like other sex besides just going to bed with each other.\u201d The appellant proceeded to explain to Miss Rice \u201cwhat these clients like to have done to them besides regular intercourse.\u201d She was quoted a salary of $110 per week plus bonuses when she would \u201centertain clients.\u201d The appellant added that he would give her help in picking out clothes to fit her figure, that he would send her to a salon to have weight taken off, and that she would be taught how to walk and how to make herself glamorous. Miss Rice left the office and went home. The following day, she reported the entire incident to the Montgomery County Police.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In response to the lead furnished by Miss Rice, Detective Ingrid Gibson, a six-year veteran of the Juvenile Section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the Montgomery County Police Department, undertook the undercover assignment of posing as a job applicant before the appellant. Her cover story required her to take the name Myrna Case and to represent herself as a divorcee who had worked as a hostess-waitress in a bar for approximately two years. She called the appellant\u2019s office for an appointment and was granted an interview on May 6. A receptionist indicated that there would be a typing test. Mrs. Gibson replied that she did not type well and was only interested in the position of receptionist. She was told not to worry about the typing test. Mrs. Gibson was interviewed by a man by the name of Mr. Mack who explained that he felt that she needed a counselor, that he was going out of town, that he really did not have the time to interview her properly and that he had an associate by the name of Mr. James whom she should talk to. She left the office with the understanding that she would be contacted on the following Monday. At her listed address at the Jo Ann Motel, she received a call from the appellant at approximately 11:15 p.m. that very evening. He indicated that he wished her to come into the office on Saturday so that he could interview her \u201cwithout the pressures of other people being there.\u201d She. met the appellant at the office at approximately 3 p.m. that Saturday. She was told to sever any existing relationships with other men. She was told that the appellant\u2019s clients were \u201cextremely important people\u201d and that \u201csecrecy was of the utmost importance.\u201d Her job was explained to her as being essentially that of \u201ca companion to the client, that many jobs would require traveling possibly with the clients, staying with them for a number of weeks, for a number of months, or possibly just for one night.\u201d The appellant told her that he could tell \u201cby the look in [her] eyes that [she] had no objections to going to bed with people, that [she] enjoyed sex, that [she] was a hot-blooded passionate person.\u201d The appellant volunteered that Mrs. Gibson \u201cprobably had experienced a variety of sex\u201d and that she \u201cwould not be adverse to doing anything that would be required of [her], that the client would require different types of sex sometimes, because of the fact that they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>important jobs, they would have a hard day, and the way it was put, that they would have a hard time getting it up, and, therefore, not to smash a man\u2019s ego by making overtures [herself].\u201d She was told that \u201cmost of the girls who worked for [the appellant] were masters at understanding people, that it was of utmost importance to preserve the man\u2019s ego, and, more or less, anticipate their wants and comply accordingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Mrs. Gibson was told by th\u00e9 appellant that she would be paid in terms of bonuses and that she would be well rewarded for her services. She was told explicitly that those services consisted of \u201cgoing to bed with clients.\u201d All negotiations with the clients were to be handled by the appellant or his associates. Mrs. Gibson would be notified when a client was coming to see her and the client would know the purpose of the visit. The interview concluded at approximately 6 p.m. Mrs. Gibson was told that she would be contacted again, at her motel, probably on the following Monday. The appellant indicated that he wanted to see her at her motel room and \u201cthat there was a test, which he didn\u2019t really explain at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">On Monday, May 10, the appellant came to the motel room at approximately 6 p.m. Mrs. Gibson was asked whether she \u201chad ever worked conventions or gone to bed with more than one person at one time.\u201d The appellant assured Mrs. Gibson that his clients were not of that caliber. The appellant made frequent references to fellatio and repeatedly asserted that he was sure that Mrs. Gibson \u201chad no aversions about any different type of sexual activity with people.\u201d In referring again to \u201cthe test,\u201d the appellant made it clear that the test consisted of going to bed with him or with one of his associates and that the purpose of this was \u201cto enable us to grow together.\u201d The appellant explained that they were \u201ca very close organization, the girls were loyal\u201d and that they helped set their girls up in business \u201cafter they finished working for them.\u201d He cited as an example one Tinker Bell who had been one of his \u201cgirls\u201d who had been subsequently set up in a nightclub in the District of Columbia. The appellant then left, indicating that he would return to the\\^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>motel room for one further visit for \u201cthe ultimate test as to whether or not [Mrs. Gibson] would have the job.\u201d Before the \u201cultimate test\u201d occurred, the Montgomery County Police, acting upon Mrs. Gibson\u2019s information, arrested the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The evidence amply demonstrates that the appellant violated Article 27, Section 15 (e) which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">(e) To procure or to solicit . . . for the purpose of prostitution, lewdness or assignation; \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The appellant, by way of defense upon this appeal, relies exclusively upon the claimed unconstitutionality of Section 15 (e), in two regards.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\n<em>Solicitation and Free Speech</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The thrust of the appellant\u2019s First Amendment argument is that all he did was to utter words and to communicate thoughts \u2014 conduct which no criminal law may constitutionally abridge. He reads the freedom of speech clause too broadly. Various forms of speech have long been held to be without the protective umbrella of the First Amendment. <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U. S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (obscenity); <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U. S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (libel); <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U. S. 568, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (fighting words); <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>341 U. S. 494, 71 S. Ct. 857, 95 L. Ed. 1137 (advocacy of governmental overthrow). We look now specifically to speech which constitutes solicitation to a criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">The inchoate crimes generally are of recent vintage in the history of the common law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The latest and the least of these is solicitation. Its first formulation, as something distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>from a mere aspect in the law of attempts, was in <em>Rex v. Higgins </em>in 1801, 2 East 5, 102 Eng. Rep. 269. As persuasively declarative of pre-existing common law, <em>Rex v. Higgins </em>was followed by landmark decisions in <em>State v. Avery, </em>7 Conn. 266, 18 Am. Dec. 105 (1828), and <em>Commonwealth v. Flagg, </em>135 Mass. 545 (1883). Solicitation is now universally recognized in the United States as a part of Anglo-American common law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In Clark and Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes </em>(7th ed., 1967), its characteristics are well set out, at 219-223:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\u201cSolicitation is a distinct common-law misdemeanor in which the act forbidden consists of the accused person\u2019s parol or written efforts to activate another to commit a criminal offense. It is immaterial whether the solicitation is of any effect and whether the crime solicited is in fact committed. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">The gist of this offense is incitement. In brief, the gravamen of this common-law misdemeanor lay in counselling, enticing, or inducing another to commit a crime . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">Inciting or soliciting another to commit a crime is . the act of the least magnitude which is punishable by the common law. In such offenses the actor does nothing himself but he urges others to violate the law. The necessity for punishing such persons is obvious, and such conduct is generally punished as a substantive crime, notwithstanding the solicitation does not move the party solicited to commit the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">See also Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(1969), 582-588; 21 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Criminal Law, </em>Sect. 114, \u201cSolicitation as substantive offense\u201d; 22 C.J.S., <em>Criminal Law, </em>Sect. 78, \u201cSolicitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>There is a genuine split of authority, however, as to the grade of the solicited criminal offense which will give rise to an indictable solicitation. England apparently and several American states consider the misdemeanor of solicitation to apply to any indictable misdemeanor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A number of states limit the object of a criminal solicitation to felonies and serious misdemeanors which tend to a breach of the peace.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Some states limit the object of the solicitation to a felony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When Maryland first considered the crime of solicitation in 1887, it placed itself in this latter category, limiting the object of a criminal solicitation to a felony. <em>Lamb v. State, </em>67 Md. 524 (over the strong dissent of Chief Judge Alvey joined by Judge Irving).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Some states which have abolished common law crimes have created statutory solicitations with certain enumerated crimes as cognizable objects of the solicitation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Some states which have limited the object of common law solicitation to felonies have by statute extended the object of solicitation to specified misdemeanors. Maryland, by Chapter 737 of the Acts of 1920, made it a misdemeanor \u201cTo procure or to solicit or to offer to procure or solicit for the purpose of prostitution, lewdness or assignation,\u201d which provision is now codified as the Art. 27, Sect. 15 (e) under present discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">It is clear that when a legislature adds to the list of crimes which may be the objects of a criminal solicitation, it does not alter the general character of the act of solicitation itself. In <em>Riley v. United States, </em>298 A. 2d 228, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was dealing with Section 22-2701 of the D.C. Code 1967, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">\u201cIt shall not be lawful for any person to invite, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>entice, persuade, or to address for the purpose of inviting, enticing, or persuading, any person or persons sixteen years of age or over in the District of Columbia, for the purpose of prostitution, or any other immoral or lewd purpose. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">It made clear that the statutory solicitation would be evaluated by the established principles governing solicitations generally at the common law. It said, at 230-231:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201cThus, it is appropriate to determine if similarity exists between the common-law and contemporary usage of the words used in \u00a7 22-2701. . . . Historically, \u2018urging, inciting, requesting, or advising another person to commit a crime\u2019 was in itself punishable as the crime of solicitation. . . . However, only the solicitations of felonies and certain misdemeanors were punishable.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">In light of the nature of the offense of solicitation as found at common law, \u00a7 22-2701 must necessarily be construed as limited to solicitations of acts which if accomplished would be punishable as a crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">It is clear that the solicitation proscribed by our Section 15 (e) is limited to objects which are themselves crimes against the State of Maryland. Section 15 (g) explicitly provides that it shall be unlawful \u201cTo engage in prostitution, lewdness or assignation by any means whatsoever.\u201d Section 17 then provides penalties of up to $500 in fine or up to one year imprisonment or both for violations of any of the provisions of Section 15. The appellant\u2019s bold assertion, unsupported by any authority, that the crime of solicitation punishes mere words and is, therefore, violative of the First Amendment, is not persuasive. Solicitation is an act. In the progenitor case of <em>Rex v. Higgins </em>itself, Justice Lawrence said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">\u201cThe whole argument for the defendant turns upon a fallacy in assuming that no act is charged to have been done by him; for a solicitation is an act. The offense does not rest in mere intention; for in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>soliciting Dixon to commit the felony, the defendant did an act towards carrying his intention into execution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Even so fervent a champion of free speech as Zechariah Chafee acknowledged that the broad social purposes behind the First Amendment did not extend the protection of that amendment to verbal acts soliciting criminal conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">\u201cThe law of attempts and solicitation is directed not against the words but against acts, and the words are punished only because that is the necessary way to avoid harmful acts. When A urges B to kill C and tells him how he can do it, this has nothing to do with the attainment and dissemination of truth ...\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">As aptly stated by Judge Learned Hand in <em>Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten, </em>244 F. 535, 540 (S.D.N.Y.):<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">\u201cOne may not counsel or advise others to violate the law as it stands. Words are not only the keys of persuasion, but the triggers of action, and those which have no purport but to counsel the violation of law cannot by any latitude of interpretation be a part of that public opinion which is the final source of government in a democratic state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The words of the Supreme Court in <em>American Communications Association v. Douds, </em>339 U. S. 382, 70 S. Ct. 674, 94 L. Ed. 925 (1950), are here appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">\u201cAlthough the First Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, press or assembly, it has long been established that those freedoms themselves are dependent upon the power of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>government to survive. If it is to survive it must have power to protect itself against unlawful conduct and, under some circumstances, against incitements to commit unlawful acts. Freedom of speech thus does not comprehend the right to speak on any subject at any time.\u201d 339 U. S. at 394.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The appellant places great reliance on two trial-level decisions of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, Criminal Division, both by Judge Charles W. Halleck: <em>United States v. Binns </em>(decided May 31, 1972) and <em>United States v. Moses </em>(decided November 3, 1972), 12 Cr. L. 2198-2201. Both cases involved violations of Section 22-2701 of the D.C. Code, hereinbefore discussed. In <em>Binns, </em>there had been a solicitation of an undercover policeman to an act of sodomy. In <em>Moses, </em>there had been a solicitation of an undercover policeman to an act of prostitution. In both cases, Judge Halleck ruled that Section 22-2701 represented an unconstitutional abridgment of the First Amendment. The <em>Binns </em>holding rested in part upon Judge Halleck\u2019s ruling that the D.C. statute prohibited solicitation to homosexual activity, which he ruled was. not a crime in the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <em>Moses </em>holding rested in significant measure upon the fact that prostitution is not a crime in the District of Columbia. Judge Halleck\u2019s decision explicitly distinguished the situation in the District of Columbia, where the act of solicitation had as its object non-criminal conduct, from the situation in Maryland, where a solicitation to prostitution has an object which is criminal. Judge Halleck reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">\u201cSpeech must directly engender a concrete evil, such as a criminal act, a breach of the peace, or a public nuisance, before it loses the protection of the First Amendment.. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">Prostitution per se is not a crime in the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>of Columbia, nor has it ever been. Accordingly, the common law doctrine of solicitation sanctioned by the First Amendment cannot justify D.C. Code Section 22-2701. While solicitation to commit a crime may properly be proscribed, it would be anomalous to punish someone for soliciting another to commit an act which is itself not a crime, and that is precisely what is involved here. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\"><em>Riley v. United States, supra, </em>in overruling implicitly the lower court\u2019s decision in <em>Binns, </em>made it clear that the District of Columbia law prohibiting solicitation \u201cfor the purpose of prostitution, or any other immoral or lewd purpose\u201d is constitutional, just so long as the object of the solicitation is an act prohibited by statute. The court in <em>Riley </em>held, at 232-233:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u201cAppellant also contends that through enforcement of this statute his First Amendment right to freedom of speech has been violated and asserts that his conduct was merely a constitutionally protected exercise of that right. We must therefore determine if the statute as construed proscribes speech which falls within the protected area of the First Amendment. Not all speech is so protected.. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">We hold that prohibiting solicitation for the offense of sodomy is within the domain of state power. We know of no authoritative holding which extends First Amendment protection to a solicitation to commit an act lawfully prohibited by statute. Accordingly, \u00a7 22-2701 does not offend the First Amendment protection of freedom of expression.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">We see no theoretical distinction between solicitation to commit kidnapping, murder or treason, on the one hand, and to commit prostitution, lewdness or assignation, on the other. The appellant intimates that there should be a difference, because the latter solicitations somehow intrude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>upon an ill-defined \u201czone of privacy\u201d protected by <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U. S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965). His constitutional attack is misdirected. If consummated crimes themselves are constitutional in terms of their criminality, a proposition which the appellant does not attack at bar, then constitutionality follows as to their incipient or inchoate phases. If a constitutional attack is to be mounted, it must be against the consummated crime \u2022itself rather than be interposed between the consummated act and one of its inchoate stages such as conspiracy, attempt or solicitation. We see no First Amendment impediment to the conviction at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We note, moreover, that the Court of Appeals in <em>Savoy v. State, </em>236 Md. 36, 202 A. 2d 324, affirmed a conviction for a violation of Section 15 (e), even though the constitutionality of the statute was not there at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>Lewdness and Vagueness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Nor may the appellant prevail upon his contention that Section 15 (e) is void for vagueness or overbreadth. Section 16 very precisely limits the terms of Section 15 (e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">\u201cThe term \u2018prostitution\u2019 shall be construed to mean the offering or receiving of the body for sexual intercourse for hire. The term \u2018lewdness\u2019 shall be construed to mean any unnatural sexual practice. The term \u2018assignation\u2019 shall be construed to include the making of any appointment, or engagement for prostitution or lewdness or any act in furtherance of such appointment or engagement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u201cProstitution\u201d and \u201cassignation\u201d could not be more precisely defined. \u201cLewdness\u201d is defined as \u201cany unnatural sexual practice,\u201d which might yet raise a question of imprecision had not that latter term itself been very explicitly defined by Article 27, Section 554, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">\u201cEvery person who shall be convicted of taking into his or her mouth the sexual organ of any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>person or animal, or who shall be convicted of placing his or her sexual organ in the mouth of any other person or animal, or who shall be convicted of committing any other unnatural or perverted sexual practice with any other person or animal, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or be imprisoned in jail or in the house of correction or in the penitentiary for a period not exceeding ten years, or shall be both fined and imprisoned within the limits above prescribed in the discretion of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><em>Blake v. State, </em>210 Md. 459, 124 A. 2d 273, disposes of the argument that Section 554 might be void for vagueness. It explicitly holds that it is not. <em>Blake </em>also includes sodomy, independently proscribed by Article 27, Section 553, and carrying its own penalty as well as felony status, as falling within the definition of \u201cunnatural or perverted sexual practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\"><em>Hughes v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 497, 287 A. 2d 299, disposes of the argument that Section 554 is unconstitutional for overbreadth. Chief Judge Orth there reasoned that whatever the constitutional protection surrounding \u201cprivate consensual sexual acts between married couples\u201d might be, that protection would not extend to one not in that category. Judge Orth there said, at 14 Md. App. 504-505:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">\u201cWe share the sentiments of the court in <em>Pruett v. State, </em>463 S.W.2d 191, 195 (Texas 1970) that to extend the protection of this right of privacy of the marital union to strike down a statute proscribing cunnilingus, fellatio, and the whole field of other unnatural or perverted sexual practice, when successful prosecution of private consensual sexual acts between married couples are at most only \u2018conceivable\u2019, is not consistent with the description of the marriage relationship and right of privacy described by Mr. Justice Douglas.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Reasoning similarly, we do not recognize standing in one such as the appellant at bar, who was endeavoring to exploit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>sex commercially, to invoke the protections which might attach to consenting adults on a non-commercial basis, whatever those protections might or might not be.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">If the consummated crimes of prostitution, lewdness (to wit, \u201cunnatural sexual practices\u201d as defined by Section 554 and <em>Blake v. State), </em>and assignation are not themselves unconstitutional for vagueness or for overbreadth, and it has been held that they are not, then it follows that the ancillary and inchoate crime of soliciting the commission of an act of prostitution, lewdness or assignation is similarly not unconstitutional for vagueness or for overbreadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-12\">.
