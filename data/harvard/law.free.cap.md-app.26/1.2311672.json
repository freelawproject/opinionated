On 29 May 1970 he filed a claim for compensation with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission (Commission) against the appellants, Clarence Keene and Clinton Pearson, T/A Pearson &amp; Keene Dock Builders (partnership), and Selected Risks Insurance Company, its insurance carrier (insurer). On 14 August 1970, after a hearing, the Commission found that the partnership was not the employer of the claimant at the time of the alleged injury and that the claimant did not sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment. The Commission disallowed the claim for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-11\">The claimant filed an appeal in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County. After a <em>de novo </em>hearing held on 8 April 1974, a jury, presided over by Judge C. Burnam Mace, found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>that the partnership was the claimant\u2019s employer at the time of his injury and that he did sustain an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. On 26 April 1974 the partnership\u2019s motion for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>was denied. It is from this order that the partnership appeals. Here the partnership\u2019s sole contention is that the evidence was insufficient to submit to the jury the questions of whether the partnership was the employer of the claimant at the time of the alleged injury and, if so, whether the claimant sustained an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">In this case the evidence was sharply disputed. Viewed in the light most favorable to the claimant, however, the facts are as follows.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellant was employed by the partnership for several years before his accident on 16 May 1970. Both partners had the right to control and direct his activities. The claimant testified that his duties included \u201cwhatever they\u2019d tell me to do . . . whenever they needed me.\u201d His regular duties included helping to build piers, bulkheads, dikes, boat ramps and duck blinds. He would drive pilings, go into the woods to cut logs for pilings which he would then haul out, stack lumber, hammer nails, bore holes, cut bolts and saw boards. On occasion, when directed so to do by Mr. Keene, he would cut the grass at Mr. Keene\u2019s garage. Most of this work was performed on Monday through Friday but because the partnership work depended upon the weather the claimant frequently was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>accrue 40 hours of compensable work during such a five day period. Often when he did not \u201cmake his hours\u201d the claimant would be asked to perform such services as cutting and hauling logs from the woods or cutting grass at Mr. Keene\u2019s garage on Saturdays.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The claimant was paid on an hourly basis at the rate of $2.25 per hour, by a partnership check issued to him on Fridays. No records of the number of hours worked by the claimant were kept either by him or the partnership. Clarence Keene, who mentally logged the number of hours of work performed by the claimant, would issue a partnership check which showed the total amount of money paid to the claimant, but did not show the number of hours worked. These checks were, in turn, looked at and signed by Clinton Pearson, the other partner, who knew \u201chow much time he [the claimant] made.\u201d The amount of the checks would then be forwarded to an accountant for payroll and bookkeeping purposes. When the claimant worked on a Saturday the number of working hours then accumulated would be carried over to the ensuing week. The claimant would be paid by a partnership check issued the following Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">At one time Clarence Keene had operated commercially the garage which he owned. Since the formation of the partnership approximately eight or nine years previously, he utilized the garage solely for repairing motors. as an accommodation to friends and as a social gathering place. The garage belonged solely to Keene, was not located on partnership property nor connected with partnership business in any way except for the possible storage of \u201csome bolts, nails, things like that, cable.\u201d A number of men in the community regarded the garage as a \u201changout\u201d where at various times they would assemble to fish nearby, cook meals and drink beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">On 16 May 1970 the claimant\u2019s son, Carl Insley, picked his father up at his father\u2019s home and drove him to Keene\u2019s garage arriving at about 9 a.m. The claimant\u2019s son began to repair a malfunctioning motor. A number of men, including Keene, were present. At some point in time the claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>son informed Keene that in order to complete the repair it was necessary to have gaskets \u201cto finish the motor up.\u201d Keene told a man named Orville Pritchett who worked at an auto repair shop that he wanted him to go get the gaskets. Pritchett refused, saying that he had to go home and cut his grass. At this juncture the claimant started to leave in order to go down the road and get some beer. According to the claimant, Keene called him back and told him \u201cto go down and help Orville.\u201d The claimant got into Pritchett\u2019s car and went with him, fully expecting, based upon his past experience in being paid for cutting Keene\u2019s grass on Saturday, to be paid by the partnership. As stated by the claimant, \u201c. . . Mr. Keene is the one that paid me \u2014 he is the one that sent me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Upon arriving at Pritchett\u2019s house the claimant began to cut the grass with a power mower which shortly ran out of gas. As the claimant and Pritchett were getting ready to refill the lawn mower they decided to burn a big pile of brush which was \u201cin the way of cutting the grass.\u201d Pritchett poured some gasoline on the brush; then the claimant threw a match into the pile to ignite it. The pile of brush \u201cblew up\u201d from eight to 12 feet. As a result the claimant suffered serious burns and other bodily injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">At the hospital, Clarence Keene assured the claimant\u2019s daughter that she did not \u201chave a thing to worry about . . . that Orville [Pritchett] had a homeowners policy and if it didn\u2019t cover it [the medical expenses], that he had sent my father, that he would put him on his insurance.\u201d The claimant was never compensated for the work performed on the day of the accident either by the partnership or by Keene.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The partnership and insurer contend that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s findings. They maintain that, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the claimant, the evidence establishes that at the time of his injury the claimant, as a result of an unauthorized direction from one of the partners, was performing services for a third party, which were not a part of his regular duties and which were of personal benefit to the assigning partner rather than to the partnership\u2019s business. They assert that under such circumstances the claimant -was not an employee of the partnership at the time of his injury, and that his injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The question of whether a claimant, directed by a person in authority to do work outside his normal duties for the private benefit of his superior is an employee acting within the scope of his employment has not previously been answered in Maryland. In 7 <em>Schneider\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 1660 (a) (3d Ed. 1950) it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-6\">\u201cAn employee who, as a voluntary accommodation to his employer or to another, performs services outside the scope of his employment, is not within the act while performing such services. * * * But an employer may enlarge or extend the scope of the employment and an employee who, at the direction of his employer or of his superior to whose orders he is subject, performs services outside the duties of his usual employment, and performs them in consequence of the existence of the relation of employer and employee, and as incidental to the employment, is within the protection of the act while performing such services. * * * Where an employee performs services for a third party by direction of his employer, if the relation of employer and employee continues to exist between them during the period of such services, the employer is liable under the compensation act for injuries sustained by the employee while performing the task so assigned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>him although he may be under the control of the third party as to the details of the work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Similarly, 1 <em>Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 27.40 (1972) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">\u201cWhen any person in authority directs an employee to run some private errand or do some work outside his normal duties for the private benefit of the employer or superior, an injury in the course of that work is compensable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-7\">\u201cThe technical reason for these holdings is that, whatever the normal course of employment may be, the employer and/or his supervisory staff have it within their power to enlarge that course by assigning tasks outside the usual area. If they do not assign these tasks on the strength of the employer-employee relation on which compensability depends, then what is the source of authority by which the task is assigned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-8\">\u201cThe practical reason for the rule is that any other view places the employee in an intolerable dilemma: if he complies with the order, he forfeits compensation protection; if he does not comply, he gets fired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">\u201cTested by these single arguments, the early cases denying compensation seem wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">Again it is said in 58 Am. Jur. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 231, p. 738 (1948):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\">\u201cAccording to many authorities, however, the employee is entitled to compensation as for an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment when such injury was received in the performance of work for his employer outside the scope of his usual duty, but which the employee had been expressly ordered to do by someone authorized to direct him as to his work ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Finally in 99 C.J.S. <em>Workmen\u2019s </em>Compensation, \u00a7 217, p. 718 (1958) reference is made to cases which hold that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">\u201cAn act directed by the employer and one which the employee performed in the good faith belief that he was following the directions of his superior are within the course of employment, although the act is beyond the scope &lt;?f the employee\u2019s duties. .. .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">A majority of state courts which have considered this question agree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In reaching this result various rationales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>are employed depending somewhat upon the wording of different state statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Some courts have reasoned that the mere fact that the particular act which the claimant is requested to perform is unusual or not customarily required of an employee in that business does not result in terminating or suspending temporarily the existing status of the claimant as an employee of the employer in the usual course of his business. Whatever the normal course of employment may be, the employer and supervisory staff have it within their power to enlarge or extend the scope of employment to cover services and tasks outside the usual area.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Other courts have held that a statute which defines an employee as one who performs services for remuneration in the course of the trade, business, profession or occupation of the employer at the time of the injury, omits from coverage only those as to whom there does not exist, at the time of the injury, employment in the usual course of business of the alleged employer. When such employment does exist, an employee is not excluded because the service which he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>temporarily performing for his employer at his employer\u2019s direction is not customarily requested of employees in such employment. When such employment does exist it is sufficient that the service, which such an employee is performing when injured, grows out of and is incidental to his employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Some of these cases are predicated on a theory that a statute, which defines compensable accidents as only those \u201carising out of and in the course of employment,\u201d does not exclude recovery by an injured employee because the service which he was temporarily performing for his employer was not one usually requested of employees in such type of employment since the compensation act \u201cdoes not say \u2018when doing the work he was employed to perform.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nugent Sand Co., supra, </em>at 648. These cases reason that the language and the intent of the act are of wider scope, so as to provide coverage of employees who are performing tasks directed by their employers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In addition some courts, relying on an estoppel theory, have found that an employer is precluded from arguing that an injury did not arise in the course of employment, if such injury was incurred while the employee was performing a job assigned by his employer. These courts rationalize that a service arises out of employment whenever the employer calls for such a service.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol., 1974 Cum. Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 21 (a) defines an \u201cemployer\u201d subject to the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">\u201c(1) Every person that has in the State one or more employees subject to this Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Article 101, \u00a7 21 (b) defines an \u201cemployee\u201d subject to the provisions of the Act as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">\u201c(1) Every person, including a person under 18 years of age, whether lawfully or unlawfully employed, in the service of an employer under any contract of hire or apprenticeship, expressed or implied . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">\u201c(5) Every person performing services for remuneration in the course of the trade, business, profession or occupation of an employer at the time of the injury, provided such person in relation to this service does not maintain a separate business, does not hold himself out to and render service to the public and is not himself an employer subject to this Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Article 101, \u00a7 15 requires every employer subject to the provisions of the Act to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">\u201c.. . pay or provide as required herein compensation according to the schedules of this article for the disability or death of his employee <em>resulting from an accidental personal injury sustained by the employee arising out of and in the course of his employment </em>without regard to fault as a cause of such injury . ...\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes. <em>State v. Richardson, </em>233 Md. 534, 541, 197 A. 2d 428, 431 (1964); <em>Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard, Inc. v. Hempfield, </em>206 Md. 589, 594, 112 A. 2d 488, 491 (1955); <em>Watson v. Grimm, </em>200 Md. 461, 472, 90 A. 2d 180, 185 (1952); <em>Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc. v. Rosenthal, </em>185 Md. 416, 424, 45 A. 2d 79, 83 (1945); Maryland Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 63. Any uncertainty in the law should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>be resolved in favor of the claimant. <em>Rosenthal, supra; Brocker Mfg. v. Mashburn, </em>17 Md. App. 327, 336, 301 A. 2d 501, 506 (1973); <em>Uninsured Employment Fund v. Booker, </em>13 Md. App. 591, 594, 284 A. 2d 454, 456 (1971); <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Chapman, </em>11 Md. App. 369, 376, 274 A. 2d 870, 874, <em>aff'd mem., </em>262 Md. 367, 277 A. 2d 444 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Following this rule of statutory construction and the previous rationales, we now hold that whenever, by virtue of a contract express or implied, an employer-employee relationship exists between two parties, and the employer, or his agent as the employee\u2019s superior, directs the employee to perform services outside of or beyond his customary or usual duties and/or of a nature not ordinarily required in the employer\u2019s business for the private benefit of the employer or his agent, rather than for the benefit of the business, the order constitutes a permissible exercise of the employer\u2019s authority to enlarge or extend the scope of employment and expands the existing employment contract. It does not create a new employment contract. Because the existing employer-employee relationship is not terminated but continues to exist while the employee is performing such work, any injury resulting from the performance of such work is compensable under the act. It would be inconsistent with the purposes of the act to relieve an employer, who directs an employee to perform an unusual task, from liability for injuries incurred while the employee was performing that task. Nor would it be consistent with the policies of the act to compel an employee to ascertain whether the task assigned lies within the scope of his customary duties and, if not, to risk being fired if he refuses to perform, or to lose the benefit of insurance coverage if he does perform.<footnotemark>7a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Applying these principles to the instant case produces a clear result. Here the evidence establishes or supports a rational inference that for several years before Saturday, 16 May 1970, by virtue of an implied contract of employment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the claimant performed various duties for the partnership required in the course of the partnership\u2019s pier and bulkheading business. During this period, the claimant had no other job, did not work alternately for any other employer, nor was he compensated in any way by anyone other than the partnership. Under this contract of employment both partners had the right to control and direct the claimant as to the type of work he was to perform, the time he was to perform it, and the place where it was to be performed. Because the availability of work depended upon the weather, the claimant was frequently unable to accrue 40 hours of work between Monday and Friday. When this occurred, and as a normal incident of claimant\u2019s job, he would be requested to work on Saturday. On some Saturdays the partners would ask appellant to work for the partnership. On other Saturdays he would be asked to cut the grass at Keene\u2019s garage. Whenever he performed this unusual incidental duty he was paid out of partnership funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">On Saturday, 16 May 1970, after a week in which the claimant had not worked 40 hours, Keene directed the claimant to cut the grass at Pritchett\u2019s house, a function which the claimant had never before been required to perform. This order, made for the personal benefit of Keene, who wanted Pritchett released from the necessity of cutting his grass so that he could run an errand for Keene, was a permissible and legitimate exercise of Keene\u2019s authority to enlarge or extend the scope of the claimant\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The fact that the claimant undertook to cut Pritchett\u2019s grass, a service which was outside of and beyond his usual duties and not in the normal course of the partnership business, only because Keene was his employer and he reasonably anticipated, on the basis of past practice with respect to cutting grrss at Keene\u2019s garage, that he would be paid by the partnership, and that the partnership was obliged to pay for such service,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> establishes that the grass cutting project was undertaken in consequence of the existence of the relationship of employer and employee and as an unusual incident of the claimant\u2019s employment. The mere fact that cutting grass at Pritchett\u2019s house was not his usual duty, was not previously required of him and did not redound to the benefit of the partnership business did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>terminate the claimant\u2019s status as an employee of the partnership. Rather the employer-employee relationshin continued to exist during the period in which such services were being performed. Under such circumstances the partnership was liable for the injury sustained by the claimant while performing the task assigned to him by Keene even though it was not one ordinarily assigned to him, or required for the partnership\u2019s business and was not undertaken for the benefit of the partnership business.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">The evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s findings that the partnership was the employer of the claimant and that the claimant\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-6\">. In determining whether a motion for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>should have been .granted this Court must resolve all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the non-moving party and consider all of the evidence and inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion was made. Baltimore &amp; O.R.R. v. Plews, 262 Md. 442, 449, 278 A. 2d 287. 290 (1971): I.O.A. Leasing v. Merle Thomas Corp.. 260 Md. 243. 248-49, 272 A. 2d 1, 4 (1971); <em>see </em>Moran v.

App. 242, 249, 319 A. 2d 320, 324-25 (1974). Consequently, if there is any competent evidence, however slight, tending to support the claimant\u2019s right to recover, the case should be submitted to the jury and the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>denied.

Although the partners conceded that the claimant had worked for them for several years prior to the day of the accident, they denied vigorously that he had ever worked for the partnership on a Saturday. Mr. Keene admitted that the claimant had mowed his grass previously on Saturdays but asserted that he had never paid the claimant anything for this task except a beer to drink. Both partners testified that the claimant had never been paid for any work done on a Saturday. Finally, Mr. Keene denied that he told the claimant to go help Pritchett on 16 May 1970 or that he stated that his compensation insurance would protect the claimant in any way. The testimony that Mr. Keene directed the claimant to go with Pritchett and that he told the daughter about his insurance was corroborated by other witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b28-7\">.

The partnership and insurer strenuously assert that the partnership did not select and engage the claimant to cut Pritchett\u2019s grass and had not paid the claimant to cut Pritchett\u2019s grass in the past. They maintain that cutting Pritchett\u2019s grass was a function outside the scope of the partnership business and that, consequently, Keene as a partner had no authority to engage the claimant to cut Pritchett\u2019s grass. <em>Larson\u2019s, supra, \u00a7 </em>2740, at 5-265, 5-266 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">\u201cThe question of the actual authority of the person issuing the order is sometimes adverted to in the cases but should not be decisive. In some instances . . . there was evidence of actual authority, by custom, to use company employees for such private jobs .... But even where the order is a gross excess or even abuse of authority, surely the employee, who has no choice but to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>comply, should not be made to pay the price of his superior\u2019s wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">Here the facts that the partnership had previously provided Saturday work for the claimant when he failed to accrue 40 hours of work between Monday and Friday; that some of the Saturday work provided was to cut Keene\u2019s grass at Keene\u2019s garage; and that the partnership paid the claimant for the hours worked on Saturday, including the hours spent cutting Keene\u2019s grass, all support the conclusion that Keene had actual authority, by custom, to engage the claimant on behalf of the partnership to perform services for the benefit of Keene at sites other than the partnership premises. Moreover, the results in this case would not change even if Keene\u2019s direction to the claimant was a gross excess of authority. San Antonio, <em>supra-, </em>Wilkerson, <em>supra; </em>Neal, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b34-13\">. The partnership and insurer vigorously assert that, because the claimant had never been paid previously to cut grass anywhere other than at Keene\u2019s property, that the partnership was not obligated, by custom or past practice, to pay the claimant for cutting grass at Pritchett\u2019s home and the claimant was not justified in assuming that the partnership would pay for such services. Moreover, the claimant was not paid by the partnership for cutting grass at Pritchett\u2019s and never demanded payment for the performance of such services. They maintain that these circumstances conclusively demonstrate that the claimant was not an employee of the partnership and that his injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-14\">The evidence that the partnership attempted to provide Saturday work for the claimant whenever he failed to accrue 40 hours of work between Monday and Friday, coupled with the evidence that Keene had directed the claimant to cut grass at his garage on Saturday and that the partnership had paid for such services, established that by custom Keene had authority to direct the claimant to cut grass on Saturday at sites other than property owned by the partnership and that when he so directed the claimant the partnership would pay the claimant for his services. Thus, the partnership was obligated, based upon custom and past practice, to pay for such work. Consequently, the partnership\u2019s failure to make the payment and the claimant\u2019s failure to make demands for the payment are immaterial with respect to the question here in issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
