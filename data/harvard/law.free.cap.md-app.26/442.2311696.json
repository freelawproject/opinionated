Vol.) Art. 66 V2, \u00a7 11-902 provides, in subsection (a), that it shall be unlawful to drive any vehicle while \u201cin an intoxicated condition\u201d; subsection (b) makes it unlawful for any person to drive any vehicle when \u201chis driving ability is impaired by the consumption of alcohol.\u201d Section 16-104 entitled \u201cLesser included offenses\u201d provides that \u201c[i]t shall be sufficient to charge any person with a violation of ... \u00a7 11-902 (driving while intoxicated [or] impaired . . .) and the court is empowered to make a finding under any subsection of ... \u00a7 11-902.\u201d The penalty for violating \u00a7 11-902 (a) (drunken driving) may exceed three months\u2019 imprisonment; the penalty for violating \u00a7 11-902 (b) (driving while impaired) is a fine of not more than $500.00. \u00a7 17-101 (b)(i)(ii). Under Code (1974) Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 4-301, the District Court is vested with exclusive original jurisdiction in cases charging violations of \u00a7 11-902 of Art. 66 V2. Under \u00a7 4-302 (d)(1) of the Courts Article, the District Court \u201cis deprived of jurisdiction if a defendant is entitled to and demands a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>trial at any time prior to trial in the District Court.\u201d Under \u00a7 4-302 (d)(2), a defendant may demand a jury trial if the penalty for the offense with which he is charged permits imprisonment for a period in excess of three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">On March 23, 1974, a Baltimore City Police Officer issued two traffic citations to the appellant Thompson. In the first citation, Thompson was charged with \u201cdriving with ability impaired or intoxicated\u201d in violation of \u201c\u00a7 11-902.\u201d In the second citation, he was charged with \u201cdriving and skidding, spinning wheels\u201d in violation of \u00a7 11-1117 of Art. 66 V2. On June 24, 1974, when Thompson appeared for trial in District Court, he demanded a jury trial. As a result, the District Court was divested of jurisdiction and jurisdiction became vested in the Criminal Court of Baltimore. <em>See </em>Courts Article, \u00a7 1-501; Maryland District Rule 5 (d); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>21 Md. App. 557, 321 A. 2d 549 (1974); and <em>Smith v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 217, 301 A. 2d 54 (1973). When the case was called for trial in the Criminal Court on July 11, 1974, the State\u2019s Attorney entered a nolle prosequi to the charge of driving while intoxicated (\u00a7 11-902 (a)) \u2014 the only charge against Thompson which carried a penalty of imprisonment in excess of three months. Thompson thereafter moved to dismiss the citation charging violations of \u00a7 11-902 on the ground that it violated \u201cthe requirement that a traffic charge set out with reasonable definitiveness the basis of an accusation\u201d and because the citation charged alternative offenses and was duplicitous. After the court denied this motion, Thompson demanded that he be afforded a jury trial on the remaining charges. He also contended that because the State had entered a nol pros to the drunken driving charge \u2014 the offense which \u201ctriggered\u201d the Criminal Court\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 the case should be returned to the District Court for trial. Finding no merit in Thompson\u2019s contentions, the Criminal Court heard the case without a jury. It found Thompson not guilty of the spinning wheels charge but convicted him of driving while impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">On appeal, Thompson contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">(1) that he was denied his statutory right to a jury trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(2) that the Criminal Court was without jurisdiction to decide the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">(3) that the Criminal Court \u201cdeprived him of a form of trial ... or of a mode of appellate review assured him by Maryland statutes . . . and thus denied him due process\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">(4) that the citation charging violations of \u00a7 11-902 was defective because it set out alternative charges and was duplicitous; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">(5) that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that Thompson\u2019s ability to drive was impaired by consumption of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Thompson argues that the provisions of \u00a7 4-302 of the Courts Article fix the place where the type of trial (jury or nonjury) is to be determined, viz., in the District Court; the time when the demand for a jury trial must be made, viz., \u201cat any time prior to trial\u201d in that court; the party who may demand a jury trial, viz., only the defendant; and the criterion which controls the right to jury trial, viz., the penalty for the offense charged. This statutory design is defeated, Thompson contends, if the State is permitted, after a jury trial is demanded and the case removed to the Criminal Court, to nol pros the only charge carrying a penalty in excess of three months and thereby deny a jury trial on the remaining charges. The State argues, on the other hand, that its action in nol prossing the drunken driving charge in no way conflicted with the statutory scheme of \u00a7 4-302 (d) because the penalty to which Thompson was ultimately subject constituted the sole determinant of his entitlement to a jury trial. Thompson had no right to a jury trial, the State contends, because he was not subject to a penalty in excess of three months\u2019 imprisonment. Focusing on the case as it was set for trial in the Criminal Court, rather than as it may have existed in the District Court, provides what we think is a commonsense approach to ascertaining the legislative intent underlying the enactment of \u00a7 4-302. While this section clearly provides a right to jury trial for offenses carrying a penalty of imprisonment in excess of three months, it plainly makes no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>provision for a jury trial for lesser offenses. By focusing on the provisions of \u00a7 4-302 (d)(1) dealing with District Court jurisdiction and the procedure for demanding a jury trial, Thompson would ignore the clear implication of \u00a7 4-302 (d)(2) which establishes the criterion for determining when a defendant may be entitled to a jury trial. Absent a charge carrying a penalty in excess of three months\u2019 imprisonment, Thompson was not entitled to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Thompson advances the alternative argument that when the State entered a nolle prosequi to the drunken driving charge, it not only removed the basis for his entitlement to a jury trial but also divested the Criminal Court of jurisdiction to hear the remaining charges. We disagree. Under \u00a7 4-302 (e) of the Courts Article, the Criminal Court has exclusive original jurisdiction of offenses \u201cotherwise within the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction if a person is charged with an offense or offenses arising from the same circumstances but not within the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Thus, when Thompson demanded a jury trial on the drunken driving charge, the District Court was deprived of jurisdiction not only over that charge, but also over the driving while impaired and spinning wheels charges. Once the Criminal Court properly acquired jurisdiction, the subsequent entry of the nol pros had no effect on the continuance of its jurisdiction to decide the remaining charges. In <em>Gray v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 677, 253 A. 2d 395 (1969), a juvenile was indicted for murder, a capital offense, but convicted only of manslaughter, a noncapital and lesser included offense. Because the juvenile court would have had original jurisdiction of the manslaughter charge, Gray argued that the jury\u2019s verdict deprived the circuit court of jurisdiction. We held, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201conce a court lawfully acquires jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter of the litigation, subsequent events will not ordinarily deprive the court of its jurisdiction, although had they existed at the time, they may have initially precluded the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6x\">6 Md. App. at 682.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Although the entry of a nol pros to the drunken driving charge, had it occurred before Thompson demanded a jury trial in the District Court, would have precluded the Criminal Court from acquiring jurisdiction, it had no effect on the jurisdiction of that court once it had lawfully attached. <em>Compare Dill v. State, </em>24 Md. App. 695, 332 A. 2d 690 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Thompson argues that the lower court denied him due process of law by depriving him of a form of trial or of a mod\u00e9 of appellate review guaranteed by Maryland statutes. Specifically, Thompson contends that he was \u201centitled to rely on his continued entitlement to the jury trial which he demanded in the District Court,\u201d but \u201cthe lower court in effect changed the rules on him in the middle of the game\u201d; and that had he been originally tried in the District Court, he would have been entitled to a second de novo nonjury trial in the Criminal Court before a different judge. Thompson relies on <em>Spencer v. State, </em>20 Md. App. 201, 314 A. 2d 727 (1974), a case in which we held that the \u201carbitrary and unexplained action\u201d of a court clerk in skipping names on a jurors\u2019 list after both the State and the defendant had exhausted their peremptory challenges amounted to a violation of due process. There we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201cIn the wise expending of his available peremptory challenges, a defendant is entitled to the expectation that the rules which have, in practice, been operating will not <em>strangely </em>cease to operate once his options have been exhausted. That expectation was <em>arbitrarily </em>denied the appellant at bar.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">20 Md. App. at 209.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The arbitrariness condemned in <em>Spencer </em>is not present in this case. Nothing demonstrably arbitrary occurred by reason of the State\u2019s action in entering a nol pros to the drunken driving charge. It may have decided that it lacked sufficient evidence to proceed on that charge. But for whatever reason the charge was nol prossed, that action was committed to the discretion of the State\u2019s Attorney. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Greathouse v. State, </em>5 Md. App. 675, 249 A. 2d 207 (1969). Nor do we think the lower court was arbitrary or unreasonable in denying Thompson a jury trial or in declining to remand the case to the District Court. As we have indicated, the court\u2019s action was entirely consistent with the law. Of course, entry of the nol pros was to Thompson\u2019s benefit. While he did not have two de novo trials on the remaining charges, with the right of discretionary review by this court (Courts Article, \u00a7\u00a7 12-305 and 12-401), he nevertheless was afforded the instant direct appeal as a matter of right (\u00a7 12-301), which he would not otherwise have had if he had been tried originally in the District Court. We see no denial of due process in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Thompson next contends that the traffic citation charging him with \u201cdriving while ability impaired or intoxicated\u201d was defective because it was not sufficiently definite, imposed charges in the alternative, and \u201csince two separate potential charges are recited in a single \u2018count,\u2019 \u201d is \u201cclearly duplicitous.\u201d The State acknowledges that charging two substantive crimes in the alternative in one count is impermissible where the offenses grow out of different transactions and involve different intents, but not when a count charges two or more offenses involving the same intent as \u00a7 11-902.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">It is clear that drunken driving and driving while impaired each bears its own penalty. Under \u00a7 16-104, it is \u201csufficient to charge any person with a violation of . . . \u00a7 11-902 (driving while intoxicated [or] impaired . . .) and the court is empowered to make a finding under any subsection of . . . \u00a7 11-902.\u201d We think that if, under \u00a7 16-104, it is permissible to charge any offense under \u00a7 11-902 by reference alone to that statute, it is likewise permissible to allege in the disjunctive in one count the charges of drunken driving and driving while impaired. We are of course aware of the well-established rule of pleading that when a statute creates an offense and specifies several different acts, transactions, means or intents by which it may be committed, a charging document, alleging such in one count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>must do so conjunctively and not disjunctively, <em>Ayre v. State, </em>21 Md. App. 61, 318 A. 2d 828 (1974); <em>State v. Beers, </em>21 Md. App. 39, 318 A. 2d 825 (1974), and that disjunctive allegations in one count of different acts, transactions, means and intents is ordinarily a defect which cannot be cured by amendment. <em>State v. Beers, supra, </em>21 Md. App. at 44. However, this rule can be changed by statute, subject to due process limitations, as was done by enactment of \u00a7 16-104. <em>See State v. Rand, </em>231 So. 2d 31 (Fla. App. 1970) and <em>State v. Bundy, </em>91 Ariz. 325, 372 P. 2d 329 (1962).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We see no due process violation in requiring Thompson to stand trial on the driving while impaired charge. The reasons for the disjunctive/conjunctive rule are twofold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\u201cThe first is that the defendant is entitled to be informed with certainty of the offense with which he is charged; the second is that he should be enabled to show, in the event of a subsequent prosecution, that he has previously been convicted or acquitted of the same offense.\u201d <em>Bonneville v. State, </em>206 Md. 302, 310-11, 111 A. 2d 669, 672 (1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">When the State entered a nol pros to the drunken driving charge, it removed whatever fair-notice problems that may have existed. The offenses of driving while intoxicated or impaired differ only in the grade of proof required to support a conviction. Quite obviously, Thompson was not hampered in preparing to defend the driving while impaired charge. And in the event of subsequent prosecution, Thompson would have no difficulty in demonstrating his previous conviction of the remaining offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Finally, we find no merit in Thompson\u2019s contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of driving while impaired. Officer Marrow testified that he stopped Thompson after observing his car accelerating as it made a right-hand turn. This, he said, caused Thompson\u2019s wheels to spin. Upon asking Thompson for his driving license and registration, Marrow said he \u201cfumbled through his wallet and placed a card beside him on the front seat.\u201d Marrow asked to see the card which he incorrectly suspected to be lottery play, but Thompson objected and hurled an expletive at the officer. Officer Marrow testified that Thompson</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\u201ccame out of the automobile. He was very loud about me asking him about the card. He said it was personal. And I watched his actions and mannerisms. He was swaying while he was talking to me, at times he was leaning up against his automobile. So I stepped closer to Mr. Thompson and I could smell a faint odor, moderate odor of alcohol on his breath.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">When the officer advised Thompson he was under arrest for driving while intoxicated, Thompson stated he was not under arrest and was not going anywhere. He then jumped back into the car and shut the door. Before Thompson was removed from the car and subdued, it took four additional officers and a burst of mace.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">From this evidence, the lower court concluded that \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s conduct can only be explained by consumption of alcohol.\u201d On the record before us, we cannot say that the judgment of the lower court was clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\">. For example, in <em>Bundy, </em>the Supreme Court of Arizona said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s contention that the information is defective for the additional reason that it charges in one count disjunctive allegations requiring different grades and qualities of proof is without merit since the information charged the crime in the language of the statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 13-621, as permitted by 17 A.R.S. Rule Crim. Proc. 115. Moreover, 17 A.R.S. Rule Crim. Proc. 138 permits disjunctive or alternative charges.\u201d 372 P. 2d at 331.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
