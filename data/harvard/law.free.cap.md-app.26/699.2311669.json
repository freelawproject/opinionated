Mulcare, personal representative and surviving husband of Betty J. Mulcare, brought suit on behalf of his deceased wife\u2019s estate, himself individually, and himself as next friend of his minor daughter, all collectively styled appellee, against Dr. Richard H. Dobson and the Brandy wine-Waldorf Medical/Dental Clinic, Inc., appellants. The suit alleged that Dr. Dobson, President and Treasurer of the Clinic, had negligently administered a tetanus toxoid injection to Mrs. Mulcare, in that the injection was made without first ascertaining Mrs. Mulcare\u2019s medical history, and without determining whether she was likely to suffer an allergic reaction to the administration of the drug. The suit averred that as a result of Dr. Dobson\u2019s negligence Mrs. Mulcare sustained bodily damage which ultimately resulted in her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">At trial in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County the appellee offered the testimony of Dr. Harold L. Hirsh, who is also a graduate of the American University, Washington College of Law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Hirsh was asked the question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">\u201c[A]re you familiar with the standard of care in existence in Prince George\u2019s County in May 1970 with respect to the administering of tetanus toxoid?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">An objection was immediately interposed by the appellants, and after <em>voir dire </em>and a colloquy with the court, the objection was sustained on the basis that while the doctor was \u201ca qualified internal medicine specialist,\u201d he was \u201cnot a general practitioner.\u201d The trial judge stated that he did not \u201cfeel\u201d that the witness was \u201csufficiently experienced as a general practitioner in the community of Brandywine to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>express an opinion in Prince George\u2019s County for an office practice and for that reason\u201d sustained the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">To support his position the trial judge cited <em>Dunham v. Elder, </em>18 Md. App. 360, 306 A. 2d 568 (1973) wherein we, after dischssing the several different rules applicable to the standard of medical skill and care that have been applied by courts in determining whether there has been a breach by physicians and surgeons of the standard required of them, noted that Maryland follows the,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201c . .. most restrictive rule, observed in a few jurisdictions ... that an expert medical witness must be familiar with the standard of care possessed and exercised by physicians in the defendant\u2019s own community or locality, the so-called \u2018strict locality rule\u2019.\u201d 18 Md. App. at 364.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">We concluded in <em>Dunham, </em>that in this State the plaintiff must demonstrate that \u201cthe defendant-physician failed to exercise \u2018the amount of care, skill and diligence as a physician and surgeon which is exercised generally <em>.. .in the community . . .in which he was practicing. </em>...\u201d 18 Md. App. at 364. <em>Kruszewski v. Holz, </em>265 Md. 434, 438, 290 A. 2d 534 (1972); <em>Nolan v. Dillon, </em>261 Md. 516, 534, 276 A. 2d 36 (1971); <em>State v. Fishel, </em>228 Md. 189, 195, 179 A. 2d 349 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The appellee noted a formal exception to the trial judge\u2019s ruling. The matter was reserved for determination by an <em>en banc </em>panel, and the trial continued. The reservation occurred on a Friday. The following Monday, the next court session, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">\u201c ... I had been doing a lot of reading and consider myself much more enlightened now'than I was the other day when I refused to let Dr. Hirsh testify as to the accepted practice in the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-10\">I was unfortunately, I believe, looking at what I personally thought of his ability as a practitioner of medicine, rather than his ability to understand and know the standard of care needed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>community, and I prohibited him from testifying as to the fact. I am convinced his qualifications are such he could have testified about it, and if you want to use him on rebuttal I will let him answer that one question. I just feel obligated to tell each of you two.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Appellee\u2019s counsel noted that Dr. Hirsh had departed for the Orient and would be gone for \u201cfour weeks\u201d. Whereupon the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">\u201cLet me say this to you, and I am not saying I am wrong in my previous ruling, and I place emphasis on this, that I wanted to get a trial with the most favorable consideration to the plaintiff. I am not convinced the Court of Special Appeals and/or the Court of Appeals wouldn\u2019t sustain my conclusion, based on the fact, I am of the opinion, for some substantial period of time he has become an educator rather than a practitioner of medicine, and I realize the basis for his expertise, apparently, was that he visited his classmate ... down at LaPlata a few times, and his practicing medicine in the City [Washington, D.C.], . . . could very readily be entirely different from Brandywine and the Waldorf area, Prince George\u2019s and Charles County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The case went to the jury without benefit of Dr. Hirsh\u2019s answer to the question directed toward Hirsh\u2019s familiarity with the standard of care existent in May 1970, in Prince George\u2019s County with respect to the tetanus toxoid injections. The jury found for the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The appellee filed a motion for a new trial. By the time the motion was heard our decision in <em>Raitt v. Johns Hopkins, </em>22 Md. App. 196, 322 A. 2d 548 (1974), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>274 Md. 489, 336 A. 2d 90, had been handed down. The trial judge denied the motion for a new trial, and the matter then proceeded before the <em>en banc </em>panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The panel consisted of Ralph W. Powers, Chief Judge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>the Seventh Judicial Circuit, and Judges Samuel W.H. Meloy and Joseph A. Mattingly. The majority of the panel, Judges Powers and Meloy <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> concluded that the trial judge had erred, and .they accordingly ordered a new trial. Appeal was entered to this Court from that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The appellee moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that no appeal lies from an order granting a new trial. They reason that inasmuch as the <em>en banc </em>panel granted a new trial, there is no appealable judgment to be reviewed by this Court. It is, of course, axiomatic that an appeal does not lie from an order granting a new trial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but the Court of Appeals has carved out an exception to the general rule, insofar as its applicability to <em>en banc </em>proceedings is concerned, and allowed such appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Recently, in <em>Buck v. Folkers, </em>269 Md. 185, 304 A. 2d 826 (1973), Chief Judge Murphy, after noting that the <em>en banc </em>panel had, on April 26,1972, remanded a case for a new trial, which new trial was held on October 2,1972, observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">\u201cWhile Buck, as the adverse party, was entitled under [the Constitution of Maryland] Article IV, \u00a7 22 to appeal from the en banc determination, . . . such an appeal, to be timely, must have been filed within thirty days after April 26, 1972. .. . Since it was not, we cannot take cognizance of the questions presented. ...\u201d 269 Md. at 187-88.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">As we read <em>Buck, </em>an adverse party in the <em>en banc </em>proceeding may appeal to this Court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from an order of the panel notwithstanding the fact that the order grants a new trial, and provided that the appeal is taken within the thirty days prescribed by Md. Rule 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Article IV, \u00a7 22 of the Constitution provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">\u201cWhere any Term is held, or trial conducted by less than the whole number of said Circuit Judges, upon the decision or determination of any point, or question, by the Court, it shall be competent to the party, against whom the ruling or decision is made, upon motion, to have the point, or question reserved for the consideration of the three Judges of the Circuit, who shall constitute a court in <em>banc </em>for such purpose; and the motion for such reservation shall be entered of record, during the sitting, at which such decision may be made; and the several Circuit Courts shall regulate, by rules, the mode and manner of presenting such points, or questions to the Court in <em>banc, </em>and the decision of the said Court in <em>banc </em>shall be the effective decision in the premises, and conclusive, as against the party, at whose motion said points, or questions were reserved; <em>but such decision in banc shall not preclude the right of Appeal, or writ of error to the adverse party, in those cases, civil or criminal, in which appeal, or writ of error to the Court of Appeals may be allowed by Law. </em>...\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The italicized portion of \u00a7 22 makes it crystalline that the adverse party in an <em>en banc </em>proceeding may appeal to this Court \u201cin those cases, civil or criminal,\u201d in which the appeal is \u201callowed by law.\u201d As we have seen (n. 3, <em>supra), </em>appeals from the granting of a motion for a new trial are not ordinarily \u201callowed by law\u201d, but <em>Buck </em>clearly stands for the proposition that the granting of a new trial by an <em>en banc </em>panel is immediately appealable. Therefore, the appellants are properly before us, and the appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is denied. We now turn to a discussion of the case on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>The law in this State is that whether a witness is qualified to testify as an expert is largely within the sound discretion of the trial judge, \u201cand unless such ruling is clearly erroneous or a clear abuse of discretion it will not be reversed on appeal.\u201d <em>Spence v. Wiles, </em>255 Md. 98, 102-03, 257 A. 2d 164 (1969). <em>See also Nizer v. Phelps, </em>252 Md. 185, 249 A. 2d 112 (1969); <em>Smith v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>240 Md. 525, 214 A. 2d 792 (1965); <em>Christ v. Wempe, </em>219 Md. 627, 150 A. 2d 918 (1959); <em>Beckner v. Chalkley, </em>19 Md. App. 239, 310 A. 2d 569 (1973); <em>Owens v. Creaser, </em>14 Md. App. 593, 288 A. 2d 394 (1972), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>267 Md. 238, 297 A. 2d 235 (1972); <em>Murphy v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019nrs, </em>13 Md. App. 497, 284 A. 2d 261 (1971). In the case presently before us, the majority of the <em>en banc </em>panel did find that the trial judge was.incorrect in his refusal to allow the testimony of Dr. Hirsh.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">A review of the record reveals that the appellants objected to the Hirsh testimony on the ground that it was proscribed by our holding in <em>Dunham v. Elder, supra, </em>in that Dr. Hirsh was unfamiliar with the. degree of care required of physicians engaged in the general practice of medicine in Prince George\u2019s County. The trial judge seemingly, as the majority of the <em>en banc </em>panel observed, \u201cconstrued <em>Dunham </em>as requiring the expert to have gained his knowledge by practicing or residing in the community involved.\u201d Furthermore, the trial judge noted that although Dr. Hirsh possessed a Maryland medical license, dating from 1969, the doctor had never had a private practice within this State except for a few occasions when he took over the practice, temporarily, of a fellow physician who was ill. Dr. Hirsh\u2019s internal medicine practice was essentially limited to the inhabitants of the District of Columbia with a few patients, however, traveling to Dr. Hirsh from nearby Maryland points. Dr. Hirsh possessed only temporary hospital privileges in this State, although he did frequent Maryland hospitals as a consultant on both infectious diseases and problems with antibiotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Chief Judge Orth in <em>Raitt v. Johns Hopkins Hospital, supra, </em>noted that <em>Dunham </em>had been misread and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>misconstrued. The Chief Judge pointed out, 22 Md. App. at 200, that <em>Dunham </em>does not hold that \u201cthe expert must have gained his knowledge by practicing or residing in the community involved.\u201d It was not, in order to establish Dr. Hirsh\u2019s expertise with respect to the standard of care required in the administration of an anti-tetanus \u201cshot\u201d in the Brandywine area of Prince George\u2019s County, necessary to show as a prerequisite that the doctor practiced or resided in that geographical region.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\"><em>\u201cDunham </em>is not to be read as other than following the rule firmly established by the Court of Appeals. When we pointed out in <em>Dunham </em>that the experts offered had never been licensed to practice in Maryland, and had never practiced in this State, treated patients, enjoyed privileges in any hospital in Maryland or maintained an office here, we were not impressing additional requirements on the qualifications required by an expert to testify on the matter of local care or skill. We were merely noting the background of the physicians involved; we were not holding that they could not be familiar with the standard of care or skill in the community unless they were licensed to practice in Maryland, and actually practiced, treated patients, maintained an office, and enjoyed hospital privileges in the locality. If the evidence is sufficient to show fairly to the reasonable satisfaction of the trial judge that the expert witness proffered is familiar with the local standard concerned, that witness, otherwise qualified, may testify as an expert with respect to the standard.\u201d 22 Md. App. at 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Appellants here argued that \u201c[c]ontrary to the <em>en banc </em>majority\u2019s opinion, . . . [the trial judge] did not base his holding solely upon Dr. Hirsh\u2019s lack of practical experience in Maryland. As is clear from his statements in the appellant\u2019s [sic] motion for a new trial, the trial judge only utilized Dr. Hirsh\u2019s lack of experience in Maryland as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>indication of his lack of familiarity with the local standards existent in Prince George\u2019s County in 1970.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The trial judge said at the hearing on the motion for a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\u201c . . . [Dr. Hirsh] decided to give up the practice of medicine full-time and go to law school and having done that, there is a serious question as to whether he continued to actively practice because since having graduated from law school and passing the Bar, he is now an educator teaching school and some medical-legal courses at Catholic University, American University and I believe Georg\u00e9town, maybe George Washington. And I believe teaching internal medicine possibly at Howard University Medical School.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">Now, the question that the Court had to resolve in this case is not whether or not Dr. Hirsh ever practiced medicine in the locality where he was called upon to testify, the issue is, whether or not he possessed the qualifications to testify as to the practice of a general practitioner in the Brandywine section of Prince George\u2019s County. The Court found originally at the trial after review of the <em>Dunham v. Elder </em>case and other Court of Appeals decision cases, ,the Court in exercise of its. sound discretion, determined that Dr. Hirsh\u2019s qualifications were at least suspect from the factual testimony and .the Court\u2019s observation qf his conduct during the trial. He was in the courtroom with: other experts .on behalf, of the Defendant and continuously assisted counsel, when I say continuously, quite.of ten.would from the audience, make suggestions to counsel and his law clerk for the Plaintiff regarding the trial. It was very obvious that'Mr. Hirsh\u2019 was -miniitely familiar\" with the princip\u00e1is involved and actually injected his relationship with Dr. Perrin J\u00e1rbo\u00e9 who , practices and has for years, practiced\u2019in L\u00e1Plata, Charles County which is not \"too distant-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>from Brandywine, Maryland, southern Prince George\u2019s County and indicated from time to time he had discussed Dr. Jarboe\u2019s patients with him during those visits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">The Court feels that that really is the factor that convinced me, after determining his present professional status as a lawyer-doctor or doctor-lawyer as to his objectiveness as an expert in the standards for a general practitioner in Brandywine, Maryland. The Court concludes that the facts that I am confronted with in this case are real tough as to letting the doctor testify or preventing him from testifying. The responsibility is mine in the exercise of sound discretion and the Court, in passing must observe that this having happened on Friday, determined on Saturday to contact the attorneys and in some indication that it might reverse itself on this ruling, suggested to Mr. Laake and Mr. Ehrmantraut that if Dr. Hirsh were to return, it\u2019s conceivable that the Court would permit him to testify. Dr. Hirsh, according to Mr. Laake, left for the Orient over the weekend, such was not possible, not to indicate that the Court was convinced that . . . [it] had in fact errored [sic] in preventing the testimony and I refer to the Court\u2019s observations. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">We think the trial court to have been misled by the fact that Dr. Hirsh is also a member of the Bar. In our view, that Dr. Hirsh may have made suggestions to appellee\u2019s counsel or counsel\u2019s law clerk is not sufficient reason to conclude that the doctor was not qualified to be an expert witness. While the doctor\u2019s aiding of trial counsel, in the presence of the jury, may have affected in the eyes of the jury the doctor\u2019s credibility as a witness, it certainly should not have prevented his testifying. Indeed, many expert witnesses confer with trial counsel prior to trial in order that counsel may become aware of the niceties of the expert\u2019s field, and thus gain some insight so as better to prepare a case for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>client with respect to both direct and cross-examination. If expert witnesses who consulted, advised and conferred with counsel prior to trial were precluded from testifying on the ground of loss of objectivity, there is not much likelihood of an expert\u2019s ever testifying unless counsel were willing to call a witness without having any concrete idea as to what the witness would say. Such a situation would be abhorrent to trial attorneys, and justifiably so. The difference between pre-trial suggestion and in-trial suggestion is a matter of degree, not kind. That Dr. Hirsh enjoys the right to practice more than one profession in no way, <em>per se, </em>lessens his expertise in either discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We conclude, as did the majority of the <em>en banc </em>panel, that the trial judge\u2019s rulings with respect to Dr. Hirsh\u2019s lack of expertise were error beyond the breadth of his discretion. The doctor\u2019s testimony was properly admissible and its improper exclusion constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Appellants also argue that even if the excluded testimony, were admissible, any error in excluding it is harmless because it was purely cumulative. There are two answers to that contention. First, the trial court itself noted that, testimony from another doctor who was a witness for the appellees did not \u201cjustify that [evidence] being in from Dr. Hirsh.\u201d Second, the evidence that was received from the local practitioner was offered for the purpose of demonstrating the local practice in regard to the inj\u00e9ction of the anti-tetanus serum. Dr. Hirsh\u2019s testimony was to show the appellant deviated from the acceptable local standard. <em>Ergo, </em>the testimony was not cumulative in that it was educed to accomplish entirely different goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">\n<em>Order of en banc panel granting a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-11\">. The record is silent as to whether Dr. Hirsh is a member of the Maryland Bar, but he has been licensed to practice medicine within the State since 1969.
