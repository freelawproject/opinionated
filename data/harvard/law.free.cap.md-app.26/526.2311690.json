Roland Brockmeyer, Assigned Public Defender, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-12\"><em>James I. Keane, Assistant Attorney General, </em>with whom were <em>Francis B. Burch, Attorney General, </em>and <em>J. Owen Wise, State\u2019s Attorney for Caroline County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b547-13\">Lowe, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">Oliver F. Perkins was convicted by a jury of the Caroline County Circuit Court for unlawful distribution of marijuana, conspiracy to violate the controlled dangerous substance laws and of maintaining a common nuisance. The indictment contained nine counts; five of distributing marijuana, one of conspiracy and three charging common nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">Appellant was arrested by warrant prior to the issuance of any indictment or information. A preliminary hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>thereafter resulted in a finding that there was insufficient evidence of probable cause to justify the detention of the accused on all but two counts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>viz. </em>4 and 5 charging distribution to Trp. Davis and conspiracy with Kermit Rogers. Despite the outcome of the preliminary hearing, the State three weeks later charged appellant by means of criminal information, Md. Rule 708 with the same series of crimes for which he was originally arrested. Appellant evidently preferred the result of the preliminary hearing and, when arraigned, pled only to Counts 4 and 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Two months later an indictment was handed down by the grand jury charging appellant with all nine counts, for each of which the petit jury found him guilty. The sentence imposed was three years on each of counts 2 and 3 to run consecutively and \u201cfine of $500.00 on each count; sentence suspended generally under remaining counts.\u201d It is thus obvious why appellant strenuously contends that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cI</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">Having chosen to charge the accused by criminal information and preliminary hearing, . . . the State [was] prevented by collateral estoppel from thereafter obtaining a grand jury indictment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The record does not reflect that appellant requested a preliminary hearing; however, he contends that having been granted one, the State is estopped from proceeding against him on any matters therein dismissed. Presumably, his reasons are grounded upon both double jeopardy which he raised by reference to <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U. S. 784 and collateral estoppel by reliance upon <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U. S. 436, and <em>Waller v. Florida, </em>397 U. S. 387. We find these last two authorities inapposite, however, since each deals with collateral estoppel to litigate an issue previously determined by a valid and final judgment between the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>parties. A preliminary hearing is obviously not a final judgment in any sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The double jeopardy argument, while equally unpersuasive, is not so readily dismissed, although both the Supreme Court and the Maryland Court of Appeals have decided that jeopardy does not attach to the findings of a district court at the preliminary hearing level. <em>United States v. Serfass, </em>420 U. S. 377, 43 LW 4315; <em>Wampler v. Warden, </em>231 Md. 639. Double jeopardy applies only after jeopardy has attached, <em>Cf. Blondes v. State, </em>273 Md. 435, and that occurs when the defendant is \u201cput to trial before the trier of the facts. . . <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U. S. 470. In <em>United States ex rel. Rutz v. Levy, </em>268 U. S. 390, 393, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cUnder state law it has uniformly been held that the discharge of an accused person upon a preliminary examination for want of probable cause constitutes no bar to a subsequent preliminary examination before another magistrate. Such an examination is not a trial in any sense and does not operate to put the defendant in jeopardy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In <em>Wampler, </em>231 Md. at 648 the Court of Appeals wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">\u201cMaryland practice has always, so far as we are informed, been in accord with the [Rutz] rule above stated; indeed this appears to be the first time that the rule has ever been challenged in this Court. The absence of any prior decision of this Court on the point indicates the long and general acceptance of the rule, for there have been many instances in which indictment and prosecution have followed the discharge of an accused person following a preliminary hearing before a magistrate. We adhere to the general and well settled rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">1 Wharton, <em>Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 137 is in accord:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">\u201cNo jeopardy arises when the first proceeding is merely a preliminary investigation which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>dismissed in favor of the accused, who is then later indicted in spite of such earlier disposition of the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">When charging a prospective defendant with a felony, other than a felony within the jurisdiction of the District Court, the State may proceed by way of criminal information, subject to the defendant\u2019s right to a preliminary hearing, Art. 27, \u00a7 592 (a). When an accused waives his preliminary hearing right by not requesting it within the prescribed 10 day period, Art. 27, \u00a7 592 (b) (1), or the preliminary hearing results in a finding of probable cause, the Prosecutor\u2019s information consummates the charging process. Md: Rule 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In the case at bar, the appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing resulted in the opposite finding: no probable cause and the dismissal of most charges. At that point the State was obviously without authority to charge a Circuit Court felony by way of information. Had the State left it at that, appellant might have had an argument. Apparently, however, the State realized its error and proceeded to obtain an indictment. Since the information coupled with a probable cause hearing is simply an alternative to grand jury indictment which the prosecutor may or may not choose to utilize, a deficiency in the information has no bearing on the validity of a subsequent indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In attempting to expedite criminal trials while preserving an accused\u2019s right to grand jury indictment \u2014 a process not acclaimed for expedition \u2014 the General Assembly by statute, Art. 27, \u00a7 592, and the Court of Appeals by Rules 708 and 709, enlarged the State\u2019s prerogative of charging by information, but tempered that authority with the prerequisite of a finding of probable cause at a preliminary hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>* or a waiver of that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Prior to the expansion of the State\u2019s information authority, the primary purpose of the preliminary hearing was to protect the accused from a unilateral decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>arrest with the accompanying likelihood of incarceration while awaiting grand jury action, or as the Court of Appeals phrased it, of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">\u201cinsuring him against being <em>committed </em>for action by the grand jury on charges which are groundless.\u201d [Emphasis added], <em>Williams v. State, </em>214 Md. 143, 154.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The liberal provisions which now exist for release of an accused on his own recognizance prior to trial, Art. 27, \u00a7 638A while not preventing the arrest, frequently prevent the commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">Conspiracy</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Appellant questions the sufficiency of the evidence to prove that a conspiracy existed between appellant and one Kermit Rogers. The difficulty arises from the exclusion of testimony of conversations with, and statements by, appellant\u2019s alleged co-conspirator. The exclusions left us with but inferential evidence of circumstances from which a jury could determine the existence of a conspiracy. <em>Jones v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 370, 377-378. The State\u2019s case included two segments of testimony from which an inference of conspiracy could arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">One undercover officer testified that he asked the alleged co-conspirator Rogers if he had any \u201cpot.\u201d An objection to the balance of the conversation was sustained; however, the witness was permitted to say that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">\u201cA conversation took place between the occupant of the vehicle that I was in [Rogers] and Mr. Perkins, concerning purchase of a quantity of marijuana.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>There followed an evidentiary colloquy among court and counsel which we omit. The witness then continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">\u201cA. After the conversation, Perkins went to the trunk of his \u2014 at the rear of his 1970 Pontiac and opened the trunk and removed a clear plastic bag, containing what appeared to be \u2014 appeared to me to be marijuana. And he got it from the trunk, he brought it over to the car and he handed it to me. And I was examining the contents of the bag and after looking at the substance, and I was pretty sure in my mi-nd it was, in fact, marijuana, I gave the Defendant, Mr. Perkins, $20.00 bill in US currency. And this took place approximately 7:50 P.M. And a short time after this transaction took place, contact with the Defendant was terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">Q. And how long were you and Mr. Perkins in each other\u2019s sight or in contact with each other on this date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">A. It was approximately five or ten minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">Q. Was there any particular reason you only paid him $20.00 on this occasion whereas you paid him forty the preceding week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">A. Well, because I only purchased one ounce of marijuana this time and the previous time, it was two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">Q. How far from your vantage point was the vehicle from which he obtained this substance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">A. He parked right adjacent to the vehicle that I was in. I was seated in the driver\u2019s side and he parked right next to the \u2014 to the driver\u2019s side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-13\">The Court: Did he recognize you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-14\">A. No sir, I don\u2019t believe he did. At the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-15\">The Court: This having been a customer on a prior occasion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-16\">A. Well, he \u2014 he knew other people that were in the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-17\">The Court: Knew other people in your car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">The Court: Well, who was in the car with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">A. Kermit Rogers was in the car and another person by the name of Anthony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">The Court: MMMm \u2014 He came over and spoke to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">A. Yes sir, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">The Court: What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-11\">A. Kermit \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">The Court: No, what did Perkins say to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-13\">A. Well, he was asked if he had any marijuana and the Defendant said, Yeh, how many do you want? And I told him just one. Meaning one ounce of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-14\">The Court: What did he say to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-15\">A. He then \u2014 he then \u2014 I can\u2019t remember what he said then, but he went to his \u2014 then he went to the rear of the Pontiac and opened the trunk and obtained the ounce of marijuana and brought it back over to me and at that time, I gave him the $20.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-16\">The second instance involved the testimony of another undercover officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-17\">\u201cA. On November 20th, I returned to Denton, Caroline County and was at the area known as Truxton\u2019s Bar, when I met with another subject, named Kermit \u2014 George Kermit Rogers. Mr. Rogers advised me that he did not have \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-18\">Mr. Hairston: Objection to what Mr. Rogers advised him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-19\">The Court: You can\u2019t testify to what Rogers said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-20\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-21\">The Court: At this point, anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-22\">Q. After talking to Mr. Rogers what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-23\">A. Drove to an address on High Street and Third here in Denton, Caroline County. I parked my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>vehicle next to a 1970 Pontiac that was the same vehicle that I had seen Mr. Perkins operate on November the 13th. At this time, Mr. Rogers got out of my vehicle, went into the residence \u2014 a residence where the Pontiac was parked. Mr. Rogers and Mr. Perkins walked out of the residence. Mr. Perkins went to the rear of the Pontiac, opened the trunk and the trunk light was on. I observed Mr. Perkins reach into a brown bag, bring up two plastic envelopes \u2014 plastic baggies \u2014 hand the two plastic baggies to Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers handed Mr. Perkins some money which Mr. Perkins put into his pocket. Mr. Perkins then took out the larg\u00e9 brown bag that had contained the plastic bags and took it into the residence and that was the last time I saw Mr. Perkins on that date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">These two instances provide sufficient circumstances from which a jury could properly find that a conspiracy existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">After defining conspiracy as \u201ca combination by two or more persons to accomplish a criminal or unlawful act, or to do a lawful act by criminal or unlawful means,\u201d [Chief] Judge Orth in <em>Jones v. State, </em>8 Md. App. at 377, 378 provided the answer to appellant\u2019s concern whether that evidence of conspiracy was sufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201cCombination results from an agreement. But conspiracy is the combination resulting from the agreement, rather than the mere agreement itself. However, there must be a meeting of the minds \u2014 a unity of design and purpose \u2014 to have an agreement, but it is not necessary that a formal agreement be shown. It need not be manifested by any formal words, written or spoken. \u2018It is enough if the parties tacitly come to an understanding in regard to the unlawful purpose, and this may be inferred from sufficiently significant circumstances, although evidence which merely creates suspicion will not be adequate.\u2019 <em>Perkins, supra, </em>at p. 530. In <em>Seidman v. State, </em>230 Md. 305, 322, the Court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u2018A conspiracy may be shown by circumstantial evidence from which an inference of a common design may be drawn and it is not necessary to demonstrate that the conspirators met and agreed in terms to a design and to pursue it by common means.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In <em>Lawrence v. State, </em>103 Md. 17, 22, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u2018Concurrence of action on a material point is sufficient to enable a jury to presume concurrence of sentiment, and from this the actual fact of conspiracy may be inferred.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">See also <em>Hill v. State, </em>231 Md. 458, 461, in which those principles of law were applied in finding that certain overt acts of concurrence of action by three persons, of whom defendant was one, on material points showed guilty knowledge on the part of the defendant, and that they were all acting in concert; <em>Boddie and Brooks v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 523; <em>Harper v. State, </em>supra; <em>Price v. State, </em>4 Md. App. 701.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">In the instant case the lower court could have properly drawn from the evidence before it an inference of a common design. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Appellant concludes his conspiracy issue by arguing that \u201c[t]his would not be a conspiracy since you cannot have a sale unless you have both a seller and a purchaser.\u201d Wharton\u2019s rule or the concert of action rule provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\"><em>\u201c &amp; </em>combination to commit an offense which can only be committed by the concerted action of two persons does not amount to conspiracy if only those two are involved.\u201d R. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>(2d ed.) at 620.<footnotemark>2A</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">Whether appellant\u2019s argument would be correct when considered in the abstract, it has nothing to do with his case. The alleged conspirators here were not the buyer and seller, but two sellers, appellant and Kermit Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Entrapment</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">We find it difficult to follow appellant\u2019s argument that he was a \u201cvictim of entrapment.\u201d Presumably he is contending that because the officers simulated smoking marijuana in his presence and an officer \u201clulled\u201d and \u201cbeguiled\u201d him into believing that the officer, like himself, acquired the smoking habit in Viet Nam, he was \u201centrapped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Appellant concedes that \u201cthe question of entrapment is a jury question.\u201d Apparently he recognizes that he had the initial burden of showing that the police did \u201cinduce the Defendant to commit the offense charged in the indictment . . .,\u201d <em>Simmons v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 355, 362, since he asserts that the State failed to meet its responsive burden, <em>viz., </em>to show that he had \u201ca predisposition to commit the offense . . . due to his own readiness. . . .\u201d <em>Simmons, supra. </em>Appellant then cites <em>Simmons, supra, </em>and <em>Byrd v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 391 as authority for his conclusion that this is a case wherein the \u201ccriminal design originates with the officials of the government, and they implant in the minds of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.\u201d <em>Sherman v. United States, </em>356 U. S. 369, 372. He would not merely persuade us as a matter of fact, but would also have us reach that conclusion as a matter of law, as was done in <em>Sherman. </em>However, in <em>Sherman, </em>the entrapment defense was considered on the basis of undisputed testimony and thus was established as a matter of law. We noted in <em>Simmons, supra, </em>on that very subject that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201cIn our jurisdiction, where the jury are the-judge of the law as well as the facts, we think that both questions pertaining to the issue of entrapment must be for the jury.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>8 Md. App. at 365, n. 7.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The two questions dealt with in <em>Simmons </em>were \u201c(1) did the appellant meet the burden of showing that he was induced by the police directly or through their agent to commit the offense? and (2) did the State meet its burden of showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>that the appellant\u2019s criminal conduct was due to his own readiness and not to the persuasion of the police or their agent?\u201d <em>Byrd v. State, </em>16 Md. App. at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The evidence submitted to the jury was clearly sufficient to permit a finding that either the appellant did not meet his burden or that the State did meet its. Appellant failed to show the requisite \u201crepeated and persistent solicitation of a previously law abiding citizen in order to overcome his reluctance to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Stewart v. State, </em>232 Md. 318, 321. As there was no inducement there was no entrapment and the conviction would be proper on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Even assuming that there was an inducement, we reach the same conclusion we did in <em>Simmons, </em>8 Md. App. at 367</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">\u201c[T]he evidence was sufficient for the trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had a predisposition to commit the offense \u2014 that he was ready and willing without persuasion and awaiting any propitious opportunity to sell marijuana. We believe it clear that the trier of fact could have properly found that the criminal conduct of appellant was not \u2018the product of the <em>creative </em>activity\u2019 of the police agent but that the police agent merely afforded opportunity for the commission of the offense. We have no difficulty in determining on which side of the line drawn between the trap for the unwary innocent and the trap for the unwary criminal appellant falls; he is on the side of the trap for the unwary criminal. Thus entrapment was not established and the conviction would be proper for this reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">Here appellant took the stand and admitted not only to the use of marijuana but that he sold it to friends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-9\">\u201cA. No, I never have. I feel that way because I\u2019ve been \u2014 I\u2019ve been smoking it for quite awhile and it never bothered me and I \u2014 I \u2014 and when I went to California, I just got the idea when I was there that it would be legalized because they had a petition at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the time that everybody signed before it legalized marijuana. So when I came back home I didn\u2019t hide the fact that I did smoke marijuana and I had some friends that would, you know, ask me if I had, you know \u2014 you know, occasionally or something like this and I would do it just for a friend\u2019s sake, not \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">The Court: Do you mean \u2014 you say you\u2019d do it, you mean let them have it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">The Court: That what you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">The Court: Would you give it to them or sell it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">A. I would give it to them, sir. If \u2014 if \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-11\">The Court: At $20.00 an ounce, you were giving it to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">A. Yes sir, \u2018cause that\u2019s what I give for it, sir. In other words, it was \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-13\">The Court: Would you give then an ounce or just a cigaret?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-14\">A. I would give \u2014 if they asked \u2014 whatever they asked, sir, if a friend, I would \u2014 I believe a person, the way I feel about people, if you\u2019re a friend of mine, if I call a friend, I would give it to you. I feel like if I could come up to you and ask you for $30.00, if I\u2019m a friend, if you have any faith in me, you would lend it to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">Such an admission is hardly compatible with the stance of a reluctant law abiding citizen being overcome by repeated and persistent solicitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">Lab Reports</p>\n<p id=\"b558-17\">Appellant asks \u201cWas the chemist\u2019s report admissible without a proper foundation being laid for admission of the confiscated goods?\u201d Since he had by stipulation agreed in open court to the admission of the lab reports the question is imprudently raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Appellant claims that the State\u2019s rebuttal argument was \u201cso improper and inflammatory as to prevent the jury from returning an impartial verdict.\u201d In the abstract, the argument may cause some concern. In context it appears less intemperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Appellant\u2019s complaints seem to fall into three categories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">1. The prosecutor\u2019s defense of the police officers on rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">2. The prosecutor\u2019s expressed concern for the \u201cruination of children . . . that get hung on marijuana and have to . . . find a way to pay ... to maintain the habit. . . .\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">3. The allusion to the sales to the police officers whom appellant \u201cthought were people like you and I, like our children and our brothers. He cold to them nevertheless and he would sell to your children or relatives just as quickly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">To gain perspective, we must first review the remarks appellant had made and to which the State was responding. Appellant\u2019s closing argument was long and detailed. It centered substantially around two issues, entrapment and the appellant\u2019s philosophy of selling only to friends. On the entrapment issue appellant commenced by attacking the police for \u201centicing people into committing\u201d crimes rather than enforcing the law. As the cresendo of attack rose and the accusations of inducement increased the record reflects that appellant\u2019s counsel physically pointed his accusing finger toward the officers. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-14\">\u201cThe trap was well laid. They used the people, they used the sympathy, they used everything at their disposal just to get someone across the line so they could hit him with a sledge hammer the moment he crossed the line. That\u2019s what\u2019s been done. It\u2019s said in a number of ways. It\u2019s said that we have police officers that have to engage in this kind of an activity. I suggest to you Ladies and Gentlemen it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>is not really a proper activity for the police officers of this State or any State to be enticing, to be inducing, to advocate, to even suggest, to even to say Can you break the law for me? This is what was said. Can you break the law for me? If that\u2019s the position that we want our police officers to be in, to say go out and break the law, I\u2019m asking you to do it, I\u2019m giving you a song and a dance, I\u2019m telling you lies. Did he tell any lies? To him? Sure he did. He said I went to Vietnam, I\u2019m a Patrol man, combat duty and I smoked some good strong stuff over there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">He depicted the actions of the police as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\"><em>\u201c a </em>guise, it\u2019s a ruse, it\u2019s a con job \u2014 it\u2019s a con job to get somebody to do something they wouldn\u2019t otherwise do. That\u2019s what it is. It is one great big con job to con this man into doing something \u2014 to con him into doing something that he wouldn\u2019t otherwise do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">When the State commenced to respond to that portion of appellant\u2019s argument it was interrupted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">\u201cMr. Wise: I find lately I \u2014 spend more time defending the police than I do prosecuting criminals and I wish to say a word or two to you for those who must remain silent and are unable to speak for themselves. The undercover men came into this County at the request of me and the Sheriff. They didn\u2019t just come into \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">Mr. Hairston: Objection, Your Honor, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any testimony on this and I think we\u2019re getting way beyond the scope of any permissible argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">The Court: I\u2019m going to overrule the objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">The objection came after the prosecutor stated that the undercover men came into the county at the request of the State\u2019s Attorney and the Sheriff. While the fact was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>not in evidence<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it was hardly prejudicially inflammatory. Judge O\u2019Donnell for the Court of Appeals said that a prosecutor in closing argument could draw upon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201c . . . Reasonable and legitimate inferences from the facts which had been offered in evidence, from the facts which were of such general notoriety as to be matters of common knowledge and matters with the cognizance of the jury from their own observations.\u201d <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 445.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The statement objected to gave us far less concern than the balance of the State\u2019s rebuttal argument although the latter came in without objection and for that reason, though argued on appeal, it is not properly before us. Our concern compelled that we review it, however, and in context that concern was somewhat assuaged. It reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">\u201cMr. Wise: The Defense Counsel would have you believe that the undercover narcotics men have nothing to do but go around and pick on poor people like Oliver Perkins. I assure you such is not the case. They had a reason to be here. The reason they were here is quite apparent in the nine charges which are before you. Obviously, there is a lot of illegal activity going on, and obviously, they perform their work very well. Rather than being chastised for good police work, I think they should be rewarded for it. The very purpose of having laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>and the purpose of having police is to prevent the violation of them. If you want police officers and law enforcement officers to sit around until some guy jumps off a building because he\u2019s blown his mind on marijuana, we can have that kind of law enforcement. Defense Counsel was worried about the Defendant and the ruination of his life. I think the Defendant has already ruined his life if you want to call it that. And I\u2019m worried about the ruination of the children, the young adults, teenagers, people that make $80.00 a week that get hung on marijuana and have to pay \u2014 to find a way to pay $20.00 an ounce to maintain the habit as Mr. Perkins has and which he admits to. I submit there\u2019s a very good reason why, even assuming Mr. Perkins wasn\u2019t making any profit on this \u2014 he was buying it for $20.00 and selling it for $20.00 \u2014 after you get a person hooked on marijuana or any other drug, he\u2019s got to have a source to keep it up. If you\u2019ve got a monopoly, then you can raise the price on it. And that\u2019s when you make your money. So there\u2019s a good motive why he would have been so-called doing this for free for his friends. Finally, so I won\u2019t detain you much longer, Defense Counsel has made much of the fact that if it were not for the police officers, this would not have happened. He raised that specific question to you. And I submit the answer is exactly what I am talking about and very disturbing to me and the reason why you shouldn\u2019t condone this. Mr. Perkins didn\u2019t know they were police officers, he thought they were people like you and I, like our children and our brothers. He sold to them nevertheless and he would sell to your children or relatives just as quickly. That is why 45 years or not, he belongs off the street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Appellant complains now (although he failed to do so at trial):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">1. First that \u201cthe State was asking the jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>bring in a verdict not based on innocence or guilt but as a reward to the police officers. . . .\u201d The phrase alluded to in context clearly dispels that inference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">2. That \u201cno where in the State\u2019s case is there any reference to other sales being made . . .\u201d but would confine the jury to his own testimony that he only sold to friends. While that fact has little relevance to the charge of distributing, it seems clear that the five sales to police officers gives rise to a permissible inference that appellant might sell to anyone.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Williams, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqg\">3. Finally appellant cites <em>Holbrook v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 265, 278 to dispel from us any notion that the State would be justified for its dramatizations or its deviations from evidentiary facts in responding to appellant\u2019s accusations, if not excesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201cWe cannot say that the argument of the prosecutor was justified because defense counsel \u2018was given considerable latitude in reading from Trial Magazine, relating their personal experience of the Bunny Club, reciting prayers of Benedictine Monks, and quoting poetry in their closing argument.\u2019 Nor can we find, on the record before us, that there was no ground for complaint because the improper remarks of the prosecutor were provoked by similar remarks of defense counsel or replied to in like manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">We recognize and repeat that provocation does not justify prejudicial excesses in response. Nor do we retreat from our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>refusal to accept the eye for an eye argument, <em>i.e., </em>because unwarranted latitude is given one it may be offset by allowing equal excesses to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Here, however, when the defense of entrapment is buttressed by appellant\u2019s seething attack on the police officers whose testimony comprised the State\u2019s case, to require the State to stand mute in the face of that attack would tend to imply that appellant\u2019s charges of, \u201cguise, ruse, con job ... lie used to induce . . . charade . . . trap . . . enticing people into committing [crimes] ... so they could hit him with a sledge hammer the moment he crossed the line,\u201d were well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Both appellant and the State went beyond the bounds of propriety, though neither went beyond the limitations set by <em>Holbrook, swpra. </em>A jury argument may be more persuasively delivered in quiet tones of equanimity, yet that is sometimes alien to our human capacities for outrage and indignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Having discussed the conspiracy, noted testimony of five sales of marijuana to police officers and referred to an admission of appellant that he sold to friends, it seems we need add little to fulfill the sufficiency requirement. We should note, however, that the appellant\u2019s automobile was the repository from which appellant extracted the marijuana each time he sold it, and it contained envelopes, bags and baggies used for packaging to sell. Such was the common nuisance maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">. Although the docket entry shows \u201c1974 Jan. 15\u201d Transcript of record from District Court charging (1) Marijuana distribution and (2) Conspiracy fd.\u201d, we assume the dismissal of all counts except 4 and 5 based on argument raised below on motion to dismiss and briefs here submitted and not contradicted by the State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\">A.

Williams, decided in 1957, and Wampler v. Warden, 231 Md. 639 decided May 15,1963 obviously were not discussing Md.

Nor were those cases discussing the present Art. 27, \u00a7 592 which was enacted in its present form in 1973, Ch. 840. The original \u00a7 592, discussed in the cases cited, was repealed by Acts 1953, Ch. 551, \u00a7 1. Its purpose was to permit charge by information but the procedure arose from the action of the accused who had to seek it by an elaborate petition.

It is ironic that appellant objects to facts not in evidence after discussing with the jury his personal experience, his private practice and a previous case, none of which were evidence or even relevant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">\u201cI was on vacation last week and I came back on Monday and a client of mine was a victim of assault and battery.

The phone was hung up on her, she was choked, taken in to \u2014 on assault and battery charge. The woman was convicted and given a $25.00 fine. That\u2019s Monday of this week.
