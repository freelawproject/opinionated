His conviction rests entirely upon a \u201cbase file\u201d which is an institutional record \u201ckept in the regular course of business of every inmate in every institution in the Division of Correction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">The base file in question showed that one Arvin Queen had been convicted of assault on December 24, 1970 and sentenced two months later to serve five years in prison. The file also contained a \u201cNotice of Escape\u201d indicating the \u201cDetails Relating to Inmate\u2019s Escape:\u201d to be \u201cWalked off from work assignment.\u201d That in itself is sufficient to form the corpus delicti of escape, outlined by Judge Menchine in <em>Robinson v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 438, 441-442:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">\u201c\u00a7 139 is a broadly based statute embracing within its purview <em>all escapes </em>from lawful confinement, whether the escape was initiated from within or without the walls or other boundaries of a penal facility; whether the confinement was actual or constructive; whether it was effected with or without force, and without regard to the circumstances of confinement if the detention was under color of law/\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>Accord, Fabian v. State, </em>3 Md. App. 270, <em>cert. denied </em>250 Md. 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The State, however, made even better use of that record. Apparently having no one available who could personally identify appellant, the State called upon the record custodian to compare the photograph in the record with the appellant, who had been arrested some two and one-half years after his departure. The State then asked the custodian:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">\u201cUsing that photo are you able to identify Mr. Arvin Queen? \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">To which the custodian replied,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">\u201cYes, I am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">The following colloquy ensued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-11\">\u201cIs he present in the courtroom today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-12\">A Yes, he is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-13\">MR. LOWMAN: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-14\">A Sitting at the defense table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-15\">COURT: Well, is this of your personal knowledge you can identify the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-16\">A I wasn\u2019t asked personal. I was to identify him from the picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-17\">COURT: Is that your objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-18\">MR. LOWMAN: That\u2019s my objection, Your Honor. The witness has no personal knowledge of who Mr. Queen is, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-19\">COURT: Well if he has a picture of Mr. Queen in the file he can identify him from that. It might be a misidentification but he can identify him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-20\">After that identification appellant questioned the custodian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>on cross-examination as to his personal knowledge of Queen\u2019s identity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201cOfficer Cunningham, at the time of this alleged escape were you in direct supervisory control of Mr. Queen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">A No, I was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">At that time did you know Mr. Queen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">A No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">Did you know him personally now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">A No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">Now the entries that have been introduced into evidence over objection did you make any of those yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-13\">A No, I did not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">Apparently recognizing some weakness in identification the State called the officer who had \u201cparticipated in returning . . . Arvin Queen to the Maryland House of Correction.\u201d The officer had gone with another to pick up Mr. Queen at the jail. He was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-15\">\u201cDid there ever come a time that Mr. Queen identified himself to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-16\">A No, he didn\u2019t identify himself to me because I stayed outside and Kershaw went inside and made the identification and took custody of him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">It was also brought out that the officer at a later date returned to the detention center to assure himself that he could identify appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-18\">\u201cAnd do you recall what the purpose of calling Mr. Queen to Center Hall was for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-19\">A Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-20\">Will you tell His Honor why you called Mr. Queen to Center Hall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>A To put a name with a face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">In other words so that you could see him to identify him today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">A By name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">Prior to October the 7th, 1974, did you know Mr. Queen personally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">And on the day that you say you were in Annapolis you could not, or you did not make any identification of Mr. Queen on that day, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">He did \u2014 he was not identified to you on that day, was he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-13\">So you really don\u2019t know who you picked up In Annapolis, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-14\">A We picked up Arvin Queen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-15\">Well is that based on the identification you made at the Maryland House of Correction on October the 7th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-16\">A Based on the identification of the man I brought back from Annapolis who I was assigned to go get.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-17\">But you find it necessary to have a meeting with him so that you could see prior to this morning, earlier this month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-18\">A To affiliate the name with the face, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-19\">Well prior to October the 7th could you have identified Arvin Queen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-20\">A To October 7th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-21\">Prior to the meeting in Center Hall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-22\">A I could identify him by the face, not by name, no.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Upon objection the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u201cCOURT: Well, I don\u2019t think whether he identifies his face here today is even relevant because he has testified that he picked up one Arvin Queen and returned him to the Institution in May of 1974 and whether he points him out on the stand today is really not too significant. But if it would make you feel better I\u2019ll strike the visual identification since I don\u2019t think he really had the visual identification based on what he saw on May the 26th, 1974 but rather on what he saw in the Institution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201cMR. DRYDEN: Your Honor, just for clarity then, the testimony in which he identified him that he picked up a person named Arvin Queen in Annapolis \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201cCOURT: No, that is not stricken. That is still admissible. That is not stricken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">As its ultimate effort the State now argues that Queen\u2019s appearance in court served as sufficient identification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">\u201c . . . the identity of the individual at trial was established prior to the taking of any testimony when appellant\u2019s case was called for trial.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Treating the identity contentions inversely, we find precious little merit in any, but no merit in the latter. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Appellant was present in court when his case was called because he was <em>brought </em>to court still in the custody of gaolers. His attorney\u2019s plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d placed in issue every element of the crime including appellant\u2019s identity as the \u201cArvin Queen\u201d who had escaped from custody two years prior. The issue of identity must be settled before that of guilt becomes relevant. <em>United States v. Hecht, </em>22 F. 2d 264, 265. Certainly the \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea may not be said to waive the State\u2019s burden of proving a defendant\u2019s identity, <em>Cf. Jones v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 420, <em>cert. denied </em>260 Md. 721. Had appellant stood mute <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court would undoubtedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>have interposed such a plea. Md. Rule 721. <em>Accord, </em>Hochheimer\u2019s <em>Criminal Law, </em>(2nd Ed.) \u00a7 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">This leaves the State with but two sources of identification: the police officer who transported appellant from one jail to another and the custodian who compared appellant to a picture in a record.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The police officer admitted that he did not know Arvin Queen; however, the judge permitted him to testify that \u201che picked up a person named Arvin Queen in Annapolis . . . .\u201d This was clearly insufficient as attested by his responses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\u201cAnd on the day that you say you were in Annapolis you could not, or you did not make any identification of Mr. Queen on that day, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">He did \u2014 he was not identified to you on that day, was he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">A No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Thus we are left with the custodian\u2019s opinion that appellant and the base file photograph are one and the same person. However that opinion, expressed without a foundation properly laid, usurped the function of the trier of fact by precluding the factfinder from testing the opinion by its own comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">The base file record, identified as made in the course of business, was not offered pursuant to Cts. Art., \u00a7 10-101 (formerly Art. 35, \u00a7 59) but was dissected and submitted sheet by sheet as the State deemed relevant. These sheets included the commitment of Arvin Queen, dated February 25, 1973, and Mr. Queen\u2019s \u201cEmployee\u2019s Initial Escape Report,\u201d dated December 14, 1971. The State did <em>not </em>introduce the \u201cbase files . . . photo[s] of the records to whom [it] pertainfed],\u201d from which the custodian expressed his identification opinion by comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>In <em>Goodman v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 473 [Chief] Judge Orth faced similar testimony of a conclusion drawn by a custodian witness from business records of a telephone company. Ironically, there the State attempted \u201cto prove that James R. Barton, M.D. <em>did not exist. . . .\u201d </em>[Emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Judge Orth wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201cMd. Code, (1965 Repl. Vol.), Art. 35, \u00a7 59 provides that any writing or record made as record of any act, transaction, occurrence or event in the regular course of any business shall be admissible in evidence in proof of said act, transaction, occurrence or event. All circumstances of the making of such record, including lack of personal knowledge by the entrant or maker, may be shown to affect the weight but not the admissibility thereof. The rule applies in criminal as well as civil cases. <em>Lauder v. State, </em>233 Md. 142; <em>Dunn v. State, </em>226 Md. 463. The statute permits the introduction of business records even though hearsay in nature, when the entry meets the test of \u2018necessity and circumstantial guaranty of trustworthiness.\u2019 <em>Morrow v. State, </em>190 Md. 559, 562. Summaries or compilations made from such records may be admissible, when a proper foundation has been laid by a qualified witness on the stand. <em>O\u2019Donnell v. State, </em>188 Md. 693. A witness called to the stand and qualified, <em>after records have been put into evidence, </em>may testify as to his conclusion therefrom. <em>Smith v. Jones, </em>236 Md. 305. In the instant case, however, the records were not in evidence. The witness was asked, \u2018(W)hat do your records show about this telephone? \u2019 and his reply indicated <em>his conclusion </em>as to what they showed. It does not appear that he lead directly from the records. We do not think that the exception to the hearsay rule, permitted by the statute, goes this far. See <em>Jones v. State, </em>205 Md. 528. We feel that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the trial court erred in allowing the testimony in evidence, although the records themselves may have been admissible. Once admitted, the witness, if properly qualified, could have testified as to his conclusion ' therefrom.\u201d [Emphasis added], <em>Goodman, </em>2 Md. App. at 476-477.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We apply the same rule here. Had the State introduced the base file containing the photograph into evidence the conclusion from the comparison would have been subject to further comparison by the trier of the facts. That not having been done, the custodian\u2019s comparison opinion was clearly inadmissible and other evidence of identity was so sparse as to hardly justify the term minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">While an escape trial is often an uncomplicated proceeding, we think it not too much to ask that the State identify the defendant as the escapee. The far better practice, of course, is to have the identification made by one who knows him to be the person accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">\n<em>Case remanded for retrial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-12\">. The State refers to appellant\u2019s appearance in court and his appointed attorney\u2019s response when Queen\u2019s case was called:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-13\">\u201cMR. DRYDEN: Next, Your Honor, the State would call Criminal No. 15,968, Arvin Queen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-15\">COURT: Alright, Mr. Queen, are you familiar with the charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-17\">MR. LOWMAN: Yes, Your Honor, Mr. Queen is familiar with the charge and he understands he is charged with escape. He is aware of his right to a jury trial and elects to be tried before this court, waiving the right to a jury trial, and at this time, Your Honor, we would enter a plea of Not Guilty to the charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\">. When a prisoner obstinately stood mute as opposed to <em>ex visitatio7ie Dei </em>(by the visitation of God) the old courts of England were less understanding in their proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201cPenalty for obstinately standing mute. \u2014 If he be found to be obstinately mute (which a prisoner hath been held to be that hath cut out his own tongue), (k) then if it be on an indictment of high treason, it hath long been clearly settled, that standing mute is an equivalent to a conviction, and he shall receive the same judgment and execution. <em>(1) </em>And as in this the highest crime, so also in the lowest species of felony, viz.: in petit larceny, and in all misdemeanors, standing mute hath always been equivalent to conviction. But upon appeals and indictments for other felonies, or petit treason, the prisoner was not, by the ancient law, looked upon as convicted, so as to receive judgment for the felony; but should, for his obstinancy, have received the terrible sentence of <em>penance </em>or <em>peiTTe </em>(which, as will appear presently, was probably nothing more than a corrupted abbreviation of <em>prisone) forte et dure </em>(strong and hard).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">Before this was pronounced the prisoner had not only <em>trina admonitio </em>(a third warning), but also a respite of a few hours, and the sentence was distinctly read to him, that he might know his danger; (m) and, after all, if he continued obstinate, and his offence was clergyable, he had the benefit of his clergy allowed him, even though he was too stubborn to pray it. (n) Thus tender was the law of inflicting this dreadful punishment; but if no other means could prevail, and the prisoner (when charged with a capital felony) continued stubbornly mute, the judgment was then given against him without any distinction of sex or degree. A judgment, which was purposely ordained to be exquisitely severe, that by that very means it might rarely be put in execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">.... The English judgment of penance for standing <em>(u) </em>mute was as follows: that the prisoner be remanded to the prison from whence he came, and put into a low, dark chamber; and there be laid on his back, on the bare floor, naked, unless where decency forbids: that there be placed upon his body as great a weight of iron as he could bear, and more; that he have no sustenance, save only, on the first day, three morsels of the worst bread; and on the second day, three draughts of standing water, that should be nearest to the prison door; and in this situation this should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>alternately his daily diet <em>till he died, </em>or (as anciently the judgment ran) <em>till he answered, (v)\u201d </em>II <em>Cooley\u2019s Blackstone, </em>(4th Ed.) at 1473-1475.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
