[should lack] in a free society.\u201d Indeed, the right to counsel was thought of so strongly by this country\u2019s founding fathers that they provided in the Sixth Amendment, a part of \u201cthat classic inventory of human rights, the Bill of Rights\u201d,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused shall ... have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d It has been over two hundred years since John Adams uttered his words relative to the right to counsel, but the question of an accused\u2019s having counsel at trial still plagues us. <em>See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U. S. 335, 344, 83 S. Ct. 792, 93, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, 805, 93 A.L.R.2d 733 (1963); <em>Manning v. State, </em>237 Md. 349, 206 A. 2d 563 (1965); <em>State v. Diggs, </em>24 Md.

At that time a County Police officer observed four men in the rear of the Holiday Inn. Paul Everette Bruce, the appellant, was identified by the officer as one of the four men, and more particularly, the man who was the driver of the motor vehicle in which the four left the area. It was later ascertained that a television set had been stolen from the Holiday Inn. An investigation by the police led to charges being lodged against the appellant for \u201couthouse\u201d breaking.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">When Bruce was arraigned in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on August 29,1974, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Paul Bruce and Leroy Griffin. Which one is Paul Bruce?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">BRUCE: lam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">THE COURT: How old are you, Mr. Bruce?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">BRUCE: Twenty-nine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">THE COURT: And, Mr. Griffin, how old are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsR\">GRIFFIN: Thirty-one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">THE COURT: Have you gotten a copy of the charges against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">BRUCE: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">GRIFFIN: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-12\">THE COURT: Do you understand what you\u2019re charged with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-13\">BRUCE: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-14\">GRIFFIN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-15\">THE COURT: Breaking into the Holiday Inn building on Belmont Avenue, western part of Baltimore County, and stealing a color television set, a twenty-one inch Westinghouse. The charge is breaking and entry of the Holiday Inn room and stealing a television set. Do you have a lawyer, Mr. Bruce?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-16\">BRUCE: Not now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-17\">THE COURT: Do you work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-18\">BRUCE: I\u2019m in school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-19\">THE COURT: Where do you go to school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-20\">BRUCE: RETS Electronics School, Russell Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-21\">THE COURT: How about you, Mr. Bruce, who do you live with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-22\">BRUCE: Live with my wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-23\">THE COURT: She work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-24\">BRUCE: Yes, she does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-25\">THE COURT: Why haven\u2019t you gotten a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACV\">BRUCE: I\u2019m supposed to take a polygraph test September the 3rd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>THE COURT: Who told you that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">BRUCE: Officer Snyder and Hopkins.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">MR. SAUER [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, that test was scheduled for July the 1st, the defendant failed to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">BRUCE: I was in traffic court that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">THE COURT: Your address 3503 Plateau Avenue? BRUCE: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">THE COURT: You\u2019re 4114 Bell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">GRIFFIN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-11\">THE COURT: The police must have grave doubts as to the guilt of Paul Bruce if they\u2019re still talking in terms of giving him a lie detector test. Whose idea was that, does that file reflect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-12\">MR. SAUER: I\u2019ll look, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-13\">THE COURT: Whose idea was it about this lie detector test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-14\">BRUCE: Officer Hopkins and Detective Sergeant \u2014 I don\u2019t know his last name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-15\">THE COURT: Well, I can\u2019t see much excuse for Griffin not getting a lawyer, but, I think that if the police were volunteering to give me a lie detector test which might very well lead to the abandonment of the charge against me I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019d rush out and get a lawyer. You have a car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-16\">BRUCE: Yes, \u201974 Oldsmobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-17\">THE COURT: Where did you get the money? You\u2019re going to RETS?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-18\">BRUCE: My wife and I got it through the Community Action Agency in Baltimore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-19\">THE COURT: You got a car through the Community \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-20\">BRUCE: No, my wife is working, she\u2019s a psychiatric nurse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-21\">THE COURT: Well, you both have to get your own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>lawyers. You\u2019ve gotten copies of the charges against you, you both understand what you\u2019re charged with. The Court rules that as long as each one of you have a 1974 automobile and that you\u2019re not eligible for a lawyer at the taxpayer\u2019s expense you\u2019ll have to get your own lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">BRUCE: But, your Honor, can I say something? If my innocence can be proven on the 3rd of September why should I get a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">THE COURT: Fine, if it\u2019s proved, if the State finds out that you\u2019re innocent on the 3rd of September then you won\u2019t need a lawyer, but, if you don\u2019t receive exoneration, if they don\u2019t drop the charge against you and it comes to trial you may need a lawyer and if you do that\u2019s your problem, you\u2019re going to have to get one. All I\u2019m telling you is that if there\u2019s to be a lawyer to represent you you\u2019re the one going to have to get it, not the Public Defender. The Public Defender will not get you a lawyer and their regulations wouldn\u2019t permit it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Subsequently, Bruce appeared before another judge on September 27,1974. At that time the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: . .. Are you Paul Everette Bruce?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVA\">BRUCE: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">THE COURT: Where is your lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-11\">BRUCE: I don\u2019t have one yet. I haven\u2019t retained one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-12\">THE COURT: <em>Do you want to represent yourself ? </em>BRUCE: <em>No.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\">THE COURT: Well, your trial is going to be called. BRUCE: Well, Your Honor, as I told [the judge], I was not employed. I was in electronics school and it is a federally funded program. I don\u2019t have a job. I am just going to school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-14\">THE COURT: What did you say? Would you repeat that, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>MR. BRUCE: That I am in electronics school and it is a federal funded program and they pay you as you go to school. That is the only employment that I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">THE COURT: He told you you had to employ counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">BRUCE: Yes, because I was driving a new car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">THE COURT: <em>You have not employed counsel so you are ready to go to trial, now; are you not?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">BRUCE: <em>No, sir. I am going to try to, my wife and I, to get the money to get an attorney.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">THE COURT: But, we gave you an opportunity, both of you, to employ counsel. So, you had your Constitutional Right to counsel. You chose not to hire one. Are you ready to proceed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">BRUCE: Yes, but I want to retain [counsel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">THE COURT: Well, you have already had an opportunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">BRUCE: I didn\u2019t have the money then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-13\">THE COURT: Well, that was determined at the hearing of August 29....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">BRUCE: Yes, but my wife wouldn\u2019t be able to get a loan until maybe two weeks from now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-15\">THE COURT: You have already been given a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-16\">BRUCE: Yes, but she has to get it through the Credit Union. She has her card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-17\">THE COURT: Yes, but neither one of you notified the State\u2019s Attorney and he has his witnesses here today ready for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-18\">BRUCE: I never even got a summons to come to Court today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-19\">THE COURT: You knew it would be assigned for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-20\">BRUCE: Yes, sir, I knew but I never got a summons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>THE COURT: Well, we can proceed with trial. You both seem to be intelligent young men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">BRUCE: Your Honor, I would like to ask for a jury trial if it is possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">THE COURT: I beg your pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">BRUCE: I would like to ask for a jury trial if it is possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">THE COURT: Well, I have not gotten down to that point yet. I am trying to settle the point of counsel. After hearing all of the information, what does the State wish to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">MR. SAUER: Well, Your Honor, the State is prepared today with its witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-11\">THE COURT: Yes, you have said that earlier. I realize the witnesses are in Court but I don\u2019t know who they are or what they consist of. What do you suggest now that you have heard the statements of the Defendants?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">MR. SAUER: The State is prepared for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-13\">THE COURT: I realize you are prepared for trial. What do you suggest insofar as the Defendants are concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-14\">MR. SAUER: Well, they are not represented by counsel, Your Honor. There is no requirement \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM6\">THE COURT: Do you suggest that we try it now or postpone it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-15\">MR. SAUER: The State is ready to try it right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-16\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-17\">THE COURT: .. . Now, Mr. Bruce, you have a Constitutional Right to a trial by a jury, and that means you could not be convicted without the unanimous consent of every member of the jury. You also have a right to be tried by a judge. What is your desire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-18\">BRUCE: Jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-19\">THE COURT: You pray a jury trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-20\">BRUCE: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>THE COURT: All right. I suggest that we go ahead with the jury trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">MR. SAUER: The State has its witnesses here. The State would like to proceed in that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">THE COURT: I say, couldn\u2019t the Judge that hears the jury trial try them both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">MR. SAUER: Well, Your Honor, one is jury and one is nonjury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">THE COURT: Yes, but he hears the facts before the jury and he can pick up the nonjury case right after; could he not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">MR. SAUER: That is correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">THE COURT: I think that if he could hear the same witnesses, hear the jury trial and then hear the nonjury trial right after it \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">MR. SAUER: Very well, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">THE COURT: Some inquiry ought to be made if we can do it today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">MR. SAUER: Your Honor, in the hypothetical sense, if there is no jury trial or no jury available today\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">THE COURT: ... There may or may not be a jury, so inquiry can be made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-15\">MR. SAUER: I will make that right now, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-16\">THE COURT: You gentlemen wait here in Court until something is determined on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-17\">BRUCE: Your Honor, is it okay if I call my wife so that she can make arrangements to have the lawyer here before the jury trial starts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-18\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-19\">(Proceedings suspended.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-20\">MR. SAUER: Your Honor, the matter of Bruce and Griffin, it is my understanding that both Defendants wish to proceed nonjury. The Defendant changed his mind, so the State would be prepared to try both cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>THE COURT: The witnesses are not excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">MR. SAUER: I have not excused any witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdH\">(Whereupon, the case was transferred ... for trial.) \u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">After waiver of jury trial, the third judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right; I\u2019ll accept your waiver of a jury trial. It has already been determined . .. that you should have employed your own counsel and therefore, you are to represent yourself. Be seated; listen to the testimony. You have the right to cross-examine the witnesses; do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">BRUCE: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">GRIFFIN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">THE COURT: All right; sit down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Bruce was sentenced to three years imprisonment and has appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">As we see it, Bruce was denied both his federal and state constitutional right to be represented by counsel. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County was wrong and must be reversed. Maryland Rule 719 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-13\">\u201ca. <em>How Made.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-14\">Arraignment shall be conducted in open court and shall consist of reading the indictment to the accused or stating to him the substance of the charge and calling on him to plead thereto. The accused shall be furnished a copy thereof as soon as practicable after it shall have been prepared and in any event within a reasonable time before he is called upon to plead, and at the expense of the prosecuting authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-15\">b. <em>Appointment of Counsel.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-16\">1. Advice by Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-17\">If at any stage of the proceeding, the accused appears in court without counsel, the court shall advise him of his right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>2. When Required \u2014 Conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\"><em>Unless the accused waives his right to be represented by counsel or is financially able to obtain counsel, </em>the court shall request the Office of the Public Defender to designate or appoint counsel to represent the accused if the offense charged is a serious crime, as defined in Code, article 27A (Public Defender).\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The State vigorously argues that Md. Ann. Code art. 27A, \u00a7 2 (f) mandates that in order for the trial court to request the Public Defender to designate or appoint counsel, there must be a finding that the accused is \u201cindigent\u201d. The accused, as the State sees it, must, on oath or affirmation, subscribe and state in writing that he is financially unable, without undue hardship, to provide for the full payment of an attorney and all other necessary expenses of legal representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The State then suggests that \u201cat no time throughout the arraignment or the trial proceedings did the appellant allege he was unable to afford private counsel nor did he request the services of the Public Defender nor did he take exception to the finding of the trial court that he was not indigent.... Thus the issue is not properly before this Court. . . Md. Rule 1085.\u201d The record, however, reveals that Bruce clearly expressed to the second judge Bruce\u2019s desire to be represented by counsel, and that he did not want to represent himself. We interpret Bruce\u2019s remark as an \u201cobjection\u201d, and thus a preservation of the issue for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">A reading of the above quoted portions of the first transcript demonstrates that the first judge was led to the conclusion that Bruce could afford to retain private counsel because of Bruce\u2019s \u201cownership\u201d of a 1974 Oldsmobile. No effort was made by the first judge nor his successors to inquire into the extent of the \u201cownership\u201d. It may be that Bruce owned the motor vehicle absolutely, or that he owned it with his wife or another. It may be that the vehicle was so heavily encumbered that the \u201cownership\u201d amounted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>little more than mere fiction. The record does not disclose enough facts for one to conclude that Bruce was or was not able to retain private counsel. Hence, the first judge\u2019s decree relative to Bruce\u2019s right to appointed counsel was obviously founded on shifting sand rather than a concrete base. In short, there was not enough data available to make a sound judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The State, on oral argument, contended that the first judge\u2019s decision did not deprive Bruce of his right to seek the services of the Public Defender. The State reasons that if Bruce felt the judge was wrong, he should have gone to the Public Defender and, for himself, ascertained his qualification, <em>vel non, </em>for those services. We do not see it in the same light. When the first judge told Bruce that Bruce could not, at public expense, have counsel appointed, there would be little likelihood that Bruce would dispute that holding and set out to determine whether the judge was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Patently, Bruce did not waive his right to an attorney. This is demonstrated by the fact that Bruce told the second judge of Bruce\u2019s desire to have an attorney, but the second judge was unfortunately lured into the same erroneous path as the first judge. By the time the matter reached the third and final judge, the die was cast. The trial judge, without knowing of the precise nature of the prior happenings, proceeded on the theory that there had been a proper determination that Bruce did not qualify for the services of the Public Defender. We have then before us a \u201cTinker to Evers to Chance\u201d play, but unlike that well-known infield trio, in this case everybody dropped the ball.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\">.
