It came into being in 1905 upon the admission to probate of the will and two codicils thereto.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> About 1913 the administration of the trust was placed under the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, and remains there to this day. See Docket 53A (1913), folio 169, <em>et sequentia. </em>The will was twice judicially construed. <em>Ryan v. Herbert, </em>186 Md. 453, decided 15 May 1946, and <em>Weller v. Sokol, </em>271 Md. 420, decided 15 April 1974. By Item Tenth of the will, the trust ceased on 24 September 1972 upon the death of Arthur Nattans II as the last survivor of the testator\u2019s eight children. The matter of compensation and allowances to the trustees appears to be the last impediment to a closing of the trust estate, and, hopefully, when it is finally resolved, the trust will be laid to rest once and for all.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The sole asset of the trust created by Item Sixth of the will consisted of all of the stock owned by the testator of the Read Drug and Chemical Company of Baltimore City, now Read\u2019s Inc., consisting of 396 shares of the 400 shares outstanding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The stock was bequeathed to three named trustees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The will assured that there would be three trustees during the life of the trust by providing for the appointment of a successor trustee to take the place of any one of the trustees named or of any one of their successors who died or resigned. On 3 June 1974 the trustees filed a petition praying the passage of an order allowing them commissions for their services from' 24 September 1972 to final distribution and compensation for making final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>distribution. On 12 June 1974 the chancellor sent counsel a letter opinion giving his views as to the compensation to be paid and allowances made. He directed counsel for the trustees to prepare an order in accordance therewith, to send a copy to counsel for all parties and to those parties not represented, and to submit the order to the court for execution after reasonable notice had been given. On 3 July Forrest F. Bramble, Jr., Esq. and Delverne A. Dressel, Esq. filed a petition for the passage of an order authorizing the trustees to pay them a reasonable counsel fee. The petition set out that they were employed by the trustees to assist and advise the trustees with respect to the proper distribution of the trust estate. On the same date Sokol and Eliasberg, as two of the trustees, filed a petition for the passage of an order allowing counsel fees out of the proceeds of the trust estate to be paid to Dressel and Paul E. Burke, Jr., Esq. The petition stated that Bramble, one of the counsel for the three trustees, was unable to fully represent the interest of all of them in connection with the allowance of proper compensation for their services as trustees because Solomon, the third trustee and also a beneficiary under the trust, although agreeing to accept such compensation for his services as the court determined to be reasonable and proper, unlike Sokol and Eliasberg, had not suggested any measure of compensation, declined to participate actively in any hearing in connection with commissions, and refused to testify on behalf of the trustees. Therefore, Eliasberg engaged the services of Burke, and Sokol engaged the services of Dressel to represent them with respect to allowance of commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">On 5 July 1974 the chancellor issued an order. The trustees were (a) \u201callowed a commission payable out of income in an amount equal to 5% of the income of the trust from September 24, 1972 through July 15, 1974 as compensation for their labor and responsibility during such period\u201d; (b) denied additional commissions; and (c) \u201cauthorized to pay out of income the sums of $10,075 and $8,686.32 to their counsel for services rendered as set forth in the petitions for payment of counsel fees.\u201d All parties were content with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>commissions allowed, at least to the extent that no challenge was made to them. Sokol and Eliasberg, however, were aggrieved by the denial of additional commissions and noted an appeal seeking to set aside that part of the order. Certain of the beneficiaries under the trust, although not questioning the payment of $10,075 as counsel fees, were unhappy with that part of the order with respect to the authorization to pay additional counsel fees of $8,686.32 to Burke and Dressel and filed a cross-appeal to have the order in that regard reversed. Thus, there is before us the propriety of the denial of the trustees\u2019 request for additional commissions and of the allowance of $8,686.32 as counsel fees as reflected in the issues for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\n<em>THE FIRST ISSUE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A9U\">\n<em>The Will</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The will expressly fixed the compensation of the trustees originally named and their successors from time to time. Item Seventh read in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">\u201cThe said trustees shall receive for their services as such the usual commission of five per cent upon the annual income of said trust estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">By Item Ninth, successor trustees were given \u201call the powers and duties together with the compensation as above provided in reference to the three trustees appointed by this will.\u201d The will was otherwise silent regarding compensation of the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Considering the provisions in the will with respect to compensation to the trustees under the firmly established principles controlling in the construction of wills, see <em>Veditz v. Athey, </em>239 Md. 435, 448, and cases cited therein, and bearing in mind that what the testator meant must be gathered from what he said in his will, as viewed from the standpoint he occupied at the time of its execution, see <em>Boyd v. Boyd, </em>24 Md. App. 497, 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">We think that the testator intended that 5% upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>annual income of the trust estate was to be all the compensation the trustees were to receive. In so construing the will we look to the status of the law at the time it was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\n<em>Compensation Allowed by Custom and Law Prior to 1939</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Prior to 1939 there was no statutory provision for compensation to conventional trustees. The question as to commissions to be allowed testamentary trustees for services rendered was presented in <em>Abell v. Brady, </em>79 Md. 94 (1894). The Court said, at 97-98:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cIt can hardly be necessary to say that in England no allowance is made, by way of compensation, to one holding a fiduciary relation for services rendered by him in the discharge of his duty as trustee, unless the instrument creating the trust provides for the payment of compensation. The principle on which the rule is founded, it has been said, is that he shall not make a profit out of his trust; and the reason of the principle is that he shall not be placed in a position where his interest may be opposed to his duty. The office of a trustee was considered as being one of honor and conscience, and having been selected by reason of some special confidence arising from the ties of kindred or friendship, he was presumed to have accepted it voluntarily from a sense of duty, and not with a view to pecuniary gain or profit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\"><em>Sanderson v. Pearson, 45 Md. 483, 484; Northern Central R. Co. v. Keighler, </em>29 Md. 572, 579; <em>Ringgold v. Ringgold, </em>1 H. &amp; G. 11, 83-84. The Court in <em>Abell </em>pointed out, however, that this rule, with the exception of two or three States, had never been adopted in this county. 79 Md. at 98. Maryland had not adopted it. In <em>Ringgold </em>it was contended that the court was not competent to allow commissions as compensation to a trustee for his trouble. The court thought otherwise. It believed that upon an equitable construction of the statutes allowing commissions to executors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>administrators and guardians and the principles on which those statutes were based, compensation ought to be allowed to a conventional trustee as a reasonable and just indemnity for services rendered by him in the discharge of his duties as trustee. 1 H. &amp; G. at 84.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court stated in <em>Abell, </em>at 99, that as to conventional trustees, \u201cthe rule ordinarily is to allow 5 per cent upon the income.\u201d The Court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">\u201cBut this rule is by no means an inflexible rule. In prescribing the rate of commissions, courts will take into consideration the nature and character of the trust estate, and the time and labor required of the trustee in the execution of the trust. The estate in some cases may be of little value, and yielding but a small income, but involving at the same time, a good deal of labor in its care and supervision, and in such cases five per cent, might not be a just and reasonable compensation. On the other hand, where the income is very large, that rate might be considered as excessive. After all, it is a matter resting largely in the discretion of the court, its reason and judgment, taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances surrounding the trust.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">E. Miller, <em>Equity Procedure </em>\u00a7 558 (1897) was in full accord: \u201cIn trusts under a will or deed, where the instrument does not fix a rate, the usual rule is to allow a commission of five per cent, upon the income, although other rates are sometimes fixed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Thus, when the will here was executed, commissions were allowed a conventional trustee, as a general rule, by judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>fiat, as a reasonable indemnity for services rendered by him in the discharge of his duties, although no provision for such compensation was made in the instrument creating the trust. \u201cSuch commissions will ordinarily be allowed where the trustee has performed his duty, unless its performance has imposed no labor or trouble which justly entitles him to compensation, or unless there is something in the nature of the trust itself, or in the terms of the trust instrument to show that no commissions were intended to be allowed or charged.\u201d Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 557. The commissions were based on income received, and the usual rate was 5% of such income, just as the testator here indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">No commissions based on the value of the trust assets were allowed. Miller said, \u00a7 561, citing <em>Jenkins v. Whyte, </em>62 Md. 427, 434, 437; \u201cWhen commissions are allowed on \u2018receipts and collections\u2019 the meaning is the receipts of income from the estate, not forming part of the principal; upon the principal, no commissions can be given.\u201d We observe that the testator here did not contemplate a sale of the trust corpus and reinvestment of the proceeds. There was no power given the trustees to sell the stock. <em>Weller v. Sokol, supra, </em>at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">It was neither the custom nor the law to allow compensation for terminating a trust. Although a trustee may have been allowed a commission on his disbursements, this meant expenditures during the existence of the trust, as distinguished from payments over to the <em>cestuis que trust. See Jenkins v. Whyte, supra, </em>at 436-437; <em>Whyte v. Dimmock, </em>55 Md. 452, 454-456. The case of <em>Bash v. Bash, </em>in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, decided 27 April 1905, and reported in 2 Baltimore City Reports 349, is persuasive on the point. Testamentary trusts were being administered under the jurisdiction of that court. The <em>cestuis que trust </em>became entitled to receive the corpus, which included securities which could readily be divided among them. The auditor stating the account for final distribution allowed the corporate trustee \u201cthe usual commission of 5 per cent on the income collected\u201d since the last report. He also gave an allowance of $250 to it as \u201ccompensation for its services in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>distributing and dividing the estate.\u201d There was objection to the latter. The question before the court was whether the trustee was entitled to this compensation. The chancellor, Harlan, C. J., held that it was not. He declared that the 5% allowed the trustee on the income was its \u201ccompensation for the general care and supervision of the trust estate\u201d or, in other words, it was the commission \u201callowed for the general <em>management and settlement </em>of the estate.\u201d The chancellor noted, at 351: \u201cThe five per cent commission does not cover special and unusual services, and it is quite customary to allow extra compensation therefor among which are commissions on sales and original investments. But\u201d, he added, \u201cI cannot find that it has been customary to allow extra compensation for distributing the trust estate to the parties entitled thereto at the termination of the trust, unless' there were special circumstances justifying the same.\u201d He found no such special circumstances. \u201cNo decision has been produced wherein a trustee has ever been allowed special compensation for distributing an estate consisting of cash or securities, and the general understanding of the profession has been that such a service is included in the duties for which the usual commission is allowed trustees, and is not the subject of any extra allowance.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Abell v. Abell, </em>2 Balto. City Repts. 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We have been discussing the custom and law which prevailed when no compensation for services rendered by a conventional trustee was provided in the instrument creating the trust. \u201cIf the instrument creating the trust provides for a certain rate of compensation, that rate will in general be allowed. Thus a trustee appointed by a will is entitled to the commissions provided for by the will. . . .\u201d Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 559. Comment f to \u00a7 242, <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>(1959) <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> at 607, is in accord: \u201cIf by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>terms of the trust it is provided that the trustee shall receive a certain amount as compensation for his services as trustee, he is ordinarily entitled to that amount. . . .\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But it goes further, adding \u201cand, unless it is otherwise provided, he is ordinarily entitled only to that amount.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Comment f to the effect that a trustee is ordinarily entitled only to the compensation provided for in the terms of the trust, is discussed in Annot., 19 A.L.R.3d 520, 523-524 (1968): \u201cThe larger portion of the decisions on this point, however, have limited the fiduciary to the compensation fixed in the will, trust instrument, or other agreement on the basis of a contractual theory that by accepting the office and qualifying as such fiduciary, he accepted the provision fixing his compensation and is bound thereby. It is also evident that if the services for which extra compensation is claimed are only such services as are incident to the duties of the office, or are such as were contemplated by the testator, or fiduciary, the latter will be limited to the compensation provided by the instrument on the theory that the fees so fixed were intended as full compensation for the rendition of such services. However, where it appears that the fiduciary has performed extraordinary services for the trust or estate, beyond those contemplated by the parties or ordinarily incident to the duties of such fiduciary the court may award such additional fees as are reasonable compensation for those services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>This was all summed up in <em>Schloss v. Rives, </em>162 Md. 346, 350-352 (1932). The Court set out certain propositions which it found from its many decisions dealing with the allowance of commissions to executors, administrators, and trustees to be established as the settled law of Maryland. We give an abstract of the Court\u2019s summary, which it deduced from its previous decisions, with respect to conventional trustees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">(1) \u201c[T]he early English rule in respect to the non-allowance of commissions to conventional trustees, unless the instrument creating the trust provided for compensation, is not the rule that has prevailed in Maryland; . . . compensation should be allowed to a conventional trustee as a reasonable indemnity for services rendered by him in the discharge of his duties, although no provision for such compensation is made in the instrument creating the trust.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">(2) \u201c[W]here the compensation of a conventional trustee is fixed in the instrument making the appointment, the same will ordinarily and generally be allowed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">(3) \u201c[T]he allowance of commissions to trustees, when the trust is administered under the control and supervision of the court, is largely within the discretion and judgment of the court, and is to be determined from all the circumstances of the particular case, taking into consideration the amount of labor required, the amount of risk incurred, the character of the duty to be performed, the time and attention necessary to be bestowed upon it, and the amount of the estate which is the subject of the trust; in other words, the compensation is upon the basis of a <em>quantum meruit, </em>and is to be such an amount as will fairly and justly compensate the trustee for the services rendered. . . Where rules of court or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>established practice fix the rate of commission, [as would be the case where compensation to be allowed is provided in the instrument creating the trust], they should be followed and enforced; but, even in such cases, keeping in mind that the character, quality, and extent of the service is what is being allowed for, the chancellor in extraordinary cases has the authority to diminish or increase the usual allowance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We see nothing in the will to indicate that the trustees would be called upon to perform services which were not incident to the duties of their office as contemplated by the testator.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The testator unequivocally declared that the compensation he set out was to be received by the trustees \u201cfor their services as such.\u201d It was the posture of the law then that when the instrument creating the trust fixed the compensation for the services of the trustee, a person accepting the trust was entitled only to that compensation, except, perhaps, as to extraordinary services not within the contemplation of the parties. Here the trust estate consisted of practically all the shares of stock in one corporation. The trustees were given no power to sell the shares. It had to be within the contemplation of the parties that the trustees would make distribution of the stock at the termination of the trust as a service incident to the duties of their office, and not as an extraordinary service. It is, therefore, that we conclude that the compensation fixed by the testator was intended to be all the compensation to which the trustees were entitled. The compensation so fixed was in full accord with that allowed by custom and law when the instrument creating the trust was silent as to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\n<em>Statutory Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We have indicated that compensation allowed conventional trustees is now covered by legislative enactment. The first such statute was enacted by ch. 100, Acts 1939, effective 1 June 1939. It was amended by ch. 36, Acts 1951; ch. 216, Acts 1963; ch. 269, Acts 1972. It was revised by ch. 11, Acts 1974, \u00a7 2. It has appeared under the \u201cChancery\u201d title of Art. 16 of the various codes \u2014 as \u00a7 268B, Code 1924; \u00a7 280, Code 1939; \u00a7 297, Code 1951; \u00a7 199, Code 1957. It is now \u00a7 14-103 of the Estates and Trusts Article. The scheme for payment of compensation has remained the same since the initial statute. That is, from the first, commissions were payable at certain percentages on designated amounts of income collected in each year, on the fair value of the corpus held in trust at the end of each year, and on the sale qf real or leasehold property. Upon final distribution there was \u201can allowance commensurate with the labor and responsibility involved in making such distribution\u201d, which \u201cin the absence of special circumstances\u201d was to be equal to one-half of one per cent upon the value of the corpus so distributed. The amendments, for the most part, simply increased the percentages authorized and established new amounts to which the percentages applied, and changed accordingly the date from which the new rates were accountable as to trusts already begun before the enactment of the amendment. From 1939 on, the various statutory authorizations for payment of commissions to trustees were \u201csubject to the provisions of any valid agreement determining their compensation.\u201d It was also expressly stated, until the stylistic revision in 1974, that the statutory commissions were \u201cin lieu of such commissions as have been heretofore allowed for such services by custom or by law.\u201d It was made manifest in the original statute and preserved in the amending statutes from time to time that the allowance of compensation as authorized was in the sound discretion of the court. The commissions were \u201csubject to be increased or diminished for sufficient cause by any Court having jurisdiction over the administration of such trust, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>allowance of special commissions or compensation for services of an unusual nature. . . The allowances upon final distribution were \u201csubject to revision or determination by any court of equity having jurisdiction. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We set out Estates &amp; Trusts Art. \u00a7 14-103, which, according to the Revisor\u2019s Note formerly appeared as Art. 16, \u00a7 199. \u201cThe subsections remain in their former order but are rewritten for the purpose of making each a complete sentence. The only other changes are in style and language.\u201d The statute as revised reflects the statutory scheme as it has existed since 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Section 14-103 (a) states the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">\u201cA testamentary trustee and trustee of any other trust whose duties comprise the collection and distribution of income from property held under a trust agreement or the preservation and distribution of the property are entitled to commissions provided for in this section for their services in administering the trusts. The amount and source of payment of commissions are subject to the provisions of any valid agreement. Any court having jurisdiction over the administration of the trust may increase or diminish commissions for sufficient cause or may allow special commissions or compensation for services of an unusual nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Subsection (b) concerns \u201cincome commissions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">\u201cAccounting from July 1, 1972, whether or not the trust was in existe'nce at that time, income commissions are</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">(1) 6 percent upon all income from real estate, ground rents, and mortgages collected in each year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">(2) 6 percent upon the first $10,000 of all other income collected in each year, 5 percent upon the next $10,000, 4 percent upon the next $10,000, and 3 percent upon any remainder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">Income commissions shall be paid from and chargeable against income. Income collected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>includes any portion of income payable to a trustee but withheld by the payor in compliance with any revenue law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Subsection (c) provides for \u201ccorpus commissions\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\u201cAccounting from July 1, 1972, whether or not the trust was in existence at that time, commissions are payable at the end of each year upon the fair value of the corpus or principal held in trust at the end of each year as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">(1) One third of one percent on the first $250,000,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">(2) One fifth of one percent on the next $250,000,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">(3) One eighth of one percent on the next $500,000, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">(4) One twelfth of one percent upon any excess. Corpus commissions shall be paid out of and chargeable against the corpus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">If a trust terminates, with respect to all or any part of the corpus held in trust in the course of any year, the commission for that year shall be reduced or prorated according to the part of the year elapsed and the amount of corpus as to which the trust terminates, and be chargeable, for such part of a year (and with respect to any such part of the corpus) at such termination of the trust, upon the then value of the corpus.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">Subsection (e) deals with \u201cfinal distribution\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">\u201cUpon the final distribution of any trust estate, or portion of it, an allowance is payable commensurate with the labor and responsibility involved in making the distribution, including the making of any division, the ascertainment of the parties entitled, the ascertainment and payment of taxes, and any necessary transfer of assets. The allowance is subject to revision or determination by any court of equity having jurisdiction. In the absence of special circumstances the allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>shall be equal to one half of one percent upon the fair value of the corpus distributed.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>The Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">A trustee does not automatically get the commissions and allowances authorized by the statutes. He is \u201centitled\u201d to them, and for the statutory provisions to apply, he must duly claim them \u201cin lieu of such commissions as have been heretofore allowed for such services by custom or by law.\u201d It appears that the trustees from time to time under the Nattans\u2019 will did not invoke the statute to obtain compensation for their services rendered prior to 24 September 1972 when the trust terminated. Thus, they were recompensed as designated by the will and effectively waived, as to the periods for which they were paid, any rights they may have had to the statutory rates. As we have seen, the statute was last amended as to substance effective 1 July 1972 whereby the commissions and allowances now in effect were established. The amendment entitled the trustees to commissions as therein authorized in lieu of such commissions as had been theretofore allowed for such services by custom or by law, accounting from 1 July 1972. The commissions authorized were at certain percentages on designated amounts of income collected in each year and upon the fair value of the corpus held in trust at the end of each year. The statute also authorized an allowance upon final distribution of the trust estate. When the trustees filed their petition for compensation on 3 June 1974, Sokol and Eliasberg <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> suggested three alternatives to recompense them for their services from 24 September 1972 to final distribution. The first was that they be paid as provided in the will, that is at the rate of 5% on the annual income. Under this alternative the provisions of the statute with respect to commissions were waived. The second was that they be paid at the rates set out in the statute with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>to income received and with respect to the fair value of the corpus. This alternative invoked the commissions provisions of the statute and waived the provisions as to commissions set out in the will. The third alternative was that they be paid at the rate of <em>5% </em>on the income as provided in the will and a commission on the fair value of the corpus held in trust at the end of each year. This alternative waived the statutory commissions on income received but invoked the statutory provision as to commission on corpus. They sought, in addition, to invoke the statute with respect to allowances upon termination of the trust, asserting that they were \u201cwilling to accept an allowance equal to one-half (V2) of one per cent (1%) of the value of the corpus of the trust estate being distributed as is set forth in Article 16, \u00a7 199 (e), of the Annotated Code of Maryland, or such additional amounts\u201d as the court deemed reasonable and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">As we have indicated, a testamentary trustee is not absolutely entitled to the commissions and allowances set out in the statute. The designated rates on commissions are subject (1) \u201cto the provisions of any valid agreement\u201d and (2) \u201cto be increased or diminished for sufficient cause by any court having jurisdiction over the administration of such trust.\u201d The allowance on final distribution of the trust, which \u201c[i]n the absence of special circumstances . . . shall be equal to one-half of one percent upon the value of the corpus so distributed\u201d, is \u201csubject to revision or determination by any court of equity having jurisdiction in the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">As we have also indicated, the chancellor allowed the trustees a commission payable out of income equal to 5% of the income of the trust from 24 September 1972 through 15 July 1974 \u201cas compensation for their labor and responsibility during such period.\u201d This fully complied with the first alternative suggested by Sokol and Eliasberg. Therefore, they may not complain regarding it, and, indeed, do not complain. The chancellor denied \u201cthe trustees\u2019 request for additional commissions.\u201d Sokol and Eliasberg are aggrieved by this insofar as it precludes an allowance which they sought upon final distribution of the trust estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>We look at the chancellor\u2019s reasons as expressed in his letter opinion for his determination of the matter of compensation. He opined that the provisions of the will did not constitute a \u201cvalid agreement\u201d within the meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We accept this for the purpose of decision, but expressly do not decide the issue at this point of the opinion because there is no need now to reach it. It necessarily follows that the statute was applicable and that the trustees were entitled to an allowance upon final distribution of the trust estate. This allowance, \u201cin the absence of special circumstances\u201d, shall be equal to V2 of 1% of the value of the corpus distributed. But if there are special circumstances, the amount of the allowance is in the sound discretion of the equity court exercising jurisdiction. In such event, the special circumstances, according to what they are, may justify the court allowing more than the V2 of 1% or less than that, including no allowance at all. In any event, the statute makes clear that the allowance shall be \u201ccommensurate with the labor and responsibility involved in making the distribution, including the making of any division, the ascertainment of the parties entitled, the ascertainment and payment of taxes, and any necessary transfer of assets.\u201d The chancellor here recognized all this in his letter opinion. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">\u201cThere would appear to be no basis for terminating income commissions as of the death of the last life tenant since none of the responsibilities of the trustees then ceased and they will necessarily continue until distribution. One cannot minimize the responsibility of trustees holding virtually all of the outstanding stock of a business enterprise and under no circumstances could they be expected to discharge these responsibilities without compensation. On the other hand, it is clear from the evidence and it is found as fact that the trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>have had no increased responsibilities or work subsequent to the death of the life tenant of sufficient magnitude to warrant any compensation in addition to the 5%.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Noting that the rate of V2 of 1% of the value of the corpus is applicable in the absence of special circumstances, the chancellor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\u201cThe basic standard for determining the distribution commission is that it be \u2018commensurate with the labor .and responsibility involved in making such distribution\u2019. In view of the size of the income commission and the minimal additional work attributable to distribution, there is insufficient labor to warrant compensation in addition to the income commissions. In the peculiar circumstances of this case the responsibility of the trustees has been substantially the same since the death of the life tenant as it was before his death and the income commissions adequately compensate for this responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u201cThe percentage commissions provided for in \u00a7 199 were determined by the legislature to represent fair compensation in the ordinary case. Experience has taught that allowance of percentages of income and corpus value is a practical and fair way of compensating fiduciaries. However, a fiduciary\u2019s compensation, particularly when the fiduciary estate is subject to the supervision of the court, must always be based on actual labor and responsibility. This is obviously the reason that the legislature provided in \u00a7 199 that all commissions were subject to determination by a court having -jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Where the court below orders an allowance upon final distribution of the trust estate in an amount greater than or less than that equal to V2 of 1% of the value of the corpus so distributed, or, as is the case here, denies any allowance, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the issue is preserved for appeal, our function on appellate review is to determine whether the chancellor was clearly erroneous in its judgment on the evidence that special circumstances existed, and, if they did, that they warranted the action he took. Maryland Rule 1086. We have reviewed the record and find that there was evidence supporting the chancellor\u2019s findings of fact. On the findings of fact, there was legally sufficient evidence for a determination that there were special circumstances of such a nature that the labor and responsibility involved in making final distribution did not call for an additional allowance. We cannot say that the view of the chancellor that the commissions allowed were commensurate with the labor and responsibility involved in all the duties the trustees performed was wrong. We note that by the nature of the trust assets, not much was required to make division and distribution, and that the parties entitled to distribution had been judicially determined. We conclude that the judgment of the chancellor on the evidence was not clearly erroneous. The part of the order denying additional commissions could be affirmed for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In reaching the conclusion that the chancellor was not clearly erroneous in his judgment on the evidence, we found no need to decide whether the provision for compensation set out in the will was a valid agreement in the contemplation of the statute. We suggest, however, an alternative reason why that part of the order denying additional commissions could be affirmed, and this reason encompasses a determination of whether the provisions in the will were a valid agreement binding on the trustees. The chancellor gave no reasons why he believed the provisions in the will regarding compensation did not constitute a \u201cvalid agreement\u201d within the meaning of the statute. But, as we have seen, there is substantial authority that the fiduciary is limited to the compensation fixed in the will on the basis of a contractual theory that by accepting the office and duly qualifying, he accepted the provision fixing his compensation and is bound thereby, at least in the absence of extraordinary services beyond those contemplated or not ordinarily incident to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>duties of such fiduciary. It may well be that the current trustees by accepting the office, especially in the light of their acceptance thereafter of compensation in accordance with the will, became bound by the provisions fixing compensation in the will. But even if the acceptance of the office did not at the time constitute a valid agreement to abide by the will\u2019s provisions, we think that what occurred after the death of the last life tenant certainly made the provisions in the will a valid agreement. Sokol and Eliasberg expressly and Solomon tacitly as a first alternative suggested that their compensation for the period 24 September 1972 to final distribution be at the rate of 5% on annual income received as fixed in the will. We have also seen that it was the intention of the testator that this be all the compensation to be received by his trustees. Although the trustees also requested a termination allowance, they did not predicate their suggestion that their compensation be as fixed by the will upon a grant of the termination allowance. One of the reasons why the chancellor accepted the suggestion that commissions be in an amount equal to 5% of the annual income was that it was \u201cwithin the expectation of the testator.\u201d We think that upon the acceptance by the chancellor of the trustees\u2019 suggestion, the provisions in the will did become a valid agreement so that unless extraordinary services were performed not contemplated in the agreement and beyond the usual duties of the trustees, the compensation of the trustees was without the statute as subject to the \u201cvalid agreement.\u201d For that reason, the part of the order denying additional commissions could be affirmed. We affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\n<em>THE SECOND ISSUE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">As has been indicated, on 8 July 1974 Sokol and Eliasberg filed a petition for allowance of counsel fees to Burke as attorney for Eliasberg and Dressel as attorney for Sokol, and for expenses incurred in the efforts of those two trustees to obtain compensation for their services as trustees. It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>alleged that Bramble, one of the attorneys for the three trustees, \u201cwas unable to fully represent the interest of all the trustees\u201d because of the position of one of the trustees, Solomon. It was suggested that the fair and reasonable value of Burke in such representation of Eliasberg was $6,670.00 and that the fair and reasonable value of the services of Dressel in his representation of Sokol was $2,016.32. On 5 July 1974 certain of the beneficiaries filed an answer to the petition.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The same date the chancellor issued the order which included an allowance of the counsel fees as suggested, to be paid out of the income of the trust estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">From the record submitted the only information as to what occurred with respect to the petition and answer before the issuance of the order allowing the fees must be gleaned from a transcription dated 8 July 1974. On that date the chancellor dictated to the court reporter the grounds for his decision. It is from this we learn that there was a hearing on the matter. No transcript of the proceedings of the hearing is included in the record. The chancellor reported that the hearing began on the morning of 5 July 1974 with the proceedings on the record. The hearing was not concluded that morning and did not resume until 6:00 p.m. that evening when a reporter was not available. The chancellor observed: \u201cNo one objected to concluding the hearing off the record.\u201d We do not know who was present at the hearing in person or by representation. According to the chancellor there was no objection to the counsel fees in the amount of $10,075 to Bramble and Dressel for the period preceding the proceedings involving objections to the trustees\u2019 commissions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But all the beneficiaries, the chancellor noted, objected to the counsel fees for Dressel and Burke for services rendered in connection with the proceedings for determination of trustees\u2019 commissions for the period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>following the death of the life tenant. He listed their objections as made in three aspects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">1) to the total fees on the ground that the trustees had not sought prior approval of the court for employment of counsel as required by Maryland Rule V77; <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">2) to counsel fees in respect to contested commissions, \u201calthough it was conceded on behalf of the beneficiaries that, at least to the extent that the Trustees had been successful, they were probably entitled to reimbursement\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">3) to the time spent by counsel \u2014 107 hours by Burke and 35 hours by Dressel on the ground that such time was excessive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The chancellor said that, after \u201call counsel had been fully heard\u201d, he determined to allow the full amount of the fees requested in the aggregate amount of $8,686.32. He gave his reasons as to each objection, but we are concerned only with the objections with respect to the second aspect because it was only that aspect which is involved.in the cross-appeal as argued by the beneficiaries.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The chancellor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\u201cThe issue with respect to whether or not the Trustees were entitled to reimbursement for counsel fees in connection with the contest over commissions was more difficult of resolution. The general rule seems to be that a trustee is entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable expenses, including counsel fees, in a_ successfully defended surcharge action brought by beneficiaries and in successfully defending exceptions filed by beneficiaries with respect to reimbursement of expenses. The argument made here was that, at best, the Trustees had been partially successful in their claim for commissions, and the suggestion was that they should be allowed only a proportionate part of the total counsel fees. The difficulty at the outset is in determining in what proportion the fees should be allowed. Although it could be argued that the Trustees were successful as to income commissions and unsuccessful as to a termination commission, this is not exactly what happened. What the court determined on the application for commissions was essentially fair compensation for the Trustees for all work done during the period between the death of the life tenant and distribution of the trust estate. Some of the beneficiaries, at least, contended that the Trustees were not entitled to any commissions during this period, and, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>other extreme, the Trustees contended they were entitled to full income commissions at the rate of five percent, as well as one-half of one percent of the value of corpus as a termination commission under Article 16, Section 199. The central issue before the Court was the applicability of this statute to this pre-1939 Will. Much of the legal work performed by counsel bore directly on this central issue. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately separate that work which pertained solely to the commission granted from that work which pertained to the commission which was denied. There would appear to be little or no justification for making an arbitrary division. The philosophy behind the Rule permitting reimbursement to the Trustees is that trustees should be fairly compensated for their work, and are entitled to reimbursement for all expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the administration of the trust. Thus, if a trustee is required to pay his own legal expenses whenever his right to compensation is contested, there is a substantial risk that he will not be adequately compensated. The Rule which permits reimbursement when the trustee is successful and denies reimbursement where he is unsuccessful seems to be a fair one and consistent with the general policy to be served. This is a doubtful case, and the Court has resolved the doubt in favor of the general policy. There is no doubt that the Trustees were entitled to some compensation, and, looking at the matter broadly, the only question was how much. In the face of the position taken by some of the beneficiaries that they were entitled to no compensation at all, the Trustees cannot be criticized, nor should they be penalized, for claiming that compensation which the statute provides shall be paid in the usual case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>\n<em>The Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The beneficiaries in their cross-appeal present the issue for decision in terms of counsel fees sought by the trustees for services and expenses \u201cincurred in connection with an unsuccessful claim against the trust assets for a termination commission based on the value of the corpus of the trust.\u201d Any doubt as to what is being attacked on cross-appeal was removed by the beneficiaries\u2019 explanation in their reply brief that the beneficiaries \u201crestricted their cross-appeal to the portion of the order allowing counsel fees to the extent that they were incurred to press the unsuccessful claim for a termination commission on corpus.\u201d Thus it is clear that they are not challenging that portion of the counsel fees which were incurred to press the successful claim for commissions on income received.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Arguing the issue in their brief, the beneficiaries urge that the allowance for counsel fees with respect to a termination must fall for two reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201cFirst, the trustees\u2019 claim for a termination commission was neither necessary for the proper administration of the trust nor was it made for the benefit of the trust estate.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">Second, the trustees were <em>not </em>successful in obtaining the terminating commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">The reasons necessarily imply two rules of law: (1) that counsel fees chargeable to the trust are to be allowed to a conventional trustee only when the counsel\u2019s services were reasonably necessary for the proper administration or management of the trust,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and (2) even if counsel\u2019s services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to a trustee with respect to obtaining compensation for that trustee are reasonably necessary to the proper administration or management of the trust when successful they are not so necessary when unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The trouble with the beneficiaries\u2019 position is that even if their reasons are entirely sound they cannot prevail. If we accept, <em>arguendo, </em>their claim, now made, that \u201cit is no more proper to pay counsel fees from the trust when a trustee\u2019s commissions claim is allowed than when it is denied\u201d, or in other words, if we assume the validity of the legal basis of the beneficiaries\u2019 two reasons why the counsel fee with respect to the unsuccessful termination commissions should not be allowed, we must, in order to give the relief requested, apportion the $8,686.32 between the services rendered in connection with the successful claim and the unsuccessful claim for compensation for the trustees. This we are not able to do.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201cThe decision of the court is presumptively correct, because of its opportunity to know or ascertain and estimate aright the value of the services, but its finding is subject to review on appeal, and will be reversed for clear and substantial error.\u201d <em>County Corporation v. Semmes, </em>169 Md. 501, 527. See cases cited therein. Quoted and applied in <em>Spencer v. McMullen, supra, </em>at 98.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Because of the state of the record before us, there is no basis for us to determine whether the chancellor erred in concluding that it was impossible \u201cto accurately separate the work which pertained solely to the commission granted from the work which pertained to the commission which was denied,\u201d and in finding \u201clittle or no justification for making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>an arbitrary decision.\u201d The beneficiaries allege in their brief: \u201cThe Chancellor did not permit counsel for the beneficiaries to cross-examine counsel for the trustees, nor did the Chancellor require counsel for the trustees to apportion their fee services rendered in connection with the termination commission and services in connection with the income commission claims, despite the request of counsel for the beneficiaries that they be required to do so.\u201d From the record, there is no way we can review the propriety of these rulings of the chancellor. Sokol and Eliasberg suggest that the beneficiaries \u201cfailed to preserve an adequate record for this court to substitute its judgment for the finding of the trial court that the legal services provided to the trustees on the compensation issue could not be accurately divided between services related to the question of commissions on income and the question of the statutory termination commission on corpus.\u201d Of course, it is not our function to substitute our judgment on the evidence for that of the trial court, but the trustees are correct in what they say to the extent that, on the state of the record, which was the obligation of the beneficiaries as to matters on their cross-appeal, there is no way for us to determine whether the chancellor was clearly erroneous in his judgment. It follows, therefore, that we must assume that the chancellor was correct in his finding that the allowance for counsel fees cannot be apportioned. Because it cannot be apportioned, that part of the allowance which the beneficiaries do not challenge cannot be separated from that part which they attack. In that posture we cannot say that there was clear and substantial error in the allowance of the fee in the amount of $8,686.32. That part of the order allowing it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>Order of 5 July 19?U affirmed; costs to be paid one-half by appellants-cross appellees and one-half by appellees-cross appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\">.

Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>although counsel as well as the Court should be aware of the Rules, Mr. Dressel would have been justified in anticipating that the Court would have taken the same position with respect to employment of Mr. Burke in connection with the contest over the Trustees\u2019 commissions as it had on October 1,1972.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">As to the third aspect, the chancellor found, \u201cconsidering all the circumstances, including the novelty of the legal issues and the investigation of the facts,\u201d that \u201cthe time spent did not appear to be out of line.\u201d He observed that no one objected to the hourly rates used by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">In their brief the beneficiaries assert that the objections cited by the chancellor were \u201csome, but not all, of the beneficiaries\u2019 objections to the allowance of a counsel fee out of the assets of the trust estate for services in connection with the compensation proceeding.\u201d On the state of the record, we do not know what other objections were made at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\">. This is in accord with what we are told about the proceedings below. According to the chancellor, as we have indicated, the argument made at the hearing on the allowance of counsel fees \u201cwas that, at best, the trustees had been partially successful in their claim for commissions, and the suggestion was that they should be allowed only a proportionate part of the total counsel fees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b111-11\">. The beneficiaries add: \u201cIt did not grow out of any provision of the instrument. It was made purely for the personal benefit of Messrs. Sokol and Eliasberg.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b111-12\">. The general rule is that \u201cwhen a trustee finds it necessary to employ or advise with counsel as to the proper management of the trust estate, he will be allowed, under the head of just allowances, such reasonable fees as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>he may have paid in properly taking the opinion and procuring the direction and assistance of counsel.\u201d Miller, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 562, pp. 663-664.
