Burch, Attorney General, Gary Melick, Assistant Attorney General, Arthur A. Marshall, Jr., State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County </em>and <em>John B. Wynes, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-12\">Moore, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">The principal contention presented on this appeal is that the trial court erred by applying the <em>prima facie </em>standard of proof in making a judicial determination of voluntariness concerning appellant\u2019s custodial confession to the fatal shooting of a fellow construction worker on November 28, 1973. Upon our review of the record, it is plain that the court did not find the inculpatory statement admissible by a preponderance of the evidence but did indeed apply the lesser standard of <em>prima facie </em>proof. We therefore reverse the judgment of conviction and grant appellant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">Appellant, Wayne Robert Felde, age 24, was indicted for the murder of William Blackwell, age 21, and for assault with intent to murder and/or assault upon four officers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department. He was tried by a jury in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, the Honorable William H. McCullough presiding, and was found guilty of second degree murder and four counts of assault. The court sentenced him to a 15-year term on the second degree murder conviction and five years each on the lesser offenses, to run concurrently.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The events leading up to the appellant\u2019s making a full and damaging statement to the police on the evening of November 28, 1973, could be found to have transpired in the following manner: at approximately 10 p.m., the police responded to 8539 Greenbelt Road to investigate reports of a fight and sounds of gunfire. When they arrived at the apartment building, a woman later identified as appellant\u2019s wife, informed .the officers that \u201cher husband had been involved in a fight with a man and that she had heard a shot and she thinks somebody had been shot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The appellant appeared briefly outside his apartment with a carbine in his hand but quickly withdrew. He then fired shots through the upper part of the door and issued a warning to the police officers: \u201c[D]on\u2019t come through the door. I will show you what Vietnam is like.\u201d After the arrival of his mother on the scene, however, he threw out the rifle and surrendered. While being handcuffed, he remarked to the police: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about him. I blew his head off. He is in my bedroom closet dead.\u201d Police Corporal Fox immediately advised him of his rights and appellant said he did not wish to make a statement. He was then transported to the office of the Bureau of Criminal Investigations in Forestville where the inculpatory statement at issue was taken by Detective James Wiseman.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">At the trial, out of the presence of the jury, Detective Wiseman testified <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that he first read appellant the <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>warnings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from a card issued by the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office and waivers of his rights on the reverse side, to which appellant acquiesced. Detective Wiseman then obtained a police department \u201clong\u201d waiver of rights form and again read it to the appellant. The latter signed the form and initialed it in several places. The statement, taken while appellant was handcuffed, consisted of 19 questions and answers and was typed \u201cverbatim\u201d by the detective during the half-hour period from 11:20 p.m. to 11:50 p.m., at the close of which appellant read over his statement and signed it. Detective Wiseman testified that although the appellant had been drinking during the day, he was not drunk and his speech was not slurred at the time of the interrogation. He also stated that no methods of coercion or intimidation were employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">At the beginning of the statement appellant declared: \u201cWhat happened is he got shot and I shot him.\u201d The following questions and answers thereafter appear concerning the shooting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201cQ. Why did you shoot Butch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">A. He was fighting with me in my own apartment. My wife was there but she ran out in front.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">\u201cQ. Why were you and Butch fighting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">A. We just had a disagreement, nothing really. It was just a disagreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">Q. How did the man, Butch, get shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">A. We were wrestling over my rifle and I told him to leave my home and he got shot. He would not leave so he got shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\">Q. How far were you from Butch when he got shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>A. About two or three feet. We were in my closet in the bedroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\u201cQ. What kind of gun did you use to shoot Butch with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">A. It was an Ml Carbine, .30 caliber, and the bullet consisted of 110 grains. That is the only bullet I have in my house. The rifle is used for deer hunting only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">Q. When did you load the rifle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">A. The rifle has always had its magazine inside of it but it is not chambered though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">Q. Did you put the bullet up in the chamber?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">A. I am not sure. I pulled the trigger. Yes, sir, I did that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">Q. What happened after Butch got shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-12\">A. I dared the police to walk through the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-13\">Q, Why did you do this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-14\">A. Because I knew they wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-15\">\u201cQ. How much education do you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-16\">A. I have about a year of college.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-17\">Q. How much have you had to drink today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-18\">A. About nine beers (12 ounce beers).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-19\">The appellant testified, out of the presence of the jury, and said that he \u201cwas very drunk, intoxicated, shaken up and scared\u201d at the time he was questioned. He did not remember talking to Detective Wiseman but did recall a \u201cDetective Nelson filling out a report,\u201d during which time,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-20\">\u201cI kept trying to doze off and he kept waking me up and telling me that I would remain awake until the report was finished and I kept still dozing off because I was dazy, and I remember him going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>his desk and taking a blackjack out, putting it in his back pocket. I was never struck with this blackjack and not threatened with it, but it was put in his back pocket, taken out of his desk, and I think it was more or less to scare me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">He also testified that he and the deceased, co-workers on a construction site in Suitland, had been drinking beer together, in a sojourn from bar to bar, since two o\u2019clock in the afternoon when their workday unexpectedly ended. On cross-examination, while admitting that his signature and initials were on the statement, appellant testified that he did not recall having made the statement: \u201cWhat happened is he got shot and I shot him.\u201d He did remember, however, that he and the deceased were wrestling over his [appellant\u2019s] gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Mrs. Ruby Felde, the appellant\u2019s mother, also took the stand at the suppression stage and testified that she had gone to her son\u2019s apartment on the evening of the \u201cmurder\u201d because of his telephone plea shortly after 9 p.m.: \u201cMama, get help. I think I killed a man.\u201d Mrs. Felde arrived at the scene and witnessed her son leaving his apartment in a condition she described as \u201cstaring like a wild man\u201d and \u201cdrunk.\u201d As he was placed under arrest, her son said to her, while crying: \u201cI think I killed a man. I couldn\u2019t help it. Mama, I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d Mrs. Felde testified that she saw her son in Forestville later that evening where \u201che was still drunk\u201d and \u201cstill acted like he did not know what he was doing.\u201d She was a registered nurse who had worked for 9 years in the emergency room at Prince George\u2019s Hospital where she treated a \u201clot of alcoholics\u201d and \u201cdrug addicts.\u201d After hearing argument on the motion to suppress, during which counsel stated that the standard to apply was that of the preponderance of the evidence, the court announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">\u201cThe Court has to. decide, whether or not the <em>prima facie </em>proof in this matter as to this time establishes that the confession was voluntarily, freely made, and in this instance, the issue is really was the defendant in this case so drunk at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>he made the confession that he did not know what he was doing, simply put.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">After reviewing the evidence, the court concluded that <em>\u201cthe State has met its burden, prima facie and has prima facie shown </em>that the statement given by this defendant was given freely, voluntarily and with a rational mind.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The jury then returned to the courtroom and the trial resumed with Detective Wiseman\u2019s testimony and the receipt in evidence of appellant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The first \u201cmajor point\u201d made by appellant\u2019s trial counsel in support of a motion for a new trial was that the court had applied an improper standard of proof \u2014 the <em>prima facie </em>test instead of the preponderance of the evidence test \u2014 in its determination of the admissibility of appellant\u2019s inculpatory statement. Reliance was placed specifically on <em>Lego v. Twomey, </em>404 U. S. 477 (1972). Denying the motion for a new trial, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">\u201cThe Court ruled at the trial that the test was whether the <em>prima facie </em>proof- was such as to establish that the confession was freely and voluntarily made. In light of counsel\u2019s argument to me <em>I still feel that is the test. </em>I ruled at the time that there was <em>prima facie </em>proof that the statement was freely and voluntarily made.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">And, the court immediately repeated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">\u201cI reviewed the evidence at the time ... 1 see no reason to reiterate what I said then. <em>I still believe the proper test was prima facie and it was met by the State, </em>and the statement made by the defendant was admissible.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">The court, in so holding, made no reference to <em>Lego v. Twomey, supra, </em>where the Supreme Court divided four to three against petitioner\u2019s contention, upon the authority of <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U. S. 358 (1970), that the trial judge should have found the confession voluntary <em>beyond a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>reasonable doubt.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) Mr. Justice White, who had authored the majority opinion in <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U. S. 368 (1964), stated for the majority in <em>Lego </em>that in the resolution of the issues presented \u201cwe must return to <em>Jackson v. Denno. </em>...\u201d There the Court had held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">(a) There is a denial of due process if a defendant\u2019s conviction is based, in whole or in part, upon an involuntary confession; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">(b) That whether there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction is immaterial; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">(c) That there is a constitutional right to object to the use of a confession and to have a fair hearing and a \u201creliable determination\u201d of voluntariness, a determination which must be uninfluenced by the truth or falsity of the confession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">That the trial judge at a coercion hearing was not constrained by the Court in <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>to determine voluntariness with reference to an \u201cespecially severe standard of proof\u201d was noted by the majority in <em>Lego. </em>On the other hand, that the less stringent standard of <em>prima facie </em>proof may not be utilized was made abundantly clear (p. 489):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">\u201cThus, the prosecution must prove <em>at least by a preponderance of the evidence </em>that the confession was voluntary. Of course, the States are free, pursuant to their own law, to adopt a higher standard.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">The trial in the instant case took place on May 8 through May 10, 1973. <em>Lego </em>was decided on January 12, 1972, and clearly represented the controlling law at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>decision below. This Court had occasion thereafter in <em>Mulligan v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 588, 308 A. 2d 418, decided on August 10, 1973, to comment, in the light of <em>Lego, </em>upon the standard of proof required of the State at a suppression hearing as a condition of the admissibility of an incriminatory statement. Judge Gilbert, speaking for the Court, emphasized that: \u201cTrial Judges should not only apply the preponderance of evidence test to confessions . . . but they should . . . shun the use of the words <em>prima facie </em>in connection with the degree of proof required ... to render a confession admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Here, the preliminary determination was unequivocally made by application of the standard of <em>prima facie </em>proof, rather than at least the test of preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Felde\u2019s constitutional right to have the question of voluntariness preliminarily determined by the trial judge, <em>Jackson v. Denno, supra, </em>was violated. The judgment of conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In view of our holding, we do not consider other questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\n<em>Judgments reversed; cause remanded for a new trial; costs to be paid by Prince George's County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-8\">. This is a belated appeal by order of Judge Samuel W. H. Meloy following appellant\u2019s petition for relief under the Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\">. Seven other detectives who had responded to the police call to appellant\u2019s apartment preceded Detective Wiseman to the stand. Their testimony was in the jury\u2019s presence. It appears from a colloquy at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>bench requested by defense counsel, that an unreported motion was made to exclude the jury, for the purpose of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, when Detective Wiseman took the stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b38-15\">.

Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of the case. Mr. Justice Brennan filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Douglas and Marshall joined, urging that the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt should be applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b43-8\">. The preliminary decision by the court involves a mixed question of law and fact. The trier of facts has, of course, the final determination whether or not the statement was voluntary and whether or not it should be believed. This ultimate determination by the trier of facts is a question of fact and the confession must be found voluntary by the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Ralph v.
