The complainant prays that the defendants, trustees under the will, may be ordered to convey to him certain real estate devised to him by the said testator, the full beneficial title of which is now vested in him in fee in severalty, by virtue of a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of this county on a bill filed in that court for partition, which decree has been affirmed, on appeal to the Supreme Court: Naglee\u2019s Estate, 2 P. F. Smith 154.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-10\">\u201c The testator by his will, after some legacies and a provision for his widow, leaves all his estate, real and personal, one-half to trustees for his three sons respectively, one-third to each in fee; and one-half to trustees for his three daughters respectively, each, pne-third to her and her heirs, and for their sole and separate use. He then proceeds to direct that both these sets of trustees, forming, as it appears, for this purpose one joint body, shall expend one-half of the net income of his estate, or more if they deem it expedient, in \u2018the erection of houses and other buildings and improvements, upon the vacant lots of ground\u2019 belonging to his estate, for the period of five years from his decease, which period by codicil he enlarged to ten. The balance of the net income he directed to be paid to his sons and daughters in the proportion before stated; the shares of each of the daughters to be paid to her for her sole and separate use. He then proceeds: \u2018 At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>expiration of the said five years, or at any time thereafter, if, in the opinion of my trustees, it will be for the benefit and advantage of my said estate and for the interest of my said children, that the said estate should be divided among my said children, I hereby authorize the same to be made, so that the share of each may be set out in severalty.\u2019 The answer admits,-that after the expiration of ten years from the death of the testator and after the death of his widow, a partition was duly made, and on the 5th January 1867, it was finally ordered and decreed by the Court of Common Pleas of this county, \u2018 that the allotments and partition made by the master and commissioners should be and the same were thereby approved and confirmed, and that the same should stand and remain as so reported, firm and stable for ever, so that the said parties to whom allotments had been so made should take and hold their allotted shares in severalty to them respectively, according to their right and title under the will of John Naglee, deceased, and the laws of Pennsylvania.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApKf\">\u201c So far as the interests of the sons are concerned, it appears to me, after the fullest reflection, that all the active duties of the trust terminated when the partition was accomplished, and so far as relates to the estate comprised in that proceeding. The sons became respectively seised of an absolute and unconditional equitable estate in fee simple in their respective parts set out to them. That such was the intention of the testator, appears to me very plainly from his going on, immediately after directing the partition, to provide that the share of the personal estate to which his daughters shall be entitled shall be invested by the trustees for their sole and separate use, and that they shall have the care and management of the \u2018real estate of his said daughters;\u2019 shall receive the rents, pay taxes, make repairs and improvements, and let any portions of the vacant lots on ground-rent, with the usual provisions securing it to the sole and separate use of his said daughters, and empowering each of them to dispose of her share by will, the same as if she was sole and unmarried. No provision whatever is made as to the continuance of the trust as to the respective shares of the sons. Before he arrives at the partition he speaks of \u2018 his estate, real and personal;\u2019 afterwards, it is his-daughters\u2019 real and personal estate. The same language as to the interest of his sons is used in the second codicil, in which he expresses his'wish, and recommends, that in case either of his sons should die having no children or their issue, that such sons shall not convey or devise for the use of his wife more than one-third part of the net income of <em>Ms </em>estate, and that only so long as she shall remain his widow and unmarried. From all\" which it is apparent that the testator knew well that his' sons would be invested with the absolute ownership in fee simple, with full power of disposition, either by conveyance or will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cIt has been contended that the following clause keeps the trust alive and as an active trust, requiring the legal estate still to remain in the trustees after the partition: \u2018 I do hereby authorize and empower my said trustees to sell or let on ground-rent any of the vacant land or lots belonging to my estate, at such times and upon such terms as they in their discretion may think proper, and I hereby authorize them to make, execute and deliver all necessary deeds, leases and conveyances for the purposes aforesaid.\u2019 Even if this were now to be considered as an existing power, I do not see that it affects the question. It is a bare power \u2014 not a direction or a trust to sell \u2014 and may well subsist in the trustees, though the legal estate should be conveyed to the sons. It is to be observed that this authority is vested in the joint body of trustees, constituted by the will for the improvement of the real estate for the term of ten years \u2014 it is preceded and followed by clauses relating exclusively to their action under the joint trust. Looking at the testator\u2019s whole scheme, and at the renewed grant of a similar, power in part at least \u2014 not to sell, but to let on ground-rent \u2014 to the trustees for his daughters after the partition, I am of the opinion that the power in question ceased with the partition. It was a useful and proper power, if limited to the period of time during which the improvements contemplated by the testator on his vacant lots were to be made. After the estate was divided, and set out in severalty to the sons and daughters, and the work of improvement ceased, it would be an unnecessary and embarrassing power. There is, in express words, no limitation of it. It is not confined even to the lives of the children, and as the testator has made provision for supplying the places of trustees who die or resign, it is not limited by the lives of the trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">\u201c If not limited to the time, during which the trustees were to improve the testator\u2019s vacant lots, it would be a power of sale suspended indefinitely over the fee, and open to the same objection as an executory devise or springing use, to take effect whenever A. or his heirs shall do a given act: Lewis on Perpetuity 547. I am quite clear that this power to sell or let on ground-rent, was intended by the testator only as auxiliary to the trust for improvement, and ceased when that trust ceased. The testator, or whoever was the draughtsman of this will, saw plainly this result, and therefore renewed the power in a modified and limited form over the estate of the daughters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-7\">\u201c If, then, we strike out of this will all the provisions which relate to the subject of the improvement of the estate, \u2018in the erection of houses and other buildings upon the vacant lots of ground\u2019 belonging to it, it stands, so far as the complainant in this bill is concerned, simply thus: \u2018 I devise one-third of one-half of the residue of my estate unto William B. Hart, Peter A. Keyser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>and Elhanan W. Keyser, and to the survivors or survivor of them, and the heirs of the survivor, in trust for my son John Naglee, Jr., and his heirs.\u2019 It is what has been termed a dry trust, the whole beneficial ownership and absolute power are in the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and the trustees ought to be decreed to convey the legal estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-6\"><em>\u201c </em>It is very strongly urged upon me, how'ever, that it is necessary that the legal estate should continue in the defendants, in order to effectuate the intention of the testator as expressed in the second codicil to his will: \u2014 \u2018 And I further direct, and it is my will, that no part of the property hereby devised to either of my sons shall at any time be liable to be sold for the payment of any of his debts, which have heretofore or shall hereafter be contracted.\u2019 There can be no doubt, I think, upon the cases in Pennsylvania, that if this devise had been in trust for the sons for life, with a power of appointment by will, and in default of appointment then to their heirs, the provision of this second codicil would have kept the trust alive as an active trust, necessary in order effectually to carry out the intention of the testator: Fisher <em>v. </em>Taylor, 2 Rawle 33; Yaux <em>v. </em>Parke, 7 W. &amp; S. 19; Brown <em>et al. v. </em>Williamson\u2019s Executors, 12 Casey 338; Barnett\u2019s Appeal, 10 Wright 392, and Shankland\u2019s Appeal, 11 Id. 113. But we have here the case of a trust' of the fee giving the <em>cestui que trust </em>the beneficial estate with a provision that it shall not be liable to the debts of the <em>cestui que trust. </em>Such a provision, if there had been no trust, would have been as repugnant to the estate devised as a condition not to alien. The <em>cestui que trusts </em>\u2014 the sons \u2014 have the equitable estate in fee with full power to alien or devise, but it is attempted to deprive their estate of a necessary lawful incident, made so by statute, and consonant with every reason of justice and policy. Fisher <em>v. </em>Taylor comes nearest, but it is not this case. There was an equitable estate expressly for life, with a legal remainder to the heirs of the body of the tenant for life, which did not therefore coalesce under the rule in Shelley\u2019s case. It seems clear to me that the mere interposition of a dry trusteef will not enable a testator to give a beneficial estate in fee simple with all the incidents of ownership, except that of liability foil debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-7\"><em>\u201c </em>It was complained that these words in a deed or will were allowed by courts of equity to repeal the Statute of Uses. Here it is claimed that these words in a wrill shall repeal the entire legislation of the Commonwealth, since the first foundations of its jurisprudence were laid in the laws agreed upon in England, by which it was enacted that \u2018 all lands and goods shall be liable to pay debts\u2019 \u2014 which may well be termed its favorite policy, and of which it may justly be proud. I am of opinion, therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief which he prays.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201c Let it be decreed that the defendants shall execute such deed or deeds as may be devised by the complainant or his counsel learned in law, at his cost, for the conveyance of the legal estate in fee to the complainant of the property or properties assigned and allotted to him by the decree in partition of the Court of Common Pleas of January 5th 1865.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">The defendants appealed, and assigned the decree for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-7\"><em>J.
