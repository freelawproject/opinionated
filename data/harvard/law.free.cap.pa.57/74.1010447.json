Johns, in April or May 1863, informed the president of the company that Welsh had agreed to rent to him No. 242, and that Welsh had directed him to ascertain whether his business would increase the risk. Johns told the president that he was going into the hay and straw business; the ship-chandlers were about moving away. A surveyor was sent, and after he had made his return, Johns was informed at the defendants\u2019 office that there was no additional risk or premium. Johns continued the hay, straw and produce business until November 1865. After that time he went \u201c into the broom-corn business and all the materials sold by broom-makers.\u201d For the last year that was his business; it did not take up one-tenth of the room taken by hay and straw. He occupied three floors; the broom-corn in bales occupied a space of thirty feet on the Water street front, <em>\u201c </em>the remaindei of the store back was nothing but racks against the wall, brooms, then guano.\u201d The office occupied sixteen feet of the second story, the shop was about twenty feet square over the office, having a glass partition. In manufacturing,the corn was taken out of the bales, thrown into boxes and cut into the lengths, dipped into the water, put into the bleaching-room, where there was a large cast-iron stove with a carpenter\u2019s glue-pot on the grate, a pot with water and one with sulphur; the corn is wired on to the handles, then put into a vice to flatten them, &amp;c. The brooms were of three sizes, from ten to twenty-four pounds per dozen. -There were forty or fifty tons of broom-corn on the premises at the time of the fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-9\">Johns was of opinion that the fire did not originate in his building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-10\">The plaintiffs proved that a sail-loft is a place for <em>manufacturing </em>sails.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-11\">Mr. Blackburn, the fire marshal, testified that he had been present at the fire, had made several examinations of the premises subsequently, and was of opinion that the fire originated in the bleaching-room. There was other testimony somewhat conflicting as to the place in which the fire originated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-12\">The plaintiffs gave evidence under exception that good stoves were insured at 2J per cent, deposit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Judge Strong, after stating some preliminary facts, charged the jury:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">\u201c The defendants, however, insist that they are not liable to make good the loss, or any part thereof, because, as they allege, after the policies were issued, such an alteration was made in the use of No. 242, the southernmost building, as to enhance the risk assumed, to make it greater than was contemplated, and because the alteration excluded the property insured from all protection by the policy, according to the stipulations of the tenth condition attached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">\u201c It is also insisted that, inasmuch as the two policies were taken out on the same day by Mr. Brock, any increase of the hazard (by Mr. Brock, or any one claiming under him) to one of the buildings, affects his right to hold the company bound by the policy covering the other, an adjoining building, and therefore that there can be no recovery for the loss caused by the partial destruction of No. 244.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">\u201c This renders it necessary for you to inquire what has been done by the person insured, or by any persons who were tenants under him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">\u201c There is evidence submitted to you that, in the spring of 1863, when Mr. Johns was about to take a lease of. No. 242, with a view to go into the hay, straw, feed and produce business there, the Messrs. Welsh, one of whom was then the owner of the policies, sent their clerk to the defendants to inquire whether, if such a business should be carried on there, the building would be considered covered by the policy, or whether an additional premium would be required; and that to the inquiry the defendants replied, in substance, \u2018it was all right, that it was no additional risk.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-10\">\u201c Keeping hay, straw and provender, you will notice, when you look at the tenth condition of the policy, was regarded as an especially hazardous risk, and it was declared that no policy would be construed to extend to such a risk unless liberty be given for the purpose, and expressed thereon. Yet, if the testimony is to be believed, it may be concluded the defendants understood the policy as covering such a risk. In connection with this may also be considered the rate of premium demanded and deposited, with the evidence that it was above the usual rate, indicating, though not proving, that more than an ordinary risk was intended to be assumed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-11\">\u201c An extraordinary premium furnishes some reason for presuming that an extraordinary risk was represented, though from a high rate of premium alone a jury ought not to infer that a concealed or misrepresented fact was understood to be at the risk of the insurers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-12\">\u201cBut what has Mr. Brock, or Mr. Welsh, or any tenant holding under Mr. Welsh, done to avoid the policies ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>. \u201c It is in evidence that Mr. Johns, a tenant of Mr. Welsh, was permitted to enter No. 242, and to keep hay, straw and produce there, after Mr. Bancker had said that it Was all right, that no additional premium would he required, or something to that effect. Johns kept those articles until November 1865, when he gave up the hay business, and went into keeping broom-corn, and making brooms to some extent, as has been described to you by the witnesses. The mode in which this was done, and the extent to which it was carried, has been detailed before you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-6\">\u201c It is not alleged that keeping broom-corn, or even making brooms, increased the risk above what it would hare done had Mr. Johns continued to keep hay, straw and produce, but it is said it was an increase of the hazard above that undertaken by the words of the policy, and that the manufacturing the corn into brooms took the building out of the policy altogether, and left it entirely uninsured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-7\">\u201c Whether the risk was increased or not depends upon the question, what risk was assumed. The subject insured is called a storehouse. That, I think, is descriptive only, not a warranty or representation that nothing should be done in it but keeping a store or a storehouse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-8\">\u201c Whether manufacturing brooms in it did add to the hazard is a question of fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-9\">\u201c Whether the fire was caused by keeping the corn, or by its manufacture, so far as it was manufactured, has been considerably debated. I do not propose to say much in regard to this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-10\">. \u201c Mr. Blackburn thinks it originated from the bleaching-room, which you have had described to.you. He speaks, however, very hesitatingly. All the witnesses testify that it was first seen nearly midway between Delaware Avenue and Water street, at considerable distance from the bleaching-room, or at least, that there was the body of the fire, and there the principal destruction. One witness testifies that the fire was entirely out in the bleaching-room before he left the store in the afternoon of January 30th 1866; and the witness who first saw the fire, tells you that the smoke came first out of the third story window on Water street, the story above that in which the bleaching-room was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-11\">\u201c I do not conceive this, however, to be a matter of primary importance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-12\">\u201c <em>A storehouse </em>was insured, and the policy does not enumerate keeping broom-corn as a hazardous risk, either requiring an increased premium, or taking the building in which the corn was kept out of the contract of insurance. The assured had a right to keep broom-corn there, and his doing so, either by himself or his tenants, was no violation of any condition or representation. And if it was not, he is not debarred a recovery in this action by the fact that the danger of fire was made greater by keeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>broom-corn than it would have been had the broom-corn not been kept there, or by the fact that the fire actually originated in the broom-corn, if you believe it did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">\u201c A more important question is, whether by anything that was done by Mr. Johns, the tenant, the building was taken out of the protection of the policy. You will observe the insurance is of the building, not of its contents.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">The judge here read the tenth condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\">\u201c This is a part of the contract. No policy covers any of the hazardous risks enumerated, unless liberty be given to keep the articles mentioned, or to carry on the kinds of business specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\">\u201c You will observe that the catalogue of things which a policy does not cover, unless specially described and allowed, contains three classes. <em>One </em>is personal property, as china, flax, groceries, hay, aquafortis, &amp;c-. These are not insured by a policy covering generally personal property, without any farther designation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\">\u201c Another is certain trades or occupations. Buildings in which such trades are carried on (bookbinders, coopers, printers, bakers, distillers, &amp;e.), are not covered by any policy, unless liberty be given to carry them on, and expressed in the policy itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-11\">\u201c The third class is real estate, and all that is enumerated is, \u2018 academies and school-houses,\u2019 \u2018taverns, oyster cellars and eating-houses,\u2019 \u2018 mills and manufactories of any kind,\u2019 \u2018 stables, public and private,\u2019 and \u2018 sugar refineries.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-12\">\u201c In examining this list, you will see that <em>manufacturing broom-corn into brooms is </em>not one of the <em>Mnds of business </em>denominated hazardous, and requiring to be specially allowed, in order that the building in which it may be carried on may be covered by the policy. The store No. 242 is not therefore uncovered by the policy, merely because Mr. Johns made or manufactured brooms therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-13\">\u201c Nor is it outside of the policy, and unprotected by it, merely because Mr. Johns kept brooms there. No condition required that such articles should not be kept.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-14\">\u201c But was the store converted into a manufactory, within the meaning of the word, as used in the catalogue of those kinds of real estate, not insured without special agreement? This is a very important question, which I submit to you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-15\">\u201c The tenth condition attached to the policy, in which it is declared that a policy shall not he construed to extend to mills and manufactories of any kind, has reference to the character of-the real estate, rather than to the uses to which it may be put. The building must itself be a mill or a manufactory, or it does not come within the tenth article. The fact that articles are made or manufactured in a dwelling-house or a store, does not, of course, make it a <em>manufactory </em>within the meaning of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>policy. Had clothes been made in the store, and had a sewing-machine been introduced, and worked there, a jury would hardly find that it had become a manufactory, and therefore no longer insured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-5\">\u201c Is not a manufactory, or a factory, a building, the main, or principal design, or use of which is to be a place for producing articles, as products of labor ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">\u201c There is no difficulty in understanding what is meant, when we speak of a factory or manufactory. It is something more than a place where things are made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\">\u201c You would probably hardly speak of a photograph establishment as a manufactory, or a painter\u2019s studio, or a bookbinder\u2019s shop, or a printing office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-8\"><em>\u201c </em>it is undoubtedly true that a building may be insured as a store, or a dwelling-house, which may afterwards be converted into a factory. If it be, under such a policy as these, it ceases to be insured. But it by no means follows that the partial use of it for making articles for use or sale makes it a manufactory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-9\">\u201c The collocation of the words in this condition is of considerable weight in determining what the parties meant. Not only are the kinds of manufacturing business excepted from the policy named, but the real' estate excepted is called \u2018 mills and manufactories.\u2019 This would seem to indicate what was in the minds of the parties, <em>mills and </em>manufactories, something known, recognised, called a mill (not merely a place where something might be ground), but what common usage recognises as a mill. A manufactory (not merely a place where something may be made by hand or machinery), but what in common understanding is known as a factory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-10\">\u201c If Avords in a policy are of doubtful signification, that meaning is to be adopted which is most favorable to the assured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-11\">\u201c Then, gentlemen, you will inquire from the evidence whether this storehouse had, before the fire, become not a storehouse but a manufactory. Had it ceased to be a storehouse, and become a building of a different character ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-12\">\u201c Upon this subject I refer you to the evidence. That it Avas a storehouse at the time it was insured is not denied. In November 1865 Mr. Johns began to make brooms out of broom-corn he had stored.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-13\">\u201c He had a small vice, for pressing, and he had a small bleaching-room. He did not, hoAvever, lay in broom-corn exclusively to be manufactured by himself. He kept it for sale \u2014 supplied manufacturers around him. Was making brooms his principal business then ? or was it only incidental \u2014 an adjunct to his main business, keeping a store ? It appears he not only kept broom-corn for sale, but he kept other articles \u2014 phosphate of lime, in barrels.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u201c All the evidence on this subject is submitted to you, and you will find whether this building, 242 Delaware avenue, was, on the 30th of January 1866, a manufactory or a storehouse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-6\"><em>\u201c </em>If it had not then been converted from a storehouse into a manufactory, the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and there is no defence to the claim of the plaintiff upon either of the policies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-7\">\u201c Your verdict should then be for the plaintiff for the amount of the loss upon both buildings, with interest from sixty days after the proof of the loss was furnished to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-8\"><em>\u201c </em>It is not disputed that such proof was furnished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-9\">\u201c If, on the other hand, the building 242 was, on the 30th of January 1866, a manufactory, as distinct from a storehouse, plaintiff is not entitled to recover for the destruction of that building; and his only right would be to recover the loss on 244, which is agreed to be $4925, with interest, <em>See.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-10\"><em>\u201c </em>I decline to instruct you, as requested, that the plaintiff cannot recover for the loss on the northernmost building (No. 244), if the fire was caused by the manufacturing of brooms in No. <em>242, </em>or even if it had been converted into a manufactory.

Each storehouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>covering the whole of its respective lot. The present numbers of these storehouses are No. 242 and No. 244 North Delaware avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">. The fourth condition in each policy is, \u201c The sum insured on one building and the contiguous buildings on the same lot, may be insured in one policy; but there shall not be insured in one policy a greater number of buildings than are erected on a single lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Each policy was, therefore, by the express declaration of the defendants made a separate and distinct contract, unconnected with any other policy on any building on any other lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">On the 30th January 1866, a fire took place which damaged No. 242 to more than the amount insured, and No. 244 to the extent of $4925. By the surveyors it appears the partition-wall between the buildings \u201c in the fifth story had been taken away, making the two in one room, and occupied as a sail-loft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">In the policy No. 242 there was a \u201c privilege to occupy as a ship-chandlery store,\u201d and the premium was $300, or 5 per cent., this being considered one of the greatest risks. The tenant of these premises kept hay, straw and provender, and was in the feed and produce business, which on inquiry at their office, the defendants said, in substance, \u201c it was all right, that it was no additional risk,\u201d although regarded as an especially hazardous risk, as appears by the tenth condition of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">In November 1865, the tenant gave up the hay business, and went into keeping broom-corn, and making brooms to some extent, but in a comparatively small way. It was not alleged that the keeping and selling brooms or broom-corn vitiated the policy, and the jury expressly found that the fire did not occur by the manufacturing of brooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The question then narrows itself down to this: does the making of brooms come within the words mills and \u201c manufactories of any kind,\u201d in the 3d section of the tenth condition of the policy ?</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">To this question we think our brother Strong gave the proper answer in his charge to the jury. \u201c Is not a manufactory or a factory a building, the main or principal design or use of which is to be a place for producing articles as products of labor ? There is no difficulty in understanding what is meant when we speak of a factory or manufactory. It is something more than a place where things are made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">\u201c The collocation of the words in the condition is of considerable weight in determining what the parties meant. Not only are the kinds of manufacturing business excepted from the policy named, but the real estate excepted is called <em>\u2018 </em>mills and manufactories.\u2019 This would seem to indicate what was in the minds of the parties, mills and manufactories, something known, recognised, called a mill (not merely a place where something might be ground), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>but what common usage recognises as a mill. A manufactory (not merely a place where something may be made by hand or machinery), but what in common understanding is known as a factory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">This appears to us the true construction and meaning of these words. The theory of the defendants requires the word manufactories should be read manufactures, which we shall certainly not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Our learned brother was therefore right in saying to the jury, if it had not been converted from a storehouse into a manufactory the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and that there was no defence to the claim of the plaintiff upon either of the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
