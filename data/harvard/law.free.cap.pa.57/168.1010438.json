The landlord obtained a judgment before the alderman. The defendant appealed, giving security for all damages and costs until final judgment, but not for all costs <em>and rent </em>accrued or that might accrue up to final judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-7\">The landlord issued a writ of possession and the tenant was ejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-8\">The landlord moved to strike off the appeal because of the defect in the recognisance. The defendant then asked leave to file the required recognisance. This was granted, and the required recognisance was filed. In answer to a rule to declare the landlord filed a <em>narr. </em>in ejectment. The tenant pleaded not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-9\">On the trial the landlord gave in evidence his deed \u2014 proved possession in his grantor and rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-10\">The tenant alleged and proved by his daughter that the notice to quit was not served three months before the expiration of the term. He then offered to show \u201cwhat his damage was by the removal, and the value of the place to him at the time of the removal.\u201d This was objected to, but admitted under exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-11\">The landlord then in rebuttal, proved a notice to quit three months before the expiration of the year in a conversation with the tenant\u2019s daughter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-12\">The tenant recalled the daughter and offered to contradict this evidence. The offer was objected to, but admitted under exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-13\">The evidence being closed on both sides, plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge the jury that, \u201c as the plaintiff recovered a judgment before the alderman, after the hearing of both parties, and as that judgment gave the plaintiff a right to eject the defendant, notwithstanding the appeal of the defendant, the presumption is that that judgment was right, and the plaintiff had a right to the possession of the premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-14\">The court (Brewster, J.), charged the jury as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-15\">\u201c This is what is called' a landlord and tenant case, under the provisions of the Act of 1863. It comes before you on an appeal by the defendant to the decision of the alderman, and <em>you are now to decide it precisely as if no prior decision in favor of the plaintiff had taken place.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-16\">\u201cPrior to the Act of 1772, landlords had to bring ejectment, which subjected them to much trouble and delay. The Act of 1772 was then passed, authorizing a proceeding before two justices and a sheriff\u2019s jury, in cases where landlords desired .to recover the possession of the premises. Then the Act of December 14th 1863 was passed, authorizing a complaint before a single justice, and providing for no jury trial. It gives an appeal which is not a supersedeas, but the act declares that the appeal shall be tried as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>actions of ejectment are tried, and if the jury find for the tenant they shall \u2018 assess the damages sustained by reason of his removal.\u2019 The controversy here is on the words of the law, \u2018 having given three months\u2019 notice of such intention to have again and repossess the premises.\u2019 The defendant contends no such notice was given. The plaintiff asserts it was given. This is the first question you have to pass upon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-6\">After referring to the testimony, the court said: \u2014 \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-7\">\u201c The question of the credibility of these witnesses is exclusively for the jury. If they find due notice was given, then their verdict should be for the plaintiff. If no such notice was given, then their verdict should be for the defendant. In the latter case you are <em>\u2018 </em>to assess the damages sustained by reason of the defendant\u2019s removal.\u2019 There is no evidence of malice or oppression. The defendant does not contend for this. The defendant is entitled to compensatory damages only.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-8\">The point for charge was thus answered:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-9\">\u201c The presumption is in favor of the regularity and fairness of all judicial proceedings, but the alderman\u2019s judgment is not binding upon the jury.\u201d And the court also charged the jury that they were <em>\u201c to decide the case precisely as if no prior, decision in favor of the plaintiff had taken place.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-10\">To this answer and charge the plaintiff excepted. He then moved to take a nonsuit; which was refused and an exception noted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-11\">The jury having found damages in favor of the tenant, and judgment having been entered for the tenant, the landlord took this writ of error and filed the following Assignments of error:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-12\">That the c.ourt below erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-13\">1. In not quashing the appeal, as the recognisance was not filed in time, nor before th\u00e9 proper tribunal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-14\">2. In requiring the plaintiff to declare, as the appeal was defective and the case not regularly and properly in court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-15\">3. In not overruling the defendant\u2019s offer \u201c to show what his damage was by the removal, and the value of the place to him at the time of the removal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-16\">4. In permitting the defendant to call and examine- his daughter in surrebuttal \u201cto contradict Langebartel by showing what he said to her when she called on him to- see if the property had been sold, and at other times.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-17\">5. In answering plaintiff\u2019s point, \u201cas the plaintiff recovered a judgment before the alderman, after hearing both parties, and as that judgment gave the plaintiff a right to eject the defendant, notwithstanding the appeal of the defendant, the presumption is that .the judgment was right, and the plaintiff had a right to the possession of the premises,\u201d as follows, viz.: \u201c The presumption is in favor of the regularity and fairness of all judicial proceedings, but the alderman\u2019s judgment is not binding upon the jury.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>6.

The right of appeal and of trial by jury is too precious to be frustrated by the ignorance, incompetency or malice of inferior magistrates and officers: Means <em>v. </em>Trout, 16 S. &amp; R. 349; Huntingdon Borough <em>v. </em>Jackson, 2 Penna. R. 431; Bream <em>v. </em>Spangler, 1 W. &amp; S. 378; Adams <em>v. </em>Null, 5 Id. 363; Ihmsen <em>v. </em>Mon. Nav. Co., 3 Casey 267. It is not safe or expedient to rely upon a discarded practice, or upon overruled cases. This is sufficient to dispose of the 1st and 2d assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">The 3d error is unaccompanied with the bill of exceptions, and is therefore informally assigned. But I may say, without a specific rule of the court to regulate the practice in this respect, it is the defendant\u2019s right under the Act of Assembly to claim and give evidence \u00a9f the damages he has sustained by reason of his removal from the premises. No other notice than the law itself, was therefore necessary to be given by him to his landlord. Tho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>law prescribes the issue, which is to be tried in the same manner as an action of ejectment, and directs the jury if they find for the tenant, to assess the damages caused by his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The 4th error is not sustained. The examination of the defendant\u2019s daughter in surrebuttal, after she had been examined before, was a matter within the sound discretion of the court. Slight explanations will often explain-apparent discrepancies, or exhibit a witness\u2019s truthfulness; and a court will not suffer truth to be smothered by form, when a discreet exercise of its power will prevent it.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">We discover no error in the charge of the judge or his answer to the plaintiff\u2019s points, as set forth in the 5th and 6th assignments of error. The court was right in refusing permission' to the plaintiff to take a nonsuit. The defendant had a right to the verdict, both to be restored to possession and to recover his damages for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">None of the errors are sustained, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
