Montgomery, one dated November 18th 1865, and the other dated the 23d of the same month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-14\">The plaintiffs wore John T. Montgomery and others, who offered the first will for probate; the defendants were Edward B. Grant and others, who offered for probate the second will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-15\">The first will gave to John T. Montgomery $15,000, and to Adeline Connelly $15,000, and gave the residue of her estate, \u201c as follows, in nearly equal proportions, to the family of my deal husband and my own family, viz.: \u2014 To the family of my dear husband,\u201d &amp;c., naming a number of legatees to whom she gave in the aggregate $27,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-17\">\u201c To my own family as follows,\u201d giving $28,000 to a number of legatees, $8000 of which are to Julia Duval, and $2000 to Adeline Mack. She gave to John T. Montgomery and Adeline Connelly her silver, and also the residue of her estate, share and share alike. Mary Coulter and Ann Coulter subscribed this will as witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-18\">By the second will she gave to_ John T. Montgomery $15,000, and half of her silverware, and to Adeline Connelly the other half of her silverware. She gave all her furniture to Julia Duval and Adeline Connelly. She gave all the residue of her estate to be divided equally between the children of her sisters Cornelia Connelly and Addie Duval. There were no witnesses to this will. She appointed John T. Montgomery and Edward E. Law, executors of each will. Mrs. Connelly has two children who are amongst the plaintiffs in the issue; Mrs. Duval is dead, leaving six .children, two of whom are Julia Duval and Adeline Mack, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>and who are not parties to the issue; the other four children are the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">Julia Duval and Adeline Mack would receive a larger portion of the estate under the will of November 23d, than under the former will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">On the trial, the plaintiffs proved the will of November 18th by the subscribing witnesses, and gave it in evidence. The defendants gave evidence of the handwriting of Mi\u2019s. Montgomery, to the will of November 23d. They produced the following paper dated November 7th 1867, viz.:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-8\">\u201c Know all men by these PRESENTS, That we hereby and absolutely and irrevocably renounce, disclaim, release, acquit and for ever discharge the estate of Isabel B.

Montgomery, deceased, bearing date November 23d 1865. Mrs. Montgomery had executed a previous instrument of November 18th 1865, the original validity of which was not disputed, but the contention was only as to the second one, which revoked the first. The parties to the issue were the executors and persons claiming under the first, as plaintiffs, and those under the second, as defendants. Adeline Mack and Julia Duval, two of the residuary legatees under the instrument of November 23d, were not named as parties. They were offered as witnesses for the defendants, and having severally executed renunciations or releases to the executors, were admitted and examined. Their competency is the only question now presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">It is not denied that they would have been entitled to a larger share of the estate under the second than under the first paper. Being thus beneficially interested at the commencement of the proceedings, they were substantially parties to the issue, though not named: Asay <em>v. </em>Hoover, 5 Barr 21; Carter <em>v. </em>Trueman, 7 Id. 315; Burrows <em>v. </em>Shults, 6 Id. 325. They were, therefore, liable for costs, and from this responsibility could not discharge themselves by a release. The opposite parties have a right to look to those who are beneficially interested in the suit: Gallagher <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Milligan, 8 Penna. Rep. 178. This, too, was the rule as settled in England before the change recently introduced in the law of that country on the subject of the competency of witnesses. It will be presumed that the proceeding was instituted by the direction of the party interested; and therefore in <em>Bell v. </em>Smith, 5 B. &amp; C. 188, in an action by the brokers on a policy of insurance, one of the parties for whose benefit the policy was effected, having released to the plaintiffs, was offered as a witness, and it was held on error in the King\u2019s Bench that he was incompetent by reason of his liability for costs. C. J. Abbott said: <em>\u201c </em>There can be no doubt that originally he was substantially, although not nominally, a plaintiff in the cause; and we ought not to be astute to give effect to that which makes the real plaintiff a witness. The action being for his benefit, although brought in the names of the brokers, it must, until the contrary is shown, be presumed that it was brought by him and by his authority.\u201d Now, admitting that a responsibility for costs would not attach to a party, who had renounced all claim before the proceedings were commenced, or who, never having made any claim or taken any part in the contest, should execute a formal renunciation or release before examination, yet that must be made to appear affirmatively. The <em>prima fades </em>is against it. This was not done in this case. In the examination of the witnesses on their <em>voir dire, </em>the contrary rather appeared; certainly the presumption was not removed by anything which was elicited. Mrs. Mack admitted that she had retained counsel to attend to her claim, and Miss Duval had been frequently at his office in relation to it. We are of opinion, therefore, that these witnesses were incompetent, by reason of their personal liability for the costs of the proceeding. This renders' it unnecessary to examine any other ground of objection to their competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
