L. 450, entitled \u201c An act to consolidate, revise and amend the laws of this Commonwealth relating to penal proceedings and pleadings,\u201d is to be computed from the time a true bill is found by the grand jury, or from the date of the complaint preferred before a magistrate, where the prosecution has been commenced in that manner. The act provides, that <em>\u201c </em>all indictments which shall hereafter be brought or exhibited for any crime or misdemeanor \u2014 murder and voluntary manslaughter excepted \u2014 shall be brought or exhibited within the time and limitation hereafter expressed, and not after.\u201d If the statute had then simply proceeded to prescribe the limitation, it would not admit of any doubt, that the time when the bill is found is the period from which it must be computed. But it adds, so far as the law before us is concerned: \u201c that is to say, all indictments and prosecutions for all misdemeanors \u2014 perjury excepted \u2014 shall be brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>or exhibited within two years next after such misdemeanor shall have been committed.\u201d There must be admitted to be considerable ingenuity in the argument that the word \u201cindictments,\u201d employed in the first clause of the section, is explained and defined by what follows: \u201c All indictments \u2014 that is to say, all indictments and prosecutions.\u201d Prom the use of the phrase \u201c'brought or exhibited,\u201d it might be inferred that these words were intended to have a distributive application. So, also, the effects and consequences, which may be legitimately resorted to in the interpretation of a law, would seem to favor the conclusion that such was the meaning of the law-makers. The finding of a bill by a grand. jury may be delayed, without any fault on the part of the ofiicers of the Commonwealth or the private prosecutor, by inability to procure. the attendance of witnesses. They may keep out of the reach of process by collusion with the defendant. The act has no saving for such a case, though it has carefully guarded against the defendant\u2019s keeping himself out of the way. But in a statute of this character, it would be wrong to ground a construction upon such considerations. Astuteness must not be employed to narrow or take away a defence granted by law to a party accused of crime. The provisos which follow, indicate clearly, on the other hand, that the term prosecution is used as synonymous with indictment. An indictment is a prosecution; though standing by itself, prosecution has a larger signification. The first proviso speaks of the person \u201c against whom such <em>indictment </em>shall be brought or exhibited,\u201d as \u201c subject and liable to <em>prosecution </em>as aforesaid.\u201d Prosecution as aforesaid, can refer only to indictment. So also the language of the second proviso is, \u201c indictments may be commenced and prosecuted;\u201d which words show that where the terms \u201cindictments and prosecutions\u201d are used in other parts of the section, they can only be construed as words of synonymous import.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The order of the Court of Quarter Sessions quashing the indictment in this case, was a judgment of a court of record according to the course of the common law, and could only be removed to this court by a writ of error: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Beaumont, 4 Rawle 868; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Church, 1 Barr 105. As no objection was made to the proceeding by certiorari, we will consider the case as though it was regularly here by writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
