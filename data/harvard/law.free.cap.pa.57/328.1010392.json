If you find any one of these points against the plaintiff, then you need go no further, hut simply render a verdict for defendant.

That the contract of a married woman is void at law and no recovery can be had under such a contract in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-8\">\u201cAnswer:\"As a general principle the contract of a married woman is void, but she <em>is </em>liable thereon in the cases enumerated in our Acts of Assembly, as explained in the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-9\">\u201c 2. That a separate recovery cannot be had against a married woman who is joined in the action with her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-10\">\u201c 3. That a recovery, if at all, in this case must be had against the husband of defendant, as the law makes him liable for work and labor, done for his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-11\">\u201c 4. That the pleadings in this case show that the defendants are husband and wife, and as there is no issue joined as to him, there cannot be a separate verdict against the wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-12\">'\u201c 5. That under the pleadings in this case the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-13\">The court declined to charge as requested in the last four points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-14\">There was a verdict for plaintiff, and the court having entered judgment in his favor, this writ of error was sued out and errors assigned in declining to charge as requested in the 2d, 3d, 4th and 5th points as above noted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-15\"><em>A. Thompson, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZMb\">argued that the wife was not liable \u2014 that no replication had been filed to her plea of coverture, and that no declaration had been filed or issue joined as to the husband. He cited Glyde <em>v. </em>Keister, 8 Casey 85.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-16\"><em>L\u00faeas Hirst, </em>for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAV\">argued that the proceedings were regular and the charge correct. He cited Mahon <em>v. </em>Gormley, 12 Harris 80; Murray <em>v. </em>Keyes, 11 Casey 384; Parke <em>v. </em>Kleeber, 1 Wright 251; Gallagher <em>v. </em>Jackson, 1 S. &amp; R. 492.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b330-17\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b330-18\">A&amp;new, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az2e\">There is no inconsistency between the counts of the declaration. The averment that Mrs. Lippincott was authorized to become indebted to the plaintiff for the work and material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>furnished by him is not -inconsistent with the express averment that she herself requested \u25a0 the work to be done, and became indebted for it on account of its being necessary for her separate estate. It is simply an averment <em>ex majore cautela </em>to show the husband\u2019s express assent to the act of his wife, but the act is clearly and expressly averred to be hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The husband was regularly joined with the wife in the action and thus satisfied the legal requirement. That the wife may appeal and prosecute the action afterwards alone is fully sustained by the case of Murray <em>v. </em>Keyes, 11 Casey 384. See also 1 Wright 251; 1 S. &amp; R. 492. The declaration shows that the wife contracted the debt -and that it was contracted for that which was necessary to preservation and enjoyment of her separate estate.' Thus bringing the case within the decisions already cited. This is a sufficient answer to all the errors assigned, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
