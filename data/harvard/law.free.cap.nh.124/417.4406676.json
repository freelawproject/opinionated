We hold that there is no coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">The plaintiff, First Bank and Trust Company (the bank), has been sued by Robert and Janet Gardner by a writ containing three counts. Count one is based on breach of contract for failing to give proper advice in the spring of 1979 regarding the purchase by the Gardners of a certain business. The second count alleges that the bank acted negligently in giving advice and assistance in connection with the purchase, while the third claims a breach of fiduciary duty and bad faith by the bank in its encouraging the Gardners to purchase the business when it knew the price was inflated.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">An insurance policy issued to the bank by the defendant New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Hampshire Insurance Group contains a provision insuring against \u201cpersonal injury or advertising injury .. . arising out of the conduct of the named insured\u2019s business . .. .\u201d The defendant declined coverage, and the bank petitioned for a declaratory judgment to determine coverage. <em>See </em>RSA 491:22, :22-a. The matter was heard before a Master <em>{Robert A. Carignan, </em>Esq.) who, on an agreed statement of facts with accompanying depositions, issued a report finding no coverage and recommending that the plaintiff\u2019s petition be denied. The Superior Court <em>{Cann, </em>J.) accepted this recommendation and denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">After examining the provisions of the policy, the master concluded, contrary to the bank\u2019s contention, that \u201cthe mere explanation of bank services to a couple in a private office, cannot be considered \u2018advertising\u2019\u201d and that an alleged failure on the part of a bank properly to provide an advertised service does not result in an \u201cadvertising injury\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Upon review of the record, we find that with reference to the evidence before him, the master properly placed the burden on the insurer to prove that no coverage exists and correctly applied the standards appropriate to the interpretation of an insurance policy. <em>See generally Andrews v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>124 N.H. 148, 467 A.2d 254 (1983); <em>U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., Inc. v. Johnson Shoes, Inc., </em>123 N.H. 148, 153, 461 A.2d 85, 88 (1983). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
