For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the PUC\u2019s ruling and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">GSE is a public utility corporation, in the business of distributing and selling electric energy to customers in twenty-three New Hampshire cities and towns. In 1972, with the approval of the PUC, it incorporated a fuel adjustment clause (FAC) into its rate schedule in order to expedite its recovery of rapidly escalating costs of fuel that it used to generate electricity. Beginning in January 1972, the first month in which the clause was permitted, GSE adjusted the rates charged its customers each month in order to collect its estimated fuel expenses for that month. The estimate for each month was based exclusively on GSE\u2019s actual fuel expenses during an earlier month. The January 1972 FAC rate was based on expenses for December 1971. After 1975, the FAC rate for a given month was based on expenses incurred <em>two </em>months earlier <em>(e.g., </em>the rate for January 1977 was based on expenses for November 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Several other electric companies adopted an FAC in January 1972, but implemented it differently. Concord Electric Company (Concord) and Exeter and Hampton Electric Company (E&amp;H) deferred collecting revenue under the clause until March 1972. The purpose of this \u201ctwo-month lag\u201d was to permit direct matching of each month\u2019s fuel expenses with revenue collected two months later, and consequently, to ensure that any shortfall in revenue would be directly reflected in the companies\u2019 balance sheets. The PUC\u2019s rules effectively guaranteed that this type of shortfall would eventually be collected, either in the form of higher rates or through some other method. Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) originally used a current accounting method, but changed in 1975 to a deferred accounting method which resulted in the two-month lag.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Under GSE\u2019s system it was difficult to keep track of the difference between fuel expenses and FAC revenues, but that system had two significant advantages over the lag system. First, GSE collected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>revenue under the clause for two months when companies using the lag system collected nothing. Second, GSE\u2019s income statement was more realistic as a whole than that of the other three companies. While GSE\u2019s statement reflected its actual costs and revenues, the other companies carried uncollected fuel expenses on their books as \u201cdeferred income,\u201d thus artificially raising their apparent rate of return. The PUC found that this accounting difference produced significant benefits for GSE when GSE computed its actual rate of return for purposes of requesting a rate change from the PUC.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\">In 1980, the PUC ordered all four companies to convert to a new, \u201cforward-looking,\u201d adjustment clause. Under the new clause, each company estimates its fuel costs for a succeeding three-month period and sets its rates accordingly. Any over-collections or under-collections during that period are adjusted through rate increases or decreases in subsequent quarters. The clause is intended to reduce the occurrence of wide fluctuations in electric rates, thus making it easier for customers to budget their electric power costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The new clause did not of itself permit Concord, E&amp;H, and PSNH to collect the shortfall of revenue they had experienced under the two-month lag system. Accordingly, the PUC permitted all three companies to collect that shortfall by means of a temporary surcharge to be added to the new rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">GSE, in its 1981 petition to the PUC, sought a similar surcharge to recover $408,000 \u2014 the difference between its actual fuel expenses and its revenue under the FAC during 1980. The PUC denied the request, citing the above-mentioned advantages which GSE had enjoyed due to its not having used the two-month lag system. On rehearing, the PUC affirmed its decision, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We will not sustain such an appeal, except for errors of law, unless GSE demonstrates by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the PUC\u2019s decision was unjust or unreasonable or reflects an abuse of commission discretion. <em>Appeal of Ass\u2019n of N.H. Utilities, </em>122 N.H. 770, 772, 451 A.2d 164, 166 (1982); RSA 541:13.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">GSE argues that it was discriminatory and an abuse of discretion for the PUC to allow other companies to recover their fuel cost shortfalls through a surcharge while denying GSE the same privilege. GSE stresses that the PUC has never disputed the reality of GSE\u2019s $408,000 shortfall in 1980. It argues, in essence, that the two-month lag and the differences in accounting procedures between GSE and the other three companies are relevant only insofar as they affected the actual <em>amount </em>of each company\u2019s shortfall. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\"> This court has ruled that \u201callowance in some form must be made for increase in fuel costs shown to be inevitable.\u201d <em>Public Serv. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>Co. v. State, </em>113 N.H. 497, 502, 311 A.2d 513, 517 (1973). Such an allowance was made when GSE was permitted to adopt its fuel adjustment clause. Neither the statutes nor this court\u2019s decisions have imposed on the PUC a precise formula for the determination of rates. See <em>Legislative Util. Consumers\u2019 Council v. Public Util. Com., </em>117 N.H. 972, 974, 380 A.2d 1083, 1084 (1977). Rather, we have held that \u201c[t]he commission has broad discretion when weighing the wide variety of factors relevant to each case before it.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neil v. Public Util. Comm\u2019n, </em>119 N.H. 930, 935, 410 A.2d 244, 248 (1979). In this case, those factors included the benefits accruing from GSE\u2019s unique implementation of its FAC \u2014 no \u201cdeferred income\u201d to artificially raise its rate of return, and two extra months of FAC collections resulting in an improved cash-flow position.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">The PUC found that these benefits had sufficient impact (or <em>potential </em>impact) on GSE, <em>apart from </em>their effect on its fuel revenue shortfall, to compensate for GSE\u2019s failure to recover that shortfall. This finding is <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable. RSA 541:13. Since neither party produced any quantitative evidence regarding that impact, GSE has failed to show that the PUC has abused its discretion or that its decision was discriminatory, and thus has failed to meet its burden of proof under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">GSE further argues that it was unreasonable for the PUC to deny the surcharge and, at the same time, to accept a \u201cnormalizing adjustment\u201d in the amount of $408,000 which GSE added to its test-year revenues in its rate filing with the PUC. GSE alleges that the only purpose of this adjustment was to prevent double recovery of its fuel shortfall, once through the surcharge and once through the new rates that would be based on the test-year revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">It is clear from the record before us, however, that the purpose of the adjustment was to bring fuel expenses and revenues for the test year into the same relationship as they would have in future years under the new forward-looking clause. Failure to make the adjustment would have produced higher rates for the future based in part on past under-collections of FAC revenues, while at the same time the new FAC provided for automatic recovery of <em>future </em>under-collections. This would lead first to recovery of past under-collections and then to double recovery of future fuel expenses. As the State points out in its brief, \u201cthe Commission would certainly have made the pro forma adjustment to remove the shortfall from the test year even if [GSE] had not done so.\u201d Since GSE had no absolute right to recover its shortfall, the PUC\u2019s reasons for denying the surcharge are equally applicable to its refusal to delete the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b161-7\">Souter, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
