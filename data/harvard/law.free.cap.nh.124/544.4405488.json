In November 1982, the defendant was arrested and charged with driving while under the influence, second offense. RSA 265:82. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the January 1980 conviction on the ground that a conviction under the former statute, RSA 262-A:62, may not be used to support a second offense charge under the current statute, RSA 265:82. In essence, the defendant contends that <em>operating </em>a motor vehicle (the language of the former statute) is different from <em>driving </em>a motor vehicle (the language of the latter statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">When the legislature recodified the DWI statute in 1981, it provided that the word \u201cdrive\u201d \u201cshall mean to \u2018operate.\u2019\u201d RSA 259:24. Thus, we perceive no merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that by rewording the DWI statute in this respect the legislature effected a substantive change. Further, while other defendants have litigated the meaning of \u201coperate\u201d before this court, we have never drawn a distinction between the words \u201coperate\u201d and \u201cdrive.\u201d <em>See State v. O\u2019Malley, </em>120 N.H. 507, 416 A.2d 1387 (1980); <em>State v. Costello, </em>110 N.H. 182, 263 A.2d 671 (1970). We decline to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">We find the distinction relied upon by the defendant to be without substance and consequently hold that the first conviction is admissible at trial to support the second offense charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
