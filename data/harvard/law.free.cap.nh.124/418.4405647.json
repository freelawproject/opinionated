They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-14\">\u201c1. Has New Hampshire adopted the \u2018dual capacity\u2019 doctrine which permits an employer, normally shielded from tort liability by the exclusive remedy principle, to become liable in tort to his own employee if he acts, in addition to his capacity as an employer, in a second capacity conferring on him obligations independent of those imposed on him as employer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>2. Is the \u2018dual capacity\u2019 doctrine applicable in these circumstances where the injury sustained by the employee and arising in the course of employment is caused by a product manufactured by the employer and sold to the public in the stream of commerce?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Pursuant to the order of certification, our consideration of these questions is to be based upon the following circumstances and facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201c1. This is an action sounding in negligence and strict liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">2. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">3. The defendant is in the business of manufacturing and selling asbestos products in the stream of commerce to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">4. The plaintiff alleges that he has contracted asbestosis disease [for which he received workmen\u2019s compensation benefits].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">5. The plaintiff alleges that his contraction of asbestosis was proximately caused by his exposure to asbestos and asbestos products manufactured, supplied and sold by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-11\">6. The plaintiff admits that his exposure to asbestos occurred in the course of his employment, through handling and being in proximity to asbestos within the work environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">7. The plaintiff asserts that his suit against his employer, the defendant is not barred by New Hampshire RSA Ch. 281, Workmen\u2019s Compensation law by virtue of the \u2018dual capacity\u2019 doctrine recognized in the case of <em>Robbins v. Seekamp, </em>122 N.H. 318 (1982) and referred to in the case of <em>DePaolo v. Spaulding Fibre Co., </em>119 N.H. 89 (1979).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-13\">The defendant contends that plaintiff\u2019s suit is barred by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws and to allow this suit would undermine the purpose and alter the balance established by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">In <em>Robbins v. Seekamp, </em>122 N.H. 318, 444 A.2d 537 (1982), referring to <em>DePaolo v. Spaulding Fibre Co., </em>119 N.H. 89, 397 A.2d 1048 (1979), we said: \u201cThis court has recognized the fact that a plaintiff may, under certain limited circumstances, maintain an action against his employer ... in spite of the fact that the plaintiff has received workmen\u2019s compensation benefits as a result of the same injury,\u201d and we further stated that \u201c[t]he \u2018dual capacity\u2019 doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>trine permits an employer, normally shielded from tort liability by the exclusive remedy principle, to become liable in tort to his own employee if he acts, in addition to his capacity as an employer, in a second capacity conferring on him obligations independent of those imposed on him as employer.\u201d <em>Robbins v. Seekamp, </em>122 N.H. at 321, 444 A.2d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"> While <em>recognizing </em>the appropriateness of the application of the \u201cdual capacity\u201d doctrine in certain limited circumstances, we have not yet <em>adopted </em>this doctrine in the sense that we have not yet permitted an employee, who has received workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, to also maintain an action against his employer under this theory. <em>See Holzworth v. Fuller, </em>122 N.H. 643, 644-45, 448 A.2d 394, 395 (1982). Accordingly, we answer question No. 1 by stating that we have recognized the \u201cdual capacity\u201d doctrine but have not yet had facts presented to this court which would provide an opportunity to adopt the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">For purposes of responding to question No. 2, we are to assume, as the plaintiff admits, \u201cthat his exposure to asbestos occurred in the course of his employment, through handling and being in proximity to asbestos within the work environment.\u201d Based upon the circumstances and facts presented to this court, we are unable to find that the defendant manufacturer in this case acted \u201c... in a second capacity conferring on him obligations independent of those imposed on him as employer.\u201d We therefore answer \u201cno\u201d to question No. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
