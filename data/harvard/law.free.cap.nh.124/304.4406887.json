We hold that the plaintiffs sustained their burden and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-14\">The plaintiffs acquired two separate commercial properties in Kingston in 1969. In each year in question, the Town of Kingston (town) placed an assessed value on the properties for tax purposes and then applied the applicable tax rates. The plaintiffs disputed the assessments and instituted the appropriate administrative proceedings for each disputed year. Having exhausted their administrative remedies, the plaintiffs petitioned the superior court for an abatement of real estate taxes pursuant to RSA 76:17 (Supp. 1981). All five actions were consolidated for trial. The Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>(Nadeau, </em>J.) approved the Master\u2019s <em>(R. Peter Shapiro, </em>Esq.) recommendations and entered a decree granting tax abatements for the disputed years. The town appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">At trial, the plaintiffs sought to prove that their properties were being taxed disproportionately to other properties in the community by establishing the value of their properties for the years in question and then applying the applicable tax rates. The master found that the parties \u201cagreed [upon] the \u2018proportionality factor\u2019 supplied by the State in each of the tax years appealed .. . .\u201d At the hearing the master had indicated that the issue before him was only fair market value and not the percentages of proportionality. Counsel so agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">To determine the value of their properties, the plaintiffs relied on the so-called \u201cincome approach.\u201d The town utilized the \u201ccost less depreciation\u201d and the \u201ccomparable sales\u201d approaches to establish the fair market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\u201cPlaintiffs have the burden of showing that the assessment placed on the subject property was disproportionately higher in relation to its true value than was the case as to other property in the [town].\u201d <em>Berthiaume v. City of Nashua, </em>118 N.H. 646, 647, 392 A.2d 143, 144 (1978). The town argues that the master erred in relying exclusively on the \u201cincome approach\u201d to determine the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 property and that, had the master considered the \u201ccomparable sales\u201d and \u201ccost less depreciation\u201d approaches, the plaintiffs could not have satisfied their burden of proof as to disproportionality. The town\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\u201cThe statutes of the State are silent about the methods to be used in the valuation of property for taxes, and this court therefore permits considerable leeway.\u201d <em>Appeal of Anderson, </em>120 N.H. 749, 751, 422 A.2d 1043, 1045 (1980). \u201cIn abatement petitions, the trial court is empowered to make a determination of the subject property\u2019s market value, and all evidence before the court relating to valuation should be considered.\u201d <em>Brickman v. City of Manchester, </em>119 N.H. 919, 920, 409 A.2d 1328, 1329-30 (1979) (citations omitted). \u201cThere are three generally-accepted methods of valuing real estate: the replacement cost [cost less depreciation] approach, the comparable sales method, and the capitalization of income approach.\u201d <em>Town of Croydon v. Current Use Advisory Bd., </em>121 N.H. 442, 446, 431 A.2d 126, 129 (1981). \u201cHowever, the court is not foreclosed from choosing a particular method to the exclusion of others.\u201d <em>Brickman v. City of Manchester, supra </em>at 920, 409 A.2d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\"> In the instant case, the master considered all three methods of valuation. He stated that, given the condition of the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ject property, \u201c[t]he least reliable approach to value is that of \u2018cost less depreciation.'\u201d He further stated that although the \u201c\u2018market data \u2014 comparable sales\u2019 approach to value tends to be the most reliable, . . . [the] method is not the most reliable for the subject property.\u201d The master\u2019s report discusses several good reasons for relying <em>on </em>the \u201cincome\u201d approach rather than the alternative methods. The determination of which method of valuation to use in assessing particular property is for the trial court, and \u201cwe will not overturn [its] decision if there is a reasonable basis for using the valuation method chosen.\u201d <em>Town of Croydon v. Current Use Advisory Bd., supra </em>at 446, 431 A.2d at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
