Howard, Jr., filed a petition in the superior court seeking a modification of a permanent custody decree. The petition was heard by a Master <em>(Earl J. Dear-born, </em>Esq.), and his recommendation granting the defendant temporary custody was approved by the Superior Court <em>(Temple, </em>J.). The plaintiff appealed, claiming several errors were committed by the master. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">The parties were divorced in 1978, and permanent custody of the two children was awarded to the mother, the plaintiff herein. The defendant subsequently applied to the superior court for a modification of the decree, requesting that he be granted permanent physical custody of the children. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff was an unfit mother because she drank excessively, abused her children and fought with her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-15\">At trial, the defendant presented the testimony of witnesses to support these allegations, and this evidence was contradicted by testimony the plaintiff proffered. The master-admitted into evidence and reviewed the report of the guardian ad litem, the examination of a psychiatrist and several other exhibits, including hospital records. The master concluded that \u201cthe evidence indicated that the children have been abused by someone in the household.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The master recommended joint legal custody of the children, physical custody with the defendant, and liberal visitation rights by the plaintiff. The master also recommended that custody ought to be reviewed after six months, on the plaintiff\u2019s motion. The plaintiff moved for a stay of the order pending review by this court. The master recommended approval of the stay, which was approved by the Superior Court <em>(Nadeau, </em>J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The plaintiff contends that the master\u2019s decision should be reversed because there were insufficient findings of fact, the evidence did not warrant a modification, the wrong legal standard was applied, and the guardian ad litem\u2019s report was impermissibly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> We will not reverse the master merely because he did not make detailed findings of fact. In <em>Society for Protection of N.H. Forests v. Site Evaluation Comm., </em>115 N.H. 163, 173, 337 A.2d 778, 786 (1975), we stated that \u201c[w]hile this court has repeatedly recognized the need for basic findings supported by the record, it has not mandated detailed and specific reasons for the basic findings.\u201d <em>See also Pugliese v. Town of Northwood, </em>119 N.H. 743, 749, 408 A.2d 113, 117 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\"> Furthermore, we do not consider the master\u2019s apparently inadvertent failure to answer one of the twenty-nine requests for findings of fact fatal to his decision or violative of RSA 491:15. The purpose of RSA 491:15 is to provide a simple method of presenting the appellate court with questions of law for review. <em>See Concord, General Mut. Ins. Co. v. Haynes, </em>110 N.H. 76, 79, 260 A.2d 99, 101 (1969). Although findings of fact that explain the trier\u2019s underlying rationale would be more helpful, the master\u2019s decision here satisfied the minimum required by RSA 491:15.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The plaintiff argues that the liberal visitation rights and the granting of the stay are inconsistent with the modification order, and support her contention that the order should be vacated. The standard for modification of custody orders that we articulated in <em>Perreault v. Cook, </em>114 N.H. 440, 443, 322 A.2d 610, 612 (1974) (\u201ca strong possibility that the child will be harmed\u201d) does not apply only to physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The master found in this case that the children were in danger of <em>both </em>physical and psychological harm. This finding could well reflect the master\u2019s recognition that there was a danger of long-term psychological harm if the children were to continue living with the mother. The finding may also indicate his realization that physical abuse is less likely to occur during visits than when a parent is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>faced with the usual day-to-day parental stresses. Viewed in this light, we cannot say that the master\u2019s modification order is inconsistent with giving the plaintiff liberal visitation rights. <em>See Taylor v. Davidson Rubber Co., </em>122 N.H. 428, 433, 445 A.2d 1119, 1122 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"> The plaintiff next argues that the evidence did not warrant a modification of the decree. This court has said that the trial court or master \u201chas wide discretion in divorce matters . . . [and] that we will not disturb its determination if it could reasonably be made.\u201d <em>Chasan v. Mintz, </em>119 N.H. 865, 867, 409 A.2d 787, 788 (1979). <em>See </em>C. Douglas, 3 New Hampshire Practice: Family Law 209 (1982). In considering this case, the master heard conflicting testimony regarding the plaintiff\u2019s actions, including allegations of child abuse, alcohol abuse, and fights with her boyfriend. In addition, the master reviewed reports of the guardian ad litem and the psychiatrist. We cannot say that the record presented to us \u201cclearly demonstrates an abuse of discretion\u201d by the master, <em>Chasan v. Mintz, </em>119 N.H. at 867, 409 A.2d at 788, and, therefore, we do not disturb his findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> The plaintiff contends that the master committed reversible error in failing to apply the \u201cstrong possibility the child will be harmed\u201d standard of <em>Perreault v. Cook, </em>114 N.H. 440, 443, 322 A.2d 610, 612 (1974). When this standard was enunciated, we did not contemplate the development of magic words that would have to be used in every decision for it to withstand appellate review. The master in the instant case found that \u201cthere is a present danger to the welfare of the children, both physically and psychologically.\u201d The master\u2019s finding of \u201ca present danger\u201d is more compelling than would be a finding of \u201cstrong possibility\u201d under Perreault; therefore, we will not disturb his decision on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The plaintiff also contends that the report of the guardian ad litem should not have been admitted into evidence because it contained hearsay, was prejudicial, denied her the right to confront witnesses, and denied her due process. The role of the guardian ad litem is to \u201cclarify issues, minimize conflict, facilitate understanding and acceptance between the parties, help the child to form a decision (or to accept one) and attempt to facilitate settlement. . . .\u201d C. Douglas, 3 New Hampshire Practice: Family Law 215 (1982). In order to perform these functions, the guardian ad litem should obtain a composite view of the child; thus he should contact persons familiar with the child because each may have a different view that should be considered. It is apparent that if the guardian ad litem is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>to perform these functions effectively, he or she will need a great deal of flexibility. To impose a set of rigid restrictions on guardians ad litem would defeat the purpose for which they are appointed under RSA 458:17-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">The plaintiff inappropriately relies on <em>Provencal v. Provencal, </em>122 N.H. 793, 451 A.2d 374 (1982), to support her contention that the admission of the guardian ad litem\u2019s report was reversible error. In <em>Provencal, </em>we held that \u201cthe secrecy surrounding the guardian ad litem\u2019s report deprived the plaintiff of her right to challenge its contents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797, 451 A.2d at 377. In the present case, the guardian ad litem\u2019s report was not withheld from the plaintiff, nor was she prevented from examining the guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The plaintiff also relies on <em>Provencal </em>to support her argument that the guardian ad litem must disclose the names of all the parties providing information. This reliance is also misplaced. Although we held in <em>Provencal </em>that the \u201cparental interest in disclosure outweighs the need for anonymity,\u201d we also said that \u201c[guardians, of course, may choose to leave out certain names of individuals who seek anonymity because of familial or other close ties that might inhibit candor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we conclude that the report of the guardian ad litem was properly admitted by the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Finally, we turn to two procedural issues that arose in this case: the propriety of the master\u2019s staying his order pending appeal and of his issuance of the order on a temporary basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In <em>Hille v. Hille, </em>116 N.H. 109, 112, 352 A.2d 703, 706 (1976), we held that \u201cthe trial court may well consider entry of a stay of the effective date of the order, if it appears that appellate review will be sought and pursued.\u201d These directions apparently have generated some confusion concerning the discretionary or mandatory nature of a decision to stay. To clarify, we now hold that the decision whether to issue a stay is discretionary, but that in no instance should a stay be issued when it would place the child in imminent danger of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\"> In this case, the master\u2019s order was subject to review in six months. This is not the preferred procedure in custody cases. The emotional trauma that children are subject to during custody disputes can have long-lasting psychological effects and, thus, should be avoided whenever possible. <em>See </em>C. DOUGLAS, 3 New Hampshire Practice: Family Law 201 (1982); <em>Hille, supra at </em>111, 352 A.2d at 705. Normally, if custody is changed on permanent orders, it is permanently changed. Temporary orders may well be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>needed in the exceptional case; however, the court should set forth its rationale therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b288-6\">Souter, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
