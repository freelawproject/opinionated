RSA 632-A:2 (Supp. 1981); RSA 626:8. The sole question is the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding of penetration. We uphold the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">It appears undisputed that Bushey attempted forcible intercourse with the thirteen-year-old girl, and that the defendant was present at the time and assisted in undressing the girl. The only question is whether there was penetration. Penetration is defined as \u201c[a]ny intrusion, however slight, of any part of the actor\u2019s body or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>object manipulated by the actor into the genital or anal openings of the victim\u2019s body.\u201d RSA 632-A:l, V(e) (Supp. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\">In determining whether the evidence is sufficient, we must consider all the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution and uphold the verdict unless we conclude that no rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that there was penetration. <em>State v. Reardon, </em>121 N.H. 604, 431 A.2d 796 (1981); <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Although the victim was \u201cnot exactly sure\u201d where Bushey\u2019s penis touched her body, she did say that her vagina \u201churted\u201d when he tried to put his \u201cthing\u201d in her. Bushey was interrupted when the victim\u2019s parents entered the apartment. They found her standing naked in the kitchen and Bushey hiding under the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The doctor who examined the victim shortly after the incident testified that in his opinion she had been raped. He described the labia of the vagina as looking \u201cvery swollen, a lot more red than normal, [and it] glistened with a moist kind of fluid.\u201d He found no bruises in the area, \u201cbut towards the back half of the vagina, towards the rectal area, it looked split.\u201d \u201cA milky fluid . . . was discharging from the patient\u2019s vagina.\u201d A lab report on this fluid revealed the presence of sperm, as well as a chemical which normally comes from ejaculate. It was the doctor\u2019s opinion that there had been penetration, but he conceded that he was not infallible.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The jury could find that, because the fluid coming from inside the victim\u2019s vagina contained sperm and a chemical normally coming from ejaculate, there was penetration sufficient to meet the requirements of RSA 632-A:l, V(e) (Supp. 1981). The swelling and redness of the vaginal labia further support the conclusion that there was penetration, \u201chowever slight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Considering all of the evidence, we cannot say that no reasonable trier of fact could find penetration beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b262-9\">Souter, J., did not participate.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
