After a jury trial in Superior Court <em>(Contas, </em>J.), the defendant was found guilty of driving without proof of financial responsibility, and a mistrial was declared on the DWI charge after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The defendant appeals the failure of the trial court, during the jury selection process, to propound specific <em>voir dire </em>questions to the jury <em>venire. </em>We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">Prior to trial, defense counsel requested that the court ask members of the jury <em>venire </em>if any of them had ever been the victim of an automobile accident in which the other party involved \u201cwas not insured or not in a position to pay for damages done because I would expect that those people might harbor some ill feelings towards people who drive without insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number> After a brief colloquy between the court and defense counsel, the court ruled: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary, Mr. Volinsky. I\u2019ve had those proposed before and I\u2019m going to go by the statute and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s absolutely necessary and your exception is noted.\u201d The statute the court referred to is RSA 500-A:12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">\u201cI. Any juror may be required by the court, on motion of a party in the case to be tried, to answer upon oath if he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">(a) Expects to gain or lose upon the disposition of the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">(b) Is related to either party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">(c) Has advised or assisted either party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">(d) Has directly or indirectly given his opinion or has formed an opinion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">(e) Is prejudiced to any degree regarding the case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">(f) Employs any of the counsel appearing in the case in any action then pending in the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-12\">II. If it appears that any juror is not indifferent, he shall be set aside on that trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">RSA 500-A:12 is skeletal and must be supplemented, because our courts do not generally permit counsel to conduct <em>voir dire </em>directly, by questions targeted to the particular bias that might be involved in a given case. The United States Supreme Court recently observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-14\">\u201cOne touchstone of a fair trial is an impartial trier of fact \u2014 \u2018a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it.\u2019 <em>Voir dire </em>examination serves to protect that right by exposing possible biases, both known and unknown, on the part of potential jurors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-15\"><em>McDonough Power Equipment Inc. v. Greenwood, </em>104 S. Ct. 845, 849 (1984) (quoting <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 217 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">The trial court\u2019s questions must reveal the surface information necessary to furnish an intelligent basis for counsel\u2019s exercise of challenges based on a lack of impartiality. <em>See United States v. Baldwin, </em>607 F.2d 1295, 1297 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Segal, </em>534 F.2d 578, 581 (3d Cir. 1976). Without sufficient information, counsel cannot use their challenges in an intelligent and meaningful manner, and the <em>voir dire </em>is rendered \u201can empty ritual.\u201d <em>United States v. Rucker, </em>557 F.2d 1046, 1048 (4th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-17\"> The choice of questions to be asked on <em>voir dire </em>is a matter within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Soucy v. Koustas, </em>120 N.H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>381, 382, 415 A.2d 335, 335 (1980). In the instant case, however, the trial judge applied a blanket prohibition to the questions that defense counsel attempted to propose. This denial, rather than a proper exercise of discretion, is a failure to exercise discretion and, thus, an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
