On motion to open the biddings upon the sale of certain real estate, and for a re-sale.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-5\"><em>Janes, Lake \u00a3 Boyd, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-6\"><em>Daniel Rogers, </em>(guardian <em>ad litem </em>for infant heirs) for defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-7\">For the motion, D. Rogers contended :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-8\">1st. That, from the analogy of the law, providing for the setting aside sales by executors, it would seem that this court has the power of opening the biddings, uppa an advance of ten per cent, beyond the price for which the property was sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-9\">2d. That, according to the English chancery practice, opening bid-dings is a matter of course, when an advance of ten percent, is offered. (See <em>3 </em>Daniel\u2019s Chancery Practice, 923, and cases there cited).</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-10\">3d. That, inasmuch as the plaintiff was the purchaser, (his being the only bid,), and the defendants mostly infants, the present cas\u00e9 calls for the interference of the discretionary powers invested in courts, exercising chancery power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-11\">4th. That although, the courts of New York have not adopted the English practice in opening biddings, yet, in extraordinary cases, they will do it. 2 <em>Paige\u2019s Chancery R. </em>99; 3 <em>Johnson\u2019s Chancery R. </em>290; 13 <em>Wendell\u2019s R. </em>224.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-12\">D. Lake, opposing the motion, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-13\">There are not many reported cases to be found, in either the English- or American books, where judicial sales are sought to be opened.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-14\">The cases in which .such practice most usually occurs, are cases of probate sales. And in them, the practice is usually founded on some express provision of the statute regulating such sales, as in our own state. (See Comp. Laws, page 401 \u00a7 119.) The rule in these cases is absolute and certain. No discretion - is left in the oourt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-15\">We do not find in the books any reported cases of application to open a.partition sale. We can only assume that the power of the court is analogous to that exercised in mortgage cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-16\">It is undeniably the practice in England to open biddings at master\u2019s sales, prior to a confirmation and sometimes \u2022 even after confirmation. In the first case, upon amere advance upon the former bid, and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>second, upon such advance, and some circumstanees showing surpriss or mistake, or fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-4\">The manner of conducting the sal\u00a9 in England is very different from ours, and opening the biddings is as much <em>&amp; </em>part of the machinery of a judicial sale there, as is the mating of a deed to the purchaser. For description of both the English aad American modes of making sales, by the master, see) remarks of senator Mason, in the case of Collier vs. Whipple, 13 <em>Wend. p. </em>233.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-5\">The English practice has never been followed in this country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-6\">Mere inadequacy of price is not here deemed <em>&amp; </em>sufficient ground for opening a sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-7\">See Williamson vs. Dale, 3 Johns, <em>C. </em>C. 290 ; White vs. Floyd, <em>1 Spier\u2019s Eq. R. </em>(New Jersey) 355 ; Dunear vs. Dodd, <em>2 Paige C. R. </em>99; 2 <em>Hoffman\u2019s Ch. </em>Prac. 146 ; Young vs. League, 1 <em>Bailey\u2019s Eq. </em>(So. Carolina) 17 ; Dick vs. Cooper, 24 <em>Penn. </em>222 ; Wertzel vs Fry, 4 <em>Dall. </em>218 (2d Ed. p. 209 ;) Glenn vs. Clapp, 11 <em>Gill and J. </em>1 <em>(Maryland:) </em>House vs. Walker, 4 <em>Md. Ch. Decis. </em>62.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-8\">We further contend, that this is a statutory proceeding, and' that no provision is made in the statute for opening the sale. The sale is to be to the highest bidder, at the time and place contained in the notice. See practice act, \u00a7 287.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-9\">The only ground for refusing a confirmation of the sale, to bis found in the statute, is contained in \u00a7 295, of same act, and that is not this case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b259-10\">Norton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK9\">In this case certain real estate, in the city of Ban Francisco, was sold under an order of the court, to effect a partition. Some of the parties in interest are infants. The property sold for \u00a715,-000, and since then; responsible persons have offered to bid \u00a717,000, in case a re-sale is' ordered, for which a motion is now made.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">In England it is the custom to open the bids, in case an advance of ten per cent, is offered. In this country, the courts have refused to adopt this custom, and it seems for good reasons. (Duncan vs. Dodd. 2 <em>Paige, </em>99; Collier vs. Whipple, 13 <em>Wend. </em>232.) In ease of fraud or surprise, or where the property of infant\u00ae had been manifestly sacrificed by the neglect of their guardians, relief may be granted, but this is not a case of that kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">Motion denied, and report of sale confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
