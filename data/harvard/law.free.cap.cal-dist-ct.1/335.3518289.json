It is not alleged that the defendants have any claim against the plaintiffs, nor do they pretend to have any. 2 <em>Story Eq. </em>Jur., \u00a71437; Aiken vs. Satterlee, 1 Paige, 289 ; Lindsay vs. Jackson, 2 <em>ib., </em>582 ; Gay vs. Gay, 10 <em>ib., </em>376 ; Murray vs. Toland, 3 <em>Johns.

Eq., </em>306; Bunting vs. Richs, 2 <em>ib., </em>130; Clark vs. Cost, 1 <em>Craig &amp; Phil., </em>154 ; Howe vs. Sheppard, 2 <em>Sumner, </em>409 ; Genley vs. Jones, 6 <em>J. J. March, </em>153.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-7\">Bor is it even alleged that plaintiffs are owners of the <em>\"</em>Madonna,\u201d against which defendant\u2019s judgment is taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">II. Plaintiffs allege that in another court they obtained judgment against the \u201c Elvira,\u201d for a collision by the \u201c Elvira \u201d <em>against </em>the \u201c Madonnabut, by the judgment of this court, it appears that -the \"Madonna \u201d <em>caused </em>the collision, which record they cannot evade,</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-9\">III. The right of. set off in equity is in the <em>discretion </em>of the court. To admit a set off of plaintiff\u2019s judgment would be to admit its equity, and of necessity the injustice of the judgment of this court. Can this court thus stultify its own decision ? Davidson vs. Geoghagan, 3 <em>Bibb, </em>233 ; Scott vs. Rivers, 1 <em>Stur. &amp; </em>Porter, 24 ; Burns vs. Thornburgh, 3 <em>Waits, </em>78 ; Tolbert vs. Harrison, 1 Bailey, 599 ; Coye vs. State Bank, 3 Hal., 172.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-12\">IY. Defendant\u2019s judgment having been obtained after plaintiff\u2019s, and, it is alleged, for the same cause of action, plaintiffs should have pleaded their judgment in bar of the action against them, and having failed to do so, have no standing in a court of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-13\">Y. Their submitting to a second trial in this court was a <em>waiver </em>of .their decree, obtained in admiralty, and was like voluntarily assenting to a new trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-14\">YI. There was no right of the plaintiffs to a set off when the assignment to the defendant, Brooks, was made. If he had collected the judgment, he would have been entitled to appropriate the money to pay the debt due him from Conway,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Having secured also the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>title, his right is superior in equity.

If there was any validity in plaintiffs\u2019 judgment, they should have assigned it to the present owners of the \u201c Madonna,\u201d or to whoever else is liable to pay it. Gilman vs. Slycksal, 7 Cowen, 469 ; see also <em>2 Story Eq. Jur., </em>\u00a7\u00a71435-36 ; Green vs. Darling, 5 <em>Mason, </em>201; Pierson vs. Meany, 3 <em>A. K.

A bill in equity is' the proper proceeding to set off two debts, where there is any claim of a third party to interfere with an ordinary motion for'a set off. Simpson vs. Hart, 14 <em>Johns, </em>74; Gay vs. Gay, 10 <em>Paige, </em>369 ; Barbor vs. Spencer, 11 Paige, 517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">II. The party should proceed in the court where the judgment against him is obtained. Cook vs. Smith, 7 <em>Hill, </em>186.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-7\">III. The parties against and in favor of whom these judgments are obtained, are substantially the same. There is as much identity as exists in the case of Barrett vs. Barrett, 8 <em>Pick., </em>341, and Driggs vs. Rockwell, 11 <em>Wend., </em>504. The \u201c Madonna \u201d is a mere nominal party. A judgment against a party\u2019s property is a judgment against him, for here lie cannot be held hut by his property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-8\">IV. As to the assignment to Brooks, see <em>Practice </em>Act, \u00a7 5 ; Green vs. Hatch, 12 <em>Miss., </em>195 ; Jenkins vs. Brewster, 14 <em>ib., </em>294 ; Jones vs. White, 13 <em>ib., </em>307; Barbor vs. Spencer, 11 <em>Paige, </em>517; Gay vs. Gay, 10 <em>ib., </em>396 ; Duncan vs. Bloomstock, 2 <em>McCord, </em>318; Williams vs. Evans, <em>ib., </em>203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-9\">V. An assignment to defendant\u2019s <em>attorney </em>cannot defeat plaintiffs\u2019 right of set off. Cooper vs. Bigelow, 1 Cowen, 206 ; Crocker vs. Claughly, 2 <em>Duer, </em>684 ; and particularly Morris vs. Hollis, 2 <em>Harrington, (De</em>l) 4.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-15\"> For legal services rendered in the conduct of the cause</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b345-10\">Norton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afc\">This is a bill addressed to the chancery powers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>court, to offset judgments. It appears that defendant, Conway, i\u00e1 insolvent, and a wholly irresponsible person. It is well settled, upon authority, that in cases of counter claims of this kind, between two parties, and especially if one is insolvent, courts, endowed with chancery powers, will employ them to offset the claims at the instance of the responsible party; and the bill being filed by Russell in this instance, it presents a proper case for the exercise of the equity jurisdiction of the court. There are several objections, which have been raised by defendant\u2019s counsel, of which the principal is, that the action in which Conway obtained his judgment, was not against Russell, but against the \u201c Madonna.\u201d But the judgment is substantially against Russell'. Making a vessel a defendant is but a legal fiction. The owner is the real party.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The fact that the act which authorizes this proceeding, also allows <em>him </em>to come in and defend, and requires the surplus proceeds of a sale te be paid to him, would seem to show that the law contemplates him as' the real defendant, to such an extent, that, in an action like the present, this-objection cannot he well sustained. The next point is, that, even if if he conceded, that a judgment against a <em>vessel </em>will authorize her <em>owner </em>to offset it, yet in this case it is not distinctly averred that plaintiffs are owners of the \"Madonna.\u201d Although this is not done in \u25a0.express terms, yet it is alleged that Conway\u2019s action was brought against the \u201c Madonna;\u201d \u201c the property of the plaintiffs,\u201d and also that the plaintiff is bound to pay the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">I think these are sufficient.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
