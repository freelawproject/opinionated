Krieger, a Montgomery County police officer. Although appellant Montgomery County (County) has presented us with three questions for review, we believe that the resolution of this appeal essentially boils down to two questions, which we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-10\">I. Was the administrative disciplinary action taken against appellee in violation of principles of double jeopardy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-11\">II. Was the administrative disciplinary action taken against appellee in violation of Maryland\u2019s Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights [LEOBR]? Responding in the negative to these questions, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The facts are largely undisputed. On October 3, 1994, appellee fueled her police cruiser at the fuel site of the Seven Locks Maintenance Facility\u2014a county-owned facility. While she was pumping gasoline into the cruiser, appellee heard a radio dispatch for another motor unit to respond to an accident involving property damage. Appellee notified the dispatcher that she would assist that unit with the call and then continued to fuel the cruiser. Shortly thereafter, the radio dispatch was upgraded to a personal injury accident authorizing a \u201ccode 3 emergency\u201d response.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In appellee\u2019s words, the following then happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">I then left the gas pumps abruptly at that point because I had to go red light and siren to the accident. At that point I must of heard a noise and looked in my rear view mirror and I saw the gas pump nozzle and hose fly up in the air and obviously then I stopped and went back and realized that I had left the pump action in my car before I took off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOM\">As a result of pulling away without removing the fuel hose nozzle from her car, the nozzle was damaged. The grand total for repairing the nozzle was $414.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Later that day, appellee reported the incident to her supervisor, Corporal Paul Sterling, and Sterling issued a Memorandum of Notification to appellee advising her that certain documents relating to the incident would be placed in her personnel file. These documents were: (1) a \u201cMotor Vehicle Accident or Loss Notice,\u201d (2) a Supervisor\u2019s Incident Investigation Report (SUR), and (3) a Form 242 Internal Investigation Notification (first Form 242).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee signed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Memorandum of Notification, the SIIR, and the Form 242. Appellee handwrote the words \u201cunder duress\u201d immediately below her signatures on each of these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Of particular interest in this case is the SIIR dated October 3, 1994. The SIIR is a County government form, the heading of which states: \u201cMontgomery County Government Department of Finance \u2022 Division of Risk Management.\u201d The record indicates that the SIIR is not restricted to police use. The SIIR is evidently used for documenting incidents involving damage to County property or injury to County personnel. In this case, it appears that both Sterling and appellee recorded on the SIIR all of the relevant information pertaining to the damage to the fuel hose nozzle. At a section of the SIIR calling for a description of the incident in the \u201cEmployee\u2019s Words,\u201d appellee provided a handwritten explanation of the incident. Appellee signed her name \u201cunder duress\u201d beneath this explanation. In another section calling for the supervisor to explain the steps \u201ctaken to prevent a recurrence,\u201d Sterling handwrote the word \u201cCounseled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The record reflects that the October 3, 1994 incident was not the first time appellee drove away without removing the fuel hose nozzle from her cruiser. In this regard, the record contains a SIIR dated January 20, 1994, which reveals that appellee accidently failed to remove the fuel nozzle from her vehicle before pulling away from the pump station on January 20, 1994. As with the October 3, 1994 SIIR, the January 20, 1994 SIIR indicates that appellee was counselled to prevent a recurrence of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>On October 11, 1994, appellee received another Form 242 (second Form 242) regarding the nozzle incident. On this form, Lieutenant David Buchanan is designated as the investigating officer. The form further indicates that the \u201cnature of the investigation is: <em>FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE REFUELING OF YOUR POLICE VEHICLE AND DAMAGE DONE TO THE FUEL PUMP NOZZLE/VEHICLE AT SEVEN LOCKS GARAGE REFUELING STATION ON OCTOBER 3, 199L\u201d </em>(Italicized indicates Buchanan\u2019s handwriting). Appellee signed the second Form 242, but did not indicate that her signature was \u201cunder duress.\u201d In all other respects, the second Form 242 is identical to the first Form 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">On November 2, 1994, Buchanan conducted a tape recorded interrogation of appellee. A Fraternal Order of Police representative represented appellee during the interrogation. During the interrogation, the following exchange between Buchanan and appellee\u2019s representative occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">BUCHANAN: The first [Form] 242 that I have here was dated 10/3/94 and it appears to be from Cpl. Paul Sterling of the Rockville District, Shift 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">REP.: And this [Form] 242 is investigating the events, what transpired with [appellee] reference a gas pump and her cruiser at Seven Locks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">BUCHANAN: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">REP.: So it\u2019s the same incident in which you are investigating that had already been investigated by Cpl. Sterling?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">BUCHANAN: At least investigated enough for this SIIR, that is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">REP.: It was investigated by Cpl. Sterling. It is my understanding and we have written documentation that Cpl. Sterling orally admonished [appellee]. There is ... documentation in the SIIR report that indicates that she was counselled, it\u2019s inserted in her personnel file, is a form of punishment and it is our belief ... [that] this investigation being continued by you is a violation of [LEOBR]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>BUCHANAN: I understand your objection to this. I\u2019m looking at the SIIR dated 10/3/94, it does indicate that she was counselled. Counselling is not a form of punishment[.] [Therefore, there has been no punishment ... so I would disagree with you in that area[.] [HJenceforth the investigation will proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Ultimately, on December 7, 1994, Major Carol A. Mehrling, the Acting Chief of Police, issued a memorandum to appellee informing her that the allegations against her\u2014namely that appellee failed to take proper care of equipment and failed to adhere to a departmental directive reminding officers to remove the gas nozzle before driving away\u2014were sustained, and that her punishment would be a $400 fine. Refusing to accept this action, appellee requested an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Accordingly, an Administrative Hearing Board (Board) was convened on March 24, 1995. The formal allegations against appellee for the Board\u2019s consideration were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqX\">\n<em>ALLEGATION 1 MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac6\">DEPARTMENT RULES, FUNCTION CODE 300, III, RULE 17 A. \u201cEMPLOYEES WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PROPER CARE, USE AND MAINTENANCE OF ALL UNIFORMS, VEHICLES, WEAPONS/FIREARMS, AND EQUIPMENT IN THEIR CHARGE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\"><em>SPECIFICATION: TO WIT: </em>Department of Transportation alleges that on October 3,1994, the respondent drove away from the Seven Locks refueling site without removing the gas nozzle from the vehicle tank, causing damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASB\">\n<em>ALLEGATION 2\u2014CONFORMANCE TO LAW</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">DEPARTMENT RULES, FUNCTION CODE 300, III, RULE 1. \u201cEMPLOYEES ARE REQUIRED TO ADHERE TO DEPARTMENTAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, DEPARTMENTAL DIRECTIVES AND MEMORANDUMS [sic], MONTGOMERY COUNTY PERSONNEL REGULATIONS, COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES, EXECUTIVE ORDERS, MONTGOMERY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>COUNTY CODE, AND TO CONFORM TO ALL LAWS APPLICABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\"><em>Reference: </em>Departmental Directive, Function Code 421.C, Vehicle Maintenance/Care, III K.4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cALL OFFICERS ARE REMINDED TO REMOVE THE GAS NOZZLE AND REPLACE IT BEFORE DRIVING AWAY FROM THE FUEL SITE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\"><em>SPECIFICATION: TO WIT: </em>On October 3, 1994, respondent drove away from the Seven Locks r\u00e9fueling station without removing the gas nozzle from the vehicle tank, causing damage to the gas hose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">During the March 24, 1995 hearing, the Board heard testimony from various individuals and received evidence. Sterling was one of those who testified. With respect to his \u201cCounseled\u201d remark on the October 3, 1994 SIIR, Sterling explained, \u201cI just spoke to her regarding the importance of paying more attention when fueling up her vehicle and leaving the pumps, to make an effort in the future to make sure that before she pulls away, that the nozzle is not in the filler spout on the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Following the hearing, the Board issued a memorandum dated March 27, 1995 to Mehrling. This memorandum contains the Board\u2019s findings of fact and concludes that appellee was guilty of both allegations. Moreover, the Board recommended to Mehrling that disciplinary action should be in the form of \u201closs of pay in the amount of $150.\u201d Mehrling concurred with the Board\u2019s recommendation of a \u201cfine of $150.00,\u201d and ordered appellee that the \u201cfine must be paid no later than May 15,1995, or Payroll Deduction papers executed by that date.\u201d We shall refer to Mehrling\u2019s decision as the Chiefs final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Unsatisfied with this outcome, appellee filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. On appeal, appellee argued that the Chiefs final decision must be reversed for essentially two reasons. First, appellee contended that the Chief was without legal authority to levy a fine against her as a form of punishment for this infraction. Second, appellee asserted that LEOBR and principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>double jeopardy prohibit successive penalties for the same incident. In this regard, appellee maintained that the $150 fine was an illegal successive punishment\u2014the first punishment allegedly being the counselling and placement of the aforementioned documentation in her personnel file.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The County responded that neither counselling nor the placement of the documentation in appellee\u2019s record constituted punishment as contemplated under LEOBR or the constitutional doctrine of double jeopardy. Additionally, the County argued that the Chiefs final decision\u2014whether considered to be the docking of pay or the levying of a fine\u2014was legally authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On August 10,1995, the circuit court heard argument on the petition for review. At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court ruled that the placement of the documents in appellee\u2019s personnel file constituted punishment. As a result, the circuit court considered the events following the issuance of the initial Form 242 as a second prosecution and the $150 fine as a second penalty. This, according to the circuit court, \u201cconstitutes violation of the principles of double jeopardy, which I do believe apply to these types of actions.\u201d Accordingly, the circuit court reversed the Chiefs final decision. In so doing, however, the circuit court expressly declined to determine whether the levying of a monetary fine was authorized.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">From the circuit court\u2019s order, the County appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Before addressing the merits of this appeal, it shall prove useful to present a brief overview of LEOBR. In <em>Maryland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number><em>State Police v. Resh, </em>65 Md.App. 167, 173-74, 499 A.2d 1303 (1985), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\">The LEOBR was enacted in 1974 by the General Assembly to ensure that law enforcement officers were accorded certain procedural guarantees during any investigation and subsequent hearing which could result in a disciplinary sanction. Section 728(b) of the LEOBR provides: \u201cWhenever a law-enforcement officer is under investigation or subjected to interrogation by a law-enforcement agency, for any reason which could lead to disciplinary action, demotion or dismissal, the investigation or interrogation shall be conducted under the following conditions.... \u201d This subsection of the statute then enumerates 14 conditions under which the interrogation or investigation shall be conducted. These include: restrictions as to the time, place, and length of the interrogation (subsections one, two and six); a requirement that the officer under investigation be given the names of all persons at the interrogation (subsection three); a provision against threats of dismissal but not against the requirement of blood alcohol tests or other tests (subsection seven); and provisions regarding the keeping of records, and prohibitions against the insertion of adverse materials into the officer\u2019s file without giving the officer an opportunity to review the material (subsections eight and twelve). Other procedural safeguards accorded to law enforcement officers include the right to counsel at an interrogation (subsection 10), and a provision that an officer may not be prohibited from bringing a suit arising out of his official duties (subsection 11).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">(Citations omitted). Although LEOBR has undergone several changes since our decision in <em>Resh, </em>those changes are relatively insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We shall address one other matter before reaching the merits of this appeal. In her brief to this Court, appellee asserts that an examination of the circuit court\u2019s oral ruling reveals that the circuit court did not determine that the Chiefs final decision was an illegal successive punishment (which was the product of an illegal successive investigation) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>in violation of constitutional double jeopardy principles, but rather that it was in violation of LEOBR. Furthermore, appellee states that \u201cneither party below, at the administrative hearing or in the Circuit Court proceedings, ever argued the merits of a constitutional violation.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because there is a degree of uncertainty regarding whether the circuit court\u2019s order was based on double jeopardy principles or LEOBR, and because the parties on this appeal have thoroughly briefed and presented arguments under both grounds, we shall address the merits of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The prohibition against double jeopardy is applicable in Maryland as a common law principle and under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 561, 566, 622 A.2d 199 (1993). \u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that no person shall \u2018be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward v. Department of Pub. Safety &amp; Correctional Sews., </em>339 Md. 343, 350, 663 A.2d 66 (1995). The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple prosecutions and multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, double jeopardy grants three protections: (1) protection against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; (2) protection against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and (3) protection against multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>Johnson, </em>95 Md.App. at 566, 622 A.2d 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Although double jeopardy protection has historically been associated with criminal cases, <em>id., </em>the Court of Appeals in <em>Ward </em>recently addressed, through dicta, double jeopardy in a factual context somewhat similar to the instant case. In <em>Ward, </em>a correctional officer argued that \u201cthe Secretary of Personnel cannot suspend him for an incident and then file charges for removal based on \u2018exactly the same incident.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>Ward, </em>339 Md. at 349, 663 A.2d 66. According to the officer, the initial suspension and later termination for the same infraction violated the so-called principle of \u201cadministrative double jeopardy\u201d\u2014a principle purportedly embodied in the Fifth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>At oral argument before the Court of Appeals, the officer abandoned this constitutional argument, but the Court nevertheless addressed it \u201cfor the sake of clarity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><em>Ward </em>explained that in <em>U.S. v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989), the Supreme Court of the United States concluded that the government can impose punishment, not only in criminal proceedings, but also in civil proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 350, 663 A.2d 66. <em>Ward </em>further explained that determining whether a particular civil sanction constitutes punishment within the contemplation of the Double Jeopardy Clause depends on whether the purpose of the penalty is retribution or deterrence. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. at 448, 109 S.Ct. at 1901-02). If the purpose is retribution or deterrence, the sanction is a punishment; if, however, the purpose is remedial, the sanction is not a punishment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Applying these principles, the Court rejected the officer\u2019s \u201cadministrative double jeopardy\u201d argument, holding that the officer was not punished within the contemplation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 350-51, 663 A.2d 66. In this regard, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">The Division of Correction, like any employer, must maintain control over its employees. To this end, the Division has established standards of conduct and published them to its employees. The standards would have no meaning, force or effect if there were no penalty for their violation. Thus, the Division has established a system of progressive discipline. Common sense dictates that this discipline is imposed to ensure that employees adhere to the established standards of conduct. Indeed, the foreword to the regulation states that \u201cdiscipline shall be progressive in nature and, in combination with specific training, shall aim at correcting inappropriate employee behavior.\u201d Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>discipline is not imposed for the purpose of punishment, the principles of double jeopardy simply do not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Id.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Similarly, our focus in <em>Johnson </em>involved the nature of the civil sanction. Therein, we rejected the double jeopardy argument of a drunk driving defendant whose driver\u2019s license had been administratively restricted in advance of his criminal conviction. In so doing, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">The purpose of [the license suspension statute] is to protect other drivers on the road from those who would drive while intoxicated and to deter those who would otherwise decide to drive drunk. While the statute is also aimed at sanctioning the offending driver, that is not its primary purpose. Moreover, the mere fact that the suspension of driving privileges may carry the \u201csting of punishment\u201d is immaterial. \u201c[C]ases have acknowledged that ... even remedial sanctions carry the sting of punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">Appellant was deprived of a valuable right when the administrative judge issued him a restricted license. He was not, however, subject to criminal punishment for the same offense under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 572-73, 622 A.2d 199 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">With these fundamental principles in mind, we turn our attention to the disposition of the first question presented. Appellee argues that she was subjected to an illegal successive punishment arising out of an illegal successive investigation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>violation of double jeopardy. According to appellee, her first punishment came in the form of counselling and the placement into her file of the aforementioned documents; and her second punishment came in the form of the Chiefs final decision to fine her $150. Also, according to appellee, she was subjected to an initial \u201cprosecution\u201d commencing with the first Form 242 and culminating with the alleged first punishment; and was subjected to a subsequent \u201cprosecution\u201d commencing with the second Form 242 and culminating with the Chiefs final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Like the correctional officer in <em>Ward, </em>appellee seems to suggest that double jeopardy protection applies in this case under the so-called principle of \u201cadministrative double jeopardy.\u201d According to appellee, \u201cadministrative double jeopardy\u201d is an \u201caccepted concept\u201d in the labor law field. In support of this assertion, appellee has directed our attention to several published opinions of arbitrators, wherein \u201cadministrative double jeopardy\u201d was applied to preclude an employer from twice punishing an employee for the same incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">For example, in <em>In re City of Kenosha, </em>76 Lab. Arb. Rep. 758, 759 (1981), the arbitrator explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">In industrial relations, the doctrine of double jeopardy means that if an employe [sic] is <em>punished </em>for a specific act, he is entitled to regard such <em>punishment </em>as final for that particular misconduct. However, there is arbitral precedent for a definite suspension followed by an investigation resulting in discharge or the withdrawal of discipline as not constituting double jeopardy. Lastly, an employe [sic] may not be given a written reprimand subsequent to an oral reprimand for the same offense <em>when the oral reprimand was intended as a final disposition of the disciplinary matter.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">(Emphasis added <em>&amp; </em>footnotes to arbitration decisions omitted). Appellee also directs our attention to <em>In re Int\u2019l Harvester Co., </em>16 Lab. Arb. Rep. 616 (1951), wherein the arbitrator explained that he was empowered to apply the doctrine of double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>jeopardy even though he was not a criminal court judge, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">I conclude that if Hall was <em>punished </em>twice for the same offense or offenses the second penalty must be set aside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeD\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The foregoing arbitration opinions notwithstanding, \u201cadministrative double jeopardy\u201d has not been recognized in Maryland, as indeed <em>Ward </em>did not adopt the concept. It must be remembered that Ward\u2019s discussion of \u201cadministrative double jeopardy\u201d was dicta to our analysis in the instant case, however, it does not much matter whether \u201cadministrative double jeopardy\u201d is an \u201caccepted concept\u201d and a viable principle of Maryland law. This is because the counselling and the placement of the documents in appellee\u2019s file was not punishment but was merely remedial administrative action, and because appellee was not subject to successive prosecutions for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The counselling that appellant received was not punishment in any sense of the word. The purpose of Sterling\u2019s counsel-ling in this case was obviously remedial in nature. The counselling was, as stated, designed to \u201cprevent a recurrence.\u201d Sterling was not attempting to extract retribution from appellee. Nor was he hoping to deter other officers from driving away from the fuel station before removing the nozzle from their cars. Indeed, the brevity and informality of Sterling\u2019s contemporaneous counselling supports our view. Under the circumstances of this case, it simply cannot be said that Sterling doled out a punishment. To conclude otherwise would lead to the absurd result of elevating to the punishment level every instance in which a superior brings to his subordinate officer\u2019s attention a shortcoming in the officer\u2019s job performance or suggests to the officer that a better way exists for carrying out a particular job responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">In addition, Sterling\u2019s counselling did not become punishment merely because he took the time to document his discussion with appellee. It is beyond cavil that it is smart managerial practice on a number of levels for an employer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>document an employee\u2019s performance and discussions he has with the employee pertaining thereto. This is especially so in the context of law enforcement. Holding that Sterling\u2019s counselling rose to the level of punishment merely because he documented the counselling would discourage this sound practice. Furthermore, it cannot be forgotten that the SIIR is a routine County-wide report that must be completed whenever County property is damaged. Thus, Sterling was administratively obliged to document the steps he took in response to appellee\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Appellee retorts, however, that Sterling\u2019s counselling was punishment because Sterling administered it during a LEOBR investigation. In this regard, appellee states that \u201c[cjounselling alone ... without an interrogation or investigation or a formal complaint or an inquiry does not trigger LEOBR protection.\u201d Nothing in LEOBR, however, indicates that Sterling\u2019s counselling was transformed into punishment within double jeopardy by the mere fact that it occurred during a LEOBR investigation. Stated differently, appellee has presented no authority to support the notion that displeasing administrative action against an officer necessarily becomes punitive (in the constitutional sense of the word) when it arises out of, or during the course of, a LEOBR investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Section 728(c) of LEOBR supports our view. That section expressly provides that LEOBR \u201cdoes not limit the authority of the chief to regulate the competent and efficient operation and management of a law enforcement agency by any reasonable means____\u201d Md. Ann.Code art 27, \u00a7 728(c) (1992). By this subsection, the Legislature made clear that LEOBR does not encroach upon the ability of the law enforcement agency to conduct its affairs and operations efficiently and effectively. <em>Resh, </em>65 Md.App. at 176, 499 A.2d 1303. In our view, when appellee informed Sterling of the incident, \u00a7 728(c) permitted Sterling, as the superior officer, to take the immediate corrective measure of counselling appellee even though the incident was also the subject of a LEOBR investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Appellee further contends that the counselling was punishment because it amounted to an \u201cOral Admonishment\u201d\u2014the first of seven \u201cTypes of Disciplinary Action\u201d under \u00a7 27-3 of the Montgomery County Personnel Regulations. Section 27-3 is incorporated by reference into the collective bargaining agreement between the police union and the Montgomery County Police Department. An \u201cOral Admonishment\u201d is defined under \u00a7 27-3 as \u201c[a] spoken warning or indication of disapproval concerning a specific act, infraction or violation of a policy or procedure that is usually given by the immediate supervisor and is noted for the record but does not become part of an employee\u2019s personnel record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In the instant case, appellee did not receive an \u201cOral Admonishment\u201d when Sterling counselled her. As we explained, the purpose of Sterling\u2019s communication was remedial. When Sterling counselled appellee he was not giving her a warning or indicating his disapproval of appellee. Rather, Sterling merely advised appellee to be more careful in the future when fueling the cruiser. Even if Sterling\u2019s counselling could be considered an \u201cOral Admonishment\u201d (and thus a form of \u201cDisciplinary Action\u201d), we would nonetheless hold that Sterling was not admonishing appellee for punitive purposes. We caution appellee not to confuse disciplinary action with punitive action. In this case, as in <em>Ward, </em>the two are not the same. <em>See, e.g., Ward, </em>339 Md. at 351, 663 A.2d 66 (\u201cBecause the discipline is not imposed for the purpose of punishment, the principles of double jeopardy simply do not apply.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Similarly, nothing in the record even remotely suggests that the placement of the documents in appellee\u2019s personnel file was punishment. The first document\u2014the \u201cMotor Vehicle Accident or Loss Notice\u201d\u2014simply reflects that appellee drove away from the fuel pump before removing the fuel hose nozzle and that the repair estimate was $400. This notice is not a formal admonishment, reprimand, or demerit; nor could it be construed as such. It merely reflects an occurrence involving minor damage to County property. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>pellee has failed to establish that the purpose of including this document in appellee\u2019s file was to punish appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Nor has appellee demonstrated that there was a punitive purpose underlying the placement of the SIIR in appellee\u2019s file. The bare notation \u201cCounseled\u201d on an SIIR, without anything more, does not denote punishment. According to Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 328 (2d ed.1982), the definition of \u201ccounsel\u201d includes \u201ca mutual exchange of ideas, opinion, etc.,\u201d \u201cdiscussion and deliberation,\u201d \u201cadvice resulting from such an exchange,\u201d \u201cany advice,\u201d or to \u201crecommend.\u201d None of these definitions carries a negative connotation or even hint at something punitive. As we explained above, sound managerial practice supports the documentation of such incidents. The record unquestionably demonstrates that Sterling was acting in accordance with this practice when he placed the innocuous SIIR in appellee\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The record is equally devoid of any indication that Sterling was punishing appellee by placing the first Form 242 in appellee\u2019s file. While we acknowledge that this document indicates that the incident would be investigated, we do not believe that the purpose of placing this document in appellee\u2019s file was to punish appellee. This document is clearly intended to serve a formal notification function. All signs indicate that furtherance of this function was the primary reason that this document was placed in appellee\u2019s file. Appellee has not demonstrated, nor does the record support, anything to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Along similar lines, we disagree that the inclusion of these documents in appellee\u2019s file constitutes a \u201cWritten Reprimand\u201d\u2014the second of the seven \u201cTypes of Disciplinary Action\u201d under \u00a7 27-3 of the Montgomery County Personnel Regulations. Section 27-3 states that a \u201cWritten Reprimand\u201d is \u201c[a] written statement concerning a specific act, infraction or violation of a policy or procedure that is made a part of the employee\u2019s personnel record.\u201d A true leap is required before the documents in question could be considered written reprimands, as that term is commonly understood. Even if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>assumed that the documents meet the technical definition of \u201cWritten Reprimand\u201d under \u00a7 27-3, we would conclude that such \u201cDisciplinary Action\u201d is not punitive. Rather, the unchallenged facts in the record convince us that these documents were placed in appellee\u2019s file as part of an internal administrative record-keeping function\u2014and not out of a desire to exact retribution from appellee or to deter such incidents in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">We hold, therefore, that the counselling and inclusion of the above-discussed documentation in appellee\u2019s personnel file was not punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause. This holding notwithstanding, we recognize that it is possible that the collection of these documents in appellee\u2019s file might negatively reflect upon appellee, and that the counselling might have been an embarrassing or negative experience for appellee. This negative impact on appellee, however, does not transform the action into punishment. In this regard, appellee may have felt the \u201csting of punishment.\u201d As the cases demonstrate, however, the \u201csting of punishment,\u201d is not invariably caused by punishment -within the contemplation of double jeopardy principles. Accordingly, we agree with the County that the \u201ccounseling of a police officer and the recording of that event in the personnel record is more purely remedial in purpose than either the sanction of suspension imposed in <em>Ward </em>or the administrative license suspension imposed in <em>Johnson.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In addition to holding that appellee was not punished within the contemplation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, we hold that appellee was not successively prosecuted. Appellee has offered no authority to support her position that a second prosecution commenced with the second Form 242. Appellee is assigning too much significance to the fact that she received two Form 242\u2019s pertaining to the same incident. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Our review of the record indicates that the exchange between Buchanan and appellee\u2019s representative during the November 2, 1994 tape recorded interrogation is the only place where an explanation can be found for why appellee received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>two Form 242\u2019s. Therein, Buchanan explained that Sterling issued the first Form 242 for purposes of Sterling\u2019s preparation of the SUR. The clear implication of Buchanan\u2019s explanation is that the scope of Sterling\u2019s investigation was limited to the documentation of property damage for the SIIR, whereas Buchanan would handle matters beyond that, i.e., the formal discipline of appellee, as part of his investigation. There is no evidence in the record indicating anything else to the contrary. Thus, we are not faced with two separate and distinct investigations culminating with two administrative dispositions. Rather, the investigation of the nozzle incident was an investigation with two concerns\u2014the ministerial documentation of property damage and the administrative disciplinary action against an officer. Sterling was responsible for the former and Buchanan was responsible for the latter. Appellee has failed to demonstrate why the two cannot constitutionally coexist.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Next, we hold that there was no violation of LEOBR in this case. Nothing in LEOBR\u2014expressly or implicitly\u2014 precluded appellee from being served with a second Form 242 and from ultimately being fined by the Chief, after having been counselled and the documents having been inserted into appellee\u2019s file.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">As we explained, the placement of the documents into appellee\u2019s file was not a final punishment, but rather was a legitimate administrative step taken during the course of an ongoing investigation. Under \u00a7 728(b)(12) of LEOBR,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">(i) A law enforcement agency may not insert any adverse material into any file of the officer, except the file of the internal investigation or the intelligence division, unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>officer has an opportunity to review, sign, and receive a copy of, and comment in writing upon the adverse material, unless the officer waives these rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\">(ii) A law enforcement officer, upon written request, may have any record of a formal complaint made against him expunged from any file if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">1. The law enforcement agency investigating the complaint has exonerated the officer of all charges in the complaint, or determined that the charges were unsustained or unfounded, or an administrative hearing board acquits, dismisses, or makes a finding of not guilty; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">2. 3 years have passed since the findings by the law enforcement agency or administrative hearing board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Md. Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 728(b) (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">We shall assume without deciding that the circuit court correctly determined that the documentation placed in appellee\u2019s personnel file was \u201cadverse material\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 728(b)(12).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We shall also assume without deciding that the first Form 242 is a \u201crecord of a formal complaint\u201d within the meaning of sub-part (ii) of this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>By obtaining appellee\u2019s signature on the Memorandum of Notification\u2014which advised appellee that the documents in question would be placed in her personnel file\u2014sub-part (i) of the above provision was satisfied. Consequently, appellee\u2019s superiors were authorized to place the documents in her file. Significantly, sub-part (i) contains no prohibition against the placement of adverse materials in an officer\u2019s file during the course of an investigation. In this regard, sub-part (i) is not concerned with when adverse documents are included in an officer\u2019s file so long as \u201cthe officer has an opportunity to review, sign, and receive a copy of, and comment in writing upon the adverse material.... \u201d Similarly, sub-part (ii) does not preclude a record of formal complaint against an officer from making its way into the officer\u2019s file before the formal disposition of the complaint. Thus, LEOBR was satisfied with respect to the inclusion in appellee\u2019s file of any \u201cadverse materials\u201d relating to the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Furthermore, nothing in LEOBR precludes appellee from being counselled regarding the nozzle incident at the time that appellee reported the incident to Sterling or shortly thereafter, even though the incident had become the subject of a LEOBR investigation. Indeed, as we have previously noted, \u00a7 728(c) expressly provides that LEOBR \u201cdoes not limit the authority of the chief to regulate the competent and efficient operation and management of a law enforcement agency by any reasonable means.... \u201d We view the counselling that occurred during this case (as well as the placement of the documentation in appellee\u2019s file during the course of the investigation) as included in the class of those administrative actions that LEOBR does not proscribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Lastly, under the circumstances of this case, neither the spirit nor the text of LEOBR was undermined by the issuance of the two Form 242\u2019s. As we have discussed, the nature of the investigation reasonably explains why two Form 242\u2019s were issued in this case, and the manner in which the investigation was conducted did not offend LEOBR.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">To be sure, reasonable minds might differ regarding whether more was made out of this incident than was necessary. There was relatively minor damage to County property and, although the infraction was obviously careless, it was somewhat understandable under the circumstances of a code 3 emergency response. Nonetheless, this was the second time appellee pulled away from the pump station without removing the hose nozzle from her vehicle, and County policy requires documentation of incidents involving damage to County property. The bottom line, however, is that the Montgomery County Police Department, \u201clike any employer, must maintain control over its employees.\u201d <em>Ward, </em>339 Md. at 350, 663 A.2d 66. Regardless of whether matters were blown out of proportion, neither the Double Jeopardy Clause nor LEOBR was violated during the course of the administrative events of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we hold that the circuit court erroneously determined that appellee was subjected to an illegal successive punishment arising out of an illegal successive investigation\u2014regardless of whether the circuit court\u2019s determination was based on LEOBR or on principles of double jeopardy. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit court, and the Chiefs final decision shall remain undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\">.

Indeed, neither party has addressed this issue in any significant way on this appeal. As a result, the issue is not before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\">. Appellee concedes that her reply memorandum filed in the circuit court states that the Chiefs final decision violated double jeopardy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b718-11\">. \"Administrative double jeopardy\u201d was also discussed, albeit briefly, in <em>Department of Pub.
