The principal issue presented is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>South Carolina had subject-matter jurisdiction to make a permanent custody determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Brittany was born on April 4, 1990. Her natural father, Robert K., died in August 1992. Until appellant was admitted to the psychiatric ward of Fairfax General Hospital in February 1993, she and Brittany lived in various homes in Maryland. Craig and Ann Simmons (\u201cthe Simmonses\u201d), Brittany\u2019s maternal grandfather and his wife, took in Brittany when Mrs. Harris was admitted to the hospital. After her release, appellant and the Simmonses entered into a voluntary \u201cCare, Custody and Support Agreement\u201d on May 2, 1993, which sought to \u201censure stability for Brittany until she reaches school age or until such time as Jennifer Simmons is able to provide a stable and secure living arrangement for both herself and Brittany,\u201d by allowing Brittany to continue living with the Simmonses. Brittany lived with the Simmonses until August 27, 1993, when appellant changed her mind and insisted that her daughter again reside with her. For the next seven months, Brittany lived with her mother and step-father, Louis Edward Harris, Jr.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Mr. Simmons, with appellant\u2019s consent, picked up Brittany on April 8, 1994 for a pre-arranged period of visitation. The Simmonses planned to have Brittany visit them in their new home in Horry County, South Carolina. The three-week visit was scheduled to allow appellant time to recover from the birth of her second child. Mr. Simmons\u2019s daughter, Mary (appellant\u2019s sister), discovered bruises and welts on Brittany\u2019s buttocks and legs shortly after the visitation period began. Upon arrival in South Carolina, the Simmonses had Brittany\u2019s injuries examined by a physician, who reported possible child abuse to the South Carolina Department of Social Services. South Carolina notified the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services (PGDSS) that it was investigating the possible abuse of Brittany. PGDSS made an independent finding of child abuse on May 9,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Brittany told appellees and her treating physicians that her stepfather beat her with a belt, causing the bruising. Mr. Harris was contacted, and he admitted that he had hit Brittany with his belt once on each of two different occasions, both on April 5, 1994. Appellant and her husband maintained, however, that the bruising was not the result of Mr. Harris\u2019s use of the belt but was instead the result of Brittany falling off playground equipment on April 4,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Proceedings in South Carolina</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The litigation leading to this appeal began on April 19, 1994 when appellees filed for custody of Brittany in the Circuit Court for Horry County, South Carolina. That same day, the court issued an <em>ex parte </em>emergency order granting temporary physical custody of Brittany to the Simmonses, stating, \u201cWithout determining whether this Court has on-going jurisdiction in this matter, the facts found above [that Brittany has been physically abused] gives this Court emergency jurisdiction to enter necessary and appropriate orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Appellant filed a motion to dismiss \u201cDue to Forum Being Inconvenient.\u201d The South Carolina court issued an order on June 27, 1994, awarding temporary custody of Brittany to appellees pending trial. The court referred to Maryland as Brittany\u2019s \u201cformer home state\u201d and cited, as bases for exercising jurisdiction, the emergency and \u201csignificant connections\u201d test of the South Carolina Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (\u201cUCCJA\u201d). The order was captioned \u201cFinal as to Jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">A permanent custody hearing was held on January 26, March 7, and March 9 of 1995. The South Carolina court granted permanent custody to the Simmonses on April 7, 1995, stating, \u201cThe prior, unappealed final order as to jurisdiction is binding upon this Court, and is the law of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Proceedings in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">On May 9, 1994, twenty days after the Simmonses instituted suit in South Carolina, appellant filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>custody of Brittany under Maryland\u2019s UCCJA, alleging that Maryland was Brittany\u2019s \u201chome state.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The circuit court (Ahalt, J., presiding), after a hearing on July 7, 1994 on the issue of Maryland\u2019s jurisdiction over Brittany\u2019s custody, found that Maryland was Brittany\u2019s home state and that South Carolina had not \u201cexercised jurisdiction substantially in conformity\u201d with the UCCJA. The Simmons-es filed alternative motions to dismiss the complaint pending in Prince George\u2019s County, or to stay the proceedings, on July 12, 1994. The Simmonses argued that Maryland should not exercise jurisdiction because they had already obtained a custody decree in South Carolina. Appellant responded by arguing that South Carolina should have declined to exercise jurisdiction once an action was commenced in Maryland, the more appropriate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Judge Ahalt presided over a review hearing on the issue of temporary custody and visitation on July 29, 1994. He once again found that Maryland was Brittany\u2019s home state. He further found that South Carolina had no basis to exercise continuing jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">That same day, Master Julia B. Weatherly of the circuit court presided over a <em>pendente lite </em>hearing on the custody issue. She recommended that custody be awarded to the Simmonses. She also recommended that Mrs. Harris be granted telephone access to and visitation with Brittany, provided that Mr. Harris was not present and had no contact with Brittany.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>The Simmonses filed a \u201cMotion for Finding of Inconvenient Forum\u201d on March 6, 1995. They asked the Maryland court to decline to exercise jurisdiction over the custody matter. Appellant again argued that South Carolina should have exercised its jurisdiction only until an action was filed in Maryland.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The circuit court (Smith, J., presiding) heard argument on the motion to dismiss<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on May 25, 1995 and granted the motion on June 23, 1995. This timely appeal followed, which presents the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">Did the South Carolina court properly exercise jurisdiction under the UCCJA to award permanent custody?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We answer in the negative, thereby reversing the grant of appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss, and remand for further proceedings. Until those proceedings have concluded, South Carolina\u2019s grant of temporary custody to appellees shall remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">The UCCJA is codified in Maryland Code (1984, 1991 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-201 to -224 of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). It controls which state has subject-matter jurisdiction over child custody cases. <em>See In re Marriage of Ben-Yehoshua, </em>91 Cal.App.3d 259, 154 Cal.Rptr. 80, 83 (1979); <em>Renno v. Evans, </em>580 So.2d 945, 948 (La.Ct.App.1991); Family Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 32.03[4] (Arnold H. Rutkin, general ed. 1990). The UCCJA was proposed in 1968 in response to problems of interstate enforcement of custody decrees. By September 1984, all fifty states had adopted it. Family Law, supra, \u00a732.03[4][a], at 32-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The general purposes of the UCCJA are to avoid jurisdictional conflict with courts of other states; to assure that litigation takes place in the state with which the child and the child\u2019s family have the closest connection and where significant evidence concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, and personal relationships is most readily available, and that courts decline to exercise jurisdiction when the child and the child\u2019s family have a closer connection with another state; and to avoid relitigation of custody decisions of other states \u201cinsofar as feasible.\u201d FL \u00a7 9-202(a); <em>see also </em>S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 20-7-784 (Law.Co-op.1985) (\u201cS.C.Code\u201d). A court issuing a custody decree retains jurisdiction for future modifications so long as the parties have requisite ties to that state. FL \u00a7 9-214; <em>see also </em>S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-810.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">The UCCJA bases jurisdiction on four grounds, only the first three of which are relevant to this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">(a) <em>Grounds for </em>jurisdiction.\u2014A court of this State which is competent to decide child custody matters has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination ... if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">(1) this State (i) is the home state of the child at the time of commencement of the proceeding, or (ii) had been the child\u2019s home state within 6 months before commencement of the proceedings and the child is absent from this State because of the child\u2019s removal or retention by a person claiming custody or for other reasons, and a parent or person acting as parent continues to live in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">(2) it is in the best interest of the child that a court of this State assume jurisdiction because (i) the child and the child\u2019s parents, or the child and at least 1 contestant, have a significant connection with this State, and (ii) there is available in this State substantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">(8) the child is physically present in this State and (i) the child has been abandoned or (ii) it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse or is otherwise neglected or dependent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">(4)(i) it appears that no other state would have jurisdiction under prerequisites substantially in accordance with items (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection or another state has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this State is the more appropriate forum to determine the custody of the child, and (ii) it is in the best interest of the child, that this court assume jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">(b) <em>Effect of physical </em>presence.\u2014Except under subsection (a)(3) and (4) of this section, physical presence in this State of the child, or of the child and 1 of the contestants, is not alone sufficient to confer jurisdiction on a court of this State to make a child custody determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">FL \u00a7 9-204. <em>See also </em>S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-788.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Neither party disputes that South Carolina had emergency jurisdiction based on the bruising evident on Brittany\u2019s body. What is hotly disputed is whether the South Carolina circuit court had jurisdiction to issue a decree granting permanent custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">A. FL \u00a7 9-204(a)(3) and S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-788(a)(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Subsection (a)(3) of FL \u00a7 9-204 and S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-788 are identical. Both allow a court to decide custody matters if the child is physically present in the state and it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because he or she has been subjected to abuse. In <em>Malik v. Malik, </em>99 Md.App. 521, 638 A.2d 1184 (1994), we held that emergency jurisdiction based on FL \u00a7 9-204(a)(3) is temporary, and only preserves \u201c \u2018the status quo for such limited time as is required to permit the petitioner to apply for a change of permanent custody to the state which has jurisdiction over such petition under the U.C.C.J.A.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 638 A.2d 1184 (quoting <em>Nussbaumer v. Nussbaumer, </em>442 So.2d 1094, 1097 (Fla.Dist. Ct.App.1983)). Neither FL \u00a7 9-204(a)(3) nor S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-788(a)(3) gives a court authority to make a decision as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>permanent custody. This result is in accord with the decisions in other states.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The order granting temporary custody of Brittany to appellees pending trial, therefore, was appropriate. We must now determine whether South Carolina had an independent basis of authority that would allow it to continue exercising jurisdiction on a non-emergency basis and to issue a permanent custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">B. FL \u00a7 9-204(a)(2) and S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-788(a)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Subsection (a)(2) of FL \u00a7 9-204 and S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-788 use identical language. If it is in the child\u2019s best interest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>both statutes allow a court to decide a child custody matter if the child and at least one contestant have a \u201csignificant connection\u201d with the state and there is available in the state \u201csubstantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships.\u201d South Carolina\u2019s final order as to jurisdiction was. based on the fact that it first had gained emergency jurisdiction and also on the \u201csignificant connections\u201d test set forth in S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-788(a)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We stated in <em>Malik </em>that jurisdiction based on the significant connections test of FL \u00a7 9-204(a)(2) should \u201c \u2018limit jurisdiction, not proliferate it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528, 638 A.2d 1184 (quoting <em>Olson v. Olson, </em>64 Md.App. 154, 165, 494 A.2d 737 (1985)); <em>see also </em>Unif.Child Custody JurisAct \u00a7 3 cmt., 9 U.L.A. 145 (1988).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The UCCJA must be read in conjunction with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (\u201cPKPA\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Court has held that when a child has a home state, the PKPA \u201cforbids the use of significant connections as the basis for jurisdiction in child custody litigation.\u201d <em>Malik, supra, </em>99 Md.App. at 528, 638 A.2d 1184.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">At the times the South Carolina and the Maryland actions were filed, Maryland was Brittany\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d within the meaning of the PKPA and UCCJA. Until April 8, 1994, Brittany had resided in Maryland for her entire life. Furthermore, the home state rule is extended for an additional six-month period after the child leaves. FL \u00a7 9-204(a)(l)(ii). \u201cThe provision makes clear that the [parent in the home state], if he acts promptly, may start proceedings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>his own state if he desires, without the necessity of attempting to base jurisdiction on\u201d significant connections. Unif.Child Custody JurisAct \u00a7 3 cmt., 9 U.L.A at 144. The South Carolina court was incorrect, therefore, in stating in its June 27, 1994 order that Maryland was Brittany\u2019s \u201cformer\u201d home state. At the time the custody action was filed in South Carolina, Brittany had been out of Maryland for approximately ten days. Because Maryland was still Brittany\u2019s home state, the South Carolina court could not base its exercise of jurisdiction upon significant connections. <em>Malik, supra, </em>99 Md.App. at 528, 638 A.2d 1184. The South Carolina court\u2019s reliance on S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-788(a)(2) was therefore misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">C. Full faith and credit</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The UCCJA and the PKPA compel a state to give full faith and credit to a valid custody decree entered by a sister state. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(a); FL \u00a7 9-213;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-808. The comment to the uniform version of the UCCJA states that recognition and enforcement of a custody decree is mandatory \u201cif the state in which the prior decree was rendered 1) has adopted this Act, 2) has statutory jurisdictional requirements substantially like this Act, or 3) would have had jurisdiction under the facts of the case if this Act had been the law in the state.\u201d Unif.Child Custody JurisAct \u00a7 13 cmt., 9 U.L.A. at 276. Courts, while parroting this language, <em>see, e.g., Thompson v. Hair, </em>146 Mich.App. 561, 381 N.W.2d 765, 767 (1986), have looked at the basis under which the other state exercised jurisdiction in order to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>mine whether the sister state court was actually exercising jurisdiction \u201csubstantially in accordance\u201d with the UCCJA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We hold that, because the South Carolina circuit court could only exercise emergency jurisdiction temporarily and, because Maryland was Brittany\u2019s home state, the South Carolina court did not have jurisdiction to issue a permanent custody decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The PKPA, like the UCCJA, does not require Maryland to give full faith and credit to the South Carolina decree because that state did not exercise jurisdiction consistently with the provisions of the federal statute. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738A(c)(l) (1988) (full faith and credit must be given only to a decree issued by a court that \u201chas jurisdiction under the law of such State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">To summarize, the South Carolina order granting temporary custody to the Simmonses, based on that state\u2019s emergency jurisdiction, will be enforced by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, until that court has made a permanent custody determination based on Maryland\u2019s authority to exercise jurisdiction as Brittany\u2019s home state.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Appellees argue that the UCCJA\u2019s \u201cfirst-in-time\u201d rule applies in this situation because, when the custody action was filed in Maryland, there was already a proceeding pending in another state. <em>See </em>Unif.Child Custody JurisAct \u00a7 6 cmt., 9 U.L.A. at 220 (\u201cWhen the courts of more than one state have jurisdiction ..., priority in time determines which court will proceed with the action____\u201d); Russell M. Coombs, <em>Interstate Child Custody: Jurisdiction, Recognition, and Enforcement, </em>66 Minn.L.Rev. 711, 772 (1982). The court in which the proceeding is pending, however, must still exercise \u201cjurisdiction substantially in conformity with\u201d the UCCJA. FL \u00a7 9-206(a);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>see also </em>Coombs, <em>supra, </em>at 725 (\u201cBy <em>properly </em>entertaining a proceeding and failing to stay it, the court of the other state limits the freedom of the court of the forum state to prefer itself as the appropriate arena.\u201d (Emphasis added)). South Carolina, however, did not exercise jurisdiction in conformity with the UCCJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Appellees also argue that the trial judge had the discretion to dismiss the action in Maryland under the \u201cinconvenient forum\u201d section of the Maryland UCCJA. A court may \u201cdecline to exercise its jurisdiction any time before making a decree if it finds that it is an inconvenient forum to make a custody determination under the circumstances of the case and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.\u201d FL \u00a7 9-207(a). <em>See also </em>S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-796. In this case, however, the Maryland trial judge specifically found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>that Maryland was not an inconvenient forum.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because of this finding, FL \u00a7 9-207(a) could not be used as the basis for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Finally, we shall address several issues that the South Carolina court relied on in exercising jurisdiction. The court stated that \u201cthe mere presence of the child in this State, gives this Court original jurisdiction concerning questions of custody.\u201d The court then cited to S.C.Code \u00a7 20-3-160, which gives it the power to make custody orders as part of granting a divorce decree.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> No divorce decree was involved in this case; therefore, South Carolina Code \u00a7 20-3-160 was inapplicable. Moreover, the UCCJA specifically states that, \u201c[e]xcept under subsection (a)(3) and (4) of this section, the child\u2019s <em>physical presence in this State ... is not alone sufficient </em>to confer jurisdiction on a court of this State to make a child custody determination.\u201d <em>See </em>.Unif.Child Custody JurisAct \u00a7 3(b), 9 U.L.A. at 144 (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>FL \u00a7 9-204(b); S.C.Code \u00a7 20-7-788(b). South Carolina cannot rely on Brittany\u2019s mere presence in the state to give it jurisdiction over this custody dispute because its emergency jurisdiction was temporary and Maryland was Brittany\u2019s home state.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Finally, the South Carolina circuit court stated in its June 27, 1994 order that \u201call objections Mother may have to the prosecution of this action under South Carolina\u2019s version of the UCCJA and the PKPA were required to be included in her pending motion. Any objections not presented are now waived.\u201d The South Carolina court cited to S.C.Rule of Civil Procedure 12, which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">12(g). Consolidation of Defenses in Motion. A party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any other motions herein provided for and <em>then available to him. </em>If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits therefrom any defense or objection <em>then available to him </em>which this rule permits to be raised by motion, he shall not thereafter make a motion based on the defense or objection so omitted....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">12(h). Waiver or Preservation of Certain Defenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">(1) A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the person, improper venue, insufficiency of process, insufficiency of service of process, or that another action is pending between the same parties for the same claim is waived if omitted from a motion [to dismiss].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">(3) Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">The South Carolina court ruling that appellant had waived her objection to the exercise of jurisdiction under the UCCJA or the federal PKPA was incorrect. The UCCJA and the PKPA spell out when a court has subject-matter jurisdiction. Lack of subject-matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time. <em>Gardner v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs of St. Mary\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>County, </em>320 Md. 63, 576 A.2d 208 (1990); S.C.Rule Civ.P. 12(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Further, even if it were not permissible to raise the issue of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction at any time, appellant did not waive her jurisdictional argument under S.C. Rule of Civil Procedure 12. To waive a defense under that Rule, the defense must be \u201cthen available to\u201d the litigant. When appellant filed her motion based on inconvenient forum, South Carolina did have emergency jurisdiction over Brittany\u2019s custody.

Due to the allegations raised and the reports of both doctors and DSS, this Court had emergency jurisdiction to enter necessary and appropriate orders. Moreover, the mere presence of the child in this State, gives this Court original jurisdiction concerning questions of custody under South Carolina Law.
