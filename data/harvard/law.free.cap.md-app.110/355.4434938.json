In this appeal, we are asked to decide whether one or both insurers are obligated to pay Personal Injury Protection (\u201cPIP\u201d) benefits to Seitz. Nationwide argues that only Allstate is liable, even though Allstate\u2019s PIP policy limit is considerably less than the limit in Nationwide\u2019s policy. Seitz asserts that he is entitled to recover the larger policy amount, either from Nationwide alone or from both insurers. We agree with the Circuit Court for Montgomery County that Seitz is entitled to recover from both Nationwide and Allstate, in an amount not to exceed Nationwide\u2019s policy limit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The facts are undisputed. On December 25, 1993, Seitz was driving his vehicle on Dorsey Road in Anne Arundel County when he was struck from behind by a vehicle owned by Richard Ward and driven by Eric Ward (\u201cthe Ward vehicle\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Seitz was insured under a motor vehicle insurance policy issued to him by Allstate Insurance Company, which contained a provision for PIP benefits in the amount of $2,500. The Ward vehicle was insured by Nationwide, and the applicable policy contained a provision for PIP benefits in the amount of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">After the collision, Seitz stepped out of his vehicle to assess the damage. Shortly thereafter, a third vehicle, owned and operated by Michelle Foster, struck the Ward vehicle from behind and propelled it into Seitz. The Foster vehicle was also insured under a policy issued by Allstate; it contained a provision for PIP benefits in the amount of $2,500. Seitz was injured and incurred medical expenses well in excess of $10,-000.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Seitz filed a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court to determine the rights and responsibilities of Nationwide and Allstate with respect to the PIP endorsements for the Ward and Foster vehicles. Seitz did not argue that he is entitled to the aggregate maximum coverage from both carriers, i.e., $12,500. Instead, Seitz contended that he was entitled to a total of $10,000, either from Nationwide alone or from both Nationwide and Allstate, because $10,000 constitutes the larger of the two PIP policy limits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">After a hearing, the circuit court found that both Nationwide and Allstate were liable to Seitz. At Nationwide\u2019s request, when the court determined that Nationwide was obligated to pay, the circuit court applied the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in the Nationwide PIP endorsement. It then determined that Nationwide was liable in the amount of $8,000 and that Allstate was liable in the amount of $2,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201cother insurance\u201d clause provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>In the event the injured person has other optional Personal Injury Protection insurance available and applicable to the accident, the maximum recovery under all such insurance shall not exceed the amount which would have been payable under the provisions of the insurance providing the highest dollar limit, and the Company [Nationwide] shall not be liable for a greater proportion of any loss to which this coverage applies than the limit of liability hereunder bears to the sum of the applicable limits of this coverage and all other such insurance.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Nationwide now appeals, and presents a single question for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">Whether payment of a PIP claim must be made by both the insurer of a vehicle that strikes another vehicle, propelling it into a pedestrian and the insurer of the vehicle that is struck and propelled into a pedestrian, rather than only the insurer of the vehicle striking another vehicle and propelling it into a pedestrian?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The issue presented requires us to analyze various interlocking provisions of Article 48A of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol. and Supp.1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Article 48A, \u00a7 539(a) requires that all motor vehicle insurance policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>issued in this State \u201cprovide coverage for the medical, hospital, and disability benefits set forth in this section,\u201d unless the insured makes a valid waiver of the coverage. The coverage required by \u00a7 539 is colloquially referred to as \u201cPersonal Injury Protection\u201d or \u201cPIP coverage.\u201d PIP coverage is entirely \u201cno-fault\u201d insurance. Section 540(a)(1) provides that PIP benefits \u201cshall be payable without regard to ... [t]he fault or nonfault of the named insured or the recipient in causing or contributing to the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">When the Foster vehicle struck the Ward vehicle and propelled the Ward vehicle into Seitz, an \u201caccident\u201d occurred within the meaning of \u00a7 538. Section 538 defines \u201caccident\u201d as \u201cany occurrence involving a motor vehicle, other than an occurrence caused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured, from which damage to any property or injury to any person results.\u201d Moreover, \u00a7 539(b) enumerates the persons protected by PIP coverage. Among these individuals are \u201c[pjedestrians injured in an accident in which the insured motor vehicle is involved.\u201d \u00a7 539(b)(3). The parties agree that Seitz, who had exited his vehicle after the first accident, was a \u201cpedestrian\u201d when he was struck during the next accident. <em>See Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 78, 517 A.2d 730 (1986) (General Assembly \u201cintended to include as a \u2018pedestrian\u2019 under \u00a7 539 all persons not occupying, entering, or alighting from a motor or other covered vehicle without regard to whether, when struck, they were actually travelling on foot, standing in a stationary position, sitting, or ... within some structure\u201d). Further, since the Ward vehicle was the object that struck and injured Seitz, it was clearly \u201cinvolved\u201d in the accident within the meaning of \u00a7 539(b)(3). Thus, under that statute, Seitz, as a pedestrian, was among the designated individuals covered by the PIP endorsements of both the Nationwide and Allstate policies. Seitz was, within the terms of the statute, a \u201c[p]edestrian injured in an accident in which the insured motor vehicle was involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Section 543(a) prohibits duplicative recovery of PIP benefits.' It provides, in pertinent part: \u201cNotwithstanding any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>other provision of this subtitle, no person shall recover benefits under the coverage described in [\u00a7 539] of this subtitle from more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u201d Other subsections of \u00a7 543 govern the coordination of policies when more than one PIP policy might provide coverage for a particular insured. Moreover, \u00a7 543(b)(1) states, in relevant part: \u201cAs to any person injured in any accident while occupying a motor vehicle for which the coverage described under \u00a7 539 of this subtitle is in effect, <em>and as to any person injured by such a motor vehicle as a pedestrian </em>..., the benefits shall be payable by the insurer of the motor vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">As we noted, Seitz does not seek to recover the aggregate of PIP benefits under each policy, which would total $12,500. Rather, he contends that he is entitled to recovery of $10,000, because that is the larger of the two policy limits for PIP benefits and his medical bills exceed $10,000. Understandably, it does not seem to matter to him if he recovers from Nationwide alone or from Nationwide and Allstate together.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Nationwide advances several arguments to support its claim that it has no obligation to pay PIP benefits. First, Nationwide argues that Seitz was not really \u201cinjured by\u201d its insured vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 543(b)(1). In Nationwide\u2019s view, this is because the Ward vehicle \u201cwas merely a projectile propelled into Seitz\u201d by the Foster vehicle. As a \u201cprojectile\u201d or inanimate object knocked into Seitz, the Ward vehicle, according to Nationwide, did not \u201cinjure\u201d Seitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">This argument is not well taken. The facts of this case indicate that the Ward vehicle was not simply an \u201cinnocent\u201d vehicle turned into a projectile by another driver. To the contrary, the Ward vehicle had been involved in an accident with Seitz before the Foster vehicle was ever involved. Indeed, it was because of that accident that Seitz exited his vehicle to inspect the damage and was then injured when the Foster vehicle collided with Ward\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Moreover, whether the Ward vehicle was a mere \u201cprojectile\u201d or was being driven at the time is completely irrelevant under the statutory scheme. Section 538(b) defines \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d in pertinent part, as an \u201cautomobile and any other vehicle ... operated <em>or designed for operation </em>upon a public road by any power other than animal or muscular power____\u201d (Emphasis supplied). While the Ward vehicle was in a stationary position at the time the Foster vehicle struck it, it retained its status as a motor vehicle, because it was \u201cdesigned for operation\u201d on the public roads. In addition, contrary to Nationwide\u2019s suggestion, it is obvious that Seitz was \u201cinjured by\u201d the Ward vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 543(b)(1), because the Ward vehicle came into contact with him. While there may be one or more forces that combine to cause an injury, <em>Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. v. Kenney, </em>323 Md. 116, 127, 591 A.2d 507 (1991); <em>Karns v. Liquid Carbonic Corp., </em>275 Md. 1, 20, 338 A.2d 251 (1975), what <em>caused </em>the Ward vehicle to strike him is not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">This view is supported by the no-fault nature of PIP coverage, codified in \u00a7 540(a)(1). The purpose of the PIP legislation was \u201cto put a limited amount of money in the hands of an injured individual under certain circumstances without regard to whether another person is liable for the injuries which the claimant sustained.\u201d <em>Smelser v. Criterion Insurance Co., </em>293 Md. 384, 393, 444 A.2d 1024 (1982). It is thus intended \u201cto assure financial compensation to victims of motor vehicle accidents <em>without regard to the fault </em>of a named insured or other persons entitled to PIP benefits.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Co. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 154, 416 A.2d 734 (1980) (emphasis supplied). Consequently, whether the owner or operator of the Nationwide vehicle was at fault for Seitz\u2019s injuries is immaterial. The Nationwide vehicle struck Seitz and caused his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Nationwide also argues, based on our recent decision in <em>Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund v. Erie Insurance Exchange, </em>105 Md.App. 377, 660 A.2d 929 (1995), that Seitz is only entitled to receive PIP benefits from Allstate, as the insurer of the Foster vehicle. In <em>Erie, </em>as in the case at bar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Car <em>A </em>struck Car <em>B, </em>propelling Car <em>B </em>into Pedestrian <em>P. A </em>critical factual difference from the present case, however, was that Car <em>B </em>in <em>Erie </em>was a Virginia vehicle that did not have PIP coverage. <em>Erie </em>thus was a dispute between the insurer of Car <em>A, </em>which had knocked the second vehicle into the pedestrian, and the pedestrian\u2019s own automobile insurer. In addition to \u00a7 543(b)(1), we had to analyze the situation in light of \u00a7 543(c), a separate coordination of policies provision. Section 543(c) pertains to situations when an injured party receives PIP benefits from his or her own motor vehicle insurance carrier. The statute provides, in relevant part: \u201cAs to any person insured under a policy providing [PIP coverage] who is ... <em>struck as a pedestrian </em>... <em>by a motor vehicle for which [PIP coverage] is not in effect, </em>the benefits shall be payable by the injured party\u2019s insurer providing such coverage.... \u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The main issue in <em>Erie </em>concerned the meaning of the words \u201cstruck ... by\u201d in \u00a7 543(c). The insurer of Car <em>A </em>contended that the pedestrian had been \u201cstruck by\u201d a vehicle without PIP coverage (Car B) and, therefore, under \u00a7 543(c), the pedestrian\u2019s own insurer was responsible for the PIP benefits. The pedestrian\u2019s insurer countered that Car A\u2019s carrier was responsible under \u00a7 543(b)(1), because the pedestrian had been \u201cinjured by\u201d Car <em>A </em>which had PIP coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">We affirmed a judgment in favor of the pedestrian\u2019s insurer. We held that \u00a7 543(c) was inapplicable to the case, because the pedestrian had been \u201cstruck by\u201d a vehicle <em>with </em>PIP coverage\u2014Car <em>A </em>We reached this conclusion by interpreting the word \u201cstruck\u201d as encompassing \u201cnot only actual physical contact but also a force causing or resulting in physical contact.\u201d 105 Md.App. at 386, 660 A.2d 929 (internal quotation marks omitted). Since Car A had applied a force that caused another object to make physical contact with the pedestrian, we concluded that Car A had \u201cstruck\u201d the pedestrian. We then reconciled \u00a7\u00a7 543(b)(1) and 543(c) by interpreting \u00a7 543(c) as applying only when <em>none </em>of the vehicles that strikes the pedestrian has PIP coverage. 105 Md.App. at 388, 660 A.2d 929. Since that circumstance was not present, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>we held that \u00a7 543(c) was inapplicable, that \u00a7 543(b)(1) controlled, and that Car A\u2019s insurer, as the insurer of a vehicle that had \u201cinjured\u201d the pedestrian, was responsible for the pedestrian\u2019s PIP benefits. 105 Md.App. at 388-89, 660 A.2d 929.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Nationwide reads <em>Erie </em>as standing for the broad proposition that, in <em>any </em>situation in which Car <em>A </em>hits Car <em>B </em>into Pedestrian <em>P, </em>Car <em>A </em>is <em>always </em>deemed to be the vehicle that \u201cstruck\u201d or \u201cinjured\u201d <em>P </em>and that, therefore, Car B\u2019s insurer is never responsible for paying the pedestrian PIP benefits. Nothing in <em>Erie </em>can be read as suggesting such a result. Indeed, that result would be clearly at odds with the statutory language, and our opinion in <em>Erie </em>indicates quite the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">We said in <em>Erie </em>that the term \u201cstruck ... by\u201d in \u00a7 543(c) <em>includes </em>a situation in which a car strikes another object and propels it into a pedestrian. We stated: \u201c[W]e believe that the legislature intended the term \u2018struck by\u2019 as used in \u00a7 543(c) to encompass <em>not only </em>actual physical, contact <em>but also </em>a force causing or resulting in physical contact.\u201d 105 Md.App. at 386, 660 A.2d 929 (emphasis supplied). We never stated that actual physical contact by a car against a person was not encompassed in the term \u201cstruck by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In short, <em>Erie </em>involved a situation in which <em>two </em>vehicles had \u201cstruck\u201d the pedestrian. We resolved the potential conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 543(b)(1) and 543(c) by holding that \u201cif <em>any </em>vehicle that strikes and injures a pedestrian has PIP coverage in effect, the insurer of that vehicle should pay the injured pedestrian\u2019s PIP benefits.\u201d 105 Md.App. at 388, 660 A.2d 929 (emphasis in original). As one of the vehicles that had struck the pedestrian\u2014Car A\u2014had PIP coverage, we determined that that vehicle\u2019s insurer was responsible to pay PIP benefits to the pedestrian.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Applying <em>Erie </em>here, it is apparent that Seitz was \u201cinjured\u201d by the Foster vehicle, which was insured by Allstate (Car A). But Seitz was also \u201cinjured\u201d by the Ward vehicle, insured by Nationwide (Car B). Thus, under \u00a7 543(b)(1), both Nationwide and Allstate are obligated to pay PIP benefits to Seitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Nationwide also suggests that Seitz cannot recover from it because of the prohibition against duplicative or supplemental recovery of PIP benefits in \u00a7 543(a). It appears to argue that an injured pedestrian may not recover PIP benefits from two insurers at the same time. Of course, this view would render meaningless the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in the Nationwide PIP endorsement, which clearly contemplates situations in which an insured recovers PIP benefits from two insurers. But Nationwide bases its argument on \u00a7 543(a), and if there is a conflict between a PIP policy provision and the PIP statute, the statute will control. <em>See Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>314 Md. 131, 135, 550 A.2d 69 (1988) (if automobile insurance policy omits or excludes coverage required by law, omission or exclusion is ineffective); <em>Keystone Mutual Casualty Co. of Pittsburgh v. Hinds, </em>180 Md. 676, 679, 26 A.2d 761 (1942). Therefore, we shall analyze this issue in light of the statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It is plain from the language of the statute that \u00a7 543(a) does not create a blanket prohibition against recovering PIP benefits from more than one insurer. <em>See </em>Andrew Janquitto, Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance \u00a7 9.16(A) at 421 (1992). Instead, it only prohibits the recovery of PIP benefits from more than one policy or insurer \u201con either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u201d \u201cAbsent a clear indication to the contrary, a statute, if reasonably possible, is to be read so that no work, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Management Personnel Services, Inc. v. Sandefur, </em>300 Md. 332, 341, 478 A.2d 310 (1984). The question, then, is the meaning of the terms \u201cduplicative\u201d and \u201csupplemental\u201d in \u00a7 543(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In <em>Travelers Insurance Co. v. Benton, </em>278 Md. 542, 365 A.2d 1000 (1976), the Court of Appeals applied \u00a7 543(a) in a dispute concerning PIP benefits. Elizabeth Benton was injured when the vehicle in which she was riding struck a bridge abutment. The vehicle was insured by the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund, which provided PIP coverage up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>$2,500, the statutory minimum. Benton was also the named insured under her own policy issued by Travelers, which provided PIP coverage up to $2,500. Benton incurred more than $5,000 in medical expenses and received $2,500 in PIP benefits from MAIF. But she also sought to recover under her policy with Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In denying- her PIP claim, Travelers relied on two exclusions in the policy. The first stated that PIP coverage did not apply \u201cto bodily injury sustained by any person ... while occupying ... any motor vehicle, other than an insured motor vehicle, for which the coverage required under Section 539 of the ... Code is in effect.\u201d The second exclusion provided: \u201cNo person may recover benefits as prescribed by law and afforded under this insurance from more than one motor vehicle liability insurance policy on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The Court upheld the validity of the exclusions in the Travelers policy, relying heavily on the coordination of policies provisions in \u00a7 543(b) and (c), which mandate that PIP coverage ordinarily \u201cruns\u201d with the vehicle. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF--\">The statutory plan making PIP coverage mandatory on a \u201cno-fault basis\u201d plainly requires that all motor vehicles registered in Maryland shall carry such insurance. As a consequence, whenever a person qualifying as an insured under his own motor vehicle liability policy is riding as a passenger in another vehicle registered in Maryland, PIP coverage potentially exists under both policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">278 Md. at 545, 365 A.2d 1000. The Court resolved this potential \u201cdual\u201d coverage by applying \u00a7 543(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">The coordination of benefits provision contained in \u00a7 543 specifies that recovery shall be under one, but not both policies; it says in no uncertain terms that no person shall recover PIP benefits \u201cfrom more than one motor vehicle liability policy or insurer on either a duplicative or supplemental basis.\u201d As heretofore indicated, \u00a7 543(b) and (c) establish which insurer is liable for payment of PIP benefits. Where PIP coverage is \u201cin effect\u201d on the motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>involved in the accident, the insurer of that vehicle is liable for payment; where such coverage \u201cis not in effect,\u201d the injured person\u2019s insurer is liable for the PIP benefits. Travelers\u2019 PIP endorsement closely tracks the language of the statute and is entirely consistent with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">278 Md. at 545-46, 365 A.2d 1000. Accordingly, the Court held that Benton was only entitled to receive PIP benefits from the insurer of the vehicle in which she had been riding.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Andrew Janquitto, in his book Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance, <em>supra, </em>cautions against interpreting <em>Benton </em>too broadly. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">Although <em>Benton </em>appears, at first blush, to prohibit recovery under more than one policy, this is not the case. <em>Benton </em>cannot be, and must not be, understood as a carte blanche prohibition of recovery from more than one policy. What Section 543(a) prohibits is cumulative adding of required basic minimum coverages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance, \u00a7 9.16(A) at 421. Janquitto takes the position that \u00a7 543(a) was intended \u201cto prevent what is often called the \u2018stacking\u2019 of coverages-that is, it is designed to assure that the injured party is compensated but at the same time to prevent the injured party from turning the accident into a profit.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 9.16(A) at 419. <em>But cf. </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1403 (6th ed.1990) (defining \u201cstacking\u201d as the \u201cability of insured, when covered by more than one insurance policy, to obtain benefits from second policy on same claim when recovery from first policy alone would be inadequate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Janquitto provides the following example of impermissible stacking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">[A] pedestrian is injured by a vehicle with $2,500 PIP [the statutory minimum]. The pedestrian also has a policy that provides him with $2,500 PIP. The pedestrian cannot recover both the other insurer\u2019s $2,500 PIP and his own. That is, he cannot add his $2,500 PIP to the other insurer\u2019s $2,500 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>and collect $5,000. This is stacking and is prohibited by Section 543(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance, \u00a7 9.16(A) at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">But Janquitto goes on to say that, \u201c[wjhen there are differing amounts of PIP ... it is theoretically possible to coordinate recovery from both policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He states in this regard that it is \u201cabsolutely necessary\u201d to pay \u201ccareful attention\u201d to the language of the insurance policies to determine how to coordinate the PIP benefits properly. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Janquitto\u2019s example, of course, is not precisely on point here, since Seitz is not attempting to claim under the insurance policy of the vehicle that struck him as well as from his own policy. Instead, he is attempting to recover under the policies of the <em>two </em>vehicles that injured him. The prohibition in \u00a7 543(a) is only against \u201cduplicative\u201d or \u201csupplemental\u201d recovery. It is, of course, possible for a pedestrian to be struck by, or injured by, two vehicles, simultaneously or otherwise. Under the statutory scheme, the insurers of both vehicles would be responsible for PIP benefits, so long as the recovery is not duplicative or supplemental.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The <em>Benton </em>Court did not define the terms \u201cduplicative\u201d and \u201csupplemental\u201d in its opinion. Moreover, Janquitto acknowledges that defining the terms \u201cis no easy matter.\u201d Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance \u00a7 9.16(A) at 420. In <em>Yarmuth v. Government Employees Insurance Co., </em>286 Md. 256, 407 A.2d 315 (1979), however, the Court defined the terms in the context of a dispute over uninsured motorist coverage, which is also governed by \u00a7 543(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">In <em>Yarmuth, </em>the Court sustained the validity of an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in an uninsured motorist endorsement that provided that, when an insured sustained bodily injury while occupying a motor vehicle not occupied by the named insured, the insurance provided by the endorsement would apply only as \u201cexcess insurance\u201d over the primary insurance covering that motor vehicle, and then only to the extent that the limit of liability of the coverage provided by the endorsement exceeded the applicable limits of liability of the other insurance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>Yarmuth </em>also held that \u00a7 543(a) prohibits recovery of uninsured motorist insurance benefits from a secondary insurer when the insured has recovered from the primary insurer an amount equal to the statutory minimum coverage, even though the insured\u2019s damages exceed that minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The Court stated that \u201cduplicative\u201d means \u201cpayment in full twice or more for the same claim.\u201d <em>Id., </em>286 Md. at 264, 407 A.2d 315. But the Court added that, under the <em>Benton </em>interpretation, \u00a7 543(a) was not \u201csimply a device to prevent recovery on a second policy that would thereby result in a claim in excess of total damages.\u201d <em>Id., </em>286 Md. at 264, 407 A.2d 315. It thus said that the term \u201csupplemental\u201d is \u201cmore encompassing\u201d than \u201cduplicative,\u201d and \u201crefers to attempts to fill the deficiencies in the uninsured motorist coverage of the primary policy by claiming under a second policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to the Court, under the terms \u201cduplicative\u201d and \u201csupplemental,\u201d \u201cafter a claim for policy limits has been paid under the primary policy, recovery under a second policy is prohibited.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The Court of Appeals subsequently considered the application of \u00a7 543(a) in other case,s involving uninsured motorist insurance. In <em>Rafferty v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>303 Md. 63, 492 A.2d 290 (1985), the Court applied <em>Yarmuth </em>and held that \u00a7 543(a) prohibits recovery of uninsured motorist benefits in excess of the statutory minimum from more than one insurer or more than one policy, even if the coverage limit of the primary insurance is less than the coverage limit of the secondary insurance. In <em>Hoffman v. United Services Automobile Association, </em>309 Md. 167, 522 A.2d 1320 (1987), the Court qualified its prior rulings somewhat, and held that, while \u201can additional recovery under the required minimum <em>uninsured </em>motorist coverage of a second policy is precluded, ... a recovery under the optional excess <em>underinsured </em>motorist coverage of a second policy is not precluded.\u201d <em>Id., </em>309 Md. at 177, 522 A.2d 1320 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Applying the foregoing principles to the facts of this case, we conclude that Seitz has not obtained a duplicative or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>supplemental recovery <em>from </em>Allstate and Nationwide. The Nationwide policy provided for PIP benefits up to $10,000. Moreover, Seitz\u2019s medical expenses were more than his combined recovery of $10,000 from the two carriers, so he did not recover twice for the same injury. Therefore, his recovery is not \u201cduplicative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Nor is his recovery \u201csupplemental.\u201d A close reading of the prior cases indicates that they all involve attempts by an insured to recover under a <em>secondary </em>policy after recovering under a primary policy. Here, neither of the policies on the Ward or Foster vehicles may be described as \u201cprimary\u201d or \u201csecondary.\u201d Since both vehicles \u201cinjured\u201d Seitz within the meaning of \u00a7 543(b)(1), the insurers of both vehicles are required to pay Seitz PIP benefits under the statutory scheme. Thus, this case does not fall within Yarmuth\u2019s edict that an injured party cannot \u201cfill the deficiencies [of the PIP coverage] of the primary policy by recovering under a second policy.\u201d 286 Md. at 264, 407 A.2d 315. In addition, the trial court coordinated Seitz\u2019s recoveries under the two policies by applying the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in the Nationwide policy. Pursuant to that clause, the court limited Seitz\u2019s total recovery to the maximum coverage provided by the policy with the highest coverage limit. Consequently, there has been no \u201cstacking\u201d of the coverage limits of the two policies. Nor has either party challenged the manner in which the trial court divided the two insurers\u2019 responsibilities under the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The basic fallacy in Nationwide\u2019s position is its contention that an injured pedestrian may never recover PIP benefits from two insurers. Nationwide seems to suggest that, when a pedestrian is injured by two vehicles, the court must pick one vehicle and assign the primary responsibility for PIP benefits to that vehicle\u2019s carrier. The statute does not so indicate. Moreover, such a determination might well involve an assignment of \u201cfault,\u201d which is at odds with the statutory scheme. Further, we observe that if the court were entitled to choose which insurer was responsible, with or without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>regard to fault, the court may well have assigned the entire responsibility for payment of PIP benefits to Nationwide, as it had the policy with greater coverage. In that event, Nationwide would have had to pay the entire $10,000 of its policy limits, rather than its share ($8,000), pursuant to the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Based on the plain language of the statutory scheme, we cannot agree with Nationwide. Because Seitz was injured by two vehicles carrying PIP coverage, both insurers are liable for PIP benefits under \u00a7 543(b)(1). Any other conclusion would require us to rewrite the language of the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN FAVOR OF SEITZ AND AGAINST NATIONWIDE IN THE AMOUNT OF $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CLERK TO ENTER JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF SEITZ AND AGAINST ALLSTATE IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-11\">. Prior to the commencement of the proceedings below, Allstate offered to pay Seitz its PIP policy limits. Therefore, it did not attend the Circuit Court hearing and it has not participated in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\">. Although Allstate tendered its policy limits of $2,500 to Seitz prior to trial, Seitz did not accept the check, for fear of prejudicing any rights that he might have against Nationwide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b382-9\">. After oral argument, we granted appellee\u2019s Motion to Revise Docket Entries to reflect accurately the trial and judgment. The corrected docket entries reflect only the judgment in the amount of $8,000 against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Nationwide. The trial transcript reflects, however, that the trial judge declared both insurers \u201cresponsible,\u201d that Nationwide was obligated to pay $8,000 to Seitz, and that Allstate was obligated to pay \u201can additional $2,000....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b383-10\">4. Under the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, the \u201cmaximum recovery\u201d for Seitz is the greater of the policy limits, or $10,000. Nationwide's share of this figure is equal to the ratio of its coverage limit ($10,000) to the sum total of all coverage limits ($12,500), or 80%. Accordingly, the court fixed Nationwide\u2019s share at $8,000, which equals 80% of the maximum recovery of $10,000. While Nationwide disputes its liability, it does not challenge the trial court\u2019s calculation of the amount of the carriers\u2019 respective liabilities under this clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\">.
