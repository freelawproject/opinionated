Erb, appellant, owns three adjoining lots of land in Calvert County. His application for a permit to construct a new on-site sewage disposal system, a septic system, as part of his plans to build a house on the property, was denied by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), appellee. That decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court for Calvert County (Clagett, J., presiding). Appellant, appearing in <em>propria persona, </em>appeals therefrom. We rephrase the questions he raises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">1. Is the agency\u2019s decision supported by substantial evidence or based upon an error of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">2. Did the State deprive appellant of his property without due process of law, in that appellant\u2019s application was denied while certain variances have been granted to owners of neighboring parcels?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">3. Did the State take appellant\u2019s property without providing him with just compensation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">4. Did the circuit court err in refusing to allow appellant to introduce new evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">5. Did the circuit court err in denying appellant a trial by jury?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">Perceiving no reversible error, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b276-14\">Appellant has owned the undeveloped property in question since 1982, and it has been held by various members of his family since the 1920s. Combined, the lots total 6,000 square feet in area, approximately one-seventh of an acre. The lots are located on a steep slope; the grade is, on average, thirty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>three percent or greater. The only portion of the property that is not on such a steep slope contains a natural drainage swale.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">As we have stated, appellant, desiring to build a house on the property, applied to the Calvert County Health Department (CCHD) for a permit to construct an on-site septic system. An evaluation of appellant\u2019s property was performed, and, in an attempt to accommodate appellant, certain regulatory requirements pertaining to the minimum size for lots were waived. <em>See </em>Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 26.04.02.02B(1). Nonetheless, the CCHD, finding that the placement of a septic system on appellant\u2019s property could not be accomplished within the remaining regulatory guidelines, due to the natural characteristics of the property, and that such a system could pose a serious threat to public health and lead to the pollution of the waters of this State, denied his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">An administrative hearing was held on June 3, 1993, before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Among the evidence presented was the testimony of three experts: William Hay-good, a licensed sanitarian in charge of the CCHD water and sewer programs; Jay Prager, the head of the Innovative and Alternative On-Site Sewage Disposal Program for MDE; and David Edwards, a. senior civil design engineer, testifying on appellant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Edwards presented a plan to regrade appellant\u2019s property to decrease the slope to twenty-five percent, the regulatory maximum for installation of a septic system, COMAR 26.04.02.041, divert water runoff, install retaining walls, if necessary, and fill the drainage swale so as to create an area large enough for the location of the septic system. Edwards conceded, however, that even with these modifications appellant\u2019s property would still not meet all of the applicable requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Haygood testified that, based upon his inspections of the property, a septic system placed thereon would fail because of the nature of the property. Of specific concern were the size <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>of the lots, the topography, and the presence of the natural drainage swale. See COMAR 26.04.02.04F, 26.04.02.041, 26.04.02.04J. Haygood stated that the placement of septic systems in ground with a grade of greater than twenty-five percent is avoided because of \u201cthe possibility of sewage erupting from the side of the slope and draining into another area.\u201d Additionally, he testified that the placement of a septic system in or near a drainage swale decreases the effectiveness of the system and is, therefore, not permitted. <em>See </em>COMAR 26.04.02.04J.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Prager\u2019s testimony was consistent with Haygood\u2019s in respect to the unsuitability of appellant\u2019s property for a septic system. Prager did not, however, testify about the potential for use of an innovative and alternative sewage system\u2014other types of sewage disposal systems that will function properly in areas that are inappropriate for conventional septic systems\u2014 on appellant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The ALJ, in his Proposed Decision, concluded that appellant had failed to meet his burden of showing \u201cthat the septic system he proposes to install on his Calvert County property will comply with pertinent State Environmental statutes and regulations.\u201d <em>See </em>COMAR 26.01.02.28B(1). Specifically, the ALJ found that appellant\u2019s lots are located on an incline with an average grade of thirty-three percent and that appellant\u2019s property also contains a natural drainage swale, which fills with, water following a moderate rainstorm. From the expert testimony, the ALJ concluded that the consequences of placing a septic system within twenty-five feet of such a steep slope is that sewage is likely to erupt out of the side of the slope and that the placement of a system within twenty-five feet of a drainage swale, even if it were filled in as suggested by Edwards, could result in an overflow to the surface, resulting in impermissible pollution of the waters of the State, <em>see </em>Md.Code (1987, 1993 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-319 of the Environment Article (EN); COMAR 26.04.02.02E, as well as being a potential serious health hazard, <em>see </em>EN \u00a7 9-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Upon the filing of appellant\u2019s written exceptions, a hearing was held before a Final Decision Maker, a designee of the Secretary of the MDE. In his Final Decision and Order, the Final Decision Maker denied appellant\u2019s exceptions and affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. Appellant then challenged the MDE\u2019s decision before the Circuit Court for Calvert County. There, he filed a Motion For Leave To Amend Complaint, in which he sought to present arguments and evidence regarding the potential use of innovative and alternative on-site sewage system disposal technologies on his property. Holding that because the case was an appeal from an administrative agency and that the court may not consider matters outside the administrative record, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion. The court went on to affirm the MDE\u2019s decision, finding that its decision was supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence and that the decision was not affected by any error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The Agency Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Judicial review of this administrative agency\u2019s decision is authorized by Maryland Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10\u2014 222 of the State Government Article (SG). Under subsection (h), when exercising such review, the court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-13\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-14\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-15\">In general,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>[a] court\u2019s role is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v.

Department of Pub. Safety &amp; Correctional Servs., </em>330 Md. 187, 212, 623 A.2d 198 (1993). This examination seeks to find the substantiality of the evidence. \u201cThat is to say, a reviewing court, be it a circuit court or an appellate court, shall apply the substantial evidence test to the final decisions of an administrative agency....\u201d <em>Baltimore Lutheran High Sch.

In terms of fact-finding, we must emphasize that under no circumstances may we substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>Anderson, </em>330 Md. at 212, 623 A.2d 198. On the other hand, \u201c[wjhen reviewing issues of law, ... the court\u2019s review is expansive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>and it may substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Curry, </em>102 Md.App. at 627, 651 A.2d 390; <em>Columbia Rd.

However, in judicial review of agency action the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\"><em>United Steelworkers of America v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>298 Md. 665, 679, 472 A.2d 62 (1984); <em>United Parcel, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Pursuant to its authority under EN \u00a7\u00a7 9-252 and 9-510, MDE has promulgated numerous regulations governing the disposal of sewage and sewage disposal systems. Several of these are applicable to the case <em>sub judice: </em>COMAR 26.04.02.02E states: \u201cA person may not dispose of sewage, body, or industrial wastes in any manner which may cause pollution of the ground surface, the waters of the State, or create a nuisance.\u201d; COMAR 26.04.02.02T prohibits sewage from being \u201cdisposed of in any manner that will cause contamination of potable water supply systems, and waters of the State, or create a nuisance.\u201d; COMAR 26.04.02.02B(2) states: \u201cIf, in the opinion of the [MDE], the lot cannot provide for a safe and adequate ... on-site waste disposal system, a permit shall be denied.\u201d; COMAR 26.04.02.041 forbids the location of an on-site disposal system \u201con slopes in excess of 25 percent.\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>and COMAR 26.04.02.04J(3) requires a separation of at least twenty-five feet between an on-site disposal system and a drainage swale.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Drawing from the expert testimony, photographic evidence, and other evidence presented, the ALJ made the following findings of fact: the average grade of appellant\u2019s lots is thirty-three percent; the only portion of the property that is not on such a steep slope contains a natural drainage swale; even if the property were to be regraded, there is a high probability that a septic system on appellant\u2019s lots would fail; the installation of a \u201cseptic system on the steep grade could result in effluent and storm water collecting together [that] ... could cause it to erupt from the sides of [the] incline, resulting in the pollution of the surface\u201d; and \u201c[installing the septic system in the area where the natural swale runs ... could also allow surface water to collect in the septic system trench ... that would eventually ... overflow to the surface.\u201d In sum, the ALJ found as fact that the natural characteristics of appellant\u2019s property precluded the safe installation of the proposed septic system within the regulatory guidelines. Given the regulatory framework and the expert testimony adduced at the hearing, we hold that there was substantial evidence from which the ALJ could reasonably conclude that the agency\u2019s decision to deny appellant his permit was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Before the ALJ, appellant provided evidence of several nearby properties that contained either excessive grades, drainage swales, or both, in an attempt to show, in part, that the agency freely granted variances and, therefore, should not have denied his application. The Assistant Attorney General who appeared before the ALJ on behalf of MDE repeatedly objected to this evidence on relevancy grounds, stating that appellant had' not shown that the natural characteristics of these other properties were <em>identical </em>to his own. The ALJ took MDE\u2019s objections under advisement and allowed appellant to present his evidence, evidence which, we believe, is relevant to appellant\u2019s case. To the extent that appellant may have been challenging the denial of his permit application in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>light of what he perceived to be CCHD\u2019s practice of liberally granting variances to the same regulatory requirements, evidence of the agency\u2019s practices is both probative and relevant. <em>See, e.g., Ad + Soil, Inc. v. County Comm\u2019rs, </em>307 Md. 307, 320-22, 513 A.2d 893 (1986). Be that as it may, the ALJ found as fact that, while these other properties did contain natural characteristics similar to those of appellant, the other \u201clots ha[d] space available in level areas and in areas that were not located near a drainage swale that were suitable to install a septic system.\u201d There was substantial evidence to support this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">As mentioned above, before the ALJ, appellant presented extensive evidence regarding variances that had been granted to neighboring landowners whose properties have similar natural characteristics. In part, we believe, appellant presented this evidence in an attempt to show that the agency discriminated against him. As we have previously set forth, we hold that the record contains substantial evidence that appellant\u2019s application was denied due to the unique attributes of his property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Correlatively, we hold that appellant\u2019s permit application was not denied as a result of discriminatory or arbitrary agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Faced with an allegation that an administrative agency had discriminated against a permit applicant, the Court of Appeals stated, in <em>Howard Sports Daily, Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>179 Md. 355, 358-59, 18 A.2d 210 (1941):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">Unquestionably, if a law is applied and administered by public authority \u201cwith an evil eye and an unequal hand\u201d so as to make unjust discrimination between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, such denial of equal justice is within the prohibition of the Constitution. <em>But in considering the application of the constitutional safeguard, due regard must be given to the principle that the State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number><em>may regulate and restrict the freedom of the individual to act. whenever such regulation or restraint is essential to the protection of the public safety, health or morals. </em>Chief Justice Taft thus defined \u201cdue process\u201d as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment: \u201cThe due process clause requires that every man shall have the protection of his day in court, and the benefit of the general law, a law which hears before it condemns which proceeds not arbitrarily or capriciously, but upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial, so that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society.\u201d <em>Truax v. Corrigan, </em>257 U.S. 312, 332, 42 S.Ct. 124, 129 [66 L.Ed. 254 (1921) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">... Whether a complainant has been deprived of due process of law ... by action of an administrative body depends upon whether it acted contrary to the statutes and rules and with arbitrary discrimination.... The State has the undoubted right to enact legislation in the legitimate exercise of its police power. The sovereignty of the State would be a mockery if it lacked the power to compel its citizens to respect its laws____ When the cry of \u201cproperty rights\u201d is raised in an effort to circumvent the provisions of a law designed to promote and protect the public interest, equity will not aid the attempt by affording the extraordinary remedy of injunction. [Some citations omitted, emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Accord <em>Bruce v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Chesapeake Bay Affairs, </em>261 Md. 585, 600-01, 276 A.2d 200 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">That this State has broad police powers that it may use to further the public safety, health, and welfare cannot be questioned, and the regulation of sewage disposal is but one of the many areas properly regulated through this power. <em>Millison v. Secretary of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>32 Md.App. 165, 170-72, 359 A.2d 247, <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 728 (1976); <em>see also Robert T. Foley Co. v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>283 Md. 140, 148-50, 389 A.2d 350 (1978). \u201cIn the exercise of the police power the State may lawfully impose such burdens and restraints on private rights as may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>reasonably necessary and proper to secure the general welfare.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Fields Rd. Corp., </em>282 Md. 575, 583, 386 A.2d 344 (1978). Pursuant to its statutory authority, MDE has promulgated numerous regulations governing the disposal of sewage and sewage disposal systems in order to further the public health and safety. When, based upon the agency\u2019s expertise, deviation from these regulations may be accomplished without compromising the public health and safety, MDE may, in its discretion, issue a permit. In appellant\u2019s case, however, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s charge that he is the victim of discrimination, he has not shown that the agency acted in a discriminatory manner. Rather, the record illustrates how the agency attempted to accommodate appellant but ultimately was unable to do so and maintain adequate health safeguards. The decision to deny a permit to appellant was one within MDE\u2019s discretion, and, in the case at bar, it has not been shown that it abused that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">In terms of due process, before the ALJ, appellant had a full adversarial hearing. Although he waived the right, appellant was entitled to be represented by counsel. He was afforded the opportunity to present evidence and witnesses on his own behalf and to cross-examine opposing witnesses. When the matter did not go as planned, appellant utilized his right of appeal to the courts of this State. Not only has appellant not been deprived of his property without due process of law, appellant has received an abundance of process. That the matter has not gone as appellant would have liked does not amount to a denial of the process that is due. <em>See Maryland Aggregates Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>337 Md. 658, 686-88, 655 A.2d 886 (1995); <em>Maryland State Police v.

South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992), appellant contends that, if the State does not grant him his permit, it should provide him with just compensation for his property. We hold that appellant\u2019s property has not been taken within the meaning of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article III, \u00a7 40 of the Maryland Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The facts of <em>L\u00faeas </em>are as follows: In 1986, Lucas purchased two beachfront lots, intending to build single-family houses on them. Prior to construction, the South Carolina legislature enacted the Beachfront Management Act, which effectively barred Lucas from erecting any permanent structures on the property. Thereafter, he filed suit against the state agency charged with administering the Act. Lucas conceded that the Act was a lawful exercise of the- state\u2019s police power; nevertheless, he argued that the construction ban deprived him of all economically beneficial use of his property and, therefore, constituted a taking under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court, in a comprehensive review of its Fifth Amendment Takings Clause jurisprudence, identified \u201ctwo discrete categories of regulatory action [that are] compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the restraint.\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1015, 112 S.Ct. at 2893. The first encompasses regulations that bring about an actual physical invasion of the property. This aspect is not implicated in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>second concerns situations in which regulations deny a property owner of \u201call economically beneficial or productive use of land.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Offen v.

Even if appellant were to establish no viable economic use, he is only entitled to compensation for his property if he has been denied all the economically beneficial use thereof under a regulatory scheme that does <em>\u201cmore than duplicate the result that could have been achieved ... under the State\u2019s law of private nuisance.\u201d Lucas, </em>505 U.S. at 1029,112 S.Ct. at 2900 (emphasis added); <em>Hebron Sav.

The record is sparse in regard to the other uses or remaining utility of the property in question, and, moreover, it is possible, as we mention, <em>infra, </em>that appellant will be able to utilize alternate means of sewage disposal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Further, and more important, as discussed above, the power to regulate sewage disposal systems rests within the police power of this State. The regulatory scheme set up by MDE does no more than could be accomplished under the nuisance laws of this State. <em>Cf. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. CAE-Link Corp., </em>330 Md. 115, 622 A.2d 745 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 907, 114 S.Ct. 288, 126 L.Ed.2d 238 (1994). Even if MDE\u2019s regulatory scheme\u2014a scheme designed to prevent appellant from creating a nuisance on his property\u2014were to leave his property economically barren, no compensation would be due because the State has a right\u2014 and, indeed, an obligation\u2014to regulate against the creation of nuisances. This principle was clearly set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Lucas:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-i\">Where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, we think it may resist compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into the nature of the owner\u2019s estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of his title to begin with.... It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; \u201c[a]s long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v.

This power to abate nuisances is independent of, though not inconsistent with, the regulatory power of the states, when they adopt regulatory practices to prevent the creation of such nuisances. The regulation of potential nuisances, alone, does not constitute an unconstitutional taking, even if no present economically viable use remains. To prevent by regulation that which is forbidden in the first instance under the laws relating to the use of private property is not a taking. Lucas makes that clear. Simply stated, there exist properties that are unbuildable, whether or not regulated, due to legitimate health and/or nuisance concerns. To prohibit by regulation that which is, in any event, prohibited is not an unconstitutional taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In the instant case, MDE\u2019s regulations serve to proscribe a nuisance from coming into existence on appellant\u2019s property. The power to regulate in this area is one facet of the State\u2019s power to regulate in order to protect the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>health and safety. Appellant\u2019s property has not been taken for public use; rather, his development of it has been restricted to prevent public harm. In general, a property owner must use his property so as not to injure others, and a state is allowed to promulgate regulations that achieve this result. Along the same lines, a property owner generally has the constitutional right to make any use of his property he desires, so long as he does not endanger or threaten the health and safety of the general public. Were appellant allowed to install a septic system, given the expert testimony that, in all likelihood, the system would fail, it would constitute a threat to public health. The State may prohibit such use, and the fact that MDE\u2019s regulations prevent appellant from enjoying his property in the manner he would like does not render the agency\u2019s actions a taking for which compensation is due. <em>See Bureau of Mines v. George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Land Co., </em>272 Md. 143, 165, 321A.2d 748 (1974); <em>see also Hebron Sav. Bank, </em>259 Md. at 300-01, 269 A.2d 597. There is no right, and there has never been any, incidental to the use of private property to create, conduct, or permit a nuisance thereon. A regulation prohibiting a nuisance is not, and cannot be, the taking or interference with a right incident to the use of private property. A right to maintain a nuisance does not exist in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Presentation of New Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">On April 7,1995, appellant filed in the circuit court a Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint. Through it, he sought to present additional evidence in respect to neighboring sites that had been granted variances from regulatory requirements and information on innovative and alternative sewage systems that he believed would work on his property. His motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Generally, the scope of a court\u2019s review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act is confined to the record made before the administrative agency. <em>United Parcel, .supra, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d 226; <em>Consumer Protection Div. Office of the Attorney Gen. v. Consumer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>Publishing Co., </em>304 Md. 731, 749, 501 A.2d 48 (1985); <em>Warner v. Town, of Ocean City, </em>81 Md.App. 176, 193-94, 567 A.2d 160 (1989). The presentation of new evidence to the circuit court is inconsistent with the narrow scope of judicial review of agency decisions. Were new evidence to be allowed before the circuit court and the court permitted to take that evidence into consideration when rendering its decision, the circuit court would no longer be focusing its attention upon the proper considerations. Rather, a party would, in most cases, be presenting this new evidence to detract from that evidence upon which the agency based its decision, and, therefore, the court would not be focusing upon whether the record itself contains substantial evidence to support the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">There exists a narrow exception to this rule, and it is limited to evidence of alleged procedural irregularities at the agency level: \u201cA party may offer testimony [to the circuit court] on alleged irregularities in procedure before the presiding officer that do not appear on the record.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-222(g)(2); <em>Ad </em>+ <em>Soil, supra, </em>307 Md. at 320-22, 513 A.2d 893; <em>Consumer Protection Div., </em>304 Md. at 750, 501 A.2d 48. To the extent that appellant was offering the evidence of subsequent variances granted to neighboring landowners in an attempt to show that the agency was acting in an arbitrary or inconsistent <em>manner\u2014i.e., </em>granting variances to certain landowners while denying them to appellant\u2014that evidence <em>might </em>be admissible before the court. <em>Ad </em>+ <em>Soil, </em>307 Md. at 320-22, 513 A.2d 893; <em>Aspen Hill Venture v. Montgomery County Council, </em>265 Md. 303, 316-17, 289 A.2d 303 (1972). \u201c[Evidence of subsequent inconsistent decisions of the same [administrative] body [is] highly reliable and probative\u201d because it directly relates to the possible \u201carbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory quality\u201d of the administrative body\u2019s actions. <em>Ad </em>+ <em>Soil, </em>307 Md. at 321, 513 A.2d 893. \u201c[S]uch evidence [is] admissible before the reviewing court as an exception to the general rule restricting judicial review to evidence in the administrative record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, any error was harmless, in that the record contained the evidence appellant had presented to the ALJ on variances granted to neighboring landowners and any new evidence presented for the first time before the circuit court would merely have been cumulative. More important, as discussed, the record contained substantial evidence to the effect that it was the inordinate confluence of factors contrary to the safe operation of an on-site septic system that caused MDE to deny the permit in appellant\u2019s case\u2014a confluence of factors not extant in respect to the permits granted the neighbors\u2014and that the decision to deny appellant his permit was not the result of an arbitrary, inconsistent, or discriminatory agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">As for the evidence on innovative and alternative systems, notwithstanding the subsequent rejection of one of appellant\u2019s proposed alternative systems, those materials and proposals have not yet been ruled upon by CCHD and MDE. Appellant\u2019s new proposals are independent of and dissimilar from his regrading proposal. Because appellant did not present evidence of such systems before the ALJ, MDE could not review the proposals at that time in order to determine if they could safely treat and dispose of the sewage attendant to appellant\u2019s residence on the property. \u201c[A] person may not obtain judicial review of a matter when he or she failed to properly raise the matter before the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Heft v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>323 Md. 257, 273-74, 592 A.2d 1110 (1991); <em>see </em>Md. Eule 7-208(c). Thus, the circuit court properly declined to review proposals that had yet to be ruled upon by the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Jury Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Appellant desired a trial by jury before the circuit court; he was not, however, afforded one. Simply stated, when a circuit court sits for the purpose of reviewing the decision of an administrative agency under the State Administrative Procedure Act, there is no right to a jury trial. Section 10-222(g) of the State Government Article flatly proscribes such a procedure: \u201cThe court shall conduct a proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ing under this section without a jury.\u201d <em>See County Council v. Investors Funding Corp., </em>270 Md. 403, 437 n. 12, 312 A.2d 225 (1973) (\u201cThat no provision is made for a de novo trial on appeal from the final action of [an administrative agency] does not constitute a deprivation of the right to a jury trial ....\u201d); <em>see also Maryland Aggregates, supra, </em>337 Md. at 680, 655 A.2d 886; <em>Esslinger v. Baltimore City, </em>95 Md.App. 607, 624, 622 A.2d 774, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 Md. 479, 628 A.2d 1066 (1993). In any event, our review of the record has failed to disclose that appellant made any demand for a jury trial to the circuit court. Thus, even if appellant had had a right to a jury trial, it was waived. Md. Rule 2-325(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In closing, we note, as Judge Clagett so correctly pointed out, this decision does not permanently foreclose appellant\u2019s right to build upon his property. Appellant is entitled to obtain further proposals for the design and construction of disposal systems and to submit them to the CCHD for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">.
