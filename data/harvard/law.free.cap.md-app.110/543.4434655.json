Frederick Motz of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, and the second by the Honorable Edward Engerud of the North Dakota Supreme Court, explain why every litigant must be afforded a full and fair opportunity to establish \u201cthe relationship between a party and a witness which might lead the witness to slant, unconsciously or otherwise, his testimony in favor of or against a party.\u201d <em>United States v. Abel, </em>469 U.S. 45, 52, 105 S.Ct. 465, 469, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984). Md.Rule 5-616(a)(4) grants each party an opportunity to question a witness about facts that are of consequence to the issue of whether \u201cthe witness is biased, prejudiced, interested in the outcome of the proceeding, or has a motive to testify falsely.\u201d This appeal from the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County presents the question of whether Anthony Lamont Leeks, appellant, was unfairly denied such an opportunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">The following evidence was sufficient to persuade a Prince George\u2019s County jury that on the night of May 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>1993, appellant committed a second degree (\u201cdepraved heart\u201d) murder and used a handgun in the commission of that felony. Appellant was in a group of persons near an apartment complex in Landover where the victim was shot. Appellant said something that a man named \u201cCliff\u2019 considered offensive. After an argument and about two minutes of fighting, both appellant and \u201cCliff\u2019 went to their respective cars. Appellant then rejoined the group, looking for \u201cCliff.\u201d Now, however, appellant was holding a small automatic pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">As appellant began waving the gun in the air, the gun fired and a bystander was shot. At this point someone tried to wrestle appellant to the ground. In the ensuing struggle, the gun fired again and yet another bystander was shot. The murder victim was shot in the head. Fortunately, the other bystander was merely grazed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">THE ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Donzell Thompson was, in the words of the prosecutor, the State\u2019s \u201cmain witness.\u201d On June 15, 1994, Thompson had entered a plea of guilty to the crime of assault that had allegedly occurred in 1991. In that same case, however, he had also been charged with armed robbery and felony theft. On December 12, 1994, Thompson had entered a plea of guilty to the crime of disorderly conduct. In that same case, however, he had also been charged with theft and assault. On March 16, 1995, the State nol prossed a controlled dangerous substance charge then pending against him. All of these cases were handled by the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Before opening statements the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">PROSECUTOR: Before you bring in the jury, I want to make a motion on the couple of items I think [Defense Counsel] might be inclined to mention.in his opening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>[Defense Counsel] had mentioned to me around lunch time that\u2014words to the effect of Dansel [sic] Thompson, and this is my main witness, has a really bad record, and I thought well, gee, maybe I better run his record and see what it has [sic]. At first blush he\u2019s been charged with robbery and theft, but it appears although it says they were either nolle prossed or plead down to misdemeanors such as assault and battery, disorderly conduct, and those types of things, the State believes that he does not have any crimes which would be admissible as impeachable offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, as far as Mr. Thompson\u2019s recordings [sic], there is a number of cases that I\u2019m interested in, but one in particular is CT 91-1857A. He was charged armed robbery, and a number of other related offenses including theft over and under, and things like that. At least theft over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">Also he has an AKA of Reginald Alphonso Thompson. His name that the States [sic] has got him for in this case is Dansel [sic] Nathaniel Thompson. In that situation, an armed robbery allegedly occurred August 6th of 1991 at 1:25 a.m., and one of the victim\u2019s [sic] was a man named Oscar Mitchell. That case was around the courthouse for a long, long time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">... Their whole case is based on testimony of Dansel [sic] Nathaniel Thompson. That has been known for quite some time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">On June 15th of 94, Dansel [sic] Thompson plead guilty not to an armed robbery, not to a theft, not to anything that could be a crime of moral turpitude. Seems to be very carefully placed that they made it an assault, and, I think that was very unusual, based on my experience as a prosecutor and defense attorney that that is what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">THE COURT: What I will do is, I will let you voir dire the witness out of the presence of the jury first, to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>whether or not there\u2019s any symptoms of a deal that has been made.... [Defense counsel], I\u2019m going to ask the State to bring this witness in, and put him on the stand. You are restricted to inquiring as to whether or not there have been any deals made between the defense\u2014I\u2019m sorry, between the witness and the State with respect to this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Thank you, Your Honor. I would ask one other area to inquire of him, and that is his D.C. record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">THE COURT: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Let me put on the record\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t care what your reason is. The answer is no, I am bringing this man in under Court order. You will be restricted to whether or not there has been any deal made between this person and the State with respect to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">I don\u2019t care sir. You\u2019ll not inquire as to his [D.C.] record, is that clear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Very well, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">The following transpired during this voir dire proceeding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJQ\">Q: Mr. Thompson, your full name is Donzell Nathaniel Thompson, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-12\">A: Correct.'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-13\">Q: Your date of birth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-14\">THE COURT: You may inquire. I told you what [you] could inquire about, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-15\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: I want to make sure\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-16\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t care. I told you what you are restricted to, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-17\">Q: Okay. Now, all three of these cases that I have just mentioned, there is CDS possession, petty theft and armed robbery, were disposed of after May of 1993, when this murder took place, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>A: Yes, I guess.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">Q: Well, [the victim] was killed in May of 1993, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">A: If it was May, I guess it was. It is so many years ago I don\u2019t recall which month it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">Q: Do you remember what year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">A: No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">Q: From the beginning of [the victim\u2019s] case, you were a State\u2019s witness, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">Q: Okay. And, has the State offered you anything in exchange for your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">A: No they haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-13\">Q: Are you in jail right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-14\">A: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-15\">Q: What are you in jail for right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-16\">THE COURT: Don\u2019t answer that. Do not answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-17\">Q: Has the State told you they are going to get you out of jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-18\">A: No, they haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-19\">Q: Okay. Have they told you that\u2014well let me put it this way. Have they told you things would go better for you if you cooperated with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-20\">A: No, they haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-21\">Q: Are you telling me that you had a charge of armed robbery back in 1991, disposed of last year, 1994, as an assault, no theft, no robbery count, just as assault, and it was no deal with the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-22\">A: No, it was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-23\">Q: Okay. Now when was the last time you talked to ... th[e] prosecutor in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-24\">THE STATE: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-25\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Q: Have you talked to any other State\u2019s Attorney besides [this one]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">THE COURT: You mean about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: About this case or any of the other cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">THE COURT: No, about this case. I have no problem. Have you talked to any other State\u2019s Attorney about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u25a0 THE WITNESS: No, I have not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">Q: Now, Mr. Thompson, have you ever informed any\u2014 either by yourself or through counsel have you informed anybody or State\u2019s Attorney that you are the Donzell Thompson to testify in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">A: No, I have not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">Q: What is your explanation for why you plead guilty to disorderly conduct, rather than petty theft in December of\u2014'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">THE COURT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">Q: Mr. Thompson, have you ever gone by the name of Reginald Alphonso Thompson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">A: That\u2019s my brother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-14\">Q: That\u2019s your brother. Were you arrested in an armed robbery case in 1991, when you gave the name Reginald Alphonso Thompson, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-15\">A: No, that\u2019s not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-16\">Q: Why on your case jacket\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-17\">THE COURT: That\u2019s enough of this. That\u2019s enough of this. Any other questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-18\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Well, Your Honor I\u2019m restricted to ask questions that I need to ask\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-19\">THE COURT: Do you have another question, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Auq\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>After defense counsel finished questioning Thompson, the judge granted the State\u2019s motion and stated to defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">Your motion is denied, The Court has now ruled. I will [not hear] another word about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">During the trial, appellant\u2019s trial counsel made no effort to circumvent that ruling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During his closing argument, the prosecutor made the following comments about Mr. Thompson\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">... Donzell Thompson was a credible witness. Donzell Thompson told you, I was out there that night. This is what happened, and again, I\u2019m going to ask you when you are deliberating, and if you have any questions about his credibility, to think about the times he would close his eyes, and he would take a minute, and he would do something with his hand, and you could see him re-playing the events in his mind, so that he would give you a correct answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">Recall also that this event is two years old, and that people\u2019s memories are not as fresh, as if we had had the trial the week after it happened. There\u2019s a lot of reasons why cases get old, and that\u2019s not something you should speculate on or wonder about, but when Donzell was directed to his statement or other things to help refresh his memory, then he would stop, and he would think about it, and then he would say oh, yes, this is what happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">As is shown by the above argument, the State was given the opportunity to present Thompson as a believable witness. Unfortunately, defense counsel was never given an adequate opportunity to establish the existence of evidence that would support a contrary conclusion. We are persuaded that the trial judge should not have restricted the efforts of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>trial counsel to establish a factual predicate for the introduction of evidence that Thompson\u2019s testimony was slanted in favor of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u201cIt is well settled law in this State that exploratory questions on cross-examination are proper when they are designed to affect a witness\u2019 credibility, test his memory or exhibit bias.\u201d <em>Kruszewski v. Holz, 265 </em>Md. <em>434, 440, 290 </em>A.2d 534 (1972); <em>see also State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 178, 468 A.2d 319 (1983). The Sixth Amendment right of confrontation includes the right to cross-examine about matters that affect a witness\u2019s bias, interest, or motive to lie. <em>Brown v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 414, 418, 538 A.2d 317 (1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">It is true, of course, that the right to cross-examine is not absolute and may be restricted by the trial judge. Any such restriction, however, should be manifested by the exercise of sound discretion. <em>Cox, </em>298 Md. at 183, 468 A.2d 319; <em>Waldron v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 686, 696, 491 A.2d 595, <em>cert. denied, 304 </em>Md. 97, 497 A.2d 819 (1985); <em>Fletcher v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 349, 357, 437 A.2d 901 (1981). When the trial judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">limits cross-examination of a witness so as to preclude a demonstration of bias, prejudice or other unworthy motivation on the part of the witness, he prevents the defense from presenting all of the facts, forestalls an adequate basis for assessment of credibility and erodes the purpose of cross-examination....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\"><em>Deinhardt v. State, </em>29 Md.App. 391, 397, 348 A.2d 286 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>277 Md. 736 (1976); <em>see also, Waldron, </em>62 Md.App. at 697, 491 A.2d 595. \u201cClearly, the absolute preclusion of cross-examination pertaining to a witness\u2019s motive for testifying would be an abuse of discretion____\u201d <em>Fletcher, </em>50 Md.App. at 357, 437 A.2d 901. This is especially the case, when the witness the defendant wishes to cross-examine is the prosecution\u2019s key witness. <em>State v. DeLawder, </em>28 Md.App. 212, 226-27, 344 A.2d 446 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">As this Court has stated previously:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>[t]he test of admissibility ... is whether the question asked is directed at eliciting from a prosecution witness the fact that he may be under pressure to testify favorably for the State, as when he is under formal accusation, and/or incarceration awaiting trial. We do not mean to imply that any time a witness testifies against a criminal defendant his entire record of previous arrests becomes relevant to the inquiry. Only where there is some present possibility of coercion should such cross-examination be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><em>Johnson v. State, </em>30 Md.App. 512, 516-17, 352 A.2d 371, <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 735 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In decisions affirming rulings that restricted the cross-examination of a State\u2019s witness, the Court of Appeals has never rejected the principles discussed in <em>Deinhardt </em>and <em>Johnson. </em>In <em>Collins v. State, </em>318 Md. 269, 568 A.2d 1. <em>cert. denied, </em>497 U.S. 1032, 110 S.Ct. 3296, 111 L.Ed.2d 805 (1990), the court rejected a contention that the trial judge had erroneously denied the accused an opportunity to cross-examine an admitted accomplice about drug possession charges pending against the witness at the time of his testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 281, 568 A.2d 1. Collins argued that, from evidence that this witness was in possession of a large quantity of narcotics, the jurors could disbelieve his testimony that he was broke and in need of money at the time of the offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The trial judge had prohibited such impeachment for two reasons: (1) the accomplice had not been convicted of the possession charge and (2) there were other persons in proximity to the drugs at the time the drugs were found. <em>Id. </em>at 281-82, 568 A.2d 1. The Court of Appeals held that, because there was sufficient evidence of the accomplice\u2019s drug involvement to allow the jury to assess his credibility, and because the accomplice had outlined his plea agreement with the State during his direct examination, the trial judge\u2019s restriction was harmless error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">In <em>Watkins v. State, </em>328 Md. 95, 613 A.2d 379 (1992), the Court held that defense counsel was not entitled to impeach two key State\u2019s witnesses by establishing that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>currently on probation. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 613 A.2d 379. Watkins defended the charges against him by claiming that he acted out of self-defense at a meeting with the victims that involved the sale of some \u201cbad\u201d drugs. Defense counsel did not suggest that either witness had received probation as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for their favorable testimony in this case. <em>Id. </em>The defense did argue, however, that the probationary status <em>of </em>these witnesses gave them an additional reason to deny any involvement with drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 102, 613 A.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Conceding that there was some merit in this argument, the Court pointed out that the trial judge did have discretion to permit such evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 102-03, 613 A.2d 379. The Court ultimately concluded, however, that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he excluded the evidence after weighing its probative value against other appropriate considerations. <em>Id. </em>at 103, 613 A.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In <em>Ebb v. State, </em>341 Md. 578, 671 A.2d 974 (1996), the Court affirmed murder convictions against a defendant who had been denied the opportunity to question two State\u2019s witnesses about pending criminal and/or violation of probation charges. The trial judge held a hearing outside the presence of the jury and determined that only one of three State\u2019s witnesses hoped t\u00f3 benefit from his testimony. The Court of Appeals held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in precluding the cross-examination of the two witnesses who denied any expectation of favorable consideration. <em>Id. </em>at 586, 671 A.2d 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\"><em>Collins, Watkins, </em>and <em>Ebb </em>make it clear that the trial judge is not obligated to allow cross-examination about every charge pending against a State\u2019s witness. Those cases, however, are distinguishable from the case before us. In <em>Watkins, </em>the defendant did not argue that either witness had been given probation because of a deal with the State. The defense in that case was more interested in showing the jury that the State\u2019s witnesses were bad persons who lacked veracity because they were involved in drug dealing. The same was true in <em>Collins. </em>Moreover, the key witness in <em>Collins </em>testified on direct examination about his deal with the State. In <em>Ebb, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>trial judge did allow cross-examination to establish the bias of the one witness who had acknowledged his hope of future consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In <em>Jackson v. State, </em>340 Md. 705, 668 A.2d 8 (1995), the Court of Appeals suggested that when deciding whether a witness can be questioned about a prior conviction, the trial judge should</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">(1) hold an on the record hearing outside of the presence of the jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">(2) afford each party the opportunity to address factors that must be considered in weighing the probative value of the conviction against the danger of unfair prejudice; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">(3) after deciding the issue, \u201cplace specific circumstances and factors critical to the decision on the record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 717, 668 A.2d 8. We are persuaded that an on the record evidentiary hearing, with the jurors out of the courtroom, is necessary when the trial judge is asked to rule <em>in limine </em>that a witness cannot be asked questions permitted by Rule 5-616(a)(4). Rules 5-401 and 5-403 apply at this hearing, interrogation should be limited to the matters listed in Rule 5-616(a)(4), and counsel are not entitled to turn the hearing into a discovery deposition. At this hearing, however, the trial judge must afford counsel an adequate opportunity to question the witness about every fact that would reasonably suggest the existence of bias. The issue of bias is often generated by circumstantial evidence, and does not disappear merely because the witness denies any reason to be biased.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If such circumstantial evidence exists, the trier of fact is entitled to observe the witness\u2019s demeanor as he or she responds to questions permitted by Rule 5-616(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">When the trier of fact is a jury, questions permitted by Rule 5-616(a)(4) should be prohibited only if (1) there is no factual foundation for such an inquiry in the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the jury, or (2) the probative value of such an inquiry is substantially outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice or confusion. If the trial court decides to exclude circumstantial evidence of bias, it must state why it is prohibiting counsel from presenting such evidence to the jury. That discretionary ruling will be entitled to great deference, provided that it is based on a complete factual predicate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We commend the trial judge for his prompt decision to resolve the bias issue at an on the record <em>in limine </em>hearing. Error occurred, however, when the trial judge restricted defense counsel\u2019s inquiry of the witness. In this case, there was a great deal of circumstantial evidence reasonably suggesting the existence of an agreed upon <em>quid pro quo, </em>or reasonably suggesting that the witness did indeed hope for some consideration from the State. Given Thompson\u2019s residence at the time of the trial, and his obvious familiarity with the criminal justice system, the trial judge should have afforded defense counsel wider latitude at the <em>in limine </em>hearing. Defense counsel should have been allowed to ask any question that was of consequence to the issue of whether Thompson had an interest in helping the State obtain a conviction. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>30 Md.App. at 516-517, 352 A.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">We are unable to affirm the ruling that insulated Thompson <em>from </em>questions directed at revealing his potential bias. As a result of the restrictions imposed on defense counsel at the <em>in limine </em>hearing, that ruling was based on an incomplete factual predicate. <em>Ebb </em>requires that the trial court give defense counsel a full and fair opportunity to establish the bias of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>State\u2019s witness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant was denied such an opportunity. Accordingly, we must reverse appellant\u2019s convictions and remand his case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR NEW TRIAL; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-12\">. Appellant also contends that the evidence was not \"legally sufficient to sustain [his] conviction for second degree depraved heart murder,\u201d and that \"the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting photographs of the deceased which were part of the autopsy report.\u201d We are persuaded that the evidence was sufficient. At appellant\u2019s new trial, the presiding judge shall resolve the autopsy photographs issue in accordance with the principles stated in <em>State v. Broberg, </em>342 Md. 544, 677 A.2d 602 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-12\">. The record does not reveal whether, at the time of appellant's trial, Mr. Thompson had been sentenced in any of these cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b541-11\">. In light of the above-quoted proceedings, nothing else was required to preserve the foreclosure of impeachment issue for our review. <em>See Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 38, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988); <em>Yowell v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 279, 282-283, 344 A.2d 442 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b545-11\">. Because such evidence is considered so important to an accurate assessment of credibility, Rule 5-616(b)(4) permits extrinsic evidence of bias whether or not the witness has been questioned about that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\">. The record does not contain the trial judge\u2019s explanation of why he prohibited defense counsel from presenting the jury with evidence of Thompson's potential bias. It is of no consequence, however, whether the trial judge concluded as a matter of law that the issue of Thompson's bias had not been generated, or concluded in the exercise of his discretion that the relevant evidence of Thompson's bias was substantially outweighed by other factors. Because of the erroneous restriction on what other questions could be asked of Thompson at the <em>in limine </em>hearing, there was an incomplete factual predicate for either conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b547-12\">. Unfortunately, the able trial judge who presided in this case did not have the benefit of the <em>Ebb </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
