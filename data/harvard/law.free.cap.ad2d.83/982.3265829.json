Memorandum: Petitioner appeals from an order of Monroe Special Term dismissing his petition in a proceeding to invalidate the designation of respondent candidate, a police officer, on the ground that the latter\u2019s candidacy violates section 17-110 of the Election Law. The petition was properly dismissed since neither the candidacy of a police officer nor the act of soliciting voters\u2019 signatures on a designating petition violates the statute (see Election Law, \u00a7 17-110; accord 1974 Atty Gen [Inf Opns] 79,124; cf. Second Class Cities Law, \u00a7 144). (Appeal from order of Monroe Supreme Court, Kennedy, J. \u2014 election law.) Present \u2014 Dillon, P.J., Cardamone, Callahan, Denman and Schnepp, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A9Z\">(Decided Aug. 26, 1981.)</decisiondate>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
