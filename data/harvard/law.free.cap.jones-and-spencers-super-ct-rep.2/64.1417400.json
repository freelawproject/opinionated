He said he had no money, but had something as good as money. He took out the note in question and told George to take it, and he took it. Nothing was said about trading out the balance. Nor was anything said about receiving the note either in payment or satisfaction of the debt, or as collateral security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-10\">The plaintiffs, after receiving the note, sold and delivered to Woodhouse goods amounting to the difference between the debt of three hundred and eight dollars and the amount of the note, and sixty dollars over and above the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>It was also proved that defendant Rogers, being indebted to Woodhouse, which indebtedness was by agreement to be paid in notes at eight months, Wood-house applied to him to make notes at four instead of eight months, to which Woodhouse consented, on condition that the four months\u2019 notes, when due, should be renewed by other notes at four months. Thereupon Rogers gave Woodhouse two notes, dated December 11, 1869, one for two hundred dollars and one for five hundred dollars. And Woodhouse executed and signed a written instrument by which he agreed to cause these notes to be renewed before maturity for another prior of four months, and that they should not be put in the market for sale or loan, but should only be discounted at bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-4\">At the maturity of the note in question Rogers made a new note for the same amount, adding the interest for four months longer, and gave it to Woodhouse to give to the parties holding the one in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\">There was conflict of evidence as to whether Wood-house tendered the new note before protest of thb old or not. There is no finding of fact on this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">Mr. Woodhouse testifies that he gave plaintiff the note in suit by mistake ; that he held another note of Mr. Rogers for five hundred dollars which was not subject to renewal, and that was the one he intended to give plaintiff. There is no finding on this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">It was shown on the trial that plaintiffs had not at any time before the maturity of the note any knowledge, information, or notice of the agreement or arrangement between Woodhouse and Rogers, nor any cause to suspect the existence of such arrangement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-8\">In the\u2019course of the trial George Lewis was asked this question :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-9\">Before the maturity of the note did he (Woodhouse) obtain any supplies on that note ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The question was objected to.

The defendant Rogers having protected himself by taking a written agreement securing to him the right of renewing the note for another and additional term, these two papers, executed at the same time and in reference to the same subject matter, are to be taken together as one paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-10\">This is so against these plaintiffs, unless they are to be protected by the rule applied in favor of the party who is <em>a bona fide holder for value.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-11\">In the first instance, the production of the note is sufficient for plaintiffs case; he is presumed to be the lawful owner, and to have received it in the due course of business and for value (1 Denio, 367; 1 <em>Sandf. </em>37 ; 15 <em>Barb. </em>285).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-13\">It is, however, a mere presumption that so aids the plaintiff; a mere presumption, <em>potent </em>if undisturbed, is a slight thing and easily got rid of. Thus, for instance, if the defendant proves that the note was lost, stolen, perverted to an improper use, or the like, all the cases agree that this shifts the burthen of proof over on the plaintiffs, and obliges them to show that they took the note in the due course of business and <em>parted with value.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-14\"><em>2. This parting with value is a vital and substan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>tial thing, </em>and precisely what the words themselves import (Rosa <em>v. </em>Brotherson, 10 <em>Wend. </em>86).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-5\">Where a creditor receives the transfer of a negotiable note in payment of a precedent debt, he takes it, though transferred before maturity, subject to all equities existing between the original parties (Cardwell <em>v. </em>Hicks, <em>23 How.

Cases collected).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI_\">It has been remarked that there is a conflict of authority in the decisions of the courts of this' State as to what constitutes a <em>bona fide </em>holder of negotiable paper for value; but it is believed that, with one or two exceptions, the cases can be harmonized and brought within well-established principles. And it is. well settled that where a note is transferred simply as collateral security for a precedent debt, the holder <em>is not a holder for </em>value, so as to cut off any defense existing in favor of the maker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-8\">The leading case in this State on the point is Codington <em>v. </em>Ray, 20 <em>Johns. </em>637.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-9\">That case was followed by Wardell <em>v. </em>Howell, 9 <em>Wend. </em>170.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-10\">Thus, it is only where the holder of negotiable paper received it before maturity in good faith, without notice of any equities between the original parties, and on the strength of it <em>parted </em>with property\u2014gives up a <em>valuable right </em>or <em>incurred </em>liability, or received it in full payment of a precedent debt\u2014he is a <em>bona fide </em>holder for value, so as to cut off any defense existing in favor of the maker. This principle was expressly decided in the affirmative in Bank of Salina <em>v. </em>Babcock, 21 <em>Wend. </em>499: Weltheimer <em>v. </em>Meyer, 33 <em>Barb. </em>215; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Brown <em>v. </em>Leavitt, 31 <em>N.

The note in this case was (no settlement) turned out simply as security, no proof that it had been received in <em>full payment </em>of the debt, the <em>indebtedness not </em>canceled, but, on the contrary, it appeared that plaintiffs supplied defendant Woodhouse with meat to an amount exceeding the amount of the note by sixty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-6\">In Bank of St. Albans <em>v. </em>Gfilliand, notes received <em>\u201cin full </em>satisfaction\u201d and the \u201cindebtedness canceled,\u201d and the decision has been followed by every well-considered case involving the same question since decided in the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-7\">In Bank of Sandusky <em>v. </em>Scoville, plaintiff discounted the note and applied the proceeds to extinguish a precedent debt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-8\">In Young <em>v. </em>Lee the note was received in payment of a note due in a few days, which was \u201csurrendered\u201d on receipt of the new note, and the decision of the cases bearing upon this question attach great importance to the terms \u201c <em>satisfaction,\u201d \u201c </em>canceled,\u201d <em>\u201csurrendered,\u201d </em>\u201cextinguished,\u201d <em>\u201cgiven up,\u201d </em>&amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-9\">In Bright <em>v. </em>Judson, 47 <em>Barb. </em>39, the reported note states \u201cit is not enough that new paper should have been received in payment and satisfaction of the old, the old paper must be absolutely surrendered before maturity to the person from whom he receives the new paper.\u201d <em>These are almost verbatim the words of </em>one of the learned justices who wrote opinion in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-10\">4.

J., Martin Grover, Lewis B. Woodruff, Thomas W. Clerke, Theodore Miller, William J. Bacon, Henry Wells, and Charles Mason, Judges), the action was brought on a n\u00f3te made by defendant Coman, dated June 4, 1859, for three thousand dollars, payable six months after date, to the order of Mr. Agnew, and by him indorsed to the plaintiff. The defense was that Agnew by false representations induced Coman to buy certain stocks, in payment whereof he gave the note in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The case was tried before a referee, who found that the note was procured by fraud, and that Agnew indorsed the note to plaintiff before maturity; that Agnew being indebted to the plaintiff in a large sum of money, for which the plaintiff held Agnew\u2019s overdue notes, the plaintiff gave up to Agnew such overdue notes, and received therefor the note in suit and new notes made by Agnew for the balance, and that the plaintiff took the note in suit without notice of any defense; he also found that the said notes so due from Agnew to the plaintiff were surrendered by the plaintiff to Agnew, and this note of defendants, with Agnew\u2019s indorsement, was delivered by Agnew to plaintiff on account of so much and as part of said indebtedness, and the note or notes of Agnew given for the balance; that no agreement was made at the time that the note in suit should be a payment of so much or any part of said indebtedness, nor was anything said on the subject, the transaction being simply a surrender of the old notes and the indorsement over of this and the giving of the other notes. On these facts the referee held that the plaintiff was not a <em>dona fide </em>holder for value, and gave judgment for defendants, which was affirmed by the general term. The court of appeals reversed the judgment, holding that the plaintiff was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>bona fide </em>holder for value. The learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court, placed the decision on two' grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">1. That the giving up toAgnew of his note and taking the note in suit for it was evidence of the intention of the parties to cancel the note; and whether it operated to discharge the pre-existing debt or not was immaterial, as it certainly operated to cancel the negotiable paper of the plaintiff, which was parting with value sufficient to constitute the plaintiff a <em>bona fide </em>holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\"><em>2. </em>That if a creditor, having a debt due him, receives from his debtor on account thereof the time note of a third person, payable to and indorsed by the debtor, without any express agreement that such note should be taken either in payment and satisfaction or as collateral, he parts with value, because he relinquishes his right to enforce the payment of his debt presently, and suspends his power to collect it until the note so received should mature.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The point involved in the first ground is that the . cancellation of prior overdue negotiable paper of the debtor, extinguishing a right of action thereon, is a parting with value.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u2022That involved in the second is that a <em>suspension </em>of the right of action on the original indebtedness, caused by the receipt of a time note of a third party, indorsed by its debtor, is also a parting with value.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Each of these points was fatal to the defense, and the decision (under the doctrine of James <em>v. </em>Patten, 6 <em>N. Y. 9) </em>must be taken as an authoritative adjudication on both. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">It will be observed that the learned judge, in course of his reasoning on the second ground, uses this phrase, \u201cAnd the plaintiff, at the time of surrendering the old note, having the right to enforce its payment presently;\u201d but, by this incidental allusion, he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>make, or intend to make, such surrender an element in Ms decision of the second ground, for it is obvious that the right of action was as fully suspended without the surrender as with it j moreover, the learned judge had previously held the surrender to work an extinguishment, and in this part of the argument, relative to the suspension and its effects, he cites with approval the case of Burns v. Rowland, 40 <em>Barb. </em>368, cited from p. 374, where no element of surrender existed, and yet the suspension was held to be a parting with value.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The facts of this case bring it within the second point adjudicated by the court of appeals. The plaintiffs were consequently <em>bona fide </em>holders for value, and thus the defense is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The questions which were allowed under defendant\u2019s exceptions were properly allowed. If they are to be regarded as calling for the operation of the mind, still, as to some extent the question is as to the intent in parting with the goods, they can be sustained by the principle of the case of Seymour <em>v. </em>Wilson, 14 N. <em>Y. </em>567.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">But I think they rather call for a fact, and are admissible under the doctrine of Sweet <em>v. </em>Tuttle, 4 <em>Kern. </em>465, which case held that the question, \u201cOn the part and behalf and for whom were the services performed <em>f </em>\u2019 was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">As to their leading character, it is in the discretion of the trial judge either to allow or exclude leading questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">In this aspect of the case, the matters suggested in the statement, as not having been passed on by the referee, are immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
