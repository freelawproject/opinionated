That from the time of their said marriage and during the whole of their said married life the plaintiff has been obliged by her own labor to support her children, herself, and in great measure the defendant in this action. That the plaintiff has since and during her removal to the city of Yew York, organized and carried on a business in said city, at 93 Houston-street. That all the money and most of the labor necessary for commencing and conducting said business have been furnished by plaintiff and the son of plaintiff and defendant. That said money was the individual earnings of the plaintiff. That defendant has at certain times when entrusted with the management of certain portions of said business, and the collection of certain claims due to the plaintiff in her business as aforesaid, squandered and appropriated to himself the moneys collected thereupon, and has on various occasions returned to the plaintiff but a- small part of the moneys collected by him on her account as aforesaid.

That when defendant has been at times entrusted with any of said business he has neglected and refused to attend to the same on various occasions to the considerable loss of the plaintiff, and that defendant to the neglect of said business has spent his time in the disgraceful manner hereinbefore specified, with other persons and at various places. That in the year 1862, the plaintiff out of her own money, earning and labor, advanced sufficient capital to organize .and carry on a business at the city of Washington, D. C., and that plaintiff by her own work, labor and money, paid for all goods necessary thereto, that defendant was entrusted with charge of said business. That, as plaintiff believes, said business was successful, but that defendant squandered the proceeds thereof and appropriated them to his own use, returning little or nothing to the plaintiff from said proceeds, and that plaintiff was obliged to pay by her own money and labor all the bills due and owing at the city of Hew York, on account of said business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">\u201c That on October 5,1870, the defendant abandoned the house of the said plaintiff, and has not since that time returned. That on the day aforesaid the defendant brought with him and introduced into the house three suspicious, all ill-looking persons, with the intention of alarming the plaintiff, and plaintiff was obliged to call others into the said house for her protection, and that thereupon defendant took from said house all his personal property, and has not since returned to or resided with this plaintiff. That since the defendant has abandoned the house as aforesaid he has refused and neglected to provide in any'way for plaintiff\u2019s support or maintainanc\u00e9, and that she is entirely dependent moon her own labors for her support.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cThat as plaintiff is informed and believes the defendant is possessed of an income of about forty-three hundred dollars per year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">\u201cWhereupon the plaintiff prays that a separation from bed and board forever, may be decreed between the said plaintiff and defendant,' and that the defendant may be compelled by the judgment of this court to make a proper and suitable provision for the support and maintenance of the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff may have such other or further relief as to the court may seem just and right, with costs of this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">The special term order struck out of the complaint all that part which is printed in italics; and directed that so much of that portion of the complaint which is contained between the words <em>\u201cFirst. </em>That,\u201d and the words \u201csaid diseases,\u201d as remained after striking out the words in italics should be made more definite and certain by making it read as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-7\">\u201cThat the defendant (insert date), by reason of sexual intercourse with other person than the plaintiff, contracted a disease he communicated to the plaintiff, stating in like manner any other time or time at which the defendant contracted and communicated said disease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-8\">And further directed that the clause numbered IV. be made more definite and certain by stating at what time or times, and what place or places the defendant lorced the plaintiff to comply with his desires to a cruel and unreasonable extent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-9\">The plaintiff appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b63-10\"><em>N. Gano </em>Dunn, attorney and of counsel for appellant, made the following points:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai8\">I. That portion at special term which requires the plaintiff to state at what time or times the defendant contracted the diseases mentioned is unreasonable. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>is from the nature of the case impossible that the plaintiff should have information as to such dates. The revised statutes required only that the plaintiff should set forth times and places with resonable certainty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-5\">II. An allegation, setting forth improper conduct of the defendant with the female servants of the family, and with other females, is proper in a complaint for limited divorce. Such conduct is an outrage on the feelings of the wife, and comes within the definition of cruelty. It is furthermore such conduct as renders it improper for the wife to live with the husband. Cruel and inhuman treatment need not consist of injury to the person of the plaintiff (Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, <em>2 </em>Phill. 207; Popkin <em>v. </em>Popkin, 1 <em>Hagg. Ecc. </em>768 ; Durant <em>v. </em>Durant, <em>Id. </em>733; Bihin <em>v. </em>Bihin, 17 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>19; <em>Bishop on Marr. &amp; Div. </em>725, 726, 732).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-6\">III. The allegation of such conduct on the part of the defendant in this action, as set forth in the <em>comp</em>laint, is sufficiently definite as to times, places and circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b64-7\">IY. S&lt;5 much of the said order as requires the plaintiff to state at what time or times the defendant contracted the diseases mentioned in the complaint, and so much of said order as strikes out the third allegation of the complaint, should be reversed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-8\"><em>F. Sherman </em>Smith, attorney for respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-9\"><em>James M. Smith, </em>of counsel.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b64-10\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aep\">This is an action for a separation from bed and board. By the common law a court- of equity had no jurisdiction to decree a separation or limited divorce (Perry <em>v. </em>Perry, 2 <em>Paige, </em>501). The j urisdiction is created, and the cases in which an action for a separation or limited divorce may be brought, are defined by statute (2 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>146 ; 3 <em>Rev. Stat. </em>5 ed. 237). To constitute cruel and inhuman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>treatment by the husband of the wife, or such- conduct on his part towards her, as may render it unsafe and improper for her to cohabit with him, within the meaning of these terms as used in the first two subdivisions of section 51 of the statute, bodily injury or acts of personal violence are not necessary (Bihin <em>v. </em>Bihin, 17 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>19); but the treatment or conduct must at least be such as to create a reasonable apprehension of bodily hurt, and the causes for such apprehension must be of sufficient importance (Whispell v. Whispell, 4 <em>Barb. </em>217; 2 <em>Kent Com. </em>126).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The statute also prescribes that the complaint in every such case shall specify particularly the nature and circumstances of the case on which plaintiff relies, and shall set forth times and places with reasonable certainty. These specific allegations present the matter upon which issue is to be joined. To be issuable, however, every circumstance thus alleged must be material in establishing some ground recognized by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The allegations, which were struck out of the complaint in this action, charged the defendant with great particularity with a series of scandalous, indecent and licentious acts committed with and upon certain females other than the plaintiff. As the action is not for a divorce on the ground of adultery, but for a separation merely, these allegations are immaterial, unless they tend to aid at least in establishing some specific ground mentioned in the first two subdivisions of the section of the statute referred to. Standing entirely by themselves, they have no such tendency, and there is no averment of any fact or circumstance in connection with which they might have become important. It is not charged that the conduct complained \u00f3f led plaintiff to apprehend personal injury to herself; she does not complain that it gave her pain. Mo effect upon either the body or mind of the plaintiff, her health or feelings is alleged. . The only injury stated is the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>grace which such conduct brought upon the. plaintiff and her family. No decree for separation can be based upon that. Frequent intoxication may bring disgrace, but cannot be made to work a separation. Nor do occasional outbursts of passion, from whatever cause, so long as they do not threaten bodily harm, present a ground for a limited divorce (Mason <em>v. </em>Mason, 1 <em>Edw. </em>278). The allegations referred to were, therefore, properly stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">That portion of the order, however, which requires the plaintiff to make the complaint more definite and certain by stating at what time or times, and at what place or places the defendant contracted the diseases in the complaint mentioned, is too broad, and must be modified so as to require the plaintiff to set forth the time or times and at what place or places the defendant communicated the said diseases to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">As thus modified, the order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Jones, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
