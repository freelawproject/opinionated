Bowers, 4 <em>Bom. </em>668; People \u00ae. Dodge, 5 <em>How. Pr. </em>47; Lewis \u00ae. Jones, 13 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>427; Stewart \u00ae.

C. Egan, </em>of counsel for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnL\">I. The order made on December 19, 1871, was Justice Speeder\u2019s decision of the motion submitted on August 34, 1871, (Bently <em>v. </em>Jones, 4 <em>How. Pr. </em>435; King <em>v. </em>Stafford, 5 <em>Id. </em>30 ; Howard v. Freedman, 6 <em>Robt. </em>511), and could not then be legally made, especially after defendant\u2019s protest <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 401, subd. 8.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-11\">II. The act required to be done is not permissive, but is prescribed as a duty, and must be obeyed <em>(Sedgwick on Interpretation of Statutes, </em>366, 377, 380, citing <em>Vattel; </em>Rules 1, 6, 7, also quoting at p. 384; <em>Domat's </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>Rules, \u00a7 </em>7). The words are clear, plain, unambiguous and imperative, showing the intent of the legislature (which is' to govern); and require (in such case) no construction <em>(Sedgwick on </em>Interpretation, 266, 277, 287, setting forth <em>Vattel\u2019s Rules, </em>\u00a7 16, and rules following ; also <em>Domat's Loix Civile </em>[at page of <em>Sedgw. </em>283-4] \u00a7\u00a7 4, 12, 13; see also <em>Sedgw. </em>p. 378, 379 and note 490 and 491; Mewell <em>v. </em>People, 3 <em>Seld. </em>97; McClusky <em>v. </em>Cromwell, 1 <em>Kern. </em>593). The aim and object here being one of general public necessity, the more effectual protection of the liberty of every citizen, and of the rights and use of property, the statute calls for, and must receive a rigid, strict construction <em>(Lieber\u2019s Recapitulation of Rules </em>[in <em>Sedgwick on Interpretation, </em>p. 287], rules 3 and 4; Mayor <em>v. </em>Furze, 6 <em>Hill, </em>612, per Nelson, J).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-5\">III. Contemporaneous mandatory statutes come in aid of a strict construction of the statutes in question (1 <em>Sess. Laws of </em>1870, ch. 151, p. 421; <em>New Supreme Court Rule, </em>94).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">IV. Time is of the very essence of this statute, and'' therefore material. It is aimed at abuses of time by the courts in their decision of such motions. In such case discretion cannot be exercised <em>(Sedgw. on Int. </em>418-19-20, and cases cited ; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 331, 332, 352, 353, as to time within which appeals may be taken; <em>Code, </em>\u00a7 273, as to time within which referee must report [60 days] ; Litch <em>v. </em>Brotherson, 16 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>384, per Bockes, J., special term ; Potter, J., general term).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-8\">V. The command here is upon the judiciary, to do a certain act within a specified time. To disobey it by construing the act to be merely directory, would not only be judicial legislation (not allowed by our system of government), but would present the unseemly, spectacle of the court setting up its individual\u2019 opinion against thecombined wisdom of the legislature, expressed in clear and unmistakable language, enjoining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>a duty upon said court. If a referee, sitting as a court to hear, try, and determine a cause, must by law report within sixty days <em>(Code, \u00a7 </em>273; 15 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>384), by parity uf reasoning a judge holding a court must (when required as in this case) decide within twenty days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-5\">VI. The order denying defendant\u2019s motion to vacate order continuing injunction, should be reversed ; and the order continuing injunction and appointing a receiver should be set aside, with costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-6\"><em>Corliss &amp; Erbe, </em>for respondent.\u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AG3\">The provision contained in subdivision 8, section 401, of the Code, as to the time within which a decision on a motion shall be rendered and made known, is merely <em>directory </em>(Burger <em>v. </em>Baker, 4 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>11; People <em>v. </em>Dodge, 5 <em>How. Pr. </em>47; Stewart <em>v. </em>Slater, 6 <em>Duer, </em>83, 102; O\u2019Brien <em>v. </em>Bowes, 4 <em>Bosw. </em>663; Lewis <em>v. </em>Jones, 13 <em>Abb. Pr. 427).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-7\">II. If the said provision be <em>imperative </em>and not merely directory, then the judge, after the lapse of twenty days from August 24, 1871, could, upon the principle contended for by the appellant, make no order, either <em>continuing </em>or <em>discontinuing </em>the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-8\">III. Without a <em>positive </em>order, <em>discontinuing </em>and dissolving the injunction, the - same <em>continues </em>to stand in <em>full force, </em>upon its original basis, until the final determination of the action (Kelly <em>v. </em>Jeroloman, 7 <em>Robt. </em>158).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-9\">IV. If the judge lost jurisdiction of the question, after the lapse of twenty days, the appellant cannot object to his action ; for such objection cannot result in any practical benefit to him. The injunction will still remain in force.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b487-10\">By the Court.\u2014McCunn, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avah\">This is an appeal from an order made at special term, refusing to set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>another order of said special term, because the learned justice who heard the first motion at special term to dissolve the injunction, neglected to file or make known his decision within the twenty days prescribed by section 401 of the Code. The last order made at special term, and from which this is an appeal, should be affirmed for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><em>First. </em>Subdivision 8 of section 401 of the Code is directory. Such was the construction put upon a similar provision in section 267, by Mr. Justice Woodbtjff in this court in the case of O\u2019Brien <em>n. </em>Bower, 4 <em>Bosw. </em>663, and such has been the uniform current of decisions in all the courts (People v. Dodge, <em>5 How. Pr. </em>47; Lewis <em>v. </em>Jones, 13 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>427; Stewart <em>v. </em>Slater, 6 <em>Duer, </em>83, 102).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">While I am holding, however, this construction of section 401 of the Code to be the correct one, yet I hold that the party aggrieved by the undue delay of a judge can have ample and complete remedy by mandamus against that judge to compel him to file or make known his decision and the proceedings thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In nearly all cases heard before a single judge the mind of the court is made up as to what its adjudication may be, but sometimes from press of business and other good and sufficient causes, a judge delays putting his views on paper and filing the same until after, but this neglect of the judge should not prejudice the suit- or in whose favor he may have decided, especially, as I have said before, the party deeming himself aggrieved has a complete remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
