The referee erred in denying the motion of defendant\u2019s counsel for a dismissal of the complaint after plaintiff had rested his case. 1. The draft \u201cExhibit No. 1,\u201d is not a biff of exchange\u2014not being payable absolutely and at all events. It was not to become payable until the money should be due on fifth installment of contract, \u201cExhibit No. 2.\u201d The plaintiff rested without proving performance of the work under the contract which would entitle Hoffman to said fifth payment. The work not being performed the order never became due (Van Wagner &amp; Jewett, 27 <em>Barb. </em>181; Galley <em>v. </em>Prindle, 14 <em>Id. </em>186; Franklin <em>v. </em>Robin, 1 <em>Johns. Ch. </em>157). 2. Assuming the testimony of the witnesses for the respondent to be true, that \u201cMr. Knubel promised to settle with Mr. Crane,\u201d and that such promise was subsequent to the abandonment, it could not, in law, be deemed a <em>waiver </em>of performance by Hoffman. The contract could not be altered or performance of it waived by <em>parol, </em>and certainly not between the appellant and the respondent (the latter not being a party to the contract), unless the <em>parol </em>contract be upon sufficient consideration, and be executed <em>(N. Y. Com. Pl. </em>1853; Tinker <em>v. </em>Gerraghty, 1 <em>E. D. </em>Smith, 687).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-8\">II. The seven, eighth, and tenth findings of fact by the referee are unsupported by the law or the evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>1. The evidence does not show that Hoffman at \u201cthe time of his abandonment of the contract had completed the work necessary thereunder to entitle him to the fifth payment, except in some slight particulars,\u201d or that he substantially completed said work, or was substantially entitled to said payment. Such payment was not to become due until the \u201ctrimmings were <em>all </em>on and doors <em>all </em>hung.\u201d There is no conflict of evidence as to the fact that when Hoffman abandoned the contract there were <em>no </em>doors hung on the basement, first or second floor of either house. There, is no conflict of evidence as to the fact that the stairs were untrimmed, or as to the fact that there were no blinds furnished or hung by Hoffman\u2014this being part of the trimmings. A party may retain, without compensation, the benefits of a partial performance, when the contractor, without the consent or agreement of the 1 other, of his own mere volition abandons the further performance of it. The acceptance by the defendant of the order \u201cExhibit Ho. 1,\u201d placed him in no different attitude with the plaintiff than he stood towards the contractor. And the same rule which would dis-entitle the contractor to the payment, obtained in absolving defendant from liability to the plaintiff <em>(Ct. of App. </em>1858; Smith v. Brady, 17 <em>N. Y. </em>173; Pike <em>v. </em>Butler, 4 <em>Id. </em>360; <em>12 Johns. </em>274, 166; 2 <em>Mass. </em>147; Jennings <em>v. </em>Camp, 13 <em>Johns. </em>94; Lantry <em>v. </em>Parks, 8 <em>Cow. </em>63; 4 <em>Wend. </em>285; 11 <em>Id. </em>484; 4 <em>Cow. </em>564; 10 <em>Johns. </em>36; 5 <em>Denio, </em>406; 4 <em>Coms. </em>411; 1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>395; 2 <em>Id. </em>195; 9 <em>N. Y. </em>93; 26 <em>Id. </em>427; 36 <em>Id. </em>223; 27 <em>Id. </em>379; 38 <em>Id. </em>189). It is the usual practice of owners of land contracting for the erection of building thereon, to reserve the largest payments until the last, when they pay in installments, as an indemnity against loss by the abandonment or non-fulfillment of the contract by the builder, and the soundness of the theory of the cases above cited, which give to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>owner the benefit of a partial performance in case of a desertion of the contract by the builder, is apparent. The owner is compelled in such a case for his own protection to take charge of the completion of the work at a sacrifice of his time, and in most cases is pecuniarily damaged by delay. These last payments are supposed usually to embrace the builder\u2019s profits, and on no principle of equity is he entitled to such profit on a contract which he has by his own act abandoned before completion. 3. The evidence does not support the tenth finding, to wit: \u201cThat after the-abandonment of the contract, the defendant waived strict performance by Hoffman, and promised to pay the amount of \u2018Exhibit Ho. 1.\u2019 \u201d The contract was under seal, and performance could not be <em>waived </em>or altered by <em>parol </em>without a consideration, &amp;c. <em>(N. Y. Com. Pl. </em>1853; Tinker <em>v. </em>Gerraghty, 1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>687). 4. When there is no conflict of evidence, the conclusion to be drawn from these facts is a question of law, and the court will inquire into the facts notwithstanding the finding of the referee (Fellows <em>v. </em>Northrop, 39 <em>N. Y. </em>117; Pratt <em>v. </em>Foote, 9 <em>Id. </em>465; Farmers\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Vail, 21 <em>Id. </em>486; Valentine <em>v. </em>Connor, 40 <em>Id. </em>253; Putnam <em>v. </em>Hubbell, 42 <em>Id. </em>113).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-5\"><em>David McAdam, </em>attorney, and of counsel for respondent, argued :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AayM\">I. If the contract between Hoffman, the <em>drawer, </em>and the defendant, the <em>drawee </em>and <em>acceptor, </em>was so far performed as to entitle the contractor to the <em>fifth </em>payment, there can be no doubt of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, because such order, and its acceptance, operated as an assignment by Hoffman to the plaintiff of the fund in the defendant\u2019s hands (Lowrey <em>v. </em>Stewart, 25 <em>N. Y. </em>239, affirming the superior court, general term, 3 <em>Bosw. </em>505; Parker <em>v. </em>City of Syracuse, 31 <em>N. Y. </em>376 ; Wells <em>v. </em>Williams, 39 <em>Barb. </em>567; Morton <em>v. </em>Taylor, 1 <em>Hill, </em>583). The drawing of a bank check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>is not of itself an assignment of the fund, but when accepted it is (Butterworth v. Peck, 5 <em>Bosw. </em>341; Chapman <em>v. </em>White, 6 <em>N. Y. </em>412).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-5\">II. Was the fifth payment earned ? This depended upon the fact whether the particular work required to be done by the contract, to entitle the contractor to the fifth payment, was done or not, or whether its performance was <em>waived, </em>and the work as done' accepted as such performance. \u2022 The fifth payment became due, according to the contract, <em>\u201cwhen the trimmings all done, doors all hung, </em>one thousand dollars.\u201d In the performance of a contract, <em>substantial </em>performance is all that is required (2 <em>Pars. on Cont. </em>172, and see notes to p. 35, 4 ed.; <em>Add. on Cont. </em>4 ed., p. 453; Smith <em>v. </em>Gugerty, 4 <em>Barb. </em>621; Sinclair <em>v. </em>Tallmadge, 35 <em>Barb. </em>602; Thomas <em>v. </em>Fleury, 26 <em>N. Y. </em>32; and see also 28 <em>N. Y. </em>444. There was a clear <em>substantial </em>performance under these decisions. <em>(a.) </em>The trimmings were all done, except fitting up some closets after the plumbers, and this work is usually done last; and this evidence stands uncontradicted, <em>(b.) </em>The doors were all hung, when Hoffman left the buildings, on the two upper stories, and the balance of the .doors were all in the building at the time, or were taken to the building from Hoffman\u2019s shop, by the defendant, after Hoffman left, (c.) The doors left unhung could be hung for from twenty-five dollars to forty dollars, <em>(e.) </em>It must be remembered, in addition to this, that the fifth was not the last payment under the contract, nor was it the last work required to be done, to render complete performance. The finishing up of the contract, and for which <em>a,further </em>payment of fifteen hundred dollars was to be made, necessarily involved a general finishing up of details, and of matters generally, in all parts of the house, many of which of necessity have to be done with the finishing of the building. Under such circumstances, the law will not be so technical in regard to perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>anee as it would on final, completion, which is supposed to embrace full performance of everything.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-5\">III. Upon the evidence offered, the question of performance became one of fact, and the finding of the referee upon it, in favor of the plaintiff, is <em>conclusive </em>to the same extent as the verdict of a jury (Sinclair <em>v</em>. Tallmadge, 35 <em>Barb. </em>602; Murphy <em>v. </em>Boker, 3 <em>Robt. </em>1; Williams <em>v. </em>Vanderbilt, 29 <em>Barb. </em>491, 504; <em>Id. </em>218 ; 33 <em>Barb. </em>347; 2 <em>Hilt. </em>528 ; 24 <em>How. </em>58).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-7\">IV. <em>There was a clear waiver, by the defendant of strict performance of the contract. </em>The defendant, when called upon by Crane for payment, <em>after </em>Hoffman had left the work, instead of repudiating the order on. the ground of non-performance of the work, so that Crane, the plaintiff, might complete it himself, and he certainly could and would have done it if required, the defendant made an unconditional promise to two witnesses to call down to Crane\u2019s, the plaintiff, and pay the order, <em>(a.) </em>Defendant went to Hoffman\u2019s shop,. <em>after </em>Hoffman had left the work, and, <em>under his contract, </em>took away all the doors for his building that had not been furnished to it by Hoffman. This is uncontradicted. <em>(b.) </em>As the fifth payment was not the last payment under the contract, nor was the work to be done to earn it the last work required to render complete performance, waiver of strict performance of the contract will more readily be inferred, <em>(e.) </em>Considering also the relations of the parties, and the fact that the contract was one not requiring the <em>personal </em>services of Hoffman, and that if Hoffman had left his contract <em>partially </em>unperformed, Crane would have the right to step in and complete it himself, in order to protect his rights as assignee under the order; any act or word, dispensing with or <em>waiving </em>the exercise of this right on the part of Crane, is, in law, a waiver of further performance. <em>(ft.') </em>It must also be remembered that the fifth payment amounted to one thousand dollars, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>order but eight hundred and twenty-one dollars, and two <em>experts </em>were sworn, and testified that all the work required to be done under the contract, to entitle the contractor to the fifth payment, was done, except the mere hanging of the doors, which could be done for twenty-five dollars, and not to exceed forty dollars. <em>(e.) </em>It must also be remembered that there was a further payment of fifteen hundred dollars (over and above the fifth payment) upon the completion of the building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-5\">V. The provisions Of a written contract may be waived by the person for whose benefit the provision was inserted, and it is not necessary that the waiver should be in writing (Smith <em>v. </em>Gugerty, 4 <em>Barb. </em>633; Fleming <em>t. </em>Gilbert, 3 <em>Johns. </em>538; Mayor <em>v. </em>Butler, 1 <em>Barb. </em>338 ; Friess <em>v. </em>Rider, 34 <em>N. Y. </em>368, and authorities cited; Keating v. Price, 1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>33; Clark v. Dales, 30 <em>Barb. </em>43; Meehan <em>v. </em>Williams, 36 <em>How. </em>73 ; Pirrepont <em>v. </em>Barnard, 6 <em>N. Y. </em>379; Flynn <em>v. </em>McKeon, 6 Duer, 303). <em>(a.) Examples of waiter. </em>1st, as to bills. It was held in reference to the protest of bills, that any act calculated to put the holder off his guard, and preventing him from treating the note as he otherwise would, is in judgment of law a <em>waiter </em>(Sheldon <em>v. </em>Horton, 53 <em>Barb. </em>33, and to the same effect, 43 <em>N. Y. </em>93). Speaking of demand and notice, the court say: 6 6 So an indorser may waive these proceedings, and consent to be bound, although these are not taken. This is upon the obvious priuciple, that a party to a contract may renounce the benefit of any stipulation in it, designed for his own protection; such waiver \u2022may be by express word, or it may arise by implication from the acts or consent of the indorser. It may precede the maturity of the note, <em>or may arise upon a promise to pay the </em>note, <em>with knowledge of the laches </em>afterward, <em>and the waiter required no new considera</em>tion\u201d (Sheldon <em>v. </em>Horton, 43 <em>N. Y. </em>93). And a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>promise </em>to pay after an irregular or informal notice, is in law a waiver (see 5 <em>Johns. </em>248, 375 ; 16 <em>Id. </em>152 ; 10 <em>Wend. </em>504; <em>Leading Cases on Bills of </em>Exchange, 473, and notes thereto; and see 12 <em>How. </em>166). (5.) Generally waiver is more commonly an <em>implication of </em>law, from acts or circumstances, and partakes of the nature of equitable <em>estoppel. </em>A party waves his rights, if in conversation he so intends, and so expresses himself as to be thus understood by the other party, in the exercise of common understanding, and is understood as waiving them <em>(Hill, on Cont. </em>vol. 2, p, 171); and an admission by a defendant calculated to influence the conduct of the man with whom he is dealing, and actually leading him into a line of conduct which must be prejudicial to his interest, unless the defendant be cut off from the power of retraction, constitutes an estoppel in pais (3 <em>Hill. </em>215 ; <em>Hill, and Denio Supp. </em>430), and in the absence of proof of the effect of the admission, on the party setting up the estoppel, it is for the jury to say, whether, on the facts, the several essential parts of the estoppel are proved (Brown <em>v. </em>Bowen, 30 <em>N. Y. </em>541); and waiver need , not be established by positive proof, it may be inferred from circumstances (Meehan <em>v. </em>Williams, 36 <em>How. </em>73). The statute requirement, that there shall be two sureties in a bond, is for the benefit of the creditor; and he may dispense with more than one without invalidating the bond (Ward <em>v. </em>Whitney, 3 <em>Sandf. </em>399). In an action for the price of hot air furnaces, it appeared that plaintiff agreed to put in a cold air register face, which he failed to do ; defendant used the furnaces without the register face three months, without complaint, held a waiver of defendant\u2019s right to insist on the work being done, as a condition precedent (Bristol <em>v. </em>Tracy, 21 <em>Barb. </em>236). Where goods are sold for which a note is to be given at six months, if the goods be delivered, and the note not demanded until two months after the sale, the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>dition will be deemed to be waived (Hennequin v. Sand, <em>25 Wend. </em>640; 6 <em>Id. </em>77; <em>2 Hill. </em>165; as to waiver, see also, 10 <em>Pick. </em>349 ; 6 <em>Id. </em>262; 19 <em>Maine, </em>303, 154). Ho consideration is ne\u00f3essary to give validity to a waiver (Sheldon <em>v. </em>Horton, 43 <em>N. Y. </em>93; 14 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>241). Parties have a perfect right, <em>orally </em>or by acts, to alter or to <em>waive </em>any of the terms of an original written agreement (Van Buskirk <em>v. </em>Stow, 42 <em>Barb. </em>10); and where parties <em>waive, </em>or prevent performance of a condition precedent, the parties waiving or preventing cannot avail themselves of such non-performance to relieve themselves from their own obligation (Moses <em>v. </em>Bierling, 31 <em>N. Y. </em>462). The doctrine of <em>waiver </em>has also been fully recognized in .insurance cases, as to preliminary proofs; <em>thus, </em>the insurer may <em>waive </em>in whole or in part, the preliminary proofs (43 <em>Barb. </em>351; 9 <em>How. </em>390), and their <em>waiver </em>in effect strikes the condition out of the contract. The waiver need not be express; it may be inferred from the acts of the insurers, which evidence a recognition of liability, or from their denial of obligation exclusively for other reasons (57 <em>Barb. </em>518; 5 <em>Wr. </em>161). If the refusal to pay the loss is put upon grounds other than the insufficiency of the notice or proofs furnished, the insurers will be held to have <em>waived </em>objections of that character (9 <em>How. </em>390; 16 <em>Wend. </em>385; 3 <em>Comst. </em>122; 6 <em>Cush. </em>342, 440 ; 25 <em>Ill. </em>466), and so the condition that the loss is payable in sixty days, may be <em>waived </em>(34 <em>Conn. </em>461; 14 <em>Mo. </em>220; and see the insurance cases above cited, collected and.asserted,' in <em>Fland. on Ins. </em>541). (e.) The question of <em>waiver </em>on the evidence, was one of fact, and the finding of the referee thereon is conclusive in plaintiff\u2019s favor.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-5\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXt\">It was conceded by both parties on the argunient that, if the contract between Hoffman, the drawer, and the defendant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>drawee and acceptor, has been so far performed as to entitle- Hoffman as contractor to the fifth payment, plaintiff, as payee named in the order, has an undoubted right to recover,- because such order and its acceptance operated as an assignment by Hoffman to the plaintiff of the fund in defendant\u2019s hands. The main question, therefore, is whether the said fifth payment has been earned by the contractor according to the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The principle of the common law, which always permitted men to manage their own affairs and to make their own contracts, provided they involved nothing immoral or illegal, which is fully applicable here, also requires that the understanding of the parties is to be gathered from the terms of the contract, and that their rights are to be determined by the language of the contract. Though the terms are hard, parties will be held concluded by their contract (Sherman <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c. of New York, 1 <em>N. Y. </em>316; Pike <em>v. </em>Butler, 4 <em>Id. </em>363). <em>A </em>condition precedent must be strictly performed, and if a person, by contract, engages to perform an act, performance is not excused by inevitable accident (Oakley <em>v. </em>Morton, 11 <em>N. Y. </em>25; Norton <em>v. </em>Woodruff, 2 <em>Id. </em>153). So, when the time for the payment of money is to happen after the performance of that which is the consideration, no right of action accrues for the money until' the consideration is performed, for a party not fulfilling his part of the contract cannot insist that it shall be performed by the other party (Grant <em>v. </em>Johnson, 5 <em>N. Y. </em>347 ; Pike <em>v. </em>Butler, 4 <em>Id. </em>363). In such case full performance is a condition precedent to the right of payment upon the contract. Substantial performance is not enough when the person, for whom the work was done, has neither voluntarily accepted it, nor waived a faithful performance of the contract (Pullman v. Corning, 9 <em>N. Y. </em>93).. This doctrine was reaffirmed in Smith <em>v. </em>Brady, 17 <em>N. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>Y. </em>187, where it was held by Comstock, J., with the concurrence of all the judges, that the rule is well settled with us, that a party may retain without compensation the benefits of a partial performance, where from the nature of the contract he must receive such benefits in advance of a full performance, and by its terms or just construction he is under no obligation to pay until the performance is complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The last named case has been followed as an unquestionable authoritative exposition of the law of this State upon the doctrine referred to, in Cunningham <em>v. </em>Jones, 20 <em>N. Y. </em>486; Bonesteel <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c., 22 <em>Id. </em>162 ; Catlin <em>v. </em>Tobias, 26 <em>Id. </em>217 ; Walker <em>v. </em>Millard, 29 <em>Id. </em>375; Husted <em>v. </em>Craig, 36 <em>Id. </em>223 ; Harris <em>v. </em>Rathbun, 2 <em>Keyes, </em>319 ; Jenkins <em>v. </em>Wheeler, 3 <em>Id. </em>654.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In view of this repeated, indorsement it will not be deemed out of place to notice more fully the remarks of Comstock, J., in Smith <em>v. </em>Brady <em>(supra), </em>as to the rights of the parties to a building contract. He says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">\u201cThe owner of the soil is always in possession. The builder has a right to enter only for the special purpose of performing his contract. Each material as it is placed in the work becomes annexed to the soil, and thereby the property of the owner. The builder would have no right to remove the brick or stone or lumber after annexation, even if the employer should unjustifiably refuse to allow him to proceed with the work. . The owner, from the nature and necessity of the case, takes the benefit of part performance, and therefore, by merely so doing, does not necessarily waive anything contained in the contract. To impute to him a voluntary waiver of conditions precedent from the mere use and occupation of the building erected, unattended by other circumstances, is unreasonable and illogical, because he is notin a situation to elect whether he will or will not accept the benefit of an imperfect performance. To. be enabled to stand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>upon t,he contract, he cannot reasonably be required to tear down and destroy the edifice if he prefers it to renmin. As the erection is his by annexation to the soil, he may suffer it to stand, and there is no rule of law against his using it without prejudice to his rights. ..... The law does not adjudge that a mere silent occupation of the building by the owner amounts to a waiver, nor does it deny to him the right so to occupy and still insist upon the contract. The question of waiver of the condition precedent will always be one of intention to be arrived at from all the circumstances, including the occupancy. To conclude, there is, in a just view of the question, no hardship in requiring builders, like all other men, to perform their contracts in order to entitle themselves to payment, where the employer has agreed to pay only on that condition. It is true that such contracts embrace a variety of particulars, and that slight omissions and inadvertences may sometimes very innocently occur. These should be indulgently regarded, and they will be so regarded by courts and juries. But there can be no injustice in imputing to the contractor, a knowledge of what his contract requires, nor in holding him to a substantial performance. ... If he fails to perform when the requirement is plain, and when he can perform, if he will, he has no right to call upon the courts to make a new contract for him ; nor ought he to complain if the law leaves him without remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">According to the well settled law of this State, therefore, the fifth payment did not become due and payable under the contract in the case at bar, until the trimmings had been all done and the doors all hung in the manner required by the specifications, which form part of the contract. The doing of <em>all </em>the trimmings and hanging of <em>all </em>the doors were made by the voluntary act of the contracting parties a condition precedent to the payment of the money. The consideration for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the payment is entire and indivisible, so that the money payable as such fifth installment is neither apportioned by the contract, nor capable of being apportioned by a court or jury. Plaintiff rested without proving performance of the work which would have entitled Hoffman to such fifth payment. <em>t </em>Consequently plaintiff\u2019s order was not shown to have become due, and the referee erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a dismissal of the complaint, unless the evidence clearly showed that the defendant had accepted the work actually done as a full performance, or had waived a strict performance of the contract, a question, which -1 shall notice more fully hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Again: it appears without contradiction from the evidence of the entire case, that Hoffman, the contractor, in the early part of April, 1868, ceased work, before the fifth payment became due; that on the tenth of that month the defendant by written notice insisted upon performance of the balance of the work then unfinished; that Hoffman did not return to finsh the work, and that defendant was compelled to finish it himself; that at the time of Hoffman\u2019s abandonment of the contract, there were no doors hung on the basement and first or parlor floors- of either house, and that a considerable part of the trimmings remained undone. It is, therefore, not a case of imperfect performance or of a defect in the manner of performance, but a clear case of non-performance of the contract, and consequently the referee erred in finding, as matter of fact, a substantial performance, which entitled Hoffman to the payment of the fifth installment, and, as matter of law, that plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the defendant, and the judgment must be reversed, unless the further finding, that after the abandonment of the contract, the plaintiff caused the order to be presented to the defendant for payment, who waived the strict performance of the contract by Hoff<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>man, and promised and agreed to pay the amount called for by said instrument to the plaintiff, is not only supported by the evidence, but sufficient in law, when considered with the other real and undisputed facts of the case, to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The evidence upon the question of waiver consists of\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">1. The testimony of Edwin Bradbrook, a witness and employee of the plaintiff, who .testified that on or about April 10, 1868, he presented the order or draft to the defendant for payment, and that defendant at that time told him that he, defendant, had no money, but that he expected some on the first or second of May, and that he would call down and see the plaintiff and settle with him; that during said conversation defendant did not say anything about Mr. Hoffman not progressing with the work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">2. The testimony of Leroy Clark, a witness called on behalf of the plaintiff, who testified as follows: \u201cI remember calling on the defendant about April 15, 1868; I presented the \u2018Exhibit Ho. 1\u2019 to him; it was the same as it now is, with the exception of the referee\u2019s mark; I asked him if he could pay us the amount of it, or words to that effect; he said, he could not pay it then\u2014the work was not done, the doors were not hung, that Mr. Hoffman had disappointed him; he said he could not pay it then, as he hadn\u2019t the money'; he would pay it the next week ; he would give Mr. Crane a check for it; he said the parlor doors were not hung; I went into the building at the time and saw the parlor doors standing in the room; I went through the houses ; he spoke of nothing but the doors being unhung and incomplete; \u2019 \u2019 and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">3. The further testimony of the witness Edwin Bradbrook to the effect that he saw the defendant \u2022 again on May 9 following, and that defendant at that interview stated that the contract was not yet fulfilled, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that Hoffman had abandoned his contract and had put him, the defendant, to extra expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Assuming this testimony to be true, it falls very much short of establishing a waiver within the rule laid down in Smith v. Brady, 17 <em>N. Y. </em>189 (see also Catlin v. Tobias, 26 <em>Id. </em>217). According to it the first interview took place on or about the date of defendant\u2019s notice to Hoffman, wherein defendant insisted upon full performance, at a time, therefore, when defendant had a right to expect that Hoffman would come and complete his contract, and defendant\u2019s promise then made must be deemed to have been made with reference to such expectation. The conversation with Leroy Clark took place about five days later. There is no evidence that by that time defendant had become aware that Hoffman had really abandoned his contract, and his naked promise, made under such circumstances, to send a check in the course of a week, coupled with the remark that doors were not yet hung, cannot be twisted into a waiver of performance by Hoffman. At the second interview, which occurred between the witness Bradbrook and defendant on May 9 following; the defendant distinctly fell back upon his legal rights under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">This testimony is not only insufficient in itself to establish inferentially a case of waiver, but it is flatly contradicted by that of the defendant, who positively denied having made any such promise as testified to by the witnesses named, and in terms equally positive testified that he told both said witnesses that he would not pay, because the work had not been finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The question of waiver in this case not being a question of law but of fact and intention between the contracting parties, namely Hoffman and defendant, to be determined upon <em>all </em>the circumstances of the case, and the evidence being wholly insufficient to establish such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>fact, the referee clearly erred in finding that such waiver had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment must be reversed, the order of reference, vacated and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Barbour, Ch. J., and Sedgwick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
