This contract contained the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-11\">\u201c And it is hereby further .agreed between the parties hereto, that this agreement shall not in any way alter, vitiate, or make null and void the existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>agreement between them hereinbefore named and bearing date November 15,1865;\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-5\">The plaintiff being called as- a witness and asked, \u201cState the circumstances under which you left the work?\u201d answered, '\u201cDefendant forbid me finishing the washing down of the front.

The objection was overruled, and defendant excepted. . He answered, Five thousand nine hundred and forty-five dollars and thirty-seven cents. He was then asked, and answered, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-6\">. \u201c Q.

The defendant excepted to this charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-8\">The jury thereupon rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for the sum of three hundred and sixty-two dollars and sixty-four cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-9\">The defendant\u2019s counsel thereupon made a motion for a new trial upon the judge\u2019s minutes, which was denied by the court, and exception duly taken by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-10\">Judgment having been entered on the verdict, defendant appealed therefrom, and also from the order denying the motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-11\"><em>Sheldon &amp; </em>Brown, attorneys, and <em>H. </em>Sheldon, of</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>counsel for appellant, urged:\u2014I.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APT\">The court erred in admitting proof of the work performed. The work performed was under a written contract, under seal, and no action could be maintained upon the common counts. The action should have been upon the contracts alleging performance on the part of the plaintiff (1 <em>Chitt. Plead. </em>340; <em>Cow. </em>Treatise, 635, a; 7 <em>Cranch, </em>299 ; Adams <em>v. </em>Mayor, &amp;c., 4 Duer, 295 ; Farron <em>v. </em>Sherwood, 17 <em>N. Y. </em>229 ; Harley <em>v. </em>Black, 28 <em>Id. </em>438; Addison <em>v. </em>Collins, 30 <em>Barb. </em>430; 18 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>235 ; 9 <em>Abb. Pr. Rep. </em>353). The contracts being under seal, the action should be upon them, alleging performance by plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-5\">II. There was no distinction between the so-called extra work, and the other work. It was all performed upon the same building, and under the same contract. Part of it consisted of an enlargement of the wall, and part in other alterations made at the request of the defendant. This work is most clearly all embraced in the contract, <em>(a) </em>Subdivision 3 is as follows :. \u201c <em>Third. </em>Should the owner at any time during the progress of the said building, request any alteration, deviation, additions, <em>or omissions </em>from the said contract) he shall be at liberty to bo so, and the same shall in no way affect or make void the contract, <em>but will be added or- deducted from the amount of the contract as the \u25a0case may be, </em>by a fair and reasonable valuation.\u201d We say, therefore, that the extra work was embraced in the written contract; that it was necessary to proceed upon the contract, and to allege and prove performance thereof, to recover from the' work and materials embraced in the verdict. (5) The charge by the court to the jury is as follows : \u201cH you believe the plaintiff, that he did the work under and by the direction of the defendant, he is entitled to recover,\u201d\u2014which was duly excepted by defendant\u2019s counsel,\u2014was for the same reasons erroneous. Most clearly the plaintiff was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>entitled to recover, for the reason that the work was embraced in the contract, as above stated, and nothing embraced in the contract could be properly recovered in this form of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\">III. The answer of the defendant sets up that the claim of the plaintiff in his complaint arose under the contract set out in the case, that the plaintiff failed to perform and abandoned the contract, and was not entitled to any further pay by its terms. And the answer further claims that defendant suffered two thousand five hundred dollars damages by reason of non-performance of the contract, which defendant claimed to recover of plaintiff in this action. On the trial of the action, and while defendant was on the stand as witness, \u201c Counsel for defendant offered to show by the witness that plaintiff abandoned the work mentioned in the contract in evidence, and that defendant was obliged to go on and complete the work, and that defendant suffered damages by reason of plaintiff, not fulfilling the contract set out in defendant\u2019s answer, which damages defendant proposed to prove amounted to two thousand five hundred dollars, and which defendant claimed to set off to plaintiff\u2019s claim, and also by way of counter-claim in this action.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>This evidence was objected to by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and was excluded by the court, and the counsel for defendant duly excepted to such decision.\u201d This ruling we insist was manifest error, <em>(a) </em>The labor performed and the material furnished, recovered for in this action, were performed and furnished confessedly in and about the same building specified in the contract, and the defendant was therefore entitled to show non-performance as a full defense. (5) The defendant was also entitled to recover any damages he was entitled to in this action, inasmuch as the action was based upon a claim of plaintiff arising upon contract and upon the very contract for the erection of the buildings upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>work was done and materials furnished, claimed in plaintiff\u2019s complaint, <em>- (c) </em>The evidence proposed was, admissible under the provisions of sections 149 and, 150, of the Code. 1st. This claim arose out of the same.transaction mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s.complain t.3d. The plaintiff\u2019s claim is on contract, and thp, defendant\u2019s claim arises also on contract and is expressly admissi-, ble under subdivision <em>2 </em>of section 150-of, the.Code., The courts have nowhere confined, a counter-claim to, claims arising out of the same cause of action-specified in the complaint, but when the action, is upon,contract, any other claim of the defendant, arising upqn, pontract also, may be recovered, in the same action by defendant., (Boston Silk and Woolen Mills <em>v. </em>Eule, <em>37 How, </em>Pr. 299 ; Vassa <em>v. </em>Livingston, 3 <em>Kern. </em>256.; Beardsley <em>v. </em>Stover, 7 <em>How. Pr.; </em>Gleason v. More, <em>2 Duer, </em>642; Shubart <em>v. </em>Harteau, 34 <em>Barb. </em>447), , It may.be for either liquidated or unliquidated damages) Signot v. Redding, 4 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>285); and of unrequitable or legal nature (Currie v. Cowles, 6 <em>Bosw. </em>453;. see also Bates <em>v. </em>Rosekrans, 37 <em>N. Y. </em>409;; DeWolf v. Crandall, 1 <em>Sweeny, </em>556).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\">IV. The verdict was improperly .influenced, by mis-, direction of the judge., \u25a0 The cqurt. should have stated that if the work was done on the tpiildings, embraced, in the contract, although not specified, if done by (defendant\u2019s direction, it, was embraced in subdivision 3 of. the contract, and could not be recovered in this action., And this point is now. tenable although t\u00edtere was go specific exception to that effect (2 <em>Lans. Sup. </em>Ct. <em>Rep. </em>94; Archer <em>v. </em>Hubbell, 4 <em>Wend. </em>514; Harris v. Wilson,. 1 <em>Id. </em>511; Wardell <em>v. </em>Hughes, 3. <em>Id. 418 ; Hill &amp; Denio, Sup. </em>243). .. , ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-6\"><em>H. A. Gildersleeve, </em>attorney and of counsel forj respondent, urged: ,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-8\">I. The court properly overruled the offer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>defendant to prove, by way of counter-claim, a breach, of the contract on the part of the plaintiff. . <em>First. </em>There is no sufficient averment of fa counter-claim contained in the answer., The. defendant alleges no performance, or offer to perform, ;on his own part (3 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pl. </em>160; <em>Abb. Forms, </em>358, 359; Walker <em>v. </em>Millard, <em>29 </em>N. <em>Y. 375). (a.) </em>The matter in the answer is not in any respect the, statement of a counter-claim (Clough <em>v. </em>Murray, 19 <em>Abb. </em>97; Cumings <em>v. </em>Morris, 3 <em>Bosw. </em>560 ; Beers <em>v. </em>Waterbury, 10 <em>Bosw. </em>397 ; Burke <em>v. </em>Thorn, 44 <em>Barb. </em>363). <em>Secondly </em>The defendant was estopped, by his own act, in preventing the plaintiff from litigating his rights <em>under the contracts, </em>from giving evidence for the purpose of establishing a cause of action <em>under the same contracts </em>against the plaintiff (Walker v. Millard, 29 N. <em>Y. </em>375).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-5\">II. All questions under the contract were excluded on defendant\u2019s motion. , , ' \u2019 \",</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b177-7\">By the Court.\u2014Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avq\">The charge of the judge, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the extra work if the jury believed his testimony, and that the extra work was done under the direction of the defendant, coupled with his overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the question, \u201c State the value of the, work, and material which you furnished on that house?\u201d (which objection was based on the ground that the work was done under the contracts and the complaint was not on them) and his ruling that as the pleadings stood the plaintiff would be confined to a recovery of the extra work done outside of the two contracts, was clearly a ruling that the work for which a recovery was had was not done under or included, in the contracts, and, as a consequence of this, that a breach of these contracts by plaintiff was no defense. It is evi-' dent that the case was tried and disposed of on this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The exception to this part of the charge sufficiently raises the question as to whether the principles on which the case was disposed of are correct or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">There is no dispute but that the work recovered for was done on the building which the defendant had agreed by written contract to erect, and for the purposes of this decision it must be assumed (for so the \u2022jury have found) that the work recovered for was done under defendant\u2019s directions, and that it was not specified in the contracts, specifications or plans..</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">But, notwithstanding all this, it was under the third clause of the contract done under and included in the contract; and, consequently, if the contract had not been fully performed, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for the work for which he was allowed to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Although the defendant pleaded the non-performance as a bar, and attempted to plead damages sustained by that non-performance as a counter-claim, yet there having been no motion made to compel an election, he was at liberty to elect at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The fact that he, after the court had held that certain work claimed for by plaintiff was not work under the contract, sought to avail himself of the damages caused.by the breach as a counter-claim, should not prejudice him in his right <em>to elect </em>to use that breach as a bar when the ruling of the court is such as to put him <em>on an election.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The principle on which the case was tried was erroneous, as above stated, and the exception to the charge sufficiently presents the error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Ereedmak, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
