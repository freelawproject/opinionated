On his cross-examination it appeared that the first negotiations between the parties resulted as to one hundred and forty dollars\u2019 worth of furniture in the following agreements:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\">\u201c This is to certify, that I have hired and taken from M.

Mrs. Davison came to me with the receipts I had given her, and requested me to put the whole amount in one receipt, which I did; which is the receipt for two hundred and six dollars; she then said that she would keep the fiirniture, and pay me the balance as soon as possible. When I gave her the receipt for two hundred and six dollars, she returned the small receipts ; I allowed her all she had paid for the hire on account of the purchase. She said she would pay the balance within a specified time, and would keep the goods ; I saw her afterwards, and she promised to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-5\">Q.

Ho further evidence was given by either party on the issue as to a sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-11\">On the issue of coverture, the defendant testified that she was married on the 23rd of December, 1861 or 1862, and that her husband was still living. On cross-examination she testified that she was carrying on a boarding house, that she signed the lease of the house, that she sometimes hired out the rooms and made agreements with the boarders, and sometimes received the money and sometimes her husband did, that she never told plaintiff the business was her own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-12\">On her re-direct examination, in answer to the question, \u201cThe money you receive from boarders you receive as the agent of your husband?\u201d she said, \u201cI do.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>In rebuttal, plaintiff and his son both testified that in December, 1868, at the time of the making of the above written instruments made in December, 1868, defendant told plaintiff that she carried on the business of a boarding house in her own name, that it was her own business, and her husband had nothing to do with it; and plaintiff further testified that he requested her husband to sign the paper, when she said her husband had nothing to do with the boarding-house, that everything she purchased was her own, and that her husband had a separate business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">The testimony was then closed on both sides.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground that there was no proof of a sale; also, that it was proved the defendant was a married woman, living with her husband, and no evidence that she carried on business in her own name; or that this was a debt con: tracted in relation to her business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">Motion granted; defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-8\">Thereupon judgment was entered in favor of defendant against plaintiff, for the sum of seventy-two dollars and forty-seven cents, costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-9\">From this judgment defendant appeals to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-10\"><em>George </em>Carpenter, attorney, and D. <em>T. </em>Walden, of counsel for appellant, urged:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-2\">I. In deciding upon the propriety of a nonsuit, the court is bound to assume the truth of the facts which the testimony of the plaintiff legitimately conduced to prove, though their correctness be controverted by the defendant\u2019s witnesses. The party nonsuited is entitled, upon appeal, to have every doubtful fact found in his favor (Colegrove <em>v. N. </em>Y. &amp; <em>N. </em>H. R. R. Co., <em>20 N. Y. </em>492; Merritt <em>v. </em>Lyon, 3 <em>Barb., </em>110; Ernst <em>v. </em>Hudson R. R. Co., 35 <em>N. Y. </em>25 41), <em>per Porter, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>II. The plaintiff testified that he sold the goods to defendant; and although the effect of that evidence may have been impaired by the cross-examination, yet, on examination by the court, he testifies, that when he gave the receipt for two hundred and six dollars, viz., October 11, 1869, she agreed to keep the goods and pay the balance. Henry'Sulzbacher, the plaintiff\u2019s brother, testifies, that they allowed the amount paid on the hiring towards the purchase, and fixed the balance, and she promised to pay it. This evidence was all in before plaintiff rested, and that the motion was then denied, it is fair to assume that the court decided it was sufficient to go to the jury on the question of sale. Subsequently, defendant was sworn, and was not interrogated as to a sale or promise by her to pay, as stated by the plaintiff. She does not contradict the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to a sale. The evidence appears to have been directed to the question whether she kept a boarding-house. There was evidence sufficient for a jury on the question of purchase, and the dismissal, if on that ground, was erroneous.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">III. The averment and proof of coverture was no defense, if the defendant was carrying on the business of boarding-house keeper, and these goods were purchased by her for that business (Barlow <em>v. </em>Beers, 35 <em>Barb. </em>78 ; Badgley v. Decker, 44 <em>Id. </em>577). And the question whether she was carrying on that business\u2014 whether it was hers or not-\u2014was a question which should have been submitted to the jury, if there were any competent evidence in favor of the plaintiff on that issue (Abby <em>v. </em>Deyo, 44 <em>Barb. </em>374).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">IV. There was evidence, competent and in every respect admissible, tending to prove, and <em>which did prone, </em>that defendant was carrying on .the business of keeping a boarding-house, when she purchased the articles, and that this furniture was for .that business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">V, Whatever difference there may be as to the force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and weight of the evidence, and as to whether the same was met, contradicted or overcome by the defendant, it should have been submitted to the jury ; and its withdrawal from them by a dismissal of the complaint' was error, for which a new trial must be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-5\"><em>Henry C. </em>Denison, attorney and of counsel for respondent, urged</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aay\">I. The contract was in writing, and is explicit, and provided for a sale afterwards to be made if certain amounts were paid. In the mean time, the contract was only one of hiring, and hence this action for goods sold and delivered will not lie, and therefore the plaintiff was properly nonsuited. The contract is that the hiring shall continue until she notifies him to take it away. A positive agreement to keep it on the premises and not underlet. No agreement of sale to be implied, nor shall a sale or purchase of it be deemed valid without a written receipt from said M. Sulzbacher therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\">II. The right reserved to the plaintiff to take the furniture at any time, provided the money paid as rent for an unexpired month is refunded, and the. agreement to give a bill of sale, all prove conclusively that there was no sale <em>in present\u00ed. </em>The complaint is for a balance due only for goods sold and delivered. Here being a specific written contract, and no pretense or claim of a new agreement or bill of sale afterwards, there is an entire failure of proof to support the cause of action. <em>If </em>anything was due for rent, that would be an entirely different claim, and depend on entirely different principles.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-7\">III. If the plaintiff wished anything but a clear regular sale of the goods submitted to the jury, it was his duty to request it at the time. He \u00b0can take, no ground here not urged at the trial (Bidwell <em>v. </em>Lament, 17 <em>How. Pr. </em>357; Marine Bank <em>v. </em>Clements, 31 <em>N. Y. </em>33).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-8\">IY. The defense of coverture was also a complete de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>fense. There is no proof that she ever had a separate estate. And not a particle of evidence that these goods were for her separate business if the faint evidence of admission furnish any evidence of a separate business. As she lived with her husband, she had not any such business as would make her liable (Smith <em>v. </em>Allen, 1 <em>Lans. </em>101; Schmidt <em>v. </em>Corta, 3 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>188).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">Y. If the faint admissions of the plaintiff that she carried on business is evidence, then there is no evidence to show that this was a contract made in connection with her business. The statute only makes the wife liable for debts contracted in connection with the business carried on by her; and before the plaintiff can recover, he must show either that the consideration for which the contract was made was for the benefit of her separate estate, or that the- contract was made in connection with the business carried on (Yale <em>v. </em>Dederer, <em>22 N. Y. </em>450; <em>Laws </em>1860, chap. 90, \u00a7 8, p. 159).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b161-6\">By the Court.\u2014Jones, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao0\">I am in favor of reversing the judgment and ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">There was error in dismissing the complaint. The court, in granting the motion, necessarily held that there was either <em>no </em>evidence of a sale, or <em>no </em>evidence either that defendant carried on business in her own name, or that the debt was contracted in relation to her business. Having held there was no evidence, there was, of course, nothing in view taken by the court to submit to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The court did not decide on the assumption that certain facts were proved, which would have brought the case within Bidwell v. Lamont, 17 <em>How. Pr. </em>357, but on the ground that there was no evidence of certain facts, which is an entirely different thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Even under the cases of Bidwell v. Lamont, and Marine Bank v. Clements, 31 <em>N. Y. </em>33, we can only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>infer, in support of the decision, those conclusions which the jury would have been warranted to draw ; and, from the evidence in the case, we think the jury would not be warranted in finding that the defendant did not carry on business in her own name, or that the articles were not purchased and furnished for that business. Such a finding would have been against the evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
