In July, 1867, George H. Filley,K brother of plaintiff, died in Montana, leaving property there ; also leaving in Connecticut, respondent and others, his brothers and sister. In October, 1867, the plaintiff with such others made an open letter of at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>torney to P. D. Barnhart, authorizing \"him for them to have, demand and receive from any person or persons then holding, or who might thereafter hold any of the estate, money, property or effects, belonging to them or to.either of them, as heirs or heir at law of the late George H. Filley. This power authorized substitution. In May, 1868, Barnhart made a letter of substitution to Charles W. Johnson, in which he describes and \u201cfully sets forth the business to be done\u201d by Johnson. In September, 1868, plaintiff and others made another written instrument <em>for the sole and exclusive protection of John B. </em>Caldwell, <em>administrator of the estate of George H. Filley. </em>That instrument declared that if said Caldwell would pay to said Johnson, as the heirs\u2019 attorney, the moneys and effects which have come to his hands as <em>administrator </em>belonging to the heirs of the estate of said George H. Filley, that they would release and discharge said Caldwell from all liability to them as heirs of said estate; and they authorized said Johnson as their attorney to demand and receive from said Caldwell, <em>as such </em>administrator, the moneys and effects of deceased. To this extent, and to this extent only, did they ratify the substitution of Johnson. On January 8, 1869, Johnson received for plaintiff the draft in dispute. On January 20, 1869, Johnson indorsed and sold said draft to Warren, Hussey &amp; Co., through Joseph A. Thatcher, their agent.\" This Johnson had no right to do ; and Thatcher had no right to purchase it, because he, Thatcher, knew that Johnson was but a substitute under the letter of power, and that said letter of power limits the business to be done and performed by the attorney. March 31, 1869, defendants were informed that plaintiff claimed to be the rightful owner of said draft, and demand was made on the defendants that the draft or the amount thereof be paid. They refused, and this action is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The only question in the case is, Had Johnson authority from Filley the plaintiff, to indorse the draft ?\u2014 and the evidence of any such authority in respect to said draft must be found, if anywhere, in the letter of power to Barnhart. Written instruments authorizing a power must be strictly construed, and this authority not extended beyond that given in terms or beyond what is absolutely necessary for carrying the authority given in terms into effect <em>(Story on </em>Agency, \u00a7 68). How the authority in this case is shown by Exhibit Ho. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">It was to act for him concerning a particular object, namely, <em>\u201cto have, demand andreceive from any person or persons now holding or who may hereafter hold any of the estate, moneys, property or effects, belonging to plaintiff as heir at law of the late George I~L </em>Filley.\u201d Such was the power given to Barnhart, and the instrument' substituting Johnson does not or could not express or imply any greater or different authority <em>(Story on Agency, </em>120).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Johnson acquired no authority from Barnhart; he acquired it through Barnhart. Hence' Johnson\u2019s authority could not exceed the authority of him who conferred it. Barnhart\u2019s authority was special, namely, as the attorney for the principals, in their names to <em>demand and receive </em>their parts and shares of the estate of the deceased Greorge H. Filley; and clearly Johnson had no authority not given to Barnhart. In no case can general language be construed as authority to indorse a draft or make a note or draw checks (Farmers\u2019 &amp; Mechanics\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Butchers\u2019 &amp; Drovers\u2019 Bank, 16 <em>N. Y. </em>144).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Thatcher saw the power in this case, and as between one dealing with an attorney as such and the principal, the former is chargeable with knowledge of the legal effect of the authority ; because he is presumed to have been on his guard and to have seen the power. This is is almost elementary learning (Horth River Bank <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Aymar, 3 <em>Hill, </em>262, 276 ; Homer <em>v. </em>Tysen, <em>Id. </em>279 ; Farmers\u2019 &amp; Mechanics\u2019 Bank <em>v. </em>Butchers\u2019 <em>&amp; </em>Drovers\u2019 Bank, 16 <em>N. Y. </em>140, 144). Sale of Texasu bonds (Hodge v. Combs, 1 Black, 192, <em>U. S. Court). </em>Making a promissory note (Rossiter <em>v. </em>Rossiter, 8 <em>Wend. </em>494). Accepting a bill of exchange (Hogg <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 <em>Taunt. </em>347; Hay <em>v. </em>Goldsmith, <em>Id. </em>349, 350 ; Murray <em>v. </em>East India Co., 5 <em>B. &amp; Ald. </em>204, 210, 211; Holtzinger <em>v. </em>Corn Exchange Bank, 1 <em>Sweeney's S. C. </em>64). The Holtzinger case was argued in the court of appeals February 7, 1871, which court has affirmed the judgment of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">When defendants received said draft (February 2, 1869), and transferred the amount thereof from the credit of the drawees to the credit of Warren, Hussey &amp; Co., the defendants accepted this draft and became liable to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b351-7\">Sedgwick, J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"ASU\">The proof shows that Howlan &amp; Weary, for value, drew their bill of exchange on the defendants to the order of the plaintiff, and delivered it to the attorney of the plaintiff. Thereupon the plaintiff became the owner of the bill and entitled to its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">The attorney without authority indorsed the bill with the name of the plaintiff. The attorney then delivered it to third parties, and in time it was presented to the defendant for acceptance and payment. It may be true that the defendants had made no engagement or contract which bound them to the plaintiff to accept or pay it. Although not so bound, they were not authorized to use the plaintiff\u2019s property for their own purposes. They paid the bill\u2014it not being indorsed by the plaintiff, and used it, it must be concluded from the facts of the case, as a voucher to the drawers, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>money had been paid by the defendants on their account. This was a conversion of the plaintiff\u2019s property. This property was a bill, which was, before acceptance, an engagement by the drawers with the plaintiff, that the drawees would accept and pay the bill, and that, if they did not, he would pay it. The engagement was presumed and was proved to be of the value of the face of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">That the defendants acted with entire honesty, there is no doubt, but they were bound, if they paid, to pay to no one but to the plaintiff or his order, and were bound not to take into their possession the plaintiff\u2019s property in derogation of his title to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">I therefore concur in the decision of the presiding judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
