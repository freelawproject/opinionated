And the plaintiff further offered in evidence, that the trade, in flour in the neighbourhood of <em>Zanesville </em>was then in its infancy, and that when flour was intended for <em>New-Orleans, </em>it was, according to the course of the flour trade in the <em>Mississippi, </em>and its tributary waters, to inspect flour at <em>New-Orleans, </em>when there was no public inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>tion of flour at the place where it was loaded in the boats intended to convey it down the river, and that on its passage down the river flour is never taken out of the boat to be inspected before it arrives at, <em>New-Orleans, </em>when destined for <em>New-Orleans. </em>And also offered in evidence the depositions of sundry witnesses, and other proceedings taken and had under commissions for that, purpose issued out of the said court to certain commissioners of <em>Zanesville, </em>in <em>Muskingum </em>county, in the state of <em>Ohio, </em>and of the city of Neio-Orleans, in the state of <em>Louisiana. </em>That part of the testimony which seems necessary to be stated, (it being admitted by the parties that the said commissions had been regularly executed,) is that of <em>Isaac Dillon, </em>the subscribing witness to the contract, who proved its execution. Also that of <em>Maunsel White, </em>of the city of <em>New-Orleans, </em>in answer to the <em>third </em>interrogatory propounded t\u00a9 him by the plaintiff, who proved \u201cthat he was balled upon iu the spring of the year 1817 by <em>Richard Relf, </em>to state the difference usually allowed on the sale of flour, between superfine, fine, common and middling: that he then stated that the difference was as follows: that two-thirds superfine and one-third fine, was the proportion established as merchantable; that when merchantable flour is worth twelve dollars a barrel, fine is only worth eleven, and middling and common worth eight. That when merchantable flour is worth eight dollars a barrel, fine is only worth seven, and middling and common six, and so in proportion.\u201d Also that of \u201c <em>William Ross, </em>of the city of <em>New-</em>Orleans, of full age, being produced, sworn and examined, on the part of the plaintiff in this cause, deposeth as follows: 1\u00bb To the first interrogatory on the part of the plaintiff he answers, that he knows neither of the parties. 2. To the second interrogatory on the part of the plaintiff he answers, that in May 1817 he inspected a boat load of flour, amounting to four hundred and ninety-nine barrels, said to be from <em>Putnam, </em>in. the state of <em>Ohio, </em>brought to the city by captain <em>Tarrier, </em>and consigned to <em>John C. Wederstrandt, </em>Esq. who being absent, the flour was delivered to <em>Richard Relf </em>Esq. by whom this deponent was called to inspect it. 3.

To the fourth interrogatory on the part of the plaintiff he answers, that the flour, except the condemned barrel, did not appear to have been at all injured in its passage down the river, .but its bad', quality was owing to its having been badly, manufactured. 5. To the fifth interrogatory on the part of the plaintiff he answers, that' he was commissioned by <em>James Villere, </em>governor; of the state of <em>Louisiana, </em>on the 1st day of January 1816.\u201d The defendant then offered in evidence the depositions taken under one of the said commissions at <em>Zanesville; </em>and he also offered in evidence, that in the year <em>1817'New-Orleans </em>was the principal port to which flour, that passed.the falls of' the <em>Ohio, </em>was carried, but that it was sometimes sold at other places, when it was discovered that the <em>New-Orleans </em>market was not a favourable one; and that boats employed in the-transportation of flour, ultimately destined for <em>New-Orleans, </em>were in the habii of calling at various places on the <em>Ohio </em>and <em>Mississippi, </em>such as <em>Cincinnati, Louisville </em>and <em>Natches, </em>when the owner or agent was on board, for the purpose of trying the market at these several places, and were - governed on the further prosecution of their voyage to. <em>New-Orleans </em>by the state of the market at the said places. And thereupon the, court, upon the prayer of the plaintiff, gave the following: instructions and directions to the jury: If the jury believe front the evidence that there was no public .inspection of flour at <em>Zanesville, </em>then the plaintiff had a right to take the flour to any port or place on the <em>Ohio </em>or <em>Mississippi </em>rivers, where there was a public inspection of that article, provided in so doing he did not take it to an unusual port or place, for the inspection of flour, descending from <em>Zanesville; </em>and if they believe the flour was inspected at <em>New-Orleans, </em>that <em>New-Orleans </em>was the great mart for the flour of the country on the Muskingum, and that flour, sold at any port or place on the <em>Muskingum </em>where there was no public inspection, was not usually inspected at any intermediate port between such place and <em>New-Orleansv </em>and .that this was generally known to the dealers in flour on, said river at the time the contract in this cause was executed, that then the jury might infer that <em>Neiv-Orleans </em>was not an unusual place for the inspection of flour descending from <em>Zanes= </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>ville. </em>And furthermore, if the jury believe that the flour was not taken to an unusual place for inspection, that the defendant in that event took the risk of inspection; and if it docs not at such place pass in quality such as the contract has stipulated, then the plaintiff is entitled to a fair indemnity for the difference in value of the flour as delivered and inspected, and the flour contracted to be delivered. The plaintiff then prayed the opinion and instruction of the court to the jury, that if th\u00e9 jury find from the evidence that <em>New-Orleans </em>was a usual and proper place for the inspection of flour delivered at <em>Zanesville, </em>at the time of the delivery of the flour in question; and if they also find that the flour, when inspected at <em>New-Orleans, </em>was of inferior quality, and of less value, as is stated in the deposition of <em>William Ross, </em>the flour inspector at <em>New-Orleans, </em>in one of the commissions heroin before mentioned, than the flour contracted to be delivered, that then the measure of damages is the difference in value at <em>New-Orleans, </em>at the time of the inspection, between the flour contracted to be delivered, and the flour in question as passed by the inspector. Which opinion and instruction the Court, <em>[Archer, </em>Ch. J. and <em>Hanson, </em>and <em>Ward, </em>A. J.] refused to give; but instructed the jury, that according to the fair construction of this contract, the proper measure of damages is the difference in value at <em>Zanesville </em>between the flour stipulated to be delivered, and that which was delivered at the time the flour was by the contract to be delivered. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">2. The plaintiff then offered to prove by a competent witness, that at the time of the contract in question, and of the delivery of the flour, and of the inspection at <em>New-Orleans, </em>the market price at <em>New-Orleans </em>regulated the price of superfine, fine, and common flour, on the <em>Mississippi </em>and the <em>Ohio, </em>at all* the plaees with which he was acquainted, and also the relative value of such flour; and also that the witness was, at the times above mentioned, well acquainted with the flour trade on the <em>Mississippi </em>and the <em>Ohio, </em>but had not at those times any acquaintance at <em>Zanesville, </em>or with the flour trade on the <em>Muskingum </em>above <em>Marietta; </em>that the witness has no knowledge of the prices or relative value of flour at <em>Zanesville </em>itself, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>at the times above mentioned he was acquainted with the flour trade at <em>Marietta, </em>and up the <em>Ohio </em>to <em>Pittsburg, </em>and there was not the difference throughout that course of more than six cents or 12J cents per barrel for flour at any of the above places, if it were of the same quality; that at the times above mentioned, flour at <em>Biarietta, </em>which would not pass inspection as fine, was of no value for exportation, and was not saleable for that purpose; that <em>Marietta </em>and <em>Zanesville </em>are both situated on the <em>Biushingum </em>river, <em>Marietta </em>at its mouth, and <em>Zanesville </em>about sixty miles higher up; that the price of merchantable flour, at the times above mentioned, at <em>Marietta, </em>was at least <em>six </em>dollars or upwards; and by merchantable flour, the witness means flour two-thirds superfine and one-third fine. The plaintiff offered in evidence, by another competent witness, that in 1817 he resided in the <em>western country </em>at <em>Steubenville, </em>and was acquainted with the prices of flour from <em>Louisville </em>to <em>Pittsburg, </em>and with the relative prices which it bore at different places on the <em>Ohio, </em>but not off the <em>Ohio, and </em>not at <em>Zanesville-, </em>but at this time cannot state the prices at any of those places; that the buyers- made their purchases, and were regulated in their prices by the prospects at <em>New-Orleans; </em>and that it was the usage in the places above mentioned to settle any damages for deficiency in quality, when the flour was to be inspected in <em>Orleans, </em>by the Orleans prices; that whenever there was no inspection at the place where the flour was put on board the boats, it was usual for the flour to be inspected at Orleans. To the admissibility of which evidence the defendant objected. And the court were of opinion that the same was not admissw ble to prove the relative value of superfine, fine, and common flour at <em>Zanesville, </em>and was not evidence which the jury were entitled to consider in ascertaining the damages which the plaintiff had sustained by the breach of the contract in this case; but that in order to furnish a standard of damages in this case, the plaintiff is bound to prove the value at <em>Zanesville </em>of the flour which the defendant contracted to deliver, and the relative value of that which was delivered at that place at that time; and thereupon refused to suffer the said evidence, or any part thereof, to be given to the jury for the purpose aforesaid. The: plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>3. The plaintiff then prayed the opinion of the court, that, 'in the absence of all proof as to the relative prices of superfine: flour, fine flour, and common flour, at <em>Zanesville, </em>or at auy other place on the <em>Muskingum </em>river, except <em>Marietta, </em>the jury may, in estimating the damages of the plaintiff in this cause, take into consideration the relative value of the above mentioned qualities of flour at <em>Marietta, </em>it being the nearest point to <em>Zanesville </em>mentioned in the testimony. Which opinion the court refused to give. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">4.

The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-6\">5. The plaintiff further offered in evidence by a witness, that lie purchased flour at <em>Zanesville </em>in the spring of 1S17, and paid for it from six to eight dollars per barrel; and that the witness, at the time above mentioned, wai engaged in shipping flour from the waters of the <em>Mississippi </em>and <em>Ohio, </em>and is acquainted with the flour trade in those waters; and that in the opinion of the witness, no merchant acquainted with the said trade would purchase for exportation at <em>Zanesville, </em>flour that would not pass inspection as merchantable flour, provided he knew it would not pass. That the witness paid for the freight of flour from <em>Zanesville </em>to <em>New-Orleans </em>two dollars pci- barrel; that the witness was not in the <em>Western Country </em>in the spring of the year 1817, and did not make the purchases he has mentioned, in person, but that some of the said purchases were made by the partner of the witness, and that some of them were made by his brother, as agent for the mercantile house of which the witness then was a partner, and that all the information of the witness of the facts of the purchases which he has mention* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ed is derived from his said partner and brother, who are both living; but that the witness knows that, his house paid for the flour above mentioned, and for other flour purchased at other places on the <em>Western </em>waters, at the prices \u00e1bove mentioned, and which prices were stated, to him by his said partner and brother as being the prices which they had contracted to give lor the said flour. The defendant objected to the admissibility of the said' evidence. \u25a0 And the court were of opinion, that the said evidence was not admissible to prove the relative value at <em>Zanesville </em>of' superfine, fine, and common flour, and was not evidence which the jury were entitled to consider in ascertaining the damages which the plaintiff had sustained by the breach of the c.ontraot in this case; but that in order to furnish a standard of damages in this case, the plaintiff is bound to prove the value at <em>Zanesville </em>of the flour which the defendant contracted to deliver, and the relative value of that which was delivered at that place at that time; and thereupon refused to suffer the said evidence, or any part thereof, to be given to the jury for the purpose aforesaid, The plaintiff excepted, \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">6. The plaintiff then offered to read in evidence that part of the deposition of <em>Maunsel White, </em>which is contained in his answer to the third interrogatory. To the <em>admissibility </em>of which evidence the defendant objected. And the court were of opinion that the said statement contained in the said answer was inadmissible evidence, and refused to let the same go to the jury. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-6\">7. The plaintiff then, in addition to the evidence above stated, offered to prove by a competent witness, that the witness purchased flour on the <em>Mississippi </em>in the spring of 1817; that the said flour was sold in <em>New-Orleans </em>in the spring of that year; that part of the said flour was part superfine, and part common; that the difference in price between superfine and fin\u00e9 was one dollar per barrel, and the difference between superfine and common was four dollars per barrel; that witness Was not in <em>New-Orleans </em>himself at the time when the sales Were made; he knows that his house received payment for flour sold in <em>New-Orleans, </em>at the relative prices above mentioned., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>at the time above slated; that the said sales were made by the partner of the witness, and the accounts were rendered of the sales in the manner and at the prices above stated; that the witness had no personal agency in mailing either the said sales or purchases, or any of them, having himself been residing all along in <em>Baltimore, </em>and that the above statement is made entirely on the information of his partner, and the agents of the house who resided in <em>New-Orleans, </em>and transacted the business, his said partner being still living. The said sales were made by agents of the house under the immediate direction of the partner of the witness, as he was informed by his said partner, and the accounts of which witness speaks, were rendered by such agents, and received by the witness from his said partner. To the admissibility of which testimony the defendant objected. And the court were of opinion, that the said testimony was inadmissible, and refused to suffer the same, or any part thereof, to go to the jury. The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-5\">8. The plaintiff further offered to prove by a competent witness, that the witness was in <em>New-Orleans </em>in May 1817, and had orders to purchase flour; that the price of superfine flour at that time was $13; that he does not know the comparative value of line and superfine flour. In the market of <em>Baltimore </em>the difference between fine and superfine is hall a dollar. That fine and common flour is inferior in value generally to superfine, but that the witness made no inquiries at <em>Orleans </em>in relation to fine or common, and cannot therefore speak of the re - iative value of those qualities of flour at <em>New-Orleans. </em>The plaintiff further offered to prove by another competent witness, that he resided in <em>New-Orleans, </em>and did business there asa commission merchant from 1806 to 1811; that he was, during that time, in the practice of selling a good deal of flour, and was well acquainted with the <em>New-Orleans </em>market for flour, and the usage of that market at that time, and with the course of trade. That the flour, of which he speaks, was the flour which came down the <em>Mississippi; </em>that during the time above mentioned the difference in value between superfine flour and common flour was as follows: that is to say, that when superfine was eleven and twelve dollars, common flour would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>about nine dollars per barrel, and so in proportion, the difference being greater when flour was higher, and less when flour was lower; that the smallest difference the witness ever knew between superfine flour and common flour in the <em>Neio-Orleans </em>market was three dollars, and the difference between fine and superfine was about one and one half dollars per barrel, when the price was such as is above mentioned, and that difference increased and diminished according to the price of flour in the rates above mentioned; fine flour is inferior in value to superfine flour, and common flour inferior in value to fine flour. It was generally difficult to sell fine or common flour in the market at <em>Orleans, </em>but superfine flour had generally a ready sale. That witness had not been at <em>New-Orleans </em>since May 1811, and has no personal knowledge of the prices of flour, or the usages of trade since that period of time; that they could always obtain for flour of the <em>Baltimore </em>brand two or three dollare more than for flour brought down the <em>Mississippi </em>from the <em>Western Country, </em>and would always sell superfine flour for something, when fine and common flour could not be disposed of. And also offered to prove by another competent witness, that the said witness resided in <em>New-Orleans </em>in 1819, and was a clerk in a mercantile house at that place; that the price of merchantable flour was at that time <em>$8 </em>per barrel, and that merchantable flour, so called in the market of <em>Neio-Orleans, </em>were One third fine and two thirds superfine; that the prices of flour during the months of November and December 1S19, and January and February 1820, were at $8 pe\u00ed barrel, and that prices fluctuated during the residue of 1819 from 50 cents to a dollar; that at the time above mentioned, flour which passed inspection at <em>New-Orleans </em>as common only, was of less value, and was worth in <em>New-Orleans </em>only five and a half dollars per barrel, when merchantable flour was worth <em>$8 </em>per barrel. Witness lived there from 1819 to 1822; that while the witness resided there flour which passed inspection as common flour was always inferior in value to merchantable flour as above described, and that when flour was high the difference was greater, and when lower the difference was less. And also offered in evidence by another witness, that the witness resided at <em>Zanesville from </em>1811 to 1817, and left <em>Zanesville </em>on the 20th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>April 1817; that when he- left <em>Zanesville </em>he was between 14 and 15 years of age, and the fall before ho left there he was employed by several persons, in conjunction with two others, to make an enumeration of the inhabitants of the town of <em>Zanesville. </em>The flour from <em>Zanesville </em>was generally sent to the <em>New-Orleans </em>market, but was sometimes sold on the way, where a market offered, as at <em>Cincinnati, Louisville, </em>or other places. There was no public inspection for flour at <em>Zanesville </em>before or at the time when the witness left there. That at the time they were making the enumeration as above mentioned, they endeavoured to ascertain the amount, of flour dispatched from <em>Zanesville, </em>and the witness made inquiries on that subject, but he was unable to ascertain it, and gave it up. That the father of this deponent was a physician, and in the habit of receiving wheat from his patients, which he somestimes sold t\u00a9 millers, sometimes had it ground into flour, and sometimes bartered the wheat or flour for such articles as he wanted; that there was very little money in the country, but flour generally had a ready sale for cash, because it was one of the articles usually sent to market to <em>New-Orleans; </em>but has no knowledge of any particular sale of flour having been made at <em>Zanesville, </em>and speaks only of what he generally understood to be the course of business in relation to flour, and as to what he has already stated in relation to the general destination of flour to <em>New-Orleans. </em>Ho has no personal knowledge on the subject, and no other knowledge than what he derived from the information of others, and from seeing boats frequently depart from <em>Zanesville, </em>which he understood from the boatmen, when he saw them taking their departure, to be destined for <em>Orleans, </em>and also from what he generally understood at <em>Zanesville </em>to be the course of the trade. He had frequent conversations with boatmen who were engaged in the trade on the river, and also had conversations with the young men who were employed to superintend the sale of flour, and his information as to the course of the trade, as above stated, is derived from these sources. To the-admissibility of all which testimony, so far as the same refers relates to the relative value of flour at <em>New-Orleans, </em>or so far as the same refers or relates to the relative value of the different qualities of flour at any place on the <em>Ohio, </em>other than at <em>Zanes</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>ville, </em>the defendant objected. Of which opinion was the court, and refused to let the said evidence go to the jury so far as above objected to. Whereupon the plaintiff prayed the court to designate the particular sentences, passages, and parts of the testimony above stated, which were admitted and rejected.

He does not hold himself bound by the construction given by the court to the contract, as stated in the <em>first </em>bill of exceptions.

The contract is a written one, and it must be construed by the court. The measure of damages is legally incorporated into every contract; and the rule given by the court below, as to the measure of damages, was the proper rule. The defendant did not subject himself to the fluctuations of a foreign market. He stipulated to deliver the flour at Zanesville; and there he did deliver it. If he had failed altogether to deliver the flour; what would* have been the measure of damages? Not what would be the price at New-Orleans, or any foreign market, to which the plaintiff might have intended to ship it; but the standard of value would be fixed at <em>Zanesville </em>at the time when the contract was to be consummated. <em>Chipman on </em>Contracts, 121, and the cases there referred to. <em>Shepherd vs Hampton, </em>3 <em>Wheat. </em>200. <em>Gainsford vs Carroll, </em>9 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Low. </em>204. <em>Leigh vs Paterson, 8 Taunt. </em>540, <em>(4 Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Low. 204.) 2 Stark.

But it has been said that the contract was not completed until after the flour was inspected at <em>New-Orleans. </em>The Contract stipulates that the flour should be delivered at Zanesville; and it was delivered there to the plaintiff, who sent it to <em>New-Orleans. </em>Suppose the flour had been lost in its transportation, would the defendant be bound to supply other flour of the same or any other quality? If the measure of damage was the value'of the flour at <em>Zanesville, </em>then the plaintiff should have produced evidence of what was the value at <em>Zanesville. </em>This he did not do; although such evidence might have.been obtained. No evidence short of that required could be received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-5\">If there ought to have been nominal damages in this case, this court, under the act of 1809, <em>ch. 153, </em>are authorised t\u00ae amend the proceedings so as to give nominal damages.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-6\"><em>Taney, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A75\">The construction given by the court below to this contract on' the first prayer of the plaintiff, is the true one. We must take it with its consequences. The contract was to deliver flour which should pass inspection, l-3d fine, 2*3ds superfine. These latter terms imply a public inspection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>for private opinion could not pass the flour, as either fine or superfine. The purport of an inspection is to give an article a fixed character. The value of the flour was to be so fixed in the market by the intent and contract of the parties. The inspection was to influence the market value. This quality of fine and superfine to be fixed by inspection, was to be attached to the flour at <em>New-Orleans, </em>the only place for inspection; and was to be conclusive between the parties. We admit that the time and place of the breach, the difference in value then and-there, will furnish the measure of damages. <em>Dillon </em>warrants the flour shall pass, and therefore he covenanted that <em>Williamson </em>might take the flour to <em>Orleans, </em>the usual place of inspection, where of course it was to pass. His, <em>D\u2019s, </em>covenant is of that extent. The flour does not pass; that is a breach of the covenant, not of delivery; but that it would pass inspection at: <em>Orleans. </em>The time of the breach then, is the time of the inspection; the place, is the place of the intended inspection, and that was <em>Orleans. </em>It is a mistake to confine the breach to the mere delivery of uninspected barrels. We claim our damages, therefore, for the injury sustained at <em>Orleans </em>at the time of the inspection and discovery that our contract had been violated. Neither would it be correct to apply to the breach arising from a failure to pass inspection, the same measure of damages as for a nondelivery. In the latter case the purchaser, not having parted with his money, can replace the article, and the difference of price, at the place of delivery, would fully remunerate him. To this last case a failure to deliver stock sold to be delivered at a future day, is analogous; but the true measure of damages in this case is the equity which the purchaser has t\u00bb reimbursement under its peculiar circumstances. <em>Bridge vs Wain, </em>2 <em>Serg. &amp; Low. </em>486. 1 <em>Stark.

There is no one prayer as to the sufficiency of the evidence; hut they all go as to the admissibility of the evidence. It is clear that the plaintiff could give, and that he did give evidence that the price of flour on the river was regulated by the price at <em>New-Orleans, </em>and he proved the relative value each place, except at <em>Zanesville. </em>The evidence was cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tainly admissible, but whether sufficient or not, was another question, and which was for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-5\">On the <em>eighth </em>bill of exceptions, he cited 1 <em>Stark. </em>Evict. 395. 3 <em>Stark.

This was an action instituted to recover damages for the nonperformance of a covenant entered into between the parties on the 25th of January 1817, in the following words, (and which was signed and .sealed by them:) \u2014 \u201cMemorandum of an agreement entered into on this 25th day of January 1817, between <em>Moses </em>Dillon, of <em>Zanesville, </em>state of <em>Ohio, </em>and <em>David Williamson </em>of <em>Baltimore, </em>state of <em>Maryland, </em>whereby the said <em>Moses Dillon </em>obligates and binds himself to deliver to the said Williamson, or order, at <em>Zanesville, </em>two hundred and fifty barrels of flour, not less than one-third of same flour <em>to pass </em>as fine quality, the remaining two-thirds of superfine, <em>to be at said place by the first day of March next, </em>to be lined and in good shipping order; and <em>to deliver on the 15th of same month, </em>two hundred and fifty barrels of flour of same quality as the first mentioned quality, and in like order, to the said <em>Williamson, </em>or order, <em>at the above named place, </em>for which flour, <em>on its delivery as above, </em>the said <em>David Williamson, </em>Jr. binds and obligates himself to pay to the said <em>Moses Dillon, or </em>order, the sum of seven dollars per barrel, for which flour payment will be made to the said <em>Dillon </em>with his bonds passed to <em>Luke Tientan </em>and <em>Kennedy Owen, </em>of <em>Baltimore, </em>interest being added in said bond to the day of <em>the delivery </em>of said flour, at the par of exchange. In testimony,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">In the trial of this cause, many exceptions were taken to opinions given by the court below; and without fallowing the regular orfler, in which they appear, we will d\u00e9cide the points' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>that arise in them, and then apply the law to each exception respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The true construction of this contract is the first question te be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">That the intention of the parties making a contract is to be regarded, and when practicable, carried into effect, is a fundamental rule in the construction of contracts. Where the agreement is in writing, and an ambiguity appears, not on the face of the paper, you may have recourse to extrinsic evidence to aid in its construction; but where its language is clear and explicit, the instrument must bo construed according to its plain import and terms. In this case we see no ambiguity, and we think the agreement, on the face of it, clearly points out the intention of the parties contracting</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The contract is for the delivery of a certain quantity of flour, of a particular quality; to be delivered \u2014 where? The contract expressly states, <em>at Zanesville. </em>When was it to be delivered? It is equally explicit that the first 250 barrels were to be delivered on the 1st of March 1817, and the remainder on the 15lh of the same month, and <em>Williamson </em>stipulated that he would pay for the said flour seven dollars a barrel, <em>on its delivery as aforesaid. </em>But the flour, thus to be delivered <em>on the 1st and 15th of March at </em>Zanesville, was to be of a particular quality, and the agreement points out the evidence by which the. quality shall be ascertained; it shall be such flour <em>as will pas&amp; inspection, </em>&amp;c. The inspection was no part of the contract, <em>as it related to the time or place of delivery, </em>but only the evidence or test by which it was agreed the quality of the flour should be ascertained. Suppose on the day after the flour was delivered, <em>Williamson, </em>under an impression that it was not of such quality as was specified in the contract, had instituted a suit against <em>Dillon, </em>can it be doubted that such suit could be sustained, although the flour had not <em>then </em>been inspected, if <em>afterwards, </em>upon inspection, it would not pass? The moment the stipulated time for the delivery of the flour had passed, the contract was either performed or broken, and it was only necessary to carry it to <em>New-Orleans, </em>or any other place, for inspection, to furnish evidence of its quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">With this explanation of the contract we are next to enquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>tit wh\u00e1t time and place </em>the price of flour was to be the measure of damages; and with this view, it is necessary to consider, not only what the contract is, but what it is not. It is not <em>a. </em>contract for the delivery of <em>stock, </em>and therefore the case of <em>Downes vs Back, 2 Serg. &amp; Lowb. </em>407, and the case of <em>M\u2018Arthur vs Lord Seaforth, 2 Taunt. </em>257, do not apply to it. By this contract the price was to be paid when the flour was delivered. It is not for affireightment, and, therefore, not within the doctrine laid down in <em>Bracket vs M\u2018Nair, </em>14 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>170, and <em>Amory vs M\u2018Greggor, </em>15 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>24, even if the authority of those cases had never been questioned; nor is it a contract for the sale and delivery of articles where <em>no time or place </em>is specified for the delivery, as in <em>Bridge vs Wain, </em>2 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Lowb. 486. </em>These are cases decided, upon principles not applicable to the one now before us, and we look in vain to <em>them </em>to aid. us in forming a correct opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">It is believed that- no case, can be found where there was ars agreement to deliver a <em>specific </em>article at a <em>particular time and, place, </em>and the money to be paid at the time of delivery, that the value of that article, <em>at the time and place of </em>delivery, was not considered the measure of damages, unless where the contract showed it was for a particular purpose, and special damages were laid in the declaration. In <em>Chipman on 0071-tracts, </em>121, it is stated, \u201cIf property be sold at a particular price, to be delivered at a future day, and in the meantime the property rise, the purchaser is entitled to the rise of property; and if the property be not delivered, the value of the property, <em>at the t\u00fane and place of delivery, </em>is the measure, of damages.\u201d And in <em>Shepherd vs Hampton, </em>3 <em>Wheat. </em>200, \u201cIt Was the unanimous opinion of the court, that the price of the article, <em>at the time it ivas to be delivered, </em>is the measure of damages.\u201d See also the case of <em>Leigh vs Patterson, 4 </em>Serg. <em>&amp; Lowb. </em>204. <em>Gainsford vs Carroll and others, 9 Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Lowb. </em>204, and <em>Cannell vs M\u2018Clean, 6 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>297.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The same rule, we think, will apply, where the damages are claimed, not for the nondelivery of the article, but for the delivery of ah article of a <em>different quality </em>from that contracted to be delivered. The difference of price, <em>at the time andplacp </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>stipulated for the delivery </em>between the article delivered and that contracted for, is the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"AiV\">The case of <em>Gilpins vs </em>Consequa, 1 <em>Peters\u2019 C. C. Rep. </em>86, sustains this position. That was an action brought to recover damages for the nondelivery of teas, of the <em>quality </em>contracted to be delivered, by <em>Consequa, </em>the defendant, to the supercargo of <em>Gilpins. Consequa </em>stipulated to deliver at <em>Canton </em>a cargo of tea for the <em>Pennsylvania </em>Packet, <em>to he fresh, prime, and of the first chop. </em>The tea was delivered, and carried first to <em>Philadelphia, </em>and afterwards to <em>Amsterdam, </em>where it was sold at public sale, according to the usage. From a comparison of the sales, it appeared these teas sold for less than some other teas of the same kind, which was attributed to their being of <em>inferior quality. </em>Judge <em>Washington </em>charged the jury, that as the contract was to deliver teas <em>at Canton </em>of a certain quality, <em>they </em>would consider the sales at <em>Amsterdam, </em>and the comparison of them with those of other teas, not as furnishing the <em>amount, </em>but the <em>rate </em>of loss; and having ascertained the rate, to apply it to the prices of the same articles of first quality at <em>Canton, </em>when these teas were delivered. And the learned judge, in illustration of this doctrine, stated \u2014 -\u201cIf a man contract to deliver a quantity of flour, for instance, by a particular day, and fails, or deliver it of a quality inferior to that stipulated for, all that can be claimed from him in the first case, is th\u00e9 price of such flour <em>at </em>the <em>time and place </em>when and where it was to be delivered; or in the'second, to make up the difference in quality.\u201d In the case of <em>Willings &amp; Francis vs </em>Consequa, 1 <em>Peters\u2019 C. C. Rep. </em>176, the doctrine laid down in the first ease is recognized and adopted. Speaking of the rule in <em>Gil-pins vs Consequa, </em>the Judge says, \u201cwith this rule the court finds no cause to be dissatisfied; and the reason of it is obvious, the contract is to deliver teas of the best quality <em>at Canton; </em>if it be not complied with, the price of such teas, at that place, is the just measure of the damage sustained by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">But it is thought this rule, to ascertain the damages, will not afford to the plaintiff ample justice; he ought also to recover the amount of expenses necessarily incurred in transporting the flour to <em>New-Orleans </em>for inspection. The answer is, such was not the contract. If that had been a stipulation between tfee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>parties, it should be found in the agreement. In its \"absence, this court can only act upon the contract as they find it, and apply to such contract the general established principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The next question is, whether the testimony offered by the plaintiff was admissible for that purpose?</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Through the whole trial of this cause, the court of <em>Baltimore </em>county seems to have acted under the impression that no testimony was admissible to prove the relative price of flour at <em>Zanesville, </em>unless it was direct, positive proof, from a witness, who knew the value <em>at that place) </em>and that in the absence of such positive proof, the jury could not be permitted to establish that fact, by any other testimony! In this, wC think the court erred. The evidence offered is not, as was contended, secondary evidence-. It is of the same grade with that required by the court, although perhaps of a less conclusive character. Where testimony is offered, which of itself shows there is other evidence of a higher character, it is secondary evidence; as in the case of a written agreement-^-the Copy is not admissible, until you first show the original cannot be had; because the copy of itself clearly proves, there is evidence of a higher character, which ought to <em>be </em>produced, unless its absence is accounted for. Not so, where the testimony is of the same grade, although it may not have an equal effect with the jury. The object to be attained in this case, was the relative value of flour at Zanes\u00ab\u25a0 <em>ville, </em>between that delivered, and that contracted for; and this might be proved either by a witness who knew the price of each kind of flour at <em>Zanesville, </em>or by showing the value at different places, by which the jury could judge of its relative value at <em>Zanesville. </em>The testimony, therefore, offered by the plaintiff, of the price of each kind of flour at <em>New-Orleans, Marietta, </em>and other places, was admissible, and ought to have been given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The evidence offered in the <em>fifth </em>bill of exceptions was hears\u00e1y, and, therefore, properly rejected by the court. Some difficulty arises in forming a decision on this exception from the \u25a0 want of care in taking down the evidence. The witness, after stating that \u201che had purchased flour at <em>Zanesville </em>in the spring of 1817, and paid for it from six <em>to </em>eight dollars a <em>barrel, </em>and .that, he had paid for the freight of flour from <em>Zanesville </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>New-Orleans </em>two dollars per barrel,\u201d said, that all the information he had as to the purchases and prices was derived from his brother and partner; hut it is not distinctly mentioned whether the prices spoken of related to the price of flour alone, or was intended to include the price of both flour and freight from <em>Zanesville </em>to <em>New-Orleans. </em>From a comparison of the several parts of the testimony, we are led to the conclusion, that his knowledge of both was derived from the same source. He was not in the <em>Western Country </em>in the spring of 1817, nor did he make the purchases himself, but the whole business was transacted by his brother and partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The court were also right in not receiving the testimony in the <em>sixth </em>bill of exceptions. <em>Maunse.l While, </em>the witness, stated, \u201cthat he was called on in the spring of the year 1817, by <em>Richard Relf, </em>to state the difference usually- allowed on the sale of flour <em>between superfine, fine, common </em>and middling; <em>that he then stated </em>the difference was as follows,\u201d &amp;c. This might be true, and yet he might have no knowledge of the facts. He only swears <em>he made the statement </em>to <em>Relf, </em>hut he does not -swear that statement was true, or that he either then knew, or ever did know, the facts to be as he stated them to <em>Relf</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\"><em>The testimony </em>offered in the <em>seventh </em>bill <em>of </em>exceptions was hearsay, and,, therefore, liable to the same objection with that contained in, the fifth.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">That part of the evidence in the <em>eighth </em>bill of exceptions that relates to the price of flour in <em>New-Orleans </em>in 1817, and that which was offered to prove there was no public inspection at <em>Zanesville, </em>at o-r <em>before </em>the time mentioned, ought to have been received; the residue of the testimony mentioned was properly rejected. The price of flour in 1811 and 1819, could not afford a correct standard to show its value in 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">We concur in the opinions given by the court below, in the <em>first, fifth, </em>sixth, and <em>seventh </em>bills of exceptions, and dissent from those in the <em>second, third, fourth, eighth, </em>and <em>ninth </em>bills of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Dorsey, J. dissented from the opinions of the court below iu the <em>first, third, </em>and <em>fifth </em>bills of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
