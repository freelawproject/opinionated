The defendant then offered in evidence the commission which issued in this cause to <em>Port-au-Prince, </em>on the 10th of April 1823, for the purpose of taking testimony, and documents and translations. The commissioners, by their return to the commission, stated that they had taken the deposition of <em>J.

Griffith. </em>The execution of the commission was admitted, and all errors in the pleadings were waived by consent of the parties. The defendant then prayed the court to instruct the jury, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. Which instruction die Court, <em>[Archer, </em>Ch. J. and <em>Hanson, </em>A. J.] gave to the jury. The plaintiffs excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against them, they appealed to this court.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\">The cause was argued before Buchanan, Ch. J. and Earle, 'Martin, Stephen, and Dorset, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-6\"><em>Gill, </em>for the Appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAL\">contended, 1. That the instruction of the court below was wrong, because the proceedings of the court at <em>Port-au-Prince, </em>set forth in the commission, established that no final judgment had been there rendered; that judgment was manifestly unfit to be adopted as final and conclusive. It did not contain a condemnation of <em>Taylor </em>and <em>M\u2018Neal's </em>funds. It was a mere authority to <em>M, Walker, </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>to pay themselves a debt due from <em>Kramer, </em>out of <em>Taylor </em>and <em>M\u2018Neal's </em>funds in their hands, as far as they <em>(M. W </em>&lt;\u00a7\u2022 <em>Co.) </em>were authorised; and how far they were authorised does not appear. The proceedings leaving the question of authority open, finally settled nothing; short of a final sentence of condemnation the proceedings on attachment were no bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-7\">2. The defence relied on arose from testimony offered by the defendant, he had therefore no right to assume its truth, and require of the court below, <em>an absolute instruction </em>to the jury, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. Where the plaintiff or defendant requires an instruction from the court, oa the testimony of the opposite party, it is like a demurrer to evidence, and admits the truth of the facts offered in proof, and reasonable inferences from them; in such case the instruction maay be positive and conclusive, because, as the court have the facts admitted, the intervention of a jury is unnecessary; but where either prays an instruction <em>on his oibn proof, </em>the instruction, if granted, should be hypothetical, as if the jury believe the testimony; otherwise either party may at pleasure take the question of how far the testimony is true or false, from the Jury. They are the exclusive judges of the credibility of tW <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>evidence. . The theory of our system has been invaded by this instruction; and a question of great importance in every case, was determined in this cause by the wrong tribunal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-5\"><em>3. </em>There was evidence of collusion between the defendants 'and <em>Kramer, </em>from the benefit of which the court below debarred the, plaintiffs by the positive and conclusive instruction given to the jury. The facts established a claim for the plaintiffs; the collusion affects the defence relied on. The sum due from <em>Kramer </em>to <em>M, Walker, </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>was borrowed on the \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d of the former. This appears from the award in the commission. In the proceedings between <em>M, W, &amp; Co. </em>and <em>Kramer, </em>(the former seeking execution of their award against the latter,) this same debt is said to be borrowed by <em>Kramer </em>for <em>Taylor </em>and <em>M\u2018Neal. </em>There is not the slightest evidence to show that if <em>Kramer </em>did in fact borrow any sum for <em>Taylor </em>and <em>M\u2018Neal, </em>that he disbursed it for their account. It does not appear that <em>Kramer </em>was the creditor of <em>Taylor </em>and <em>M\u2018Neal </em>the contrary results from the statement, that he borrowed money for them. It is unaccountable, but on the idea of collusion, that <em>M, W, </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>in endeavouring to enforce an award against <em>Kramer, </em>should suddenly fey a new direction given to the proceedings, obtain judgment, against <em>Taylor </em>and <em>M-Neal, </em>they not being indebted to <em>Kramer. </em>That <em>Kramer </em>was unable to pay, was manifest from all the documents; and this shows the reason of the combination. The evidence sufficiently raises the question of fraud; and it should have been left to the jury. Proceedings in a foreign attachment, though a good bar, must like all other matters be liable to impeachment for fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-6\">4. Foreign laws are to be compared with the original, and sworn to be a true copy. 2 <em>Esp. Dig. </em>439. Here there is no proof that the witness compared the copy. The answer of the witness to the <em>fifth </em>interrogatory is objected to, so far as the witness speaks of a judgment rendered. Foreign judgments are not conclusiye. They may be examined into. <em>Barney vs Patterson\u2019s Lessee, </em>6 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>202, 203. <em>Pawling vs Bird\u2019s Ex\u2019rs. </em>13 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>206. It must be established that the murt had jurisdiction over the case. Where the party to be ^cted by the proceedings is not present, the judgment is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>conclusive, nor is it evidence for any purpose. <em>Buchanan vs Rucker, </em>9 <em>East, </em>191, 192. <em>Owings </em>&amp; <em>Cheston vs Nicholson </em>&amp; <em>Williams, 4 </em>Harr. &amp; <em>Johns. </em>103, argument of Mr. <em>Pinkney. </em>The act of 1813, ch. 164.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-5\"><em>Meredith, </em>for the Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG3\">The rule is well established^ that where funds are attached for the debt of a person, to whom the funds belong, the judgment is a bar. A person having the property of another, and pays it over by compulsion, is exonerated. L<em>e Chevalier vs Lynch, </em>1 <em>Doug. </em>170, <em>Allen vs Dundas, 3 T.

C. 20 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>268. It is admitted that the judgment given in evidence in this ease is properly authenticated. But it has been said that the judgment is examinable for irregularity. It is well settled, that if a foreign judgment comes collaterally as a defence in the cause, it is conclusive and unexaminable. <em>Cas. temp.

There is no difference between a judgment in attachment,, from a judgment in any other case. It may be inquired, 1. Was the court at <em>Port-au-Prince </em>a court of competent jurisdiction? <em>2- </em>Does it judicially condemn the debt, which is the subject of the present action? 3. Is there any evidence of fraud oi collusion as between the defendant and the attaching creditor?</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-6\">1. The law of the place was produced in evidence; and if it was duly approved, it did authorise the proceeding by attachment. It cannot be doubted, but that <em>Kramer </em>was a creditor of the present appellants. Is the law properly proved? This may be done in one of two ways. It may be by an authenticated, or by a sworn eopy. The witness does not say expressly that he examined the law'; but it is to be presumed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>interrogatory propounded, and his answer thereto, that it was a sworn copy. It cannot be doubted but that it, is a sworn copy. If the law is out of the case, there is still sufficient <em>prima facie </em>evidence from the record, to show that the court had jurisdiction.. A want of jurisdiction must be shown by him who contests it. <em>Molony vs Gibbons, </em>2 <em>Campb. </em>502. <em>Shumway vs Tilghman, </em>4 <em>Cowen\u2019s Rep. </em>292. This court will intend that the court of <em>Port-au-Prince </em>had jurisdiction over the subject matter, unless it is shown to be otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-4\">2. What does the judgment condemn? Although the'record has been incorrectly translated, yet shows that <em>Kramer </em>was indebted to the defendant\u2019s house in $797 50, for money, borrowed for the appellants on <em>Kramer\u2019s </em>own responsibility, with a collateral security of debts due to <em>Dennis </em>and <em>Brown. </em>Proceedings were had to enforce payment of <em>Kramer. </em>A reference was made to arbitrators, who awarded that <em>Kramer </em>should pay to the defendant\u2019s house a sum <em>of </em>money. The award was not complied with, and an execution was awarded against <em>Kramer. Kramer </em>then petitioned the court to authorise this debt to be deducted out of the funds in the hands of the. defendant\u2019s hduse, belonging to the appellants; and this the court directed to be done</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-5\">3. No fraud appears in the transaction. Need not show a debt due to the plaintiff in the attachment. <em>M'Daniel vs Hughes, </em>3 <em>East, </em>367. Under our act of 1715, <em>ch. </em>40, a person having funds in his hands belonging to his debtor, may attach the amount in his own hands to pay his own debt. The case at bar is not stronger, nor so strong, of a case of inferred fraud than our own laws sanction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-6\"><em>Moale, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8Z\">A judgment on a foreign attachment is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a debt, when it is to be enforced in this country. But it has been said, that when brought in incidentally it is then conclusive. The plaintiffs were never residents in <em>Port-au-Frince, </em>and had no notice of the proceedings, now attempted to be set up in bar of their action. There is no difference when a foreign judgment is offered as a set-off, and when it is to be enforced. This court did not, in <em>Barney vs Patterson\u2019s Lessee, </em>6 <em>Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>202, say, that a foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>judgment was conclusive when offered by way of set-off. There the judgment was offered in evidence as a link in the chain of the plaintiff\u2019s title. There can be no difference between a foreign judgment to be enforced, and where offered by way of set-off. <em>Owings &amp; Cheston vs Nicholson &amp; Williams, 4 Harr. &amp; Johns. </em>66, where all the parties were before the foreign tribunal, and yet this court decided that the judgment was not conclusive. In all the cases relied on by the counsel for the appellee, the parties affected by the foreign judgment were, or had been resident of the country in Which such judgments were rendered, To make a foreign judgment on attachment, evidence for any purpose, it must appear that the defendant had been a resident or had been summoned. <em>Fisher vs </em>Lane, <em>3 Wils. </em>297. The record offered in evidence in this case does <em>not show </em>that the plaintiffs ever,had been summoned, or had notice, or ever were under the jurisdiction of the court. Nor does it appear that any debt had been proved against them. <em>Buchanan vs Rucker, </em>9 <em>East, </em>194. <em>Borden vs Fitch, Ib Johns. Rep. </em>121, 142, 143. To bind a person by a judgment he must be a party to the proceeding. There is nothing to show in this case that any proceeding was had by <em>Kramer </em>against the plaintiffs, so as to attach the funds of theirs in the hands of the defendant. Nor is there any thing to show that there was any process <em>of attachment against the </em>plaintiffs. <em>The statute law of </em>a <em>foreign </em>country must be proved by a copy, either properly authenticated, or sworn to be true. But the common law may be proved by parol evidence. Here there has been no legal proof of any law,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b509-5\">Buchanan, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAA\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The facts of this case, as set out in the bill of exceptions taken at the trial, are in substance these: <em>F. A. Kramer, </em>upon his own responsibility, borrowed on account of the appellants $797 50, from <em>Montandevert, Walker </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>merchants at <em>Port-au-Prince, </em>who sued and obtained judgment against him for the amount so borrowed. To discharge himself from which, he sued out an attachment against the funds of the appellants, in the hands of <em>Montandevert, Walker 8? Co. </em>consisting of a balance of the proceeds of a shipment of herrings, amounting <em>to </em>$459 71, which he recovered by a judgment of condemnation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>in the civil tribunal sitting at that place. For the amount so Recovered, this suit was brought against the appellee, as surviving partner of the house of <em>Montandevert, Walker &amp; Co. </em>and that recovery is relied upon as a full defence to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"Akj\">No principle is now better established, than that where a; debt has been recovered by attachment in a foreign court, the recovery is a protection to the debtor, as garnishee, against his original creditor. <em>Chevalier vs Lynch, </em>1 <em>Doug. </em>170. <em>Philips vs Hunter, 2 H. Blk. Rep. </em>402. <em>Holmes vs Remsen, </em>4 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>460. S. C. 20 <em>Johns. Rep. 229. Embree &amp; Collins vs Hanna, </em>5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>101, are in point, with many others, proceeding upon the same principle, to which it is unnecessary to refer; and nothing could be more unreasonable and unjust^ than that a person, who has been coerced by the sentence of a Court of competent jurisdiction to pay a debt once, should be compelled to pay it a second time. It would be any thing but right and proper, and therefore not sanctioned <em>in </em>law. It may indeed be said to be hard, that a creditor should lose his money, without having had an opportunity afforded him of being heard, and perhaps in such cases, injustice is frequently done.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">These attachments, however, are resorted to by such as claim t\u00e9 be creditors of those whose funds are sought to be affected; and when in truth they are creditors, no injury is in fact done to those whose debts are attached, being only an application of their funds in that form to the payment of their debts, to which they might be coerced by the attaching creditors in a different-form. It is but the turning over one debt in discharge of another. And in the absence of any proof of fraud or collusion, the presumption is, that what is done is rightly done, and that the claim of the attaching creditor is established to the satisfaction at least of the court, in which the judgment of condemnation is obtained. Injustice may, and is sometimes, but not always done, in that <em>ex parte </em>form of proceeding; hut in th\u00e9 ease of a debtor, it would be extremelv hard, that after having been made to pay the debt, by the authority of a court which * he could- not resist, he should be compelled to pay it over again; and in every such case, where he was not himself tainted with fraud, &amp;c. injustice would be done. And it is not for us <em>to </em>complain of the effects of foreign judgments in attachment on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>rights of creditors here; our own attachment law has the same operation upon the rights of nonresident creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The cases relied upon by the counsel for the appellants, to show that foreign judgments are not conclusive, are chiefly eases in which they were sought to be enforced by suits being brought upon them; and in such cases they certainly are not conclusive. The distinction is between the effect of a foreign judgment, when it is sought to be enforced by the party claiming the benefit of it, by bringing suit upon it, and when it only comes incidentally in question. In the former case it is not conclusive, but <em>prima facie </em>evidence only, and may be impeached for irregularity, and rebutted by other evidence. But in the latter, if it be by a court of competent jurisdiction, it has the force and effect of a domestic judgment, and the correctness of it cannot bo examined into, but it is conclusive. This distinction was fully recognized and adopted in <em>Barney vs Patterson, 6 Harr. &amp; Johns. 183.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In this case the judgment of the civil tribunal at <em>Port-au-Princc, </em>does come incidentally in question, and is only introduced and relied upon by the appellee as a protection against the claim of the appellants, his former creditors, who are seeking to compel him to pay over again a debt, which under process of attachment he has once already been obliged to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The jurisdiction of the civil tribunal at <em>Port-au-Prince </em>is not impeached, and however the fact may have been, there is no evidence in the record of any fraud or collusion having been practised. As far as appears to us, and we cannot look beyond the record, it was the common case of a creditor, attaching the funds of his absent debtor in the hands of a third person, and that is what is done every day in our own courts. And it would be thought very strange, and hard too, by a citizen of this state, if, after being obliged by a judgment in attachment in one of our courts to pay the amount of a debt due from him to a citizen of <em>Virginia, </em>he should on going into that state, be subject to be sued by his original creditor there, and made to pay the same debt over again; and that is exactly what it is sought to make the appellee do in this case, but which the iw will not sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">JUDGMENT AEFXKMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
