On the 8tli of May 1818 \u00e1 writ of <em>scire facias </em>issued, out of <em>Baltimore </em>county \u2022court, on a recognizance of special bail entered into in the usual form in that court at September term 1816, by <em>Joseph </em>Cappeau, (the appellant,) for <em>Charles Cappeau, </em>at the suit of Middle<em>ton </em>and <em>Baker, </em>(the appellees,) in a plea of trespass on the case, &amp;c. by the said <em>Middlet\u00f3n </em>and <em>\u00c9aher </em>against the said <em>Charles Cappeau,\u2022 </em>in the same court prosecuted, &amp;c. The \u2022Writ of <em>scire facias </em>then stated, that in the said court in September 1817, <em>Middleton </em>and <em>Baker </em>recovered judgment against <em>Charles Cappeau </em>for ' the sum of, &amp;c. Nevertheless, the said <em>C. Cappeau </em>the damages, &amp;c. <em>to </em>the said <em>Middleton </em>and <em>Baked </em>had not satisfied, nor his body in execution of such judgment to the public prison of the said county had rendered, &amp;e. Whereiofe the said <em>Middleton </em>and <em>Baker </em>had be\u00e1ought a proper reme'-* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>dy, &amp;.c. Command was therefore given to the sheriff to give notice to <em>Joseph Cappeau, </em>in the usual form of such'Writs of <em>scire facias. </em>The defendant, (the special bail,) appeared, and pleaded, (after praying oyer of the writ of <em>scire facias,) </em>1. <em>Nut tiel record </em>of recognizance. 8. That before the suing out of the writ of <em>scire facias, </em>and before the return of any writ of <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>issued on the said judgment against the said <em>Charles Cappeau, </em>to wit, on, &amp;c. the said <em>Charles </em>died, to wit, at <em>Saint Domingo, </em>&amp;c. To the <em>first </em>plea the plaintiffs replied <em>habetur tale recordum </em>of recognizance, and- issue was joined to the court upon the record. To the <em>second </em>plea the plaintiffs replied, that <em>Charles Cappeau </em>did not die before the return of the writ of <em>capias ad </em>satis<em>faciendum </em>issued against him upon the said judgment; and tendered an issue to the country, which was joined in by the defendant. Upon the first issue, the county court gave judgment for the plaintiffs, that there was such record, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">At the trial of the issue joined on the <em>second </em>plea, the defendant offered in evidence a commission issued out of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, in the usual form, to <em>Robert Lavens </em>and <em>Pelegrin Vidal </em>of <em>Mayaguez, </em>commissioners, for taking the testimony of witnesses in the said action, by them or either of them, &amp;c. Also the translations, (made by consent of the parties,) of certain depositions in the <em>Spanish </em>language, returned with the said commission. It appeared by the return of <em>Robert .Lavens, </em>the commissioner who acted, that he addressed a request to the governor, judge or the proper officer of the place, to cause the commission, which was in <em>JEnglish, </em>to be translated into the <em>Spanish </em>language by the public interpreter of the town of <em>Yagues, </em>where the commissioner resided.' This was complied with. The commissioner then addressed another request to the same person, in which, stating himself to be commissioner, &amp;c. ho requested that he would be pleased to admit a declaration of witnesses, and to bind under oath those whom he the commissioner should present, to answer certain interrogatories which might be propounded according to the usual form. He then set forth the interrogatories. And that these being done, to let a testimony of these proceedings, corroborated by the signature of two or three notaries public, be drawn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>&amp;c, This request was granted, with directions, that all the witnesses presented swear and declare according to the form and manner requested, &amp;c. It was then stated that in the town of <em>Mayaguez, </em>on the 2d of August 1824, \u201cthe party requesting .the declaration, presented as a witness, <em>Joseph Lenner, </em>a resident of this place. The <em>Jllcade </em>took his oath before me, which he performed according to law, and under which promised to tell the truth in every thing which he would be interrogated; and being requested to answer the preceding interrogatories; to the <em>first, </em>he said,\u201d &amp;c, \u201cHe signed it with the <em>Jllcade, </em>before me, I attest, <em>Jlrroyo. </em>(Signed) Jlldiexi. (Signed) <em>Lenner, </em>Before me, (signed) <em>Peter Jlrroyo, </em>Notary Public.\u201d \u201cOn the same day I notified, and delivered these proceedings to the party concerned, which I attested. Signed <em>Arroyo.\u201d </em>The testimony of another witness was taken in a similar manner. The commissioner who acted, then certified to <em>Baltimore </em>county court, that <em>P. Vidal </em>and himself, being charged and named as commissioners, having to take an oath prescribed in the commission, before a person authorised to administer the same, presented themselves to the proper authority for that purpose, and were informed that <em>it was </em>impossible to act eatfra-judicially in this case, so as to effect the commission according to the tenor of the oath. That before they could' cite any witness in this case, it was necessary to make a representation to the judge for permission to have their power translated by a public interpreter, by which he could he instructed with the nature of the commission and according to law exe-. cute the same. That had they, or either of them, being charged simply to take information from persons acquainted in the affairs, it might have been fully and satisfactorily executed; but to have an oath, prescribed by the <em>laws of a </em>court in a foreign country, to be administered and subscribed to by a person <em>in </em>another, was a thing that the judge of that place did not, nor would not understand, though the commissioners explained to him the nature of the commission, and said he would not cite the witnesses, who lived at a distance, except it was notarially and publicly done, &amp;c. The plaintiffs objected to the admission of the said evidence; and insisted that the said depositions ought not to be read in evidence. And the Court <em>\\Jlrcher% </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Ch. J. and <em>Ward, </em>A.

The appellees having sued out a <em>scire facias </em>against the appellant, as special bail of <em>Charles Cappeau, </em>in the usual form, without setting out the issuing and return of <em>ca. sa. </em>the appellant pleaded <em>nul fiel record; </em>and also that his principal died, before any <em>ca. sa. </em>returned. On the <em>first </em>plea an issue was joined, and judgment given thereon by the court against the appellant. The appellees in their replication simply trraversed the fact, alleged in the <em>second </em>plea, (without setting. forth the <em>ca. sa. </em>which had issued and been returned, the time when, &amp;c.) and tendered an issue to the country, in which the appellant joined. The verdict and judgment being rendered against the appellant, he seeks a reversal by this court. <em>First. </em>On the ground that the appellees\u2019 replication to the <em>second </em>plea concludes to the country, instead of concluding with a verification, which it should have done. If this objection were well founded, it cannot avail the appellant here; his remedy should have been by demurrer in the court below;-the defect, if it existed, js cured by verdict. But there is ho such defect as that complained of. The replication contains no new matter, which the appellees had a right to demand an opportunity of answering; but is a direct and naked denial of all the <em>matters </em>contained in the plea, and could technically conclude in no other way than by tendering an issue to the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The <em>second </em>ground of reversal is, that this replication is erroneous in not setting out the <em>ca. </em>sa, with the time of its issuing and return, and that the issue joined upon it is an immaterial issue; and that instead of a final judgment upon the verdict, a repleader should have been awarded. That surely cannot be an immaterial issue which decides the whole matters in controversy between the parties. Such was the issue to which exceptions are now taken. The issue being material, no judgment of repleader could have been given. Admitting, that upon the authority of the case of <em>Fortune vs. Manucaptors of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>Davis, Carth. </em>8, recognised by Justice <em>Sutler </em>in <em>Chandler vs. Roberts and another bail of </em>White, 1 <em>Dougl. 58, </em>the replication ought to have set out the <em>ca. sa. </em>and return, (although a different precedent appears in <em>2 Harr. Ent. </em>472); yet the omission to do so, in the present case, is mere informality in pleading, which is only had on demurrer. But if it be matter of substance, it is remedied by the verdict, which the jury could not possibly have given, unless the issuing and return of the <em>ca. sa. </em>had been in evidence before them. And by this form of the issue, the rights of the appellant, though somewhat modified, in truth sustain no diminution. If the <em>ca. sa, </em>and its return, had been formally stated in the replication, the appellant might, by a plea of <em>nut tiel record, </em>have put their verity <em>to </em>issue before the court. He accomplishes, in effect, the same object, when on the trial he objects to their going in evidence to the jury. The question presented for the decision of the court, becomes in both cases precisely the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The objections to the pleadings being disposed of, it only remains to be inquired, whether the court erred in rejecting the testimony returned with the commission? We think they did. not. The power conferred on a commissioner to take testimony, is strictly personal, and on its faithful execution the most, important interests of the parties may depend. To ensure, such fidelity, oaths, to be taken by the commissioner, and the person by him to be employed as clerk, are ann\u00e9xed to the commission. Especial confidence also is presumed to he reposed in the person appointed. Upon no principle of reason or law, therefore, can the testimony returned with the commission be admissible. The person by whom it was taken held no share in the confidence of the parties or of the court; he; received from them no delegation of authority; and even if he had, having\u2019 failed to take the requisite oath, his proceedings are a .nullity. For this singular attempt to transfer a strictly personal trust, the record in thi,s case furnishes neither solution nor apology.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, <footnotemark><em>(a.)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a.)\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\"><em>) </em>If the government of the place where a commission has issued to take testimony, will not permit it to be executed, the court here will issue <em>Letters Rogatory </em>for the purpose of obtaining testimony.
