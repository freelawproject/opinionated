At the second term thereafter, the landlord of one of the tenants in possession, moved the court to set aside the judgment, &amp;c. A rule was granted; and at the nest term, the county coivt set aside the judgment, awarded restitution as prayed, permitted the landlord to appeal, and ordered the action to be reinstated on the docket, and regular continuances entered therein. At this stage of the proceedings, the plaintiff moved the court for a reconsideration, and to set aside the order for restitution, as unduly obtained. This being refused, the plaintiff <em>appealed </em>\u2014 Held, that the setting aside a judgment against the <em>casual ejector, </em>on the motion of the landlord of the tenant in possession, awarding restitution of the premises, and ordering the action to be tried, is but an interlocutory proceeding,from which an appeal will not lie; and the refusal of the county court to reconsider such proceedings, does not alter the case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-7\">Appeal from <em>Harford </em>County Court. Ejectment for a tract of land called <em>Bupalla, </em>brought on the 18th of August 1823. Copies of the declaration and notice were directed to, and served on, <em>Jibraham Jarrett, Thomas Brown </em>and <em>William Bussell, </em>as tenants in possession of the premises, or of some part thereof, to March term 1824, the copies which were directed to be served to August term 1823, having been returned <em>Tarde. </em>At an adjournment of March term 1824, viz. on the 12th of June 1824, on motion of the plaintiff, a judgment <em>nisi </em>for possession, &amp;c. was entered against the <em>casual ejector\u2014 </em>the tenants, although called for that purpose, not appearing, &amp;c. Writ of possession issued on the 12th of June 1824, and returned by the sheriff to August 1824, \u201cpossession delivered the 14th of June 1824.\u201d At March term 1825, a motion was made to the court by <em>Daniel M. Cooley, </em>(the appellee,) and <em>William Bussell, </em>to strike out the judgment rendered by default, and to permit <em>Cooley, </em>the landlord of <em>Bussell, </em>to appear and defend the action, and to award a writ of restitution. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>motion was accompanied with sundry affidavits. A rule was made on the plaintiff to show cause, during the next term, why the judgment should not be set aside, and <em>Cooley </em>be admitted, to appear and defend the action. At August term 1835, the plaintiff filed certain affidavits; and the court ordered that the judgment rendered against the <em>casual ejector </em>be stricken out, and that the writ of possession, issued thereon, be set aside. The court further ordered, that a writ of restitution be issued to give possession to <em>Cooley </em>of all that part of the land and premises mentioned in the declaration, which was in the month of October 1823, in the possession and occupation of <em>Russell, </em>and which is commonly called <em>Cooley\u2019s Fishery; </em>that the clerk continue the action from June 1824 until the then term, by regular continuances; and that <em>Cooley be </em>admitted to defend the action on the usual terms. <em>Cooley </em>then appeared by his attorney, and entered into the common rule, with leave to ascertain his defence; and the plaintiff filed a new declaration against him, in the usual manner, and <em>Cooley </em>took defence on warrant, and pleaded not guilty, to which issue was joined, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>At the same term, (August 1825,) the plaintiff filed additional affidavits, and moved the court to reconsider the motion on the part of the defendant, and to set aside the order for a writ of restitution, as unduly and unfairly obtained, without apprizing the court of the death of <em>Russell, </em>and of the sale of the interest of <em>Cooley </em>in the premises mentioned, before the said motion was made in his behalf as landlord thereof. The court overruled the motion made by the plaintiff; and he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-5\">Motion by the appellee to dismiss the appeal.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\">This motion was argued before Buchanan, Ch.
