The complainant\u2019s husband lost his money- \u2014 $693.70\u2014in these gambling and wagering contracts, and she filed this bill against the defendants who got the money, within twelve months from the date of the transactions, to recover it from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">\u201c The Chancellor was of opinion and decreed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201c \u2018 It further appears to the Court that the defendants made various wagering contracts in \u201cfutures\u201d with M. C. Dunn, the husband of the complainant, and that said contracts were purely wagering or betting contracts on the rise or fall of the grain, cotton, or stock markets, without any intention on the part of either party to the contracts to handle or deliver any real article.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">\u201c The Chancellor granted a decree in favor of the complainant against the defendants for the money lost and interest \u2014 -$749.20. The decree is clearly correct upon the law and the facts of the case, except the set-off of $178.65 claimed by the defendants, which, we think, should have been allowed. The proof shows that the complainant\u2019s husband, while he was losing his \u2018margins,\u2019 won that amount from the defendants. The defendants\u2019 right to plead the set-off <em>attached </em>when the bill was filed against them, and they were not barred by the ninety days\u2019 limitation, although their answer, claiming the set-off, was not filed within that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\u201c\u2018The bringing of a suit by one party saves from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>the operation of tlie statute all such claims of the defendant as are properly the subject of set-off, and which are in fact pleaded' as a set-off in the action.\u2019 Wood on Lim., 601; 8 Bax., 896; 2 Esp., 569.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201cIt is earnestly insisted, however, that the contracts to buy \u2018futures\u2019 in this case are not within the statute authorizing the losing party to recover hack the money put up and lost \u2018 on margins.\u2019 We think the contracts are, under the proof in this case, within the <em>letter </em>as well as within the <em>evil </em>iutended t\u00f3 be remedied by the statute. ' The facts are, - that when the dealer, M. C. Dunn, concluded upon which side he would put up his margin \u2014 whether he would risk it upon the rise or fall of the article named \u2014 he signed and delivered to the 'defendants a written order to buy or sell the \u25a0 article named upon his account, at the price named, to be delivered at a future day specified, and the defendants, at the s'ame time, delivered to him a written contract that they <em>had bought </em>or <em>had sold </em>the article upon his account, to be <em>delivered </em>at a future day named in the contract. The contract then states the amount of the margin put up, and recites conditions upon which it would be lost and the contract closed. The proof is conclusive that the defendants did not buy or sell the articles named in the contract, and that neither party <em>intended </em>at any time to buy, sell, deliver, or receive the articles specified, but <em>intended </em>simply to settle by the \u2018difference\u2019 in the price of the article in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the market when the contract was made and the price on the day named for delivery. This leaves nothing in the transaction hut a \u2018naked wager\u2019 upon the rise or fall of the article in the market. We think the margins put up under these contracts are as clearly wagers as can be conceived, pernicious in the extreme, and void, .both by statute and public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">\u201cWe have heretofore considered the questions involved in these bucket-shop cases, giving the reasons and citing the authorities for our opinion; but, in deference to the earnest and able argument of the defendants\u2019 counsel in this case, we will again briefly state the ground of our conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">\u201cThe Code, under the general head, \u2018Void Contracts,\u2019 and under the special head, \u2018Gambling and Wagering Contracts,\u2019provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\u201c \u2018 2438. All contracts founded, in whole or in part, on a gambling or wagering consideration shall be void to the extent of such consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">\u201c\u20182439. No money or property of any kind won by any species or mode of gaming shall be recovered by action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">\u201c \u2018 2440. Moreover, any person who has paid any money, or delivered anything of value, lost upon any game or wager may recover such money, thing, or its value, by action commenced within ninety days from the time' of such payment or delivery.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">\u201c\u20185705. All laws made for the prevention, disT couraging, or suppression -of gaming shall be construed as remedial and not as penal statutes, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>no presentment or indictment in such case shall be quashed for want of form.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\u201cBouvier defines a wager as follows: <em>Wager. </em>A bet; a contract by which two parties or more agree that a certain sum of money or other thing shall be paid or delivered to one of them on the happening or not happening of an uncertain event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">' \u201c The whole current of authority now is that contracts just such as these in this record, under the same state of facts, are gambling and wagering contracts, and void, both by statute and public policy. We have no doubt whatever that the Legislature, in enacting the chapter in the Code entitled \u2018Void Contracts,\u2019 intended to declare all contracts and transactions of the character of those in this record \u2018gambling and wagering contracts,\u2019 and intended to empower the losing party, his wife or creditor, to recover the money thus lost from the other party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">\u201c The construction of the penal statute against gaming' \u2014 Code, \u00a7 5688 \u2014 using the words, \u2018play at any game of hazard or address,\u2019 and the cases defining gaming under that statute, have no application to the questions in this case. The chapter of the Code above recited, over the head of \u2018 Gaming and Wagering Contracts,\u2019 was simply intended to provide a remedy for the losing party in all contracts, void as gaming or wagering contracts, to recover back the money thus lost. We will cite some of the cases and authorities which we have considered, and which sustain our conclusion upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the questions in this case: <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Thruston, </em>3 Lea, 740; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Willar, </em>110 D. S., 499, 508; <em>Dickson </em>v. Thomas, 97 Pa., 278; <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Culbertson, </em>83 Ill., 33; <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Backhaus, </em>52 Wis., 593; <em>Story </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>71 N. Y., 420; <em>Love </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>114 Mass., 80; Dos Passos on Stock Brokers, 410, 477; 2 Benj. on Sales, 714.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">\u201cMr. Justice Matthews, delivering the opinion of the Court in <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Willar, </em>above cited, says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqo\">\u201c\u2018 The generally accepted doctrine in this country is, as stated by Mr. Benjamin, that a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered at a future day is valid, even though the seller has not the goods, nor any other means of getting them than to go into the market and buy them; but such a contract is only valid when the parties really intend and agree that the goods are to be delivered by the seller and the price to be paid by the buyer; and if, under the guise of such a contract, the real intent be merely to speculate in the rise or fall of prices, and the goods are not to be delivered, but one party is to pay the other the difference between the contract price and the market price of the goods at the date fixed for executing the contract, then the whole transaction constitutes nothing more than a wuiger, and is null and void.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7nt\">\u201cThe English statute, 8 and 9 Vict., Ch. 109, Sec. 18, is similar to ours, using the words: \u2018Contracts by way of gaming or wageriug shall be null and void,\u2019 and the courts there uniformly hold that contracts like .these in this record are within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the statute. <em>Grizewood </em>v. <em>Blane, </em>11 C. B., 526, was an action on a contract for the future delivery of railway shares, and Jervis, C. J., left it to the jury to say what was the plaintiff\u2019s intention and what was the defendant\u2019s intention at the time of making the contracts \u2014 -\u2018whether either party really meant to purchase or sell the shares in question, telling them if they did not the contract was, in his opinion, a gambling transaction and void.\u2019 The ruling was held to be correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">\u201cBut certainly we need not multiply authorities upon the question. The statute is plain, and the evil to be suppressed is rank, and is corrupting the morals of the land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">\u201cThe charter of incorporation does not cover these transactions, and the defendants must be held liable individually as confederates in unlawful transactions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">\u201cWe recommend that the Chancellor\u2019s decree, modified as above indicated, be affirmed, but the complainant should pay the cost of the appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">\u201c Caldwell and Eakin, B,.\u2019s concur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">The defendants filed five exceptions to the report :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\"><em>\u201cFirst </em>\u2014 Because the Court failed to report that the alleged-contracts were made upon the rise and fall of the New York and Chicago markets, and that the defendants or complainant had no control over the said markets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">The repoi\u2019t does fail as assumed in this exception; but that is wholly immaterial. That the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>tracts of tlie parties were made with reference to markets in other cities, and beyond their control, cannot affect the validity or invalidity of those contracts and the liabilities flowing therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><em>\u201cSecond </em>\u2014 Because the Court failed to report that the defendant is an incorporated company,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The bill is not filed against \u201can' incorporated company,\u201d and no such creature is before the Court as a defendant. Certain individuals are sued as persons \u201ctrading under the name of the \u2018Tennessee Brokerage Association,\u2019\u201d but no effort is made to sue a corporation. The persons sued answer jointly as individuals, making no reference to \u201can incorporated company.\u201d The bill of exceptions recites that it was agreed by counsel \u201cthat the charter of the \u2018Tennessee Brokerage Association\u2019 be read as evidence;\u201d but no such charter appears in the transcript. The bill of exceptions paranthctically states: \u201cThis charter referred to was never filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">\u201c <em>Third </em>\u2014 Because they do not report that said transactions * * . * were legitimate, and not gambling or wagering transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">The report states the facts of the case correctly with reference to the transactions mentioned therein, and properly applies the law to them. That neither party <em>intended, </em>to buy or sell <em>real </em>products, and that both parties intended, at the- time of making the several contracts, to close them by a <em>settlement of differences merely, </em>is well established by the proof; and the authorities cited sustain the proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>that such contracts arc gambling or wagering, and, therefore, illegal and void. In accord is the late case of <em>Beadles </em>v. <em>Owenby, </em>16 Lea, 424; also <em>Fortenburg </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 S. W. R., 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The fourth and fifth exceptions are that such contracts are reported to be \u201cwithin the meaning \u25a0of \u00a7 2440 of New Code,\u201d when the contrary should have been reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Upon this point the report sustains itself, and we need add nothing to it. The same construction is given in an opinion delivered to-day by Judge Snodgrass in <em>McGrew </em>v. <em>Produce Exchange.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The Commission cited no authority for its holding, at the conclusion of the report, that \u201cthe defendants must be held liable individually as confederates in unlawful transactions.\u201d Nevertheless, that proposition of law is sustained by authority, both in cases of criminal and in cases of civil liability. Judge Catron said, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">\u201cIt is insisted that those who encourage and promote gaming\u2019 are not subject to indictment by the Act of 1803. This is clearly a mistake, for two reasons. Let us. put a case: Say four persons sit down to play loo; one of the parties bets nothing himself, but plays for another. Here he who plays encourages the match without betting. To adopt the construction contended for, neither is indictable. Still, in point of fact, they are both guilty of gaming. In offenses inferior to felony, there are no accessories; all concerned in their commission are principals.\u201d 2 Yerg., 273.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>This language is quoted and approved in <em>Howlett </em>v. State, 5 Yerg., 158, for the purpose of holding one who did not bet himself, but played cards with others whom he knew to be betting, guilty of encouraging and promoting gaming.</p>\n<p id=\"AYZ\">In <em>Lear et al. </em>v. McMillen, 17 Ohio St., 469, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">\u201cIf the plaintiffs in error were in fact engaged in maintaining and carrying on an illegal business of gaming, it is not for <em>them </em>to set up the illegality of the business or of the contract between them to defeat their joint liability. It is a well-known rule of law \u00bfthat when an illegal <em>conspiracy </em>is proven, the acts of each conspirator are held as the acts of all. It is true their illegal contract is not binding <em>between </em>them, but it is binding <em>upon </em>them. It gives no legal rights, but it imposes upon them legal <em>liabilities. </em>Having established their <em>joint </em>proprietorship, the defendant in error, <em>by proving the receipt of money by one, proved its receipt by all, and entitled himself to a joint recovery against all. </em>The real \u2018winners\u2019 of the money are the proprietors of the business, who, by the terms of the contract between them \u2014 no matter if it he an illegal contract \u2014 are to furnish the funds, pay the losses, and receive the winnings. The dealer is their agent, and they are estopped from denying his power to bind them. Ilis winnings arc their winnings, and his receipt of money won is their receipt. Any other construction of the law would render it uttcr-ly ineffective. It would only be nee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>essary to put forward an irresponsible \u2018dealer\u2019 in order that the real gamblers, who grow rich by his winnings, might evade the law. This would be to hold the nominal party and let the real party escape \u2014 to convict the \u2018dealer\u2019 and acquit the <em>double dealer. </em>It would be of little avail to set aside the \u2018game\u2019 by which the plaintiff has been defrauded of his money, and allow him to recover it back, and yet allow the <em>deeper </em>game, by which the law itself is to be defrauded of its purpose, to have its intended effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">It cannot be seriously controverted, in the face of this record, that the defendants were, having the business, detailed in the report, conducted for their benefit. That such was the fact is not denied by any exception to the report;- nor could it have been successfully denied by exception or otherwise. That they did not make the contracts themselves in person with Dunn is of no importance. The acts of one Herndon, whom they put forth for that purpose, were their acts, for which they are individually and joifitly liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The bill is in time as to all of the items allowed by the Chancellor, though such items were not lost within \u201cninety days\u201d next before the filing of the bills. This is the suit of the wife, by next friend, to recover money lost by her husband. It is only the <em>party losing the money </em>who must sue \u25a0 within \u201cninety days;\u201d but suit by, or on behalf of, the wife is not barred if brought \u201cafter the expiration of the ninety days, and within twelve months thereafter.\u201d New Code, \u00a7 2441.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Tbe Chancellor improperly refused, and the Commission properly allowed, the defendants the set-off claimed by them. The reason and authority for its holding are stated in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">All exceptions are overruled, the report is confirmed, and decree of the Chancello! is modified accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
