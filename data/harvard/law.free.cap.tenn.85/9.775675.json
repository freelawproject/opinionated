For that whereas, heretofore, to-wit, on the 14th day of April, 1883, defendant was, and hitherto hath been, and still is, operating, managing, and controlling a certain line of railway between Knoxville, Tenn., and the Kentucky State line, having under its care, direction, control, and management divers engines and cars, and in its employ divers and many servants; and on the day and year aforesaid, at, to-wit, on the line of said railway, in the county of Knox, and State aforesaid, defendant wrongfully and negligently run its engine and cars in, upon, and against <em>W. </em>C.

C. Pratt, husband of plaintiff, whereby, and on account of which, the said W. C. Pratt was wounded, bruised, and mangled in body, head, arms, and legs, thereby causing great mental and physical pain and suffering. ***** By reason of the wounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>and bruises aforesaid, wrongfully and negligently inflicted as aforesaid, the said \"W\". 0. Pratt then and there died.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">No reference was made to the statute, either by averments that the provisions of the Code, \u00a7 1298, were not complied with, or by statement of facts so showing, and defendant, therefore, insisted that evidence that these provisions were not complied with was irrelevant and incompetent, except so far as it might indicate negligence independent of the statute, and the Court was asked to charge the jury as follows: \u201cTli\u00e9 declaration in this case is what is called a common law declaration. It does not profess to be based upon a violation of the statutes of Tennessee enacted to prevent accidents upon railroads. I, therefore, instruct you that the liability of the defendant, if any exists, does not depend upon whether or not it complied with the provisions of the Code in this regard. All evidence going to show whether or not there was a lookout ahead, or whether or not the whistle was sounded or brakes put down, can only be looked to for the purpose of determining whether or not defendant was guilty of negligence outside and independent of the statute,\u201d etc. ITis refusal t\u00f3 do so was the principal error assigned, elaborately argued, and carefully considered on the hearing before us, and now repeated in the petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">The counsel for plaintiff in error assumes that the precautions made necessary to be obseiwod by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u00a7 1298 of the Code, create duties that would not have devolved upon the servants of the railroad companies when any person, animal, or other obstructions appeared upon their roads, and that the provision of \u00a7 1299, that \u201c every railroad company which fails to observe these precautions, or cause them to be observed by its agents or servants, shall be responsible for all damages done to persoir or property on its road,\u201d makes the company liable for the \u201cstatutory negligence\u201d of the preceding section, while there exists still, outside of the statute, a \u201ccommon law negligence,\u201d in suits on account of which a different case must be made than is required in an action for injuries resulting from the negligence of the servants of the railroad company, where the statutory precautions were not observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">This is an erroneous view of the law. The section under consideration (\u00a7 1298) provides that \u201c every railroad company shall keep the engineer, fireman, or some other person upon the locomotive always upon the lookout ahead, and when any person, animal, or other obstruction appears upon the road, the alarm whistle shall be sounded, the brakes put down, and every possible means employed to stop the train and prevent an accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">This section imposes no duty on the railroad companies that would not have existed at common law \u2014 the duty to keep some one on the lookout, sound the alarm whistle when any person, animal, or other obstruction appears on their road, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>put down brakes and use every possible means employed for such purpose to stop the train and prevent an accident \u2014 is but, in other words, the duty to watch the road, warn any one who appears on it to got off by such noise of alarm as will most effectually do this, and at the same time give notice to the servants employed on the train to expect, and aid in the effort to avoid running over the obstruction, and then try to stop and prevent the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Without the statute it would have been the duty of the .road to do each of the things enumerated, and it is only in the matter of watching and warning and trying to stop that the three specific, simple, and obvious precautions to be taken are specified. As the failure to observe any one of these would have been negligence before, and as the statute provides, in addition, that the companies shall employ <em>every possible means </em>to stop their trains and prevent accidents, this covers any and all other acts of negligence, and does not create any new form of it which may be distinguished from another by the term \u201cstatutory,\u201d or leave out any which might be classified as common law negligence. The statute has been repeatedly held by this Court to be but declaratory of the common law. <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Memphis &amp; Ohio Railroad </em>Company, 1 Cold., 75-6; <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Mary Connor, </em>9 Heis., 21; <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Louisville Nashville Railroad Company, </em>7 Heis., 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>It follows, therefore, that if an injury to a person occurs while he is on the road of the company, through any negligence of its officers and servants, it is now statutory negligence, or negligence against which the statute, as well as the common law, provides; and a declaration, as in the present case, that the -servants of the company wrongfully and negligently run its train over such person, gives notice that it was contrary to the statute, and imposes no hardship on defendant in requiring that it come and defend, by showing, in accordance with the same statute, that it observed these precautions, and is therefore not li-. able.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Such declaration does not, as assumed by counsel, require defendant \u201cto prepare itself to defend against either or any form of negligence,\u201d \u201ccommon law\u201d and \u201cstatutory,\u201d because these are but different terms to describe the same thing. It gives notice that defendant has been guilty of negligence, and requires it to come prepared <em>tcf </em>show that it had neither done, nor omitted to do, any act which the law now and before the statute made negligence. '</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The petition is therefore dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
