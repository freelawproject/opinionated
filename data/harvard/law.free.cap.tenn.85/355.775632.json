Car &amp; Nicholson, pages 594-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The same direction to the commissioner for certificate under \u201chand and seal,\u201d and the same attestation of the commissioner \u2014 \u201cwitness my hand and seal\u201d \u2014 in the certificate is contained in the Code; but the appended [seal] in the original form is omitted; and in view of the fact that the Justice has no seal of office, and private seals, except of corporations, are abolished (ohl Code, \u00a7 1804), it is no longer essential to add to the official signature any seal, and the certificate is valid without it. Such omission from the statutory form referred to was probably intended so to indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Nor is the acknowledgment void because taken on Sunday. We are referred to a Wisconsin case assumed by counsel to decide the contrary\u2014 <em>Deforth </em>v. <em>W. &amp; M. R. R. Co., </em>52 Wis., 320. Whatever may have been the holding in Wiscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>sin upon a statute making it unlawful \u201cto do any manner of labor, business, or work, except only works of necessity or charity,\u2019\u2019 on Sunday, or in. any other State, upon statutes unlike our own, as was this one, or upon statutes similar to ours, our Court has held that a contract executed on Sunday was not void for that reason alone; and we have likewise held that a writ issued on Sunday was not void; and we hold in this case that the acknowledgment of Mrs. Larkin was not void because taken on Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The decree is affirmed with cost.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
