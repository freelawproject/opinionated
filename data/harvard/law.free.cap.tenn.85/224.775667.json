G. Houston &amp; Co. and others, but amended so as to. make the \u201cothers\u201d complainants. The bill alleges that the complainant, the Lookout Mountain Company, was a corporation authorized to build and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>operate a railroad between Chattanooga, Tenn., and Rome, G-a.; that on the 2d March, 1880, it had entered into a written contract with J. C. Stanton &amp; Co., a firm of railroad contractors, for the building of said road, and the contract is in writing, and exhibited with the bill, showing, among other things, that Stanton &amp; Co. were to receive $8,000 per mile in stock, and $15,000 per mile in first mortgage bonds of said company; that subsequently \u2014 to-wit, on the 11th day of May, 1880\u2014 the defendants, R. G-. Houston &amp; Co., being- desirous of obtaining the contract, proposed to the railroad and to Stanton &amp; Co. that the latter surrender their contract, and that the railroad company enter into contract with them to build the road, on the terms stipulated in a written contract then present and exhibited, which proposition was accepted, provided the defendants, Houston &amp; Co., would agree to pay all debts contracted and outstanding due by the railroad -company and by J. C. Stanton &amp; Co.; to - all of which Houston &amp; Co. then and there agreed: Thereupon the contract for building the railroad was executed as drawn' and presented by Houston &amp; Co., which is exhibited with the bill, from which it appears, among other things, that Houston &amp; Co. were to receive $8,000 per mile in stock, and $22,000 per mile in first mortgage bonds. The names of the creditors and the amounts of the debts thus promised to be paid by Houston &amp; Co. in consideration of their being let into this railroad contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ar\u00e9 set out in the bill. The bill then seeks, on behalf of such creditors, to collect the amount of said debts from Houston &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Houston &amp; Co. interpose a demurrer upon several grounds, the only one of which that .was pressed in the court below or in this Court is that the bill shows a promise, not in writing, to pay the debt of another, and, as such, is void under the statute of frauds and perjuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The demurrer was sustained by the Chancellor, and complainants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In this we think there is manifest error. The veihal promise or agreement by Houston <em>&amp; </em>Co. to pay these debts was the consideration for which Stanton &amp; Co. surrendered their contract, and for which the railroad company canceled that conti'act and entered into a less advantageous one with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The contract of Houston &amp; Co. to pay such debts is \u201c a new and original undertaking,\u201d upon a valid consideration passing at the time, and does not fall within the statute. <em>Moore Miller </em>v. <em>Stovall, 2 </em>Lea, 543, overruling <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Findley, </em>3 Hum., 330.
