If so, in every case there would have to be a description of the property and privy examination. That privy examination is not necessary is expressly determined in <em>Menees </em>v. <em>John</em>son, 12 Lea; and again in <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>1 Pickle, p. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">In the latter case Judge Caldwell, speaking for the Court, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-10\">\u201cAny contract which will authorize a court of equity to subject her separate <em>personal </em>property will warrant the subjection of her <em>lands </em>held to the same uses, and a privy examination or authentication for registration is no more necessary in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>one case than in the other, and is not required in either.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In that case the charge was stipulated in the face of the note, but for goods furnished some time before the execution thereof, with no description of the property and no acknowledgment, which facts were deemed unimportant to the conclusions there reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>Cr. &amp; Ph., 48, 54, Lord Cottenham says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\u201c The mistaken notion that the wife\u2019s contract creates an equitable <em>lien </em>or distinct charge upon her separate property is to be found in some of the American decisions, but is wholly rejected by others. This notion is utterly inconsistent with the well-settled rules concerning the extent of the liability and its enforcement. If there were a lien, it would follow the property into the hands of purchasers with notice from the wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Again he says, in the same case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">\u201cThe view taken of the matter by Lord Thurlow in <em>Hulme </em>v. <em>Tenant </em>is correct. According to that view, the separate property of a married woman being a creature of equity, it follows that, if she has the power to deal with it, she has the other power incident to property in general \u2014 the power of contracting debts to be paid out of it; and inasmuch as her creditors have not the means at law of compelling payment of those debts, a court of equity takes upon itself to give effect to them, not as personal liabilities, hut by laying hold of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the separate property as the only means by which they can be satisfied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">What has been so often said in the books about the exclusion of parol proof of an agreement or undertaking to charge a married woman\u2019s separate estate will be found to rest entirely upon one or the other of two grounds, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\"><em>First </em>\u2014 Where the <em>evidence of the debt </em>or contract was itself in writing. Of course, in such cases, to admit parol proof to show an agreement or engagement that the separate estate was to be charged with the debt or contract would contravene the elementary rule of evidence, which excludes parol proof offered to alter or enlarge the writing entered into by the parties. Such were the cases of <em>Ragsdale </em>v. Gossett, 2 Lea, 736; and <em>Jordan </em>v. Feeble, 1 Pickle, p. 412, and others that might be cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\"><em>Second </em>\u2014 Where the instrument creating the separate estate, in terms or by necessary implication, limits the <em>power </em>of disposition in such manner as to negative the idea of a parol charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The restraint upon anticipation, when inserted in the instrument creating the separate estate, applies to the wife\u2019s contracts, or, more properly speaking, <em>engagements, </em>as well as to her <em>alienations. </em>The separate property, therefore, which she holds subject to the restraint upon alienation or anticipation, is not liable for any contracts or engagements which she may make. 3 Pomeroy\u2019s Eq., Section 1123; <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Fitzgibbon, </em>L. R., 17 Ch. L., 454, 459, 462, 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>We do not believe any case can be found in our State where parol proof has been rejected or held insufficient that is not bottomed on one or the other of the propositions just stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">We conclude, therefore, -that all that is necessary to charge the separate estate of a married woman with her engagements, whether oral or written, is that there must be an express promise or engagement to create such charge, and that the method in which such engagement is expressed or created must be within the express or necessarily implied <em>powers </em>of the instrument creating the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In the case at bar the express parol contract or agreement to charge her estate is explicit in its terms, and clearly proven. And there is nothing in the terms of the instrument creating the separate estate which imposes, directly or indirectly, any restriction upon the power or manner of disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The instrument creating the separate estate embraced both personal and real property, both of which were in being at the time the contract or engagement was made, and both alike referred to in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">As we have seen, there was no <em>lien </em>upon either, nothing to prevent the married woman from subsequently incumbering either or both, or from disposing of any part or all of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The realty alone remains, or at least is alone sought to be subjected here. Whatever poi^ion of the property that remains,- real or personal, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>she held at the time of entering into the engagement, and is included in the bill as filed (and not the married woman, nor any particular piece of her separate estate), <em>is the debtor </em>in. the equity proceedings to subject the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">That she may be overreached by false swearing of the pai\u2019ty with whom she trades is no sufficient objection to holding a manned woman\u2019s separate property bound. In this respect her <em>property </em>is in no more jeopardy than is the property and <em>life </em>of men, nor of woxnexx (if sex is to be coxxsidered), who are <em>femme sole, </em>holdixig a gexieral estate. The latter are as liable to be made the victims of pexjury as the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">This is inherent ixx the administration of jxxstice, and the danger is more imagixiary thaxx 1 real; for, with an opportunity of beixig a witxxess ixi reply, with all the varied tests of truth to be applied under the rules of evidence axxd of practice, the danger suggested is reduced to a nxixxixnum, and is shared ixi by all ixi every relatioxx of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Again, where is the warraxit of law for demandixxg that such engagenxents as we are xxow considering shall be in writing? For the courts to require it now would seem very like an oncroachmeixt upoxx the province of the Legislatxxre.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Her undertaking is a contract only <em>sub modo; </em>it is only an equitable obligatioxx, which counts of equity enforce alone against her property; and the courts which <em>enforce </em>will be as careful to <em>protect.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\"><em>We </em>are unable to discover any rule of law or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>any considerations of public policy that would require a <em>higher order of evidence </em>to charge the <em>property </em>of a married woman than is sufficient to bind the person and the property of an unmarried woman, husband\u2019s influence and domination out of the way. Indeed, she is an unmarried woman as to her separate property in the character of cases we are considering.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">\"We have examined Mr. Pomeroy\u2019s excellent work on equity jurisprudence, and in his very full discussion of the subject of charging the separate estate of married women we find nothing militating against the views here expressed, while in Bispham\u2019s Principles of Equity, Section 102, we find this language in reference thereto:</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">\u201c This liability was at first supposed. to exist only when the <em>femme </em>had executed some obligation under seal; but the courts have now reached the conclusion that the same liability exists in respect of a mere verbal engagement.\u201d Citing in note <em>Pickard </em>v. <em>Hine, </em>L. R., 5 Chan., 274; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>3 DeG., F. &amp; J., 494; <em>London Bank of Australia </em>v. <em>Lempiere, </em>4 Priv. Coun.

R., 2 Eq., 182, which cases we have not now the means of examining,. 'but doubt not they will be found to sustain the text of the learned author.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Let the decree be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b687-8\">Turney, C.
