W. M. Bradeord, Oh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-15\">E. H. Bunn died, testate, in 1863, leaving a widow and five children. Pie owned 600 to 800 acres of land, which he devised to his widow and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>children by a clause in his will, set out in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">In 1868, complainant, Charles Owens, married Texas, a daughter of the testator. She died in 1869, leaving one child, T. C. Owens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">The bill was filed in 1881, by Charles Owens, against the widow and children of testator, and said T. 0. Owens, to have said will construed, averring that his wife, Texas, took an undivided one-fifth thereunder in the lands devised, and that he was entitled, as tenant, by the courtesy to her interest therein, and to rents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\">Testator\u2019s widow, to whom dower in said lands had been assigned, died pending this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">By way of defense for T. C. Owens, who was a minor, it was insisted and proven that complainant had never set up any claim to his wife\u2019s lands prior to filing his bill; that he had always claimed, and treated it, and received rents therefrom, as the guardian of said T. C. Owens. Complainant\u2019s bill was dismissed, and he appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b152-9\"><em>W. </em>L.

LI. Dunn, probated in 1865.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">\u201cIt is my will that my property be kept together, under the direction of my wife, and executors, A. P. Bradford and N. B. Dunn, and that my children be as thoroughly educated as circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>stances will admit of, and as they marry off, give each a decent outfit, which shall be equal, and at the death of my beloved wife, the property to be equally divided between my children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">We are of opinion that the \u201cclass doctrine\u201d does not apply to this case, but that under this will there was a vested interest, passing to the children of testator at the time of his death, and that upon the death of the daughter, Texas, the wife of complainant, her interest went to her only child, the minor defendant herein, under the statutes of descent and distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">While we have had the benefit of very learned arguments, involving the consideration of the numerous decisions in this State on this question, we quite agree with the' Court in the case of <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Walch, </em>3 Head, 492, that \u201cthere has been enough written in our cases upon that doctrine, and it is only necessaiy to apply the. principles settled upon it, to new cases as they mayN arise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">We do not think it important to determine whether, under the will, Texas was seized of such an estate during the life of the widow of testator (who died pending the suit in this Court), as would entitle her husband to an estate by the curtesy at her death, which occurred in 1869, for the reason that he will not be heard to assert such right, if it ever existed, after the long delay in setting up same, and which delay is wholly unexplained.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Especially is lie to be repelled from a court of equity after his participation and continued acquiescence in the family settlement had in 1875, wherein the share of his deceased wife was allotted to his infant son, and which share complainant took possession of as guardian for his said son.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The bill must be dismissed at complainant\u2019s cost.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
