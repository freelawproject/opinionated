L. Saul, Jr., one of said firm of S. L. Saul &amp; Co., * * * with the evil intent to de\u2022fraud this respondent,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Iii conclusion, respondent states that it is not sufficiently advised to make answer \u201c concerning contracts of insurance made by the <em>assignors </em>of complainants\u201d with other insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The policy sued upon, with the assignment thereof to complainants indorsed upon its back in due form, and signed by Saul &amp; Co., was made a part of the bill, and is in the record; but the general assignment was not produced, and is not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The Chancellor heard the cause upon pleadings and the policy of insurance, and, being of the opinion that complainants had failed to show title to- the policy, he dismissed the bill. Thereupon complainants brought the cause to this Court by writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The Honorable Commission of Referees heard the cause, and recomended an affirmance of the decree, upon the ground that complainants failed to establish their title to the policy. Complainants except to the report, and insist that their title to the policy is sufficiently made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">We think the decree and the report are both erroneous. The bill distinctly alleges the transfer of the policy to complainants by general assignment, and also by indorsement on the back of the policy itself, and the policy is filed with the bill as a part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The answer does not deny or admit the assignment in express words, but it does, in its tenor, concede the assignment. It says -that respondent \u201cknows nothing and admits nothing * * * as to the <em>terms </em>of the assignment,\u201d but \u201cpresumes the instrument itself will be the best evidence of its con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tents,\u201d thus recognizing the existence of the assignment itself, but- admitting nothing as to <em>its terms, </em>which are not known to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">This is not all. In two distinct paragraphs occurring subsequently in the answer, the respondent refers to Saul <em>&amp; Go., </em>the assured, as the \u201c assignors\u201d of complainants \u2014 not as the <em>alleged assignors </em>or the supposed assignors, but as in fact <em>the assignors of the policy to complainants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AA0\">Then, the least that can be said of the answer on this point is that it impliedly admits the assignment, and concedes complainants to be the owners of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">After this implied admission and this concession, the right of complainants to recover upon the policy is denied, on the ground that the policy was avoided by the fraud of one of the assured in burning the goods himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The bill seeks a reference to ascertain the value of the goods destroyed and the proportionate part of the loss to be borne by the policy sued upon, there being concurrent policies in other companies upon the same goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">The report of the Honorable Commission of Referees will be set aside, the decree of the Chancellor reversed, and the cause remanded for an account and further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Respondent will pay the costs of this Court,.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
