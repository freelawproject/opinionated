Foust was presented in the Circuit Court of Macon County for carrying arms. He pleaded (1) not guilty, (2) former conviction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">The plea of former conviction was regular in form, and was supported by a copy of the record on which it was based. This record disclosed a regular proceeding before a Justice of the Peace, under which Foust was arrested for carrying arms, plead guilty, was fined $50, paid the fine and costs, and was discharged. The plea averred that the offense punished by the Justice and that charged in the presentment were the same. On motion of the Attorney-General this plea was stricken out, on the ground that the offense of carrying arms not being within the \u201csmall offense\u201d jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace, the proceedings were void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-9\">Foust was then tried upon his plea of not guilty, convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of $50, and undergo a term of imprisonment. He appealed to this Court. The' only error assigned is the action of the lower court striking out the plea of former conviction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-10\">J. L. Roark and T.
