We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court on the defendant\u2019s cross appeal. This renders the plaintiff\u2019s appeal moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The relevant facts are as follows. On September 11, 1980, the plaintiff, while employed as a trash collector<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for the city, suffered a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder. On January 30,1981, the plaintiff underwent surgery on his shoulder. The plaintiff did not return to work after his injury, although he did remain on the payroll and received his full salary. When the shoulder failed to improve significantly, the plaintiff underwent a second operation on November 30,1981. On the same day, the defendant sent the plaintiff a letter that his employment was terminated because \u201c[t]he letter of prognosis [from the plaintiff\u2019s doctor, John Carino] . . . states that you will not be able to return to work for an unestimated period of time . . . and does not anticipate that you will be returning to your regular occupation for a prolonged period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On December 7,1981, the plaintiff filed a grievance with his union, Teamster Local Union No. 145 (union), seeking to be restored to his position as a laborer. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>that same day, the union business agent, Dominic Lamberti, and the sanitation department shop steward, Jimmy Bolanis, met with the deputy commissioner of the defendant\u2019s department of public works, John Canavan, for forty-five minutes to discuss the plaintiff\u2019s grievance. At that meeting Canavan produced the plaintiff\u2019s absenteeism record<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and stated \u201c[w]e can\u2019t tolerate this kind of performance because he is more out than he is in.\u201d Lamberti explained that many of those absences were due to injury and were not the plaintiff\u2019s fault, but Canavan refused to reinstate the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Lamberti then made an appointment to discuss the plaintiff\u2019s grievance with the commissioner of the department of public works, Bruce Spaulding, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A meeting was held on December 10, 1981, and in attendance were Spaulding, Lamberti, Canavan, Bolanis and Vincent Capoccitti, a union representative. The commissioner produced letters from Carino, stating that the plaintiff would not be able to work for a \u201cprolonged\u201d and \u201cunestimated\u201d period of time. Despite the urgings of Lamberti, Bolanis and Capoccitti to the commissioner to reinstate the plaintiff, the commissioner denied the plaintiff\u2019s grievance. The union thereafter refused to pursue the plaintiff\u2019s grievance before the Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>cut board of mediation and arbitration because, in the union\u2019s view, the plaintiff\u2019s case was too weak. Lamberti, a union representative with eighteen years of experience, testified that he had handled over 150 grievances prior to December 10,1981, and that he did not \u201cthink . . . [he had] a . . . chance to win this case.\u201d The plaintiff, through counsel, made numerous attempts to secure a hearing with the defendant but all requests were denied because the union was the exclusive bargaining agent for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The plaintiff brought the present action by filing a complaint in the Superior Court on August 31, 1982. The first count of a subsequent amended complaint alleged that the defendant had violated the plaintiff\u2019s right to procedural due process by failing to afford the plaintiff a hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On August 29,1988, after a court trial, the court, <em>Cioffi, J., </em>concluded that the first count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint stated \u201ca cause of action sounding in violations of both federal and state constitutional rights embodied in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>court held that pursuant to <em>Cleveland Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985), the plaintiff, having a property interest in his employment, was entitled to a pretermination hearing. The court further held that since the defendant'failed to provide the plaintiff with a pretermination hearing, it was required to provide the plaintiff with a posttermination hearing. The court concluded that the December 7 and 10 meetings between the union and city officials \u201cdid not comport with the requirements of a post-termination hearing because those hearings with Mr. Canavan and/or Commissioner Spaulding were not before a neutral and unbiased decisionmaker.\u201d The court <em>also </em>concluded that the arbitration hearing held in 1987; see footnote 9, supra; was not a constitutionally sufficient posttermination hearing because it did not \u201ctake place within a meaningful time after the termination.\u201d Based on those conclusions, the court awarded the plaintiff $41,084.44 in compensatory damages and $47,085.50 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The court dismissed the remaining counts as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case with direction to render judgment for the defendant. The Appellate Court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint did not state a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 because the complaint did not allege that the deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s due process right \u201coccurred through the operation of a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stam</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>ford, </em>20 Conn. App. 51, 56, 563 A.2d 1046 (1989). On the plaintiffs first appeal to this court, we concluded that \u201c[t]he defendant had sufficient notice that the plaintiff was pursuing a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to prepare its defense and was not misled or surprised by the plaintiffs failure to allege specifically that his constitutional rights were violated as the result of a municipal policy. The defendant\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of evidence concerning the city\u2019s policies and its failure to claim any prejudice further supports this conclusion.\u201d <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>215 Conn. 450, 463, 576 A.2d 1273 (1990). We therefore reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court and remanded the case to the Appellate Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">On remand, the Appellate Court first concluded that the confirmation by the trial court, <em>Landau, J., </em>of the 1987 arbitration proceeding; see footnote 9, supra; did not render the plaintiffs claim moot since \u201c[a]n employee\u2019s rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 cannot be precluded by a decision in an arbitration proceeding. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Gardner-Denver Co., </em>415 U.S. 36, 94 S. Ct. 1101, 39 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1974). An arbitrator is limited to determining an employee\u2019s rights under a collective bargaining agreement, whereas the resolution of more difficult constitutional issues remains in the province of the courts.\u201d <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>24 Conn. App. 377, 379-80, 588 A.2d 656 (1991). The Appellate Court concluded further that based on \u201c[subsequent federal law,\u201d the earlier decision of the trial court, <em>Cioffi, J., </em>that the plaintiff had been entitled to a pretermination hearing when he was discharged in November, 1981, must be reversed. The Appellate Court noted that the trial court had relied on <em>Cleveland Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>supra, which, in 1985, established the right to a pretermination hearing. The Appellate Court concluded, however, that pursuant to <em>Zinker </em>v. <em>Doty, </em>907 F.2d 357 (2d Cir. 1990), \u201cthe <em>Loudermill </em>decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>cannot be applied retroactively to give the plaintiff a right that he did not have at the time of his termination.\u201d <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 380-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The Appellate Court next considered whether the plaintiff was afforded a meaningful posttermination hearing. The court concluded, without explanation, that \u201cthe hearing afforded the plaintiff was constitutionally deficient . . . .\u201d Id., 381. The court further concluded, however, citing <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 98 S. Ct. 1042, 55 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1978), that the plaintiff was \u201cnot entitled to recover anything greater than nominal damages for the justified deprivation of an interest protected by the constitution\u201d since the \u201crecord in the arbitration proceedings, of which we took judicial notice, [is] replete with medical reports stating that the plaintiff could not return to work, and would never be able to return to his job in the future.\u201d <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 24 Conn. App. 382-83. The Appellate Court, therefore, reversed the award of compensatory damages. Finally, the Appellate Court concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees since he had failed to produce contemporaneous time records. Id., 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification limited to the following issues: \u201c1. Did the Appellate Court properly reverse the trial court's award of attorney\u2019s fees based on an absence of contemporaneous time records? 2. Did the Appellate Court properly reverse the award of compensatory damages?\u201d <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>219 Conn. 911, 593 A.2d 136 (1991). We also granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to cross appeal on the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly determine that the union grievance process and decision of the board of mediation and arbitration was \u2018constitutionally deficient\u2019 and direct that the plaintiff be awarded nominal damages?\u201d <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>219 Conn. 910, 593 A.2d 135 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>In its cross appeal, the defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the union grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement did not satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s right to due process.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant argues that affirming the Appellate Court decision would undermine the union\u2019s discretion in deciding which claims to bring to arbitration and would unduly burden the labor relations process. The plaintiff claims, on the contrary, that the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement did not give him all the process that he was due.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant that, in this case, the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement satisfied the plaintiffs right to procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides that the \u201cState [shall not] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .\u2019\u2019In order to prevail on his due process claim, the plaintiff must prove that: (1) he has been deprived of a property interest cognizable under the due process clause; and (2) the deprivation of the property interest has occurred without due process of law. See <em>Double I Limited Partnership </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>218 Conn. 65, 76, 588 A.2d 624 (1991); <em>Connecticut Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Tirozzi, </em>210 Conn. 286, 293, 554 A.2d 1065 (1989); see also comment, \u201cDevelopments in the Law\u2014Public Employment,\u201d 97 Harv. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Rev. 1611,1781 (1984). It is undisputed that the plaintiff had a property interest in his continued employment with the defendant because the collective bargaining agreement stated that he could be terminated only for \u201cjust cause.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The issue then is whether the plaintiff was deprived of this property interest without due process of law. See <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corporation </em>v. <em>Mallen, </em>486 U.S. 230, 240, 108 S. Ct. 1780, 100 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1988); <em>Morrissey </em>v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u201c[T]he due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions require that one subject to significant deprivation of liberty or property must be accorded adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Counsel on Probate Judicial Conduct re: James H. Kinsella, </em>193 Conn. 180, 207, 476 A.2d 1041 (1984); <em>Sager </em>v. <em>GAB Business Services, Inc., </em>11 Conn. App. 693, 695, 529 A.2d 226 (1987). We note, however, that \u201c[d]ue process, unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances. <em>Cafeteria Workers </em>v. <em>McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 895 [81 S. Ct. 1743, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1230] (1961). [D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481 [92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484] (1972). Accordingly, resolution of the issue whether the [grievance] procedures provided here are constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private interests that are affected.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976); see also comment, supra, 1791.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>supra, 335, the court stated that the \u201cspecific dictates of due process generally [require] consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d Applying these factors to the present case, we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s right to procedural due process was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u201c[T]he significance of the private interest in retaining employment cannot be gainsaid. [The United States Supreme Court has] frequently recognized the severity of depriving a person of the means of livelihood. See <em>Fusari </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>419 U.S. 379, 389 [95 S. Ct. 533, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>42 L. Ed. 2d 521] (1975); <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson, </em>[402 U.S. 535, 91 S. Ct. 1586, 29 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1971)]; <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 264 [90 S. Ct. 1011, 25 L. Ed. 2d 287] (1970); <em>Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U.S. 337, 340 [89 S. Ct. 1820, 23 L. Ed. 2d 349] (1969). While a fired worker may find employment elsewhere, doing so will take some time and is likely to be burdened by the questionable circumstances under which he left his previous job. See <em>Lefkowitz </em>v. <em>Turley, </em>414 U.S. 70, 83-84 [94 S. Ct. 316, 38 L. Ed. 2d 274] (1973).\u201d <em>Cleveland Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>supra, 543. Moreover, the government\u2019s interest in immediate termination, standing alone, does not outweigh the plaintiff\u2019s interest in retaining employment. See id., 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s interest, however, is tempered in this case by the societal interest in an orderly and efficient system of dispute resolution in the public sector in the form of union grievance procedures set forth in a collective bargaining agreement, with benefits inuring to both employer and employee.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>School Administrators Assn. </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>200 Conn. 376, 511 A.2d 1012 (1986) (grievance procedures are preferred method of resolving disputes); <em>Antinore </em>v. <em>State, </em>49 App. Div. 2d 6, 371 N.Y.S.2d 213 (1975), aff'd, 40 N.Y.2d 921, 358 N.E.2d 268, 389 N.Y.S.2d 576 (1976) (binding arbitration procedures must be viewed as advancing public good by expedition of resolution of disciplinary disputes in simpler, more prompt manner). As the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit noted in <em>Parrett </em>v. <em>Connersville, </em>737 F.2d 690, 696 (7th Cir. 1984), \u201c[although the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment . . . could not have foreseen the rise of public-employee unions, grievance procedures, and other phenomena of modem labor relations . . . the concept of due process is sufficiently flexible to allow the courts to work out an accommodation between the interest in an orderly system of labor relations in the public sector as elsewhere and public employees\u2019 interest in procedural protections of job rights classified as property rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The plaintiffs interest in the present case is also tempered when one balances the minimal risk of an erroneous deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s property interest through the procedures used in the collective bargaining agreement against the minimal value additional procedural safeguards would provide and the adverse effect such additional safeguards would have on the labor relations process. In <em>Parrett </em>v. <em>Connersville, </em>supra, 696, the court stated that \u201c[t]he standard test of procedural adequacy under the due process clause, that of <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>[supra, 335,] merely requires a comparison of the costs and benefits of giving the plaintiff a more elaborate procedure than he actually received. There is no basis under this test for blanket disqualification of arbitration, which businesses often use to resolve multi-million dollar disputes, and which is the standard method of protecting job security in unionized plants and facilities in the private sector. If the dispute is the type for which arbitration is well suited\u2014and disputes over job rights fit that bill-then the gains from additional procedure, in reducing the chance of error, may well be smaller than the costs of additional procedure, especially when are added to the direct costs the indirect costs in disrupting orderly labor relations by bypassing the grievance procedure set up by a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>In the present case, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of the plaintiffs property interest under the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement was minimal. Article XXV of the collective bargaining agreement, entitled \u201cGrievance and Arbitration Procedure,\u201d provided the following: \u201cAny grievance arising between the City and the Union or any employee shall be settled in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u201cA. The aggrieved employee and/or Union Steward shall attempt to adjust the grievance with the employee\u2019s immediate supervisor within ten (10) working days after the grievance arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u201cB. If a satisfactory adjustment of the grievance is not effected with such supervisor, the employee and/or the Union Steward shall submit a statement of the grievance in writing to the Commissioner of Public Works . . . .The employee and the Union\u2019s business representative or the Union Steward shall then take the grievance up with the Commissioner of Public Works . . . and a decision thereon shall be given to the Business Representative within five (5) working days after termination of this meeting in writing. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u201cD. At the request of the City or the Union, any grievance not settled as the result of the procedure provided for above shall be submitted to the Connecticut Board of Mediation and Arbitration who shall hear the grievance according to its rules and regulations. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">\u201cE. The procedures set forth herein for settlement of grievances and/or the review of disciplinary action shall be the exclusive method of settlement of grievances and/or the review of disciplinary action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Pursuant to the agreement, the plaintiff, through the union or by his own initiation, was afforded two meetings with city officials in order to attempt to resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>his grievance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plaintiff was represented by his union representatives at both meetings, one with the deputy commissioner, which lasted forty-five minutes, and one with the commissioner, which lasted one and one-half hours. After the second meeting, the plaintiffs union representatives discussed whether the union should submit the plaintiffs claim to the Connecticut board of mediation and arbitration. Thereafter, the union decided not to take the claim to arbitration because, in its opinion, the case was too weak.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The union, however, did not have unfettered discretion when deciding whether to take the plaintiff\u2019s grievance to arbitration. As the exclusive bargaining representative of the plaintiff, the union had the right and obligation to act for the plaintiff and to represent his interests. See General Statutes \u00a7 7-468.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>it was required to act on the plaintiffs behalf in his best interest. A union must represent its members in good faith. See <em>Air Line Pilots Assn. International </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>499 U.S. 65, 111 S. Ct. 1127, 113 L. Ed. 2d 51 (1991); <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 177, 87 S. Ct. 903, 17 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1967). If an employee\u2019s grievance has merit, the union must proceed to arbitration. \u201c[A] union may not arbitrarily ignore a meritorious grievance or process it in a perfimctory fashion. . . .\u201d <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, </em>supra, 191. In this context, pursuant to the grievance procedures, the plaintiff, through the union, did have an <em>opportunity </em>to be heard by an impartial decisionmaker, namely, the Connecticut board of mediation and arbitration. That opportunity was limited, however, by the union\u2019s discretion as to which grievances to submit to arbitration, which was, in turn, informed by the union\u2019s duty to represent the plaintiff in good faith. If a union fails to submit a meritorious grievance to arbitration, an employee may sue the union for breach of its duty of fair representation. See id., 177; see also <em>Winston </em>v. <em>United States Postal Service, </em>585 F.2d 198, 208 (7th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that there was a minimal risk of an erroneous deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s property interest through the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement. First, under the agreement, the plaintiff was afforded two mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>meetings between the union and city officials where the union, representing the plaintiffs interests, presented the merits of his grievance to city officials. Both the union and the employer understood that if the dispute was not resolved, each side had the right to submit the grievance to arbitration. Since an impartial arbitration board was always available as a forum to resolve the grievance, each side had an incentive to deal fairly and honestly in resolving the dispute, thereby minimizing the risk that the plaintiff would be erroneously and arbitrarily deprived of his property. Furthermore, the union had an added incentive to fight zealously for meritorious claims, since a dissatisfied employee could sue the union for breach of its duty of fair representation. In light of the minimal risk of an erroneous deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s property right under the collective bargaining agreement, we find that the value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards was limited. Indeed, additional procedures may have adversely affected the labor relations process, thereby adversely affecting the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The plaintiff claims, nonetheless, that due process required that the defendant should have afforded him a hearing, regardless of the union\u2019s discretion to decide which grievances to take to arbitration pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement. We disagree. Requiring the city to give each aggrieved employee a separate hearing despite the union\u2019s decision not to take a grievance to arbitration would effectively dispense with the union\u2019s right to screen grievances; see <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, </em>supra; and would bypass the grievance procedures that are set in place for the employee\u2019s benefit. The practical result of allowing a separate hearing for the employee outside of what is provided for in the collective bargaining agreement would be to allow an employee to compel arbitration even if the union determines that the grievance is meritless. This result would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>not only undermine the union\u2019s control over the grievance process,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but would be contrary to the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, </em>supra, 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In <em>Vaca, </em>an employee, claiming to have been wrongfully discharged by his employer in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, filed a grievance with his union. After processing the employee\u2019s claim through four steps of the grievance process afforded by the collective bargaining agreement, the union refused to submit the employee\u2019s claim to arbitration. The employee brought suit against the union, claiming that the union had breached its duty of fair representation in its handling of his grievance. The court held that an employee does not have \u201can absolute right to have his grievance taken to arbitration . . . .\u2019\u2019Id., 191. The court noted that \u201c[i]n providing for a grievance and arbitration procedure which gives the union discretion to supervise the grievance machinery and to invoke arbitration, the employer and the union contemplate that each will endeavor in good faith to settle grievances short of arbitration. Through this settlement process, frivolous grievances are ended prior to the most costly and time-consuming step in the griev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>anee procedures. Moreover, both sides are assured that similar complaints will be treated consistently, and major problem areas in the interpretation of the collective bargaining contract can be isolated and perhaps resolved. And finally, the settlement process furthers the interest of the union as statutory agent and as coauthor of the bargaining agreement in representing the employees in the enforcement of that agreement. See Cox, Rights Under a Labor Agreement, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 601 (1956).\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The court reasoned further: <em>\u201cIf the individual employee could compel arbitration of his grievance regardless of its merit, the settlement machinery provided by the contract would be substantially undermined, thus destroying the employer\u2019s confidence in the union\u2019s authority and returning the individual grievant to the vagaries of independent and unsystematic negotiation. </em>Moreover, under such a rule, a significantly greater number of grievances would proceed to arbitration. This would greatly increase the cost of the grievance machinery and could so overburden the arbitration process as to prevent it from functioning successfully. See <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Acme Industrial Co., </em>385 U.S. 432, 438 [87 S. Ct. 565, 17 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1967)]; Ross, Distressed Grievance Procedures and Their Rehabilitation, in Labor Arbitration and Industrial Change, Proceedings of the 16th Annual Meeting, National Academy of Arbitrators 104 (1963).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 191-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The court concluded: \u201cIt can well be doubted whether the parties to collective bargaining agreements would long continue to provide for detailed grievance and arbitration procedures ... if their power to settle the majority of grievances short of the costlier and more time-consuming steps was limited by a rule permitting the grievant unilaterally to invoke arbitration. Nor do we see substantial danger to the interests of the indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>vidual employee if his statutory agent is given the contractual power honestly and in good faith to settle grievances short of arbitration. . . . The dampening effect on the entire grievance procedure of this reduction of the union\u2019s freedom to settle claims in good faith would surely be substantial. Since the union\u2019s statutory duty of fair representation protects the individual employee from arbitrary abuses of the settlement device by providing him with recourse against [his] . . . union, this severe limitation on the power to settle grievances is neither necessary nor desirable.\u201d Id., 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">We conclude that under the balancing test set forth in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>supra, the plaintiff received all the process that he was due.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We recognize that the employee\u2019s interest in his employment is great. That interest, however, is tempered by the government\u2019s interest in an orderly termination process, the minimal risk of an erroneous deprivation of the plaintiff\u2019s property interest under the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement, the minimal incremental value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and the adverse effect additional procedures would have on the labor relations process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Our conclusion that the plaintiffs due process rights were satisfied in this case is an accord with the conclusions of other jurisdictions. See <em>Parrett </em>v. <em>Connersville, </em>737 F.2d 690 (7th Cir. 1984); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Hillsborough Transit Authority, </em>726 F.2d 664 (11th Cir. 1983); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Temple University, </em>721 F.2d 931 (3d Cir. 1983); <em>Winston </em>v. <em>United States Postal Service, </em>585 F.2d 198 (7th Cir. 1978); <em>Pennsylvania Social Services Union </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Board of Probation &amp; Parole, </em>508 A.2d 360 (Pa.

App. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In <em>Winston </em>v. <em>United States Postal Service, </em>supra, 208, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit noted that \u201c[vjesting the Union with control of all grievances increases the likelihood of uniformity and reduces \u2018a potential source of competitions and discriminations that could be destructive of the entire structure of labor relations in the plant.\u2019 It prevents dissident minorities from pressing real or imagined grievances in an effort to squeeze the last drop of competitive advantage out of each grievance.\u201d Finally, the court noted that \u201c[ajilowing an individual to compel arbitration whenever he is dissatisfied with the company-union adjustment would discourage day-to-day cooperation between union and company in which grievances are treated as problems to be solved. Public officials and arbitrators, as well as employers, constantly remind union officials that they have a duty to discountenance disruptive and frivolous claims. If they are to accept this responsibility, union officials should be given the power to make their decisions effective.\u201d Id. The court further noted that \u201c[ajlthough their representative declined their requests to demand arbitration, appellants could have sued the Union for breach of its duty to fairly represent them if the refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>demand arbitration was not in good faith. 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1208 (c); <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, </em>supra at 194-95, 87 S.

In <em>Zinker </em>v. <em>Doty, </em>907 F.2d 357, 361 (2d Cir. 1990), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined that <em>Loudermill </em>did not declare existing law, but rather established new law and, therefore, pretermination hearings were not constitutionally mandated prior to the date of the <em>Loudermill </em>decision. Since the plaintiff\u2019s employment in the present case was terminated prior to the decision in <em>Loudermill, </em>he was not constitutionally entitled to a pretermination hearing. Even if we were to apply <em>Loudermill </em>retroactively, however, it is unclear whether that decision would be controlling since <em>Loudermill </em>did not consider what process a public employee is due when there are union grievance procedures set in place by a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\"> There can be no question that collective bargaining through union representation is beneficial to employees. Most collective bargaining agreements \u201chave provisions governing wages, hours, discipline, promotions, medical and health insurance, pensions, vacations and holidays, work assignments, seniority and the like.\u201d R. Gorman, Labor Law\u2014Basic Text (1976) p. 540. Collective bargaining \u201cprovides the worker with a system of industrial government or industrial jurisprudence which protects his rights and privileges in his workplace.\u201d M. Wortman &amp; C.

In support of this claim, the plaintiff notes that the collective bargaining agreement does not define the term \u201cgrievance.\u201d The plaintiff is apparently arguing, therefore, that since it is unclear whether a termination is a grievance, the union grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement do not apply. It is hard to imagine, however, any employer action that would more aptly give rise to a grievance than a termination. Indeed, the plaintiff filled out a grievance form and submitted it to his union representative, who pursued it through the grievance process. Therefore, the collective bargaining agreement did provide procedures for resolving a disputed termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\"> Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, the union was not required to submit the plaintiff\u2019s grievance to the arbitration board.

By weeding out frivolous grievances, the union may be increasing the overall chance of success of a meritorious grievance.
