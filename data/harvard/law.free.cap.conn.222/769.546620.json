After exhausting the third party tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage and receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits, Colman commenced a compulsory arbitration proceeding against the plaintiff, CNA Insurance Company (CNA), which insured the automobile driven by Colman, to recover uninsured motorist benefits. Although the arbitration panel ruled that Colman was entitled to such coverage, the trial court granted CNA\u2019s motion to vacate the award. As a result of Colman\u2019s appeal to the Appellate Court, the arbitral award was reinstated. <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, 25 </em>Conn. App. 651, 595 A.2d 949 (1991). We then granted CNA\u2019s petition for certification<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>The pertinent facts are not in dispute. On July 11, 1983, Colman was involved in an automobile accident while driving his employer\u2019s personal automobile within the scope of his employment. CNA insured the automobile, along with three others owned by Colman\u2019s employer, under a personal automobile liability policy. Each of the four vehicles carried $40,000 in uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Prior to making his claim under the CNA uninsured motorist policy, Colman had exhausted the third party tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage of $20,000 and had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits of $38,758.67. The central issue before the arbitration panel was \u201cwhether or not [Colman was] barred from pursuing an action for damages against [CNA] because of having been awarded Workman\u2019s [sic] Compensation benefits from his employer.\u201d The arbitration panel concluded that, because Colman\u2019s action for uninsured motorist benefits was based on a \u201ccontractual concept\u201d that existed between Colman and CNA, Colman was entitled to recover benefits despite having already received workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The trial court granted CNA\u2019s application to vacate the arbitration award in reliance on <em>Ross </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>19 Conn. App. 169, 561 A.2d 457 (1989), which had held that \u00a7 31-284 (a) made benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act the exclusive remedy for work related injury claims against an employer. The court further concluded that uninsured motorist benefits under CNA\u2019s policy of insurance did not qualify as \u201cadditional benefits\u201d under \u00a7 31-284 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court. It concluded that \u00a7 31-284 (a) \u201cdoes not bar an employee who has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from also obtaining uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits\u201d from his employer\u2019s insurer. <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>supra, 653. Its conclusion was based in part on its reading of our decision in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 814, 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990), as having implicitly overruled <em>Ross </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra. <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>supra, 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Having been granted certification to appeal, CNA contends that \u00a7 31-284 (a): (1) bars any work related claim for uninsured motorist benefits under an insurance policy procured by the employer; and (2) bars such a claim even though the insurance at issue is an employer\u2019s personal automobile liability insurance. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">We have today concluded, in the companion case of <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>222 Conn. 744, 610 A.2d 1245 (1992), that an employee who has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries that occurred during the course of his employment is precluded by the clear language of \u00a7 31-284 (a) from recovering uninsured motorist benefits from his self-insured employer. We must decide in this case whether the same rule applies when the employer is not self-insured, and thus the employee\u2019s claim is brought against a commercial insurance provider on an uninsured motorist insurance policy procured by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Colman maintains that his claim against CNA is not barred by the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision because \u201c[ijnsurance companies, like everyone else, should be held accountable for both their acts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>their contracts,\u201d and because \u201c[t]he benefits sought are contractual benefits from CNA, not from any \u2018employer.5 \u201d His contention has three subparts: (1) his claim is statutory or contractual, and hence is not a personal injury claim; (2) his claim involves only the contractual liability of CNA; and (3) his claim is a special agreement that is expressly excluded from the exclusivity provision by \u00a7 31-284 (a). We find none of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">We have already determined in <em>Bouley </em>that, in an action against the employer, the statutory or contractual basis of uninsured motorist coverage does not exempt a claim for such benefits from the purview of the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 756. The characterization of the employee\u2019s claim does not take on special significance just because the employee is pursuing an action against the employer\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The fact that the employee\u2019s suit is based on an uninsured motorist insurance policy issued by a commercial insurer does not warrant a departure from the exclusive remedy policy of our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Colman\u2019s employer procured and paid for the insurance policy under which Colman is seeking benefits in this case. \u201cUnder the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, both the employer and the employee have relinquished certain rights to obtain other advantages.\u201d <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 752. Pursuant to this compromise, the employer is insulated from bearing <em>any </em>costs arising out of workplace injuries in excess of those provided by workers\u2019 compensation. See <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>219 Conn. 439, 454-55, 594 A.2d 446 (1991); <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979). Claims paid by an employer\u2019s insurer will presumably be reflected in the insurance premium that the employer must pay. It follows therefore that CNA, as the alter ego of its insured, the employer, must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>the right to refuse to pay benefits to an employee injured during the course of employment above and beyond the legal liability of the employer. See <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>National Indemnity Co., </em>492 Pa. 154, 165, 422 A.2d 1061 (1980) (exclusiveness of Workers\u2019 Compensation Act barred employee\u2019s claim for no-fault benefits against employer\u2019s insurer \u201cfor an insurer provides coverage for an employer\u2019s possible liability and has no independent basis for liability on its own part\u201d); compare <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>Interstate Freight, </em>408 Mich. 164, 181, 289 N.W.2d 708 (1980) (statute allowing employee\u2019s direct cause of action against employer\u2019s no-fault insurance carrier); see also 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1992) \u00a7 65.11, p. 12-1 (\u201cOnce a workmen\u2019s compensation act has become applicable . . . it affords the exclusive remedy for the injury by the employee . . . against the employer and insurance carrier.\u201d). Because of the central role that the exclusive remedy provision plays in our workers\u2019 compensation law, an employee who can receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits is therefore barred from collecting under his employer\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage, whether that coverage is provided through self-insurance or through a commercial insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">We also reject Colman\u2019s contention that the CNA insurance policy falls within a statutory exemption to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision. While \u00a7 31-284 (a) provides that an employee may secure \u201cby agreement with his employer, additional benefits from his employer\u201d for injuries sustained during the course of employment, there is no evidence in the present case that such an agreement for additional benefits existed. The only contract in this case was between Colman\u2019s employer and CNA. See also <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Finally, we can discern no reason to depart from our holding in <em>Bouley </em>on the ground that the automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>in which Colman was injured was insured pursuant to a personal automobile liability policy. While the personal nature of the coverage might be relevant to the issue of \u201cstacking\u201d; see <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 525, 529-32, 569 A.2d 541 (1990); it is not relevant to the issue of whether a claim for uninsured motorist benefits is precluded by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Glass, Borden and F.X. Hennessy, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) An employer shall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment or on account of death resulting from personal injury so sustained, but an employer shall secure compensation for his employees as follows, except that compensation shall not be paid when the personal injury has been caused by the wilful and serious misconduct of the injured employee or by his intoxication. All rights and claims between employer and'employees, or any representatives or dependents of such employees, arising out of personal injury or death sustained in the course of employment as aforesaid are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter, provided nothing herein shall prohibit any employee from securing, by agreement with his employer, additional benefits from his employer for such injury or from enforcing such agreement for additional benefits.\u201d Although this statute was amended, effective July 1,1991, by Public Acts 1991, No. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 41, the changes are not pertinent to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\"> In this opinion, the term uninsured motorist benefits encompasses underinsured motorist benefits as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\"> Frank Colman\u2019s wife is also a defendant in this case.
