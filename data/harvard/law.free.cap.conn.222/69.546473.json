The issue presented is whether in determining eligibility for assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602 et seq., the applicable federal statute mandates the inclusion of children\u2019s savings accounts in determining the family\u2019s total resources. We agree with the fair hearing officer\u2019s determination that such savings accounts are required to be considered in determining the family\u2019s resources and, therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court that held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">The procedural facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff is a recipient of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). On August 15,1990, the defendant notified her that during the period between August 1, 1988, and August 31,1989, two of the plaintiff\u2019s minor children had had savings account balances that totaled more than the $1000 statutory limit on family resources. The defendant concluded, therefore, that the family had been ineligible for assistance during that period and sought the return of $9342.75 paid to the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>on the mistaken assumption that the family had been eligible for AFDC benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The plaintiff made a timely request for a fair hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The hearing officer determined that during the period in question, two of the plaintiff\u2019s children, Angel and Sandra, who were both under the age of eighteen and full-time students, had savings accounts from accumulated earnings of $989.51 and $4964.11, respectively. The hearing officer found that these savings accounts were includable in calculating whether the family unit had resources in excess of $1000. The hearing officer, therefore, determined that \u201cthe assets of the appellant\u2019s assistance unit were in excess of the agency AFDC asset limit of $1000.00 during the period of August 1,1988, through August 31,1989. Therefore, the District properly determined that all the AFDC assistance [payment] rendered during that period represents an overpayment. The total amount of $9,342.75 is therefore subject to recoupment action.\u201d The plaintiff took a timely appeal to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The trial court, relying upon <em>Rebman </em>v. <em>Welfare Com</em>missioner, 31 Conn. Sup. 515, 324 A.2d 273 (1973), a decision of the Appellate Division of the Court of Common Pleas, concluded \u201c[t]hat earned income and accumulated income as represented by a savings [account] held more than one month for the purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>of determining the extent of benefits should not be distinguished. To do so \u2018is to do violence to the entire federal system of public welfare. A disregarding of the child\u2019s accumulated earnings instills the incentive to work, whereas reimbursement of this accumulated earned income to the welfare commissioner perpetuates a disincentive to work.\u2019 <em>[Rebman </em>v. <em>Welfare Commissioner, </em>supra], 520.\u201d The trial court concluded \u201cthat the District Office and the Fair Hearing Officer incorrectly and improperly applied the law to the claim of the appellant\u201d and sustained the appeal. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. We thereafter transferred the matter to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">As succinctly set forth in the defendant\u2019s brief, the statutory and regulatory background to this issue is as follows: \u201cThe AFDC program is a joint federal state program. The federal statutes relating to AFDC are codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 601 et seq. Federal regulations relating to eligibility for AFDC appear at 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.10 et seq. The defendant, Commissioner of Income Maintenance, is the state official charged with the administration of the AFDC program. See General Statutes \u00a7 17-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u201cThe AFDC program, as enacted by Congress, and, in which the state participates, is designed to provide for needy dependent children. The Congress has set up, and the state has implemented, a complex system for determining whether a given child is needy. In order to provide an incentive to work, the Congress requires a participating state, in determining eligibility, to disregard certain earned income of various types of people who may make up a household. Among them are minor children who are students, minor children who are not students, parents and stepparents. That income which must be disregarded is not counted by the states in making eligibility determinations. The Congress has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>also imposed a $1,000.00 limitation on the resources that an AFDC household may have and still be eligible for the AFDC program.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u201cIn the case at bar, the plaintiffs minor children earned wages from jobs. Those wages were disregarded by the state in the month in which they were received. The children placed some portion of their wages in savings accounts. It is the defendant\u2019s contention that once the wages were retained beyond the month in which they were received, they became resources, subject to the $1,000.00 limitation on resources; and that, therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s family was ineligible for AFDC for the entire period in which the combined balances in the savings accounts exceeded $1,000.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The plaintiff argues, on the other hand, that once disregarded, the children\u2019s wages were to be thereafter disregarded for all purposes and that the earned income should have been categorized simply as retained income and was not to be included in determining the $1000 resource limitation for AFDC eligibility purposes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Title 42 of the United States Code, \u00a7 602 (a) (7) provides that a state plan for AFDC benefits must \u201cprovide that the State agency\u2014(A) shall, in determining need, take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative claiming aid to families with dependent children . . . (B) shall determine ineligible for aid any family the combined value of whose resources (reduced by any obligation or debts with respect to such resources) exceeds $1,000 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Title 42 of the United States Code, \u00a7 602 (a) (8) (A) provides that a state plan for AFDC must \u201cprovide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that, <em>with respect to any month, </em>in making the determination under paragraph (7), the State agency\u2014(i) shall disregard all of the earned income of each dependent child receiving aid to families with dependent children who is ... a full-time student or a part-time student who is not a full-time employee attending a school, college, or university, or a course of vocation or technical training designed to fit him for gainful employment. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This language does not expressly restrict the time period for disregarding a full-time dependent student\u2019s income to the month in which it is earned.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">It is well settled that \u201c[w]hen [statutory] language is clear and unambiguous, its meaning is not subject to modification by construction.\u201d <em>Thibeault </em>v. <em>White, </em>168 Conn. 112, 115, 358 A.2d 358 (1975). When the language of a statute is reasonably subject to diverse interpretations, however, we look to the statute\u2019s legislative history and the policy it was designed to implement \u201cto ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992). The legislative history of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602 (a) (8) does not specifically address whether Congress intended to exempt permanently the earnings of a dependent child who is a full-time student in determining a family\u2019s eligibility for AFDC. It does indicate, however, that until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>1981, a state agency could, subject to limitations imposed by federal regulations, permit a family to set aside earned or other income for the \u201cfuture identifiable needs\u201d of a dependent child. In 1967, Congress amended \u00a7 402 (a) of the Social Security Act to add various provisions for the disregarding of certain types of income of AFDC recipients and applicants, including the provision requiring that a state agency disregard all earned income of a dependent child receiving AFDC who is a full-time student.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pub. L. No. 90-248, \u00a7 202 (b) (1967). The amended law incorporated existing language, which provided that \u201cthe State agency . . . \u2018(B) (i) may, subject to the limitations prescribed by the Secretary [of Health, Education and Welfare],<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> permit all or any portion of the earned or other income to be set aside for future identifiable needs of a dependent child. . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If a state agency chose to exercise this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>option, it considered such retained income \u201cas not available for meeting current subsistence needs\u201d of the family unit. Pub. L. No. 87-543, Senate Report No. 1589, reprinted in 1962 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Adm. News 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The provision allowing for the setting aside of income for the future identifiable needs of dependent children was deleted, however, from the statute by Public Law No. 97-35, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981. At that time, Congress also enacted the $1000 statutory limitation on the resources of a family receiving AFDC.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a result of these amendments, a state agency may no longer permit AFDC recipients to retain income in excess of $1000, even if it is intended for the future identifiable needs of dependent children. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the legislative history of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602 (a) (8) discloses the deliberate excision of statutory language that could have served as the basis for excluding children\u2019s savings from the $1000 monthly resource limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s suggested construction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602 (a) (8) is also contrary to the relevant federal regulations. Although it is not controlling, the interpretation of a federal agency is entitled to substantial deference. <em>Chevron U.S.A. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844-45, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, reh. denied, 468 U.S. 1227, 105 S. Ct. 28, 82 L. Ed. 2d 921 (1984). Section 233.20 (a) (3) (i) (B) of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, an enactment of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the federal agency charged with implementation of the AFDC program, provides: \u201c[I]n AFDC\u2014The amount of real and personal property that can be <em>reserved </em>for each assistance unit shall not be in excess of one thousand dollars equity value . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 233.20 (a) (6) (viii) states: <em>\u201cReserves </em>accumulated from earnings are given no different treatment than <em>reserves </em>accumulated from any other sources.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, it is clear that HHS construes savings, whether or not they are derived from earned income, as resources that are limited to $1000 per eligible family.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">While such an interpretation may be an unwise perpetuation of a disincentive to save for one\u2019s education or other worthy goals in order to get off the welfare rolls, policy determinations are not a function of the judicial branch, however, but repose exclusively with the Congress that enacted the controlling legislation. Because 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602 (a) (7) limits the resources for an entire family to $1000, we conclude that the hearing officer correctly determined that during the period of August 1,1988, through August 31, 1989, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tiff was ineligible for AFDC because the balance in the children\u2019s savings accounts exceeded $1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-2a provides: \u201cfair hearings by commissioner, application. Any aggrieved person authorized by law to request a fair hearing on a decision of the commissioner of income maintenance, or the conservator of any such person on his behalf, may make application for such hearing in writing over his signature to the commissioner and shall state in such application in simple language the reasons why he claims to be aggrieved. Such application shall be mailed to the commissioner within sixty days after the rendition of such decision. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-2b (b) provides: \u201cThe applicant for such hearing, if aggrieved, may appeal therefrom in accordance with section 4-183. Appeals from decisions of said commissioner shall be privileged cases to be heard by the court as soon after the return day as shall be practicable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b93-10\"> As also set forth in the defendant\u2019s brief, \u201c[t]he $1,000 limitation is imposed after disregarding certain resources, such as an automobile of limited value. Resource disregards are not in issue in this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\"> The absence, of restrictive language in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602 (a) (8) (A) (i) contrasts with other subsections of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602 (a) (8) (A). Section 602 (a) (8) (A) (ii), for example, provides that a state agency \u201cshall disregard from the earned income of any child or relative applying for or receiving aid to families with dependent children, or of any other individual (living in the same home as such relative and child) whose needs are taken into account in making [the eligibility determination], the first $90 of the total of such earned income/or <em>such month.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In addition, subsection (vi) of paragraph (8) (A) provides, in relevant part, that a state agency \u201cshall disregard the first $50 of any child support payments/or <em>such month received, in that month.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\"> Prior to the 1967 amendment, the law allowed (but did not require) the state agency to disregard the earnings of children up to $50 a month per child for a maximum of $150 a month per family.
