The sole issue is whether the plaintiff is entitled to a jury trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the plaintiff is not entitled to a jury trial, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The record discloses the following. The plaintiff and Terrence Boyd were charged with the crimes of felony murder, burglary in the first degree and larceny in the third degree. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>214 Conn. 132, 570 A.2d 1125 (1990). The plaintiff agreed to a sentence of twenty years on a plea of guilty to burglary in the first degree. The plaintiff testified at Boyd\u2019s trial and Boyd was convicted as charged. This court set aside Boyd\u2019s conviction of felony murder on appeal, however, on the ground that the insufficiency of admissible evidence presented at his probable cause hearing deprived the trial court of personal jurisdiction over him. Id., 141. On remand, the trial court held a new probable cause hearing on December 23, 1990, at which the plaintiff was called as a witness. The plaintiff refused to answer any questions posed by the defendant in error, assistant state\u2019s attorney David Cohen (defendant). The trial court ordered the plaintiff to answer the defendant\u2019s questions and advised him that he could be held in contempt if he refused.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Despite the trial court\u2019s admonitions, the plaintiff persisted in refusing to testify. The plaintiff stated that he was refusing to answer any questions because he was concerned about his personal safety at the correctional institution where he was incarcerated. The trial court reviewed the various contempt statutes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and informed the plaintiff that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>it believed that General Statutes \u00a7 51-33a was applicable. The trial court advised the plaintiff that, pursuant to \u00a7 51-33a, the state\u2019s attorney would have to decide whether to file contempt charges, which would then be adjudicated by another judge. The trial court then continued Boyd\u2019s probable cause hearing until January, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">On January 23,1991, the trial court, relying on <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 440 A.2d 969 (1982), advised the plaintiff that his refusal to testify would constitute summary contempt for which it could impose a sentence of up to six months to run concurrently or consecutively with the sentence that he was then serving. After answering a few preliminary questions posed by the defendant, the plaintiff refused to answer any further questions. The trial court established that the plaintiff did not intend to testify further and that his refusal was based on concern for his personal safety, the same reason that he had given at the previous hearing. The trial court then advised the plaintiff that it would order him to answer the defendant\u2019s questions, and that if he refused, it would hold him in contempt of court. The court again advised the plaintiff that it was authorized to impose a sentence of up to six months imprisonment. The plaintiff continued to refuse to testify, and the trial court found him in contempt of court pursuant to Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 51-33.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court advised the plaintiff that his refusal to answer any questions despite its order that he do so amounted to summary contempt under <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, and that it intended to impose a sentence of six months to run consecutively to his current sentence. After inquiring whether the plaintiff still refused to testify, to which the plaintiff responded affirmatively, the trial court sentenced him to six months incarceration to run consecutively to the sentence he was then serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The sole issue presented by this writ of error is whether, pursuant to \u00a7 54-82b, the trial court was empowered to impose a sentence in excess of thirty days on a summary contempt charge without providing the plaintiff the right to a jury trial. It is well established that this court\u2019s review of a summary criminal contempt proceeding by writ of error is limited to three questions: \u201c(1) whether the designated conduct is legally susceptible of constituting a contempt; <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>[84 Conn. 60, 63, 78 A. 853 (1911)]; (2) whether the punishment imposed was authorized by law; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>147 Conn. 167, 169, 158 A.2d 166 (1960); and (3) whether the judicial authority was qualified to conduct the hearing. <em>Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>400 U.S. 455, 465-66, 91 S. Ct. 499, 27 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1971).\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 257; see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>221 Conn. 498, 500-501, 605 A.2d 1350 (1992); <em>In re Dodson, </em>214 Conn. 344, 346-47, 572 A.2d 328, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 896, 111 S. Ct. 247, 112 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1990).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff concedes that the writ of error in the present case is limited to the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The plaintiff argues that, pursuant to \u00a7 54-82b, the trial court was required to afford him the opportunity for a jury trial. In essence, the plaintiff contends that \u00a7 54-82b supersedes \u00a7 51-33 to the extent that the latter statute authorizes the <em>summary </em>imposition of up to six months imprisonment for a contempt committed in the presence of the court. The defendant argues that the plaintiffs construction of \u00a7 54-82b renders \u00a7 51-33 meaningless and, therefore, violates basic rules of statutory construction. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Section 54-82b (a) provides that \u201c[t]he party accused in a criminal action in the superior court may demand a trial by jury of issues which are triable of right by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>a jury.\u201d The statute specifically exempts criminal actions for which the maximum penalty is a f\u00edne of $199.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 51-33 authorizes \u201c[a]ny court\u201d to \u201cpunish by fine and imprisonment any person who in its presence behaves contemptuously or in a disorderly manner.\u201d Under the latter statute, a court\u2019s authority is expressly limited, however, to imposing a fine of up to $100 or a term of imprisonment of up to six months or both. A statute providing for the summary punishment of criminal contempt had existed in the state of Connecticut well before \u00a7 54-82b was enacted. See, e.g., General Statutes (1888 Rev.) \u00a7 843 (allowing any court, except a justice of the peace, to punish by a fine no greater than $100 and by imprisonment for no longer than six months any person who behaves contemptuously or disorderly in the court\u2019s presence).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Section 54-82b, by its terms, limits the right to a jury trial to \u201c[t]he party accused in a <em>criminal action.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The plaintiff argues, therefore, that this court should construe a summary criminal contempt proceeding as a \u201ccriminal action\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54-82b. In so arguing, the plaintiff asks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>this court to conclude that the legislature, in enacting \u00a7 54-82b, impliedly repealed \u00a7 51-33 to the extent that it permits a court summarily to punish a contempt committed in its presence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We decline to reach such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">\u201cThe rule disfavoring implied repeals is a well established principle of statutory construction. . . . The legislature is presumed to have acted with the intent to create a consistent body of law. ... If two statutes appear to be in conflict but can be construed as consistent with each other, then the court should give effect to both. . . . [EJnactments by the General Assembly are presumed to repeal earlier inconsistent ones to the extent that they are in conflict. . . . Because repeal by implication is generally disfavored, however, the principle applies only when the relevant statutes cannot stand together. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>217 Conn. 631, 641, 587 A.2d 415 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The plaintiff relies <em>on Bloom </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 194, 88 S. Ct. 1477, 20 L. Ed. 2d 522 (1968), in support of his argument that the distinctions between summary criminal contempt proceedings and criminal prosecutions are artificial and, therefore, a summary criminal contempt proceeding should be deemed a \u201ccriminal action\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54-82b. In deciding whether a contemnor summarily sentenced to more-than six months imprisonment had a constitutional right to a jury trial, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bloom </em>analogized criminal contempt proceedings to criminal prosecutions. The court referred to criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>contempt as \u201ca crime in the ordinary sense\u201d and \u201cin every fundamental respect,\u201d stating that \u201cconvictions for criminal contempt are indistinguishable from ordinary criminal convictions . . . .\u201d Id., 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Similarly, this court long ago concluded that a criminal contempt proceeding should conform as nearly as possible to proceedings in criminal cases. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>52 Conn. 147, 157 (1884); see also <em>McTigue </em>v. <em>New London Education Assn., </em>164 Conn. 348, 356, 321 A.2d 462 (1973). We have nonetheless previously rejected an argument akin to that made by the plaintiff in the present case. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, the defendant, an attorney who had been summarily punished for a contempt committed in the presence of the court, claimed to have a right of appeal pursuant to General Statutes (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 54-12, which provided that \u201c[a]ny person convicted ... by any municipal court of any offense may . . . appeal from the judgment ... to the . . . court of common pleas . . . .\u201d The defendant argued that contempt of court was an \u201coffense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54-12. This court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument, stating: \u201cThe word \u2018offense\u2019 in \u00a7 54-12 . . . must be construed as meaning \u2018criminal offense.\u2019 <em>When the defendant was fined for a contempt committed in the presence of the court, he was not convicted of a criminal offense within the meaning of \u00a7 54-12.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 170. We likewise conclude that a summary criminal contempt proceeding is not a \u201ccriminal action\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54-82b.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">\u201cCriminal contempt is conduct which is directed against the dignity and authority of the court. In such a case, the court may punish the offender on its own motion, without the presentation of any charge, formal or otherwise, and solely upon facts within its own knowledge. When the offense is committed in the presence of the court, punishment may be imposed at once. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>This power inheres in, and is essential to, any court, in order that it may be enabled to administer justice.\u201d Id., 169. This court has repeatedly stated that <em>\u201c[i]n this class of contempt, the proceedings are criminal in nature but do not constitute a criminal prosecution. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>80 Conn. 668, 671, 69 A. 1057 (1908); <em>Middlebrook </em>v. <em>State, </em>43 Conn. 257, 267 (1876). Rather, criminal contempt proceedings \u201care for an offense against the court as an organ of public justice and not for a violation of the criminal law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra; see also <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Our conclusion that \u00a7 54-82b does not apply to summary criminal contempt proceedings conducted pursuant to \u00a7 51-33 permits the two statutes to \u201cstand together\u201d in accordance with established rules of statutory construction. See <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>supra. At common law, a party accused of contempt was not entitled to a jury trial. <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, 196. This court adhered to this long established principle in <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>48 Conn. 174, 201 (1880).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra, created a <em>constitutional </em>right to a jury trial for criminal contempt where the punishment imposed exceeds six months imprisonment, the common law principle still applies to contempts that qualify as \u201cpetty offenses,\u201d a category consisting of crimes carrying a sentence of six months or less. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 505-506, cit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>ing <em>Codispoti </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>418 U.S. 506, 512, 94 S. Ct. 2687, 41 L. Ed. 2d 912 (1974). As this court has stated: \u201cSo long as the punishment [for a criminal contempt] is kept within the six-month term provided by \u00a7 51-33, the court\u2019s jurisdiction to impose such punishment summarily is clear.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 503; see also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 259. We discern no persuasive reason to depart from this well established principle of our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The plaintiff also claims a violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in that our statutes and rules of practice provide disparate treatment for summary and nonsummary contempt with respect to the right to a jury trial. Although the plaintiff\u2019s attorney alluded to the differential treatment of summary and nonsummary contempt proceedings at the probable cause hearing, he did not distinctly raise a claim that these differences constituted a violation of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional right to equal protection under the law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant contends that this court should decline to address the plaintiff\u2019s claim because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>not properly preserved nor is it of constitutional magnitude. The defendant argues, alternatively, that should this court review the plaintiff\u2019s equal protection claim, he cannot prevail under the criteria set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 238-42, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In <em>Golding, </em>we clarified the standard for appellate review of unpreserved constitutional claims that this court had set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). We held that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Applying the first criterion to the present case, we conclude that the record is adequate to review the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Despite the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s argument at the probable cause hearing, regarding the different procedures for summary and nonsummary contempt, raised no constitutional concern, the transcript indicates that the trial court imposed a sentence of six months imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 51-33. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to articulate an equal protection claim before the trial court does not detract from the sufficiency of the record to review such a claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">With respect to the second criterion, the plaintiff\u2019s claim facially satisfies the requirement that the unpreserved claim be of \u201cconstitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right.\u201d Id., 239. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The plaintiff claims that his right to equal protection of the laws was violated because there is no rational basis for distinguishing between summary and nonsummary contempt for purposes of punishment.-This is not a \u201cpatently nonconstitutional claim\u201d nor one \u201cmasquerading\u201d as a constitutional claim. Id., 240, 241. In determining whether the second <em>Golding </em>requirement is satisfied, we do not evaluate the merits of the claim, except to determine whether the claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Having surmounted the threshold requirements for review of the plaintiffs equal protection claim pursuant to the first two criteria in <em>Golding, </em>the plaintiff is entitled to a determination of the merits of his claim under the third criterion. Id., 241. The plaintiff concedes that the applicable standard for review of his claim is whether there is any rational basis for the difference in the maximum punishment that may be imposed without affording an alleged contemnor a right of jury trial: six months when the court acts summarily, pursuant to \u00a7 51-33 and Practice Book \u00a7 988, for a contempt occurring in its presence, and a fine of $199, as limited by \u00a7 54-82b, when the same contemptuous conduct is prosecuted nonsummarily pursuant to \u00a7 51-33a and Practice Book \u00a7 993. The plaintiff argues, however, that there is no reasonable ground for subjecting a contemnor to such disparate punishments for the same conduct occurring in a courtroom, depending on the \u201cwhim\u201d of the court or, if a proceeding is to be instituted under \u00a7 51-33a, also that of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The defendant argues that no such disparity exists because \u201cnonsummary contempt concerns conduct that does not occur in the presence of the court.\u201d That argument, however, overlooks the plain language of \u00a7 51-33a, which authorizes a nonsummary criminal contempt proceeding for \u201c[a]ny person who violates the dignity and authority of any court, in its presence . . . .\u2019\u2019It also ignores the authority conferred upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the court by Practice Book \u00a7 989<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to defer proceedings for contempts occurring during a trial until after the trial is completed, when the adjudication must be nonsummary pursuant to an information. Practice Book \u00a7 991.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We conclude, nonetheless, that, even when the identical contemptuous conduct is involved, there is a rational basis for the distinction made in the statutory scheme with respect to the punishments available for contempts occurring in the presence of the court that are adjudicated summarily, rather than in a nonsummary proceeding, which affords a right of jury trial if the punishment is to exceed $199. When the contempt is based upon the unlawful refusal of a witness to answer proper questions during a criminal trial, as in this case, there is an overwhelming necessity for empowering a court to adjudicate the contempt summarily and to impose punishment sufficiently substantial to cause the witness to reconsider and deter such conduct by others. The trial court should not be compelled to suspend the proceeding to await the outcome of a fullblown criminal prosecution for the contempt with an attendant right of jury trial, and a mistrial would raise double jeopardy concerns. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>421 U.S. 309, 318-19, 95 S. Ct. 1802, 44 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1975). \u201c \u2018The power to fine and imprison for contempt, from the earliest history of jurisprudence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>has been regarded as a necessary incident and attribute of a court, without which it could no more exist than without a judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>376 U.S. 681, 699-700, 84 S. Ct. 984, 12 L. Ed. 2d 23, reh. denied, 377 U.S. 973, 84 S. Ct. 1642, 12 L. Ed. 2d 742 (1964), quoting <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>36 Miss. 331, 341 (1858). When a witness refuses to testify at a trial in obedience to a court order, \u201csummary contempt must be available to vindicate the authority of the court as well as to provide the recalcitrant witness with some incentive to testify.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The absence of any similar necessity when a contempt, whether or not occurring in the presence of the court, is prosecuted in a nonsummary proceeding, permits the ordinary criminal procedure to be followed in adjudicating the contempt, including the right of jury trial if a punishment greater than a fine of $199 is sought. Because we conclude, therefore, that there is a rational basis for the distinction made by our statutes and rules of practice with regard to summary and nonsummary contempt proceedings, the plaintiff cannot prevail on his unpreserved equal protection claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">In this opinion Peters, C.

General Statutes \u00a7 54-82b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The party accused in a criminal action in the superior court may demand a trial by jury of issues which are triable of right by a jury.

General Statutes \u00a7 51-33 provides: \u201cAny court, including a family support magistrate, may punish by fine and imprisonment any person who in its presence behaves contemptuously or in a disorderly manner; but no court or family support magistrate may impose a greater fine than one hundred dollars or a longer term of imprisonment than six months or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 51-33a provides: \u201ccriminal contempt, (a) Any person who violates the dignity and authority of any court, in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, or any officer of any court who misbehaves in the conduct of his official duties shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>guilty of contempt and shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both.</p>\n<p id=\"ACs\">\u201c(b) No person charged with violating this section may be tried for the violation before the same judge against whom the alleged contempt was perpetrated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Afo\">General Statutes \u00a7 51-35 provides: \u201c(a) Any court or family support magistrate may commit to a community correctional center any person legally summoned who refuses to appear and testify before it in any case, there to remain at his own expense until he so testifies.</p>\n<p id=\"AKP\">\u201c(b) A person shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself, except as otherwise provided by statute, nor shall such evidence when given by him be used against him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\"> Before imposing sentence, the trial court gave the plaintiffs attorney an opportunity to present argument on the plaintiffs behalf. Plaintiffs counsel noted the difference between General Statutes \u00a7 51-33 and Practice Book \u00a7 988, which authorize the trial court summarily to impose a six month sentence when a contempt is committed in its presence, and Practice Book \u00a7 993, which provides, with regard to nonsummary contempt, that \u201c[n]o person shall receive a total effective sentence of more than thirty days imprisonment or a fine in excess of ninety-nine dollars unless he has been afforded the right to a jury trial.\u201d The plaintiffs attorney requested that the trial court take judicial notice that the plaintiffs fears for his personal safety were well founded.

The conduct for which the trial court held the plaintiff in contempt in this case arguably constituted a civil contempt, in that the plaintiff could have \u201cpurged\u201d himself by agreeing to testify. See <em>Mays </em>v. <em>Mays, </em>supra. Because the plaintiff has not challenged the classification of his conduct as criminal contempt, however, we treat his refusal to testify as a criminal contempt in accordance with our precedent.
