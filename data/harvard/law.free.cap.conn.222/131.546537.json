Daniel Friedland, alleging that he had committed professional miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>duct in the representation of four clients. After a hearing, the trial court found the defendant guilty on all counts and ordered that he be permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Connecticut. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion to reconsider, open and set aside the judgment. After a second hearing, at which the defendant appeared and presented evidence, the trial court denied his motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that: (1) the committee failed to present clear and convincing evidence to support the discipline imposed by the trial court; (2) the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant the defendant a continuance; (3) the defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel; and (4) the trial judge should have recused himself from this action. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The defendant was admitted to practice in Connecticut on May 13,1983. On March 2, 1990, the committee filed the presentment that is the subject of this appeal in the Superior Court at Hartford. The presentment was served on the defendant on March 8, 1990, notifying him that a hearing was scheduled for April 10, 1990. The defendant\u2019s attorney appeared at the April 10 hearing and requested a continuance on the defendant\u2019s behalf, which the trial court denied. We shall set forth the remaining facts as they relate to each of the defendant\u2019s four claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The defendant first claims that the committee failed to present clear and convincing evidence of professional misconduct that would support the discipline imposed by the trial court. In addressing this claim, we set forth the evidence presented at the April 10, 1990 hearing separately as it relates to each count of the presentment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">COUNT I - PATRICK WADE</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">On or about March 2, 1988, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) brought a deportation proceeding against Patrick Wade, a permanent resident of the United States and a native and citizen of Jamaica. The testimony of Wade and <em>David </em>Zitzkat established the following facts. Wade retained the defendant and paid him $4000 to represent him in the deportation proceeding. A series of hearings was held by the INS regarding Wade\u2019s deportation. The defendant was unprepared at the first hearing and failed to explain to Wade what had transpired at the second hearing. Wade had to \u201cassume\u201d that the defendant was working on his case. A final hearing on Wade\u2019s deportation was scheduled for April 13,1989, at which neither the defendant nor Wade appeared. According to Wade, the defendant had misinformed him about the hearing date. In Wade\u2019s absence, the INS issued an order of deportation against him. On April 19, 1989, the defendant appealed the deportation order to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Thereafter, Wade retained Zitzkat to represent him. At Zitzkat\u2019s request, Wade obtained his file from the defendant. The file contained a notice from the INS dated December 22,1988, referring to Wade and addressed to M. <em>David </em>Fried-land, which stated in relevant part: \u201cPlease take notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>that the above captioned case will be heard by an Immigration Judge on April 13,1989 @ 4:00 PM at the office of the Immigration Judge . . . .\u201d The notice stated further: \u201cSince you are the attorney/representative of record, this will be the only notice of this hearing issued. The office of the Immigration Judge will not notify your client.\u201d The file also contained an appeal form and an affidavit dated April 19,1989, regarding Wade\u2019s case. The appeal papers, which were signed by the defendant, represented that the only notice of any proceedings that the defendant or Wade had received had been a letter sent to Wade requesting that he appear before the INS on April <em>19, </em>1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">COUNT II - FRANCIS NKWO</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Francis Nkwo<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> testified to the following facts. In October, 1988, Nkwo paid the defendant $750 to assist him in obtaining legal resident status through the INS amnesty program. In the subsequent months, the defendant failed to keep appointments that he had scheduled with Nkwo. In addition, Nkwo was unable to contact the defendant by telephone and for at least one month the defendant\u2019s telephone number was not in service. The defendant failed materially to assist Nkwo with his immigration case and did not return any of the money Nkwo had paid him.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">COUNT III - MARIE BEAUVOIS</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Marie Beauvois testified as follows. In August, 1988, Beauvois retained the defendant and paid him $500 to represent her in a dissolution action. The defendant failed to obtain any pertinent information from Beauvois regarding her marriage. Beauvois called the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>defendant regularly for several months but he never returned her calls. In addition, the defendant did not keep appointments that he had scheduled with Beauvois. Beauvois saw the defendant on only two occasions, first, when she retained him and paid the $500, and once thereafter when she did not have an appointment. The defendant did not return any of the money Beauvois had paid for his services. Beauvois ultimately retained another lawyer to represent her in the dissolution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">COUNT IV - JOSHUA ELNISTON</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Joshua Elniston<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> testified as follows. In January, 1988, Elniston retained the defendant to represent him in a workers\u2019 compensation case. Elniston paid the defendant a total of approximately $600. The last time Elniston saw the defendant was on March 16, 1989, when he paid the defendant $300. A hearing was scheduled on Elniston\u2019s claim for June 12,1989. Prior to the hearing date, Elniston called the defendant repeatedly at his office and at home but was unsuccessful in contacting him. The defendant neither called nor wrote to Elniston before the hearing date. Ultimately, another attorney was appointed to represent Elniston.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">We have held that clear and convincing evidence is the proper standard of proof in attorney disciplinary proceedings. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>215 Conn. 162, 171-72, 575 A.2d 210 (1990). The defendant argues that the evidence presented by the committee at the April 10, 1990 hearing failed to satisfy this standard. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>In the presentment, the committee alleged that the defendant was guilty of misconduct not occurring in the actual presence of the court, involving his character, integrity and professional standing and conduct. Specifically, the committee alleged that the defendant had violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: (a) rule 1.1 with respect to Wade and Elniston; (b) rule 1.3 with respect to Wade, Beauvois and Elniston; (c) rule 1.4 with respect to Nkwo, Beauvois and Elniston; and (d) rule 3.3 with respect to Wade.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Rule 1.1 requires that an attorney provide a client with \u201ccompetent representation,\u201d which includes the \u201cthoroughness\u201d and \u201cpreparation\u201d reasonably necessary to the representation. Wade testified that the defendant had been unprepared for Wade\u2019s first deportation hearing. In addition, the defendant failed to appear or to notify Wade to appear at the April 13, 1989 hearing, which resulted in the entry of an order of deportation against Wade. The defendant also failed to prepare for or appear at the hearing on Elniston\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. As a result of the defendant\u2019s failure, another lawyer was appointed to represent Elniston. On the basis of the foregoing testimony, the trial court could reasonably have concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that the defendant had violated rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Pursuant to rule 1.3, a lawyer must \u201cact with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d Zitzkat testified that the defendant\u2019s file on Wade contained a notice from the INS dated December 22, 1988, regarding Wade\u2019s April 13, 1989 deportation hearing. Although the notice was incorrectly addressed to M. <em>David </em>Friedland, it was sent to the defendant\u2019s business address and contained sufficient information to alert the defendant that Wade\u2019s case was scheduled for a hearing on April 13,1989.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in responding to the notice, which resulted in the entry of a deportation order against Wade. Beauvois testified that the defendant failed to obtain any relevant information from her regarding her marriage. The defendant\u2019s lack of diligence in representing Beauvois <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>led'her to retain another lawyer. Finally, Elniston testified that the defendant provided no assistance in preparing for a hearing on his workers\u2019 compensation claim. The trial court could reasonably have concluded from the foregoing testimony that there was clear and convincing evidence that the defendant had violated rule 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In accordance with rule 1.4, a lawyer \u201cshall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.\u201d In addition, the rule provides that a lawyer \u201cshall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.\u201d Nkwo, Beauvois and Elniston testified that the defendant had failed to keep them informed about the status of their cases. The defendant failed to keep appointments or otherwise reasonably communicate with Nkwo and Beauvois. Moreover, he did not respond to efforts by Nkwo, Beauvois and Elniston to contact him and, for a period of time, did not even maintain a working telephone number. The trial court could reasonably have concluded that the testimony of Nkwo, Beauvois and Elniston established by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant had violated rule 1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The committee also alleged that the defendant had violated rule 3.3 with respect to his representation of Wade. Rule 3.3 (a) (1) provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not knowingly . . . [m]ake a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal.\u201d When Zitzkat received Wade\u2019s file from the defendant, he discovered the December 22,1988 notice from the INS notifying the defendant that Wade\u2019s deportation hearing was scheduled for April 13, 1989. The notice stated that this would be the only notification of the hearing that either the defendant or Wade would receive. In the appeal papers that the defendant filed with the Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Immigration Appeals on Wade\u2019s behalf, however, the defendant stated that the only notice of any proceedings had been a letter sent to Wade requesting that he appear before the INS on April <em>19, </em>1989.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Relying on Zitzkat\u2019s testimony and the documents in the defendant\u2019s file on Wade, which were admitted as exhibits at the April 10, 1990 hearing, the trial court could reasonably have concluded that the defendant had made a false statement of material fact to a tribunal in violation of rule 3.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In addition to the testimony of Wade, Nkwo, Beauvois and Elniston, the committee presented evidence, which the defendant has not disputed, that the defendant had previously been disbarred in another state.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court had the unique opportunity to assess the evidence presented in light of all the circumstances, including the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses. See <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>186 Conn. 387, 391, 441 A.2d 629 (1982). Our review on appeal is limited to a determination of whether the trial court\u2019s assessment of the evidence was clearly erroneous. Id., 391-92. We are persuaded that the trial court could reasonably have concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that the defendant had engaged in professional misconduct as alleged in the presentment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request for a continuance. The defendant argues that he was unprepared for trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>on April 10, 1990, because in a prior presentment against him, the committee\u2019s attorney had treated the first hearing as a status conference. The committee contends that one attorney\u2019s handling of the earlier presentment was not binding on it and that the defendant had been notified prior to April 10,1990, that the committee planned to \u201cgo forward\u201d on that date. We conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">At the April 10 hearing, the defendant\u2019s attorney, Norman Whitney, requested a continuance on the defendant\u2019s behalf. Whitney informed the court that the defendant, who was living in Florida, had called him the previous day and had asked him to attend the hearing to ask for a continuance. Whitney acknowledged that the defendant had been notified of the hearing date when he was served with the presentment on March 8,1990, and had since been informed by the committee\u2019s attorney, Darlene Reynolds, that she was \u201cgoing forward\u201d with the presentment. Whitney told the court that on the basis of the defendant\u2019s previous experience with the committee, the defendant had interpreted the term \u201cgoing forward\u201d to mean a status conference and not an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>At the May 29, 1990 hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to open, the defendant presented evidence regarding his communications with the committee prior to the April 10 hearing date.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant called Christine Whitehead, the attorney who had tried the prior presentment on behalf of the committee. Whitehead testified that when she was handling the first presentment, she had informed the defendant that it was her practice to treat the first court appearance as a status conference. She testified that she usually followed this practice because of the volume of cases in Hartford but could not represent how other attorneys for the committee handled presentments.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The defendant also called Reynolds, who testified as follows. On March 8, 1990, when the defendant was served with the presentment, he had indicated to Reynolds that he would not be able to attend the April 10 hearing for financial reasons and asked if she would consider agreeing to factual stipulations. On March 23, Reynolds contacted the defendant by telephone in Florida to discuss relevant factual stipulations, but they were unable to agree on any. At that time, Reynolds informed the defendant that she planned to \u201cgo forward\u201d with the hearing on April 10. The defendant again told Reynolds that he could not afford to attend the hearing. After the defendant referred to how Whitehead had handled the prior presentment, Reynolds told him that she did not intend to continue this matter. On April 9, the defendant telephoned Reynolds to ask about the status of the case. When Reynolds informed him that the hearing was scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>for the following day, the defendant reiterated that he could not afford to attend and suggested that she ask for a continuance. Reynolds told the defendant that she did not intend to request a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u201c \u2018A motion for continuance is addressed to the discretion of the trial court, and its ruling wall not be overturned absent a showing of a clear abuse of that discretion.\u2019 . . . <em>We are especially hesitant to find an abuse of discretion where the court has denied a motion for continuance made on the day of trial. . . . </em>\u2018Every reasonable presumption in favor of the proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion will be made.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added; citations omitted.) <em>Thode </em>v. <em>Thode, </em>190 Conn. 694, 697, 462 A.2d 4 (1983). Because there is no \u201cmechanical\u201d test for determining whether the denial of a continuance constitutes an abuse of discretion, we must consider the particular circumstances of each case, paying special attention to the reasons presented to the trial court at the time the request was denied. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>198 Conn. 43, 47-48, 501 A.2d 752 (1985); <em>Ridgeway </em>v. <em>Ridgeway, </em>180 Conn. 533, 539, 429 A.2d 801 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The principal reason presented by Whitney in support of the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance was that the defendant had relied on the procedure followed in the prior presentment, and therefore expected the April 10 hearing to be a status conference only. We have stated that a defendant does not have an \u201cabsolute\u201d right to a continuance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>supra, 47; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>167 Conn. 80, 83, 355 A.2d 6 (1974). In the present case, despite his receipt of timely notice of the hearing and the fact that Reynolds had told him nearly three weeks earlier that she did not intend to follow Whitehead\u2019s practice and that she would be \u201cgoing forward\u201d on the scheduled date, the defendant argues that he reasonably relied on the procedure followed by Whitehead in the prior presentment. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>court concluded, however, that as an experienced attorney, the defendant could reasonably be expected to understand that \u201cgoing forward\u201d meant a trial or evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree. Accordingly, we are persuaded that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The defendant also claims that he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the defendant claims that Whitney provided ineffective assistance at the April 10, 1990 hearing in that he allowed the trial judge to set the pace of the proceedings, failed to review relevant files, failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>call witnesses or to present evidence, and failed to raise the claim that April 10 was a major Jewish holiday in support of the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The committee argues that the defendant\u2019s claim is not properly before this court because the right to effective assistance of counsel attaches only in criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Pursuant to the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, a defendant in a <em>criminal </em>proceeding has the right to the assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We have held that defendants in certain <em>civil </em>proceedings also have a constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. See <em>Lavertue </em>v. <em>Niman, </em>196 Conn. 403, 412, 493 A.2d 213 (1985) (indigent defendants in state-supported paternity actions have a right, under both the federal and state constitutions, to court-appointed counsel at state expense). The right to counsel necessarily implies a right to the effective assistance of such counsel. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>179 Conn. 155, 159, 425 A.2d 939 (1979) (right to effective assistance of counsel is implicit in statute mandating the assistance of counsel in proceedings for the termination of parental rights). \u201cThe proceeding to disbar [or suspend] an attorney is neither a civil action nor a criminal proceeding, but is a proceeding sui generis, the object of which is not the punishment of the offender, but the protection of the court. . . .\u201d (Cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tions omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>219 Conn. 473, 483, 595 A.2d 819 (1991), cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 1170, 117 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1992). The defendant has cited no authority in support of his argument that an attorney in a disciplinary proceeding has a constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. Because we discern no special circumstances in this case that would warrant departure from the general rule that civil proceedings ordinarily do not give rise to a right to counsel, we decline to address the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial judge should have recused himself from this action. The defendant contends that the judge, the Honorable Samuel Freed, had a personal bias against him as a result of having presided over previous matters involving the defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In support of his claim, the defendant cites certain comments made by Judge Freed at the April 10, 1990 hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant argues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>therefore, that Judge Freed should have recused himself in accordance with canon 3 (C) (1) (a) of the Code of Judicial Conduct.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The committee argues that the defendant\u2019s claim of judicial bias was not properly preserved and, therefore, this court should decline to address it. We agree with the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The defendant did not properly preserve his claim of judicial bias because he failed to move for disqualification of Judge Freed at the April 10, 1990 hearing. \u201cAs a general rule, even in cases alleging judicial bias, this court will not consider the issue on appeal where the party failed to make the proper motion for disqualification at trial. . . . Failure to request recusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>or move for a mistrial can be construed as the functional equivalent of consenting to the judge\u2019s presiding over the trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>20 Conn. App. 6, 8-9, 564 A.2d 610, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 808, 568 A.2d 793 (1989). \u201cOnly in the most exceptional circumstances will this court consider a claim that was not raised [below]. . . . Such exceptional circumstances may occur where a new and unforeseen constitutional right has arisen between the time of trial and appeal or where the record supports a claim that a litigant has been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. ... An exception may also be made where consideration of the question is in the interest of public welfare or of justice between the parties.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corporation, </em>222 Conn. 62, 68-69, 607 A.2d 431 (1992); see Practice Book \u00a7 4185. We conclude that no such exceptional circumstances exist in the present case, and, therefore, we decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In proceedings against an attorney for professional misconduct, \u201c[the] defendant is entitled to notice of the charges against him, to a fair hearing, and a fair determination, in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, of the questions at issue, and to an appeal to this court for the purpose of having it determined whether or not he has in some substantial manner been deprived of such rights. . . . The ultimate question is whether he is a fit person to be longer allowed the privileges of being an attorney. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Grievance Committee of the Bar of New Haven County </em>v. <em>Sinn, </em>128 Conn. 419, 422, 23 A.2d 516 (1941). The defendant attorney\u2019s \u201crelations to the tribunal and the character and purpose of the inquiry are such that unless it clearly appears that his rights have in some substantial way been denied him, the action of the court will not be set aside upon review.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>In the present case, the defendant received timely notice of the charges against him and was given the opportunity to be heard. The defendant\u2019s attorney appeared at the hearing and had the opportunity to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses and make argument on the defendant\u2019s behalf. We are persuaded that the defendant has not been deprived of his rights in any substantial manner and, accordingly, we affirm the order of the trial court permanently disbarring the defendant from the practice of law in the state of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Callahan and Borden, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\"> The defendant also filed a motion for articulation and correction of the record for appeal, which he subsequently amended. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s amended motion with respect to his request that the record include the transcript of a hearing concerning a prior presentment held on November 3,1989, before the Honorable Norris L.

He claims further that he did not receive the December 22,1988 notice until after April 19,1989, when he requested Wade\u2019s file from the INS. Because we conclude that the defendant knowingly forfeited the opportunity to testify at the April 10, 1990 hearing; see part II infra; we decline to address these claims on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b159-9\"> Zitzkat initially filed an appeal on Wade\u2019s behalf representing the same facts. After discovering the December 22, 1988 notice in the defendant\u2019s file, however, Zitzkat amended Wade\u2019s appeal to state that the defendant had in fact received notice of the April 13, 1989 hearing. Zitzkat included a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the amended appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b159-10\"> At the April 10, 1990 hearing, the committee\u2019s attorney initially stated that the defendant had been disbarred in Illinois in 1982, but other references in the transcript and briefs are to Indiana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\"> Whitney also represented to the court that the defendant \u201c[did not] have a dime\u201d to pay for traveling to Connecticut and that the defendant\u2019s wife had been in the hospital \u201cthe day before.\u201d At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to open on May 29,1990, the defendant testified that his wife had been placed in a rehabilitation program after the prior presentment and that he had communicated that fact to Reynolds. Reynolds testified, however, that she did not recall any conversations with the defendant regarding his wife\u2019s health prior to the April 10,1990 hearing. The defendant requested the trial court\u2019s permission at the May 29 hearing to document his wife\u2019s medical problems. The court ruled that, even assuming evidence of the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s medical condition as of April 10, he'was incorrect, nevertheless, in assuming that April 10 was to be only a scheduling date and status conference. The transcript reveals that the court did not deny the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment on the basis of insufficiency of evidence concerning the wife\u2019s medical problems. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to open the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> The defendant claimed for the first time at the May 29 hearing that the trial court should have granted him a continuance because April 10 was a major Jewish holiday. Reynolds testified that the defendant had made no reference to the holiday in a telephone conversation they had on April 9, 1990. Because the defendant\u2019s attorney did not raise this claim at the April 10 hearing, the trial court acted within its discretion in denying this basis for opening the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\"> During argument on the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">\u201cThe Court: What were the exact words you used?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">\u201cMs. Reynolds: Attorney Friedland was told that the Statewide Grievance Committee was prepared to go forward on this date. There was no indication of any misunderstanding of what the term going forward meant. I would suggest that there is no ambiguity in the term going forward. Any understanding or any agreement that Attorney Friedland had with another Attorney on another matter, I would suggest, does not have any relevance to this proceeding today.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">\u201cAttorney Friedland was properly served over four weeks ago. And he did indicate four weeks ago that he did not plan on attending for financial reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">\u201cMr. Whitney: Might I add one thing, Your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">\u201cThe Court: Sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">\u201cMr. Whitney: The going forward is something a Judge can rule upon. But, Mr. Friedland\u2014and the record before Judge Norris O\u2019Neill will show that [he] never had any arrangement with Christine Whitehead as to procedure\u2014he wanted to try it. He was not allowed to. He thought, this is exactly the same thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">\u201cThe Court: But he was told. I mean, any lawyer, in my experience knows that going forward doesn\u2019t mean entering a plea. I mean, going forward to me always meant to me only one thing, the trial would proceed or the evidence would be taken. That\u2019s what going forward means to anybody who has ever been in a Court. I would think\u2014Mr. Friedland is not a babe in the woods here. He knows what going to Court and what going forward means, as I am sure you do.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"><em> </em>We note that despite this claim, the defendant retained the same attorney to represent him in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\u201d In <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.

Because I believe that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to grant a reasonable continuance, I disagree with part II of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Although I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion in part IV that the defendant, M. Daniel Friedland, did not properly preserve the claim of judicial bias, the colloquy between the trial court and counsel for the defendant upon which the defendant relies for this claim cannot be viewed in isolation from the rest of the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That colloquy, taken in conjunction with the following facts, clearly supports the defendant on the issue of a continuance: (l)the attorney from the statewide grievance committee who handled the first presentment, and whom the defendant thought was also handling the second presentment, admitted that it was her practice to treat the first court appearance as a status conference only; (2) before the court date, the defendant represented that he had insufficient funds to travel to Connecticut from Florida; (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>defendant\u2019s wife was taken to the hospital shortly before the hearing; (4) the defendant was required to care for his five year old son; and (5) the defendant did not previously request a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Furthermore, there was no showing that witnesses would be inconvenienced if the court granted the continuance, nor was there any indication that the profession or individual clients would be subject to any harm as a result of the continuance. Indeed, the defendant was not actively practicing in Connecticut and he previously agreed to an interim suspension of his right to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Attorneys, like other citizens, are entitled to due process of law and justice. \u201c \u2018Due process does not mandate a particular procedure but rather requires only that certain safeguards exist in whatever procedural form is afforded.\u2019 <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>196 Conn. 172, 176, 491 A.2d 1084, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 920, 106 S.

Ed. 2d 258 (1985). \u2018In [presentment] proceedings such as this a defendant is entitled to notice of the charges against him, to a fair hearing, and a fair determination, in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, of the questions at issue, and to an appeal to this court for the purpose of having it determined whether or not he has in some substantial manner been deprived of such rights.\u2019 <em>Grievance Committee of the Bar of New Haven County </em>v. <em>Sinn, </em>128 Conn. 419, 422, 23 A.2d 516 (1941).\u201d <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>215 Conn. 162, 169, 575 A.2d 210 (1990). Because I would find that the trial court had abused its discretion in not allowing the continuance, I would remand the case for a new hearing.
