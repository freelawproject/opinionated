The plaintiff is Joan Dubois, widow of the deceased, Arthur Dubois.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The facts are essentially undisputed. The plaintiff married Arthur Dubois on June 30, 1956. From October 11, 1958, through November 12, 1988, Arthur Dubois was employed by the defendant. Dubois was totally disabled from October 20,1988, through November 12, 1988. On November 12, 1988, Dubois died of respiratory failure and lung cancer. At the time of Dubois\u2019 death, the plaintiff was living with him and was wholly or mainly supported by him. On October 6,1989, a notice of claim for widow\u2019s benefits was served upon the defendant via certified mail. On October 10,1989, a notice of claim was served upon the commissioner. On October 27, 1989, one of the defendant\u2019s insurers filed a notice of intention to contest liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">On March 9,1990, the plaintiff filed a motion to preclude the defendant from contesting her right to receive benefits. This motion was dismissed on May 3, 1990. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a motion to correct this ruling, which was granted by the commissioner on August 3,1990. Thereafter, the commissioner granted the motion to preclude, and later awarded benefits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the plaintiff. The defendant appealed this decision to the review division, which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The defendant has appealed the review division\u2019s decision, claiming that it improperly: (1) concluded that the notice of claim given in the present case satisfied the address requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 31-294;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) failed to apply General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b), as amended by Public Acts 1990, No. 90-116, \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>rendering its decision. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We affirm the decision of the review division.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The defendant first argues that the notice of claim given pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-294 was insufficient to preclude its defenses under General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b). The defendant further argues that since the notice of claim was deficient, the commissioner was without jurisdiction to grant the plaintiffs motion to preclude. An understanding of the relevant statutory provisions is necessary in order to evaluate this claim properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Section 31-294 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo proceedings for [workers\u2019] compensation . . . shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given .... Such notice . . . shall state, in simple language, the date and place of the accident and the nature of the injury resulting therefrom . . . <em>and the name and address of the employee and of the person in whose interest compensation is claimed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 31-297 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[W]henever liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer, he shall file with the compensation commissioner, on or before the twentieth day after he has received a written notice of claim, a notice . . . stating [inter alia] that the right to compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>is contested . . . and the specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested, and a copy thereof shall be sent to the employee. <em>If the employer </em>. . . <em>fails to file the notice contesting liability within the time prescribed herein, the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of such alleged injury or death and shall have no right thereafter to contest the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation on any grounds or the extent of his disability </em>. . . . <em>\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201cAlthough the phrase, \u2018written notice of claim,\u2019 in \u00a7 31-297 (b) does not specifically refer to the phrase, \u2018written notice of claim for compensation,\u2019 in \u00a7 31-294, it is clear that both statutory sections refer to the same notice.\u201d <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Caron Pipe Jacking, Inc., </em>13 Conn. App. 276, 280, 535 A.2d 1321, cert. denied, 207 Conn. 805, 540 A.2d 393 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">According to the defendant, the notice of claim was inadequate in that \u201cno address at all was provided to identify the employee\u201d and that \u201c[o]nly the address of the person in whose interest compensation was claimed was provided.\u201d A copy of the notice at issue reveals that the address was provided, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">\u201cJoan Dubois (widow of Arthur Dubois Sr.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afr\">(Signature of Injured Employee)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">278 Ross Hill</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahp\">Lisbon CT 06351</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abq\">(Address)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">By /s/Matthew Shafner</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avr\">Attorney\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Upon consideration of the facts of this case, and the policy behind the \u00a7 31-297 (b) preclusion, we conclude that this notice satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 31-294. \u201cWe recently interpreted \u00a7 31-297 (b) in <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 430-31, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988), where, quoting <em>Menzies </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>165 Conn. 338, 343, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>334 A.2d 452 (1973), we stated: \u2018 \u201cThe object which the legislature sought to accomplish [was] plain. . . . [It] was amended to ensure (1) that employers would bear the burden of investigating a claim promptly and (2) that employees would be timely apprised of the specific reasons for the denial of their claims. These effects would, in turn, diminish delays in the proceedings, discourage arbitrary refusal of bona fide claims and narrow the legal issues which were to be contested.\u201d \u2019 We have also stated that \u2018[w]e are mindful of the principles underlying Connecticut practice in workmen\u2019s compensation cases: that the legislation is remedial in nature; <em>Kennerson </em>v. <em>Thames Towboat Co., </em>89 Conn. 367, 375, 94 A. 372 (1915); and that it should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose. <em>DeCarli </em>v. <em>Manchester Public Warehouse Co., </em>107 Conn. 359, 364, 140 A. 637 (1928).\u2019 <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 117, 411 A.2d 924 (1979).\u201d <em>Ash </em>v. <em>New Milford, </em>207 Conn. 665, 672-73, 541 A.2d 1233 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">When these principles are applied to the present case, it is clear that the notice was sufficient to allow the defendant to make a timely investigation of the claim. The plaintiff, Joan Dubois, has the same last name as the deceased employee, Arthur Dubois. The plaintiff states in her notice of claim that she is the widow of the deceased employee, and she provides the address of their family domicile as the proper place to make an inquiry. The notice leaves no doubt that this is a claim for death benefits, as the cause of injury refers to: \u201cExposure to lung irritants/asbestosis that caused death DOD 11-12-88 Lung Cancer.\u201d In light of these facts, we hold that the notice of claim at issue substantially complied with \u00a7 31-294 and that therefore, the commissioner had jurisdiction to grant the plaintiff\u2019s motion to preclude. See <em>Collins </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>210 Conn. 423, 555 A.2d 981 (1989) (since the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>notice satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 31-294, the commissioner had jurisdiction to award benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c). We further find that under these facts, the purposes of \u00a7 31-297 (b) were not violated by precluding the defendant\u2019s defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The defendant next argues that the review division should have, considered the adequacy of the plaintiff\u2019s notice of claim filed on October 6, 1989, according to the requirements of \u00a7 31-297 (b) as amended by Public Acts 1990, No. 90-116, \u00a7 9. The amendment added to \u00a7 31-297 (b) as of October 1,1990, the provision that \u201cthe employer shall not be conclusively presumed to have accepted compensability when the written notice of claim . . . fails to include a warning that the employer shall be precluded from contesting liability unless a notice contesting liability is filed within the time period set forth in this section.\u201d The defendant argues that the amended statute should be applied retroactively, and that since the notice of claim at issue did not contain the warning to the employer now required by \u00a7 31-297 (b), the decision of the review division must be reversed. Although this issue was not raised before the review division, the defendant argues that we may nonetheless consider it under the plain error doctrine. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u201cOnly in the most exceptional circumstances will this court consider a claim that was not raised [below].\u201d <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>187 Conn. 94, 99, 444 A.2d 907 (1982); see Practice Book \u00a7 4185. \u201cSuch exceptional circumstances may occur where a new and unforeseen constitutional right has arisen between the time of trial and appeal or where the record supports a claim that a litigant has been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>182 Conn. 262, 267, 438 A.2d 80 (1980); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>v. Evans, </em>[165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973)]. An exception may also be made where consideration of the question is in the interest of public welfare or of justice between the parties.\u201d <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 100. No such exceptional circumstances exist in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Furthermore, \u201c[pjlain error is properly reserved for those extraordinary situations where the error is so obvious that the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial process would be impaired were we to fail to address an issue that was not raised or preserved at trial.\u201d <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Youth Challenge of Greater Hartford, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 657, 671, 594 A.2d 958 (1991). We conclude that this is not a case that would justify consideration of an issue raised for the first time on appeal under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The decision of the compensation review division is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-294 (a) provides: \u201cAny employee who has sustained an injury in the course of his employment shall forthwith notify his employer, or some person representing his employer, of such injury; and, on his failure to give such notice, the commissioner may reduce the award of compensation proportionately to any prejudice which he finds the employer has sustained by reason of such failure; but the burden of proof with respect to such prejudice shall rest upon the employer. No proceedings for compensation under the provisions of this chapter shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given within one year from the date of the accident or within three years from the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, as the case may be, which caused the personal injury, provided, if death has resulted within two years from the date of the accident or first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease, a dependent or dependents, or the legal representative of the deceased employee, may make claim for compensation within such two-year period or within one year from the date of death, whichever is later. Such notice may be given to the employer or any commissioner and shall state, in simple language, the date and place of the accident and the nature of the injury resulting therefrom, or the date of the first manifestation of a symptom of the occupational disease and the nature of such disease, as the case may be, and the name and address of the employee and of the person in whose interest compensation is claimed. An employee of the state shall send a copy of such notice to the commissioner of administrative services.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-297 (b), as amended, provides: \u201cExcept as provided in subsection (c) of this section, whenever liability to pay compensation is contested by the employer, he shall file with the compensation commissioner, on or before the twentieth day after he has received a written notice of claim, a notice in accord with a form prescribed by the commissioners stating that the right to compensation is contested, the name of the claimant, the name of the employer, the date of the alleged injury or death and the specific grounds on which the right to compensation is contested, and a copy thereof shall be sent to the employee. If the employer or his legal representative fails to file the notice contesting liability within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the time prescribed herein, the employer shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the compensability of such alleged injury or death and shall have no right thereafter to contest the employee\u2019s right to receive compensation on any grounds or the extent of his disability, provided the employer shall not be conclusively presumed to have accepted compensability when the written notice of claim has not been properly served in accordance with section 31-321 or when the written notice of claim fails to include a warning that the employer shall be precluded from contesting liability unless a notice contesting liability is filed within the time period set forth in this section.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
