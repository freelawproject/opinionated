Thus, he must establish not only that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, but that as a result thereof he suffered actual prejudice, namely, \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674, reh. denied, 467 U.S. 1267, 104 S. Ct. 3562, 82 L. Ed. 2d 864 (1984). In this context, a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d does not require the petitioner to show that \u201ccounsel\u2019s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.\u201d Id., 693. Rather, it merely requires the petitioner to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>lish \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id., 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The dispositive issue of this habeas corpus appeal is whether, under the facts of this case, the petitioner suffered \u201cprejudice\u201d within the meaning of <em>Strickland </em>by the failure of his appellate counsel to raise on appeal a claim that the trial court, at his criminal trial, gave an improper instruction to the jury. The petitioner claims that the state\u2019s burden of proof was improperly diluted when the jury was told that, in drawing an inference from circumstantial evidence, \u201cthe inference asked to be drawn is not only logical and reasonable, but it is more probable than not that the fact to be inferred is true.\u201d The petitioner appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the habeas court dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He claims that the court improperly rejected his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because as a matter of law: (1) the failure of his counsel to raise on appeal a claim of dilution of the burden of proof, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 502 A.2d 360 (1985), and its progeny, established prejudice; and (2) that same failure also established his counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>We hold that the petitioner did not suffer prejudice, and, therefore, we affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The petitioner\u2019s claims arise out of the direct appeal of his conviction of three counts of manslaughter in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1), and two counts of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunkley, </em>202 Conn. 629, 522 A.2d 795 (1987). The petitioner filed this habeas corpus petition challenging the performance of his counsel on that appeal. He claims that his counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the claim that \u201cthe trial court [had] wrongfully charged the jury regarding the standard by which the jury can draw inferences,\u201d and that he was prejudiced because, had his counsel raised such an argument on appeal, his conviction would have been reversed and a new trial would have been ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"A2YL\">The habeas court found the following facts. In August, 1982, the petitioner was arrested and was later charged with three counts of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3), two counts of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), and one count of failure to stop when signalled in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 14-223 (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These charges arose out of the following factual scenario. At approximately noon on August 13, 1982, after attempting to shoplift some clothes from a store on Silver Lane in East Hartford, the petitioner left the store and drove from the store parking lot at a high rate of speed in a Lincoln automobile. Officer Richard Rohner of the East Hartford police department, who was in a police vehicle, saw the petitioner\u2019s car speed through the parking lot onto Forbes Street. Rohner followed the car and signalled with both his siren and flashing light for the petitioner to stop, but he failed to do so, went through a red light and turned west onto Silver Lane. Silver Lane is a four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>lane highway that runs generally east and west. At this time, traffic was heavy in both directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Rohner pursued the petitioner\u2019s car and radioed for assistance. Officer Patricia Topliff responded to Rohner\u2019s call and joined the chase on Silver Lane. Rohner pursued the petitioner at speeds reaching sixty miles per hour. During the chase, the petitioner passed another vehicle on the right, cut over to the left and struck that vehicle. The petitioner then swerved back and forth in the westbound lanes, went off the road, and crossed the center line into the eastbound lane and straddled the center line, missing another vehicle by inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The petitioner\u2019s car then crossed over the center line into the eastbound lane and struck head on a car driven by Eleanor Mitchell, killing Mitchell and her two daughters, and seriously injuring her son and his friend, who were passengers in the Mitchell vehicle. The petitioner admitted that at the moment of impact he was driving the Lincoln at approximately sixty to seventy miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">At his trial in May, 1984, the petitioner conceded that he was guilty of failure to stop when signalled and of the lesser included offenses of misconduct with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-57, or negligent homicide with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-222a,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but argued that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>not guilty of the manslaughter and assault charges.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In its charge to the jury on circumstantial evidence, the trial court included the following language, which forms the crux of the petitioner\u2019s claim in this case: \u201cThis rule [of circumstantial evidence] involves the offering of evidence of facts from which you are asked to infer the existence of another fact, or set of facts. Such an inference may be made, provided two elements in the application of this rule are satisfied: first, that the fact from which you are asked to draw the inference has itself been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and second, that the inference asked to be drawn is not only logical and reasonable, <em>but is strong enough so that you can find that it is more probable than not that the fact to be inferred is true. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The jury found the petitioner guilty of the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the second degree and assault in the third degree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In his direct appeal from the ensuing judgment of conviction, the petitioner was represented by attorney Jon Schoenhorn,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> who was assisted on the brief by attorney Kathleen Murrett. Schoenhorn was responsible for the handling of the appeal and wrote the brief, except for two issues written by Murrett and edited by Schoenhorn. Although they raised seven claims of trial court error, the petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel did not invoke <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>supra, to challenge the trial court\u2019s instruction on circumstantial evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunkley, </em>supra, 632. It is undisputed that <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>supra, was decided on December 17,1985; see id.; and that the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>argued in this court on November 4, 1986. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bunkley, </em>supra. This court affirmed the petitioner\u2019s conviction on the direct appeal. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Having found these facts, the habeas court in this case focused on the prejudice requirement of <em>Strickland. </em>The habeas court read that requirement to mean that, where a habeas petitioner challenges the effectiveness of his appellate counsel, he must establish that, but for appellate counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of his trial would have been different. Thus, considering that the petitioner was required to establish \u201cby a reasonable probability, that the jury would have acquitted him but for the [unchallenged] instruction,\u201d the habeas court concluded that he had not met that requirement because \u201c[t]he evidence submitted indicates otherwise.\u201d Accordingly, the habeas court dismissed the petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We first consider the petitioner\u2019s claim that the habeas court, when considering the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland, </em>improperly focused on the probable result of the petitioner\u2019s trial rather than the probable result of his appeal. The petitioner argues that, under <em>Strickland, </em>prejudice resulting from the deficient performance of appellate counsel means that there is a reasonable probability that, but for that performance, the result of the appeal would have been different\u2014the appeal would have resulted in a reversal of the conviction and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The petitioner follows this argument with the contention that, gauged by this standard, he has established prejudice because on his direct appeal this court \u201cwould have reversed his conviction on all counts if the Court had heard a claim under the doctrine of <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>supra.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He points out that in both his case and <em>Rodgers </em>the primary dispute at trial involved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>mental state of the accused, that in both cases the resolution of that dispute depended on the jury\u2019s assessment of circumstantial evidence, and that the trial court in his case gave a charge on circumstantial evidence identical to the charge held to be reversible error in <em>Rodgers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Relying, therefore, on this court\u2019s analysis in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 757, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), the petitioner argues that the offending portion of the trial court\u2019s charge would have been viewed by this court in isolation from the remainder of the charge and that, so viewed, it would have yielded a reversal of his conviction and a new trial. This is particularly so, the petitioner asserts, because the trial court \u201caugmented the constitutional harm of its instruction\u201d by specifically permitting the jury to use inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence to arrive at the ultimate elements of the offenses charged. Furthermore, the petitioner argues, in light of his trial counsel\u2019s concession of his guilt of the lesser included offense of negligent homicide; see footnote 8, supra; the jury\u2019s determination of his mental state was the \u201csole determinant\u201d regarding whether he was guilty of the crimes originally charged, of the lesser included offenses of which he was found guilty, or of the lesser included offenses of which he conceded his guilt. Therefore, the petitioner contends that since this court would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>reversed his conviction and granted him a new trial, he has established prejudice under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The respondent argues, on the contrary, that \u201c[t]he petitioner must show a reasonable probability that the result at trial would have been different.\u201d Thus, under the respondent\u2019s view, the petitioner must establish not only that he would have been entitled to a reversal on appeal, but also \u201cthat the [unchallenged] instruction likely affected the result at trial.\u201d The respondent also argues that, if we were to focus on the result of the appeal, we should reconsider the <em>Rodgers </em>line of authority, on which the petitioner relies, that on appeal the jury instruction in question must be viewed in isolation in a case where, as here, mental state was the principal issue in the petitioner\u2019s trial. The respondent argues that the standard of review of such an instruction purportedly adopted by this court in <em>Rodgers </em>and its progeny was incorrect, and that under the proper standard of review the petitioner would not have been entitled to a reversal of his conviction even if his appellate counsel had raised the claim. Therefore, the respondent contends, the petitioner has not established prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">We agree with the respondent that in this case the proper focus under the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland </em>is the result of the trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude that, in order for the petitioner to establish prejudice resulting from his appellate counsel\u2019s deficient performance, he must establish that, as a result of that performance, there remains a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict that resulted in his appeal. Put another way, he must establish that, because of the failure of his appellate counsel to raise a <em>Rodgers </em>claim, there is a reasonable probability that he remains burdened by an unreliable determination of his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>In <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 671, the United States Supreme Court \u201cconsider[ed] the proper standards forjudging a criminal defendant\u2019s contention that the Constitution requires a conviction . . . be set aside because counsel\u2019s assistance at the trial . . . was ineffective.\u201d In the context of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the court held that such a contention \u201chas two components. First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d Id., 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The constitutional right of a criminal defendant to the effective assistance of counsel also includes the right to such assistance on the defendant\u2019s first appeal as of right. <em>Evitts </em>v. <em>Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387, 105 S. Ct. 830, 83 L. Ed. 2d 821 (1985). We have adopted the two-part <em>Strickland </em>analysis in the context of a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>216 Conn. 678, 690, 583 A.2d 1277 (1990); <em>Valeriano </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>209 Conn. 75, 83-84, 546 A.2d 1380 (1988). Thus, a habeas corpus petitioner seeking to establish such ineffectiveness must prove both deficient performance and prejudice resulting therefrom. <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra. Neither the United States Supreme Court nor this court, however, has specifically defined the meaning of \u201cprejudice\u201d in the context of a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>We find convincing guidance, however, in the fundamental rationale of <em>Strickland, </em>namely, the overarching emphasis on the necessity for ensuring the reliability of the verdict that is under attack. The court in <em>Strickland </em>repeatedly defined prejudice in terms of that necessity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Given that emphasis, it cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>doubted that, if the issue before us were whether the petitioner had been prejudiced by his <em>trial </em>counsel\u2019s failure to object to the \u201cmore probable than not\u201d language in the jury instructions, rather than whether he was prejudiced by his <em>appellate </em>counsel\u2019s failure to raise on appeal precisely the same improper instruction by the trial court, the appropriate inquiry would be whether there was a reasonable probability that, but for his trial counsel\u2019s failure, the verdict would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Moreover, that inquiry into the prejudice resulting from the petitioner\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance would require us to consider not solely the offending language of the instruction in isolation from the remainder of the charge, but also \u201cthe totality of the evidence before the . . . jury.\u201d <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 695. It would also require us to consider whether particular language of the instruction \u201chad a pervasive effect on the inferences to be drawn from the evidence,\u201d or whether it had, on the contrary, \u201can isolated, trivial effect.\u201d Id., 695-96. Furthermore, it would require us to take into account that \u201ca verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\u201d Id., 696. Finally, it would not require in a habeas proceeding that we find the error of trial counsel harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, despite the constitutional nature of the misstatement in the charge that trial counsel had failed to call to the court\u2019s attention, for which the harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt standard would be applicable on direct appeal. Thus, \u201c[tjaking the unaffected findings as a given, and taking due account of the effect of the errors on the remaining findings, a court making the prejudice inquiry must ask if the defendant has met the burden of showing that the decision reached would reasonably likely have been different absent the errors.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We conclude that the same inquiry should apply to this case, where the petitioner seeks, by way of an attack on his appellate counsel\u2019s performance, the same remedy that he sought by way of a contemporaneous attack on his trial counsel's performance; see footnote 3, supra; namely, a new trial. He seeks that new trial, moreover, by way of the same claimed error by the trial court, namely, the inclusion of the \u201cmore probable than not language\u201d in the jury charge. By either route-ineffective assistance of trial counsel or of appellate counsel\u2014his aim is to overturn the jury\u2019s verdict. We see no principled reason why he should have a different, more relaxed,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> burden of establishing prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>simply because he couches his claim in terms of the misconduct of his appellate counsel rather than of his trial counsel. In either case his burden should be the same: to establish that, based upon the totality of the evidence before the jury and upon the likely effect of the instructional error, as a result of the error of the trial court that was not brought to the attention of either that court or this court on his direct appeal, there is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict that he seeks to overturn.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">This conclusion, moreover, is consistent with the nature of the relationship between a trial and an appeal. \u201cThe trial of a criminal case, and the ensuing appeal from a judgment of conviction, are not separate and distinct proceedings divorced from one another. They are part of the continuum of the process of adjudication. Stated in the most elementary terms, the trial seeks to determine whether the state has proven the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The appeal seeks to determine whether, in the process of that adjudication, the trial judge committed error which requires either a new trial or a judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosby, </em>6 Conn. App. 164, 173-74, 504 A.2d 1071 (1986). \u201c \u2018The very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is that partisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>Evitts </em>v. <em>Lucey, </em>supra, 394, quoting <em>Herring </em>v. <em>New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 862, 95 S. Ct. 2550, 45 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">An appeal is no less a part of that adversary system than is a trial. Indeed, the appellate harmless error doctrine is rooted in that fundamental purpose of our criminal justice system\u2014to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent. \u201c \u2018The harmless error doctrine recognizes the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. 225, 230 [95 S. Ct. 2160, 45 L. Ed. 2d 141] (1975), and promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 577, 106 S. Ct. 3101, 92 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1986), <em>quoting Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Thus, since \u201c[t]he purpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the assistance necessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding\u201d; <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 691-92; that \u201cproceeding\u201d must be regarded as the entire continuum of the adjudicatory process, both trial and appeal. The petitioner's argument would break this continuum by applying a different standard of prejudice to the misconduct of his appellate counsel from that of his trial counsel, despite the fact that his ultimate goal remains the same\u2014to gain a new trial because of the purported unreliability of the result of the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Finally, it is significant that the petitioner seeks a new trial by way of a writ of habeas corpus. The principal purpose of the writ of habeas corpus is to serve as \u201ca bulwark against convictions that violate \u2018fun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>damental fairness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 126, 102 S. Ct. 1558, 71 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1982), quoting <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97, 97 S. Ct. 2497, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring). This court has taken the same view. \u201cTo mount a successful collateral attack on his conviction a prisoner must demonstrate a miscarriage of justice or other prejudice and not merely an error which might entitle him to relief on appeal. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 428, 82 S. Ct. 468, 7 L. Ed. 2d 417, reh. denied, 369 U.S. 808, 82 S. Ct. 640, 7 L. Ed. 2d 556 <em>(1962).\u201dD\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>193 Conn. 144, 156-57, 476 A.2d 543 (1984); see also <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>19 Conn. App. 440, 441, 562 A.2d 588, cert. denied, 212 Conn. 817, 565 A.2d 534 (1989). In order to demonstrate such a fundamental unfairness or miscarriage of justice, the petitioner should be required to show that he is burdened by an unreliable conviction. There is nothing fundamentally unfair about applying the same standard of prejudice to the performance of his appellate counsel that we would be required to apply to the performance of his trial counsel, particularly where in either case both the trial error of which he complains, namely, the improper instruction, and the remedy he seeks, namely, a new trial, are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">As we have stated in a similar context, there are special problems that are likely to arise relating to the feasibility of a second trial when a conviction is set aside by a habeas court rather than by an appellate court. These problems are related mainly to the more extended delay of the second trial that frequently results from a reversal of a conviction by a habeas court. There is no statute of limitation or other time limit that would bar a habeas petition. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>331 U.S. 469, 475, 67 S. Ct. 1330, 91 L. Ed. 1610 (1947). Ordinarily the petition may not be filed until appellate remedies have been exhausted, lest the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>petitioner be charged with a deliberate bypass of an appeal. An additional record must be created in the habeas court, which may require extensive testimony. If the petitioner is successful in overturning his conviction, another appeal is almost inevitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u201cA direct appeal following a conviction, on the other hand, is subject to strict time limits at each stage of the proceeding. Except for extraordinary cases, an appeal in this state is ordinarily determined within approximately one year from the date it was filed. The greater time lapse that results when a second trial is ordered by a habeas court has a serious impact on the availability of witnesses and other evidence for the second trial. Memories fade with the passage of time, exhibits are lost, and other evidence is less likely to be available.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>218 Conn. 403, 416, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The United States Supreme Court has also adverted to the \u201csignificant costs\u201d of collateral review of a criminal conviction by way of a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Isaac, </em>supra, 126. That review \u201cextends the ordeal of trial for both society and the accused,\u201d frustrating the interest in ensuring both that at some point litigation will end and that \u201cattention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 127. Furthermore, \u201c[ljiberal allowance of the writ. . . degrades the prominence of the trial itself . . . [which] concentrates society\u2019s resources at one time and place in order to decide, within the limits of human fallibility, the question of guilt or innocence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Finally, \u201cwrits of habeas corpus frequently cost society the right to punish admitted offenders. Passage of time, erosion of memory, and dispersion of witnesses may render retrial difficult, even impossible. While a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>habeas writ may, in theory, entitle the defendant only to retrial, in practice it may reward the accused with complete freedom from prosecution.\u201d Id., 127-28.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">These considerations counsel strongly in favor of requiring a habeas corpus petitioner who seeks to establish prejudice from his appellate counsel\u2019s performance to show that, as a result of that performance, it is reasonably probable that he remains burdened by an unreliable conviction. Indeed, the facts of this case highlight those very concerns. The petitioner seeks to overturn the verdict that was rendered by a jury in May, 1984, eight years ago, regarding his conduct in August, 1982, nearly ten years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">We therefore turn to the conclusion of the habeas court that \u201c[t]he petitioner has failed to show [that] \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, absent the [improper jury instruction], the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis omitted.) We agree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The differentiating element between the offenses of which the petitioner was convicted and those of which he sought to persuade the jury of his guilt was the petitioner\u2019s state of mind. At his trial, the state sought to prove that the petitioner had acted recklessly with respect to the deaths and injuries that he caused, that is, he was \u201caware of and consciously disregarded] a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result[s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>[would] occur.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13). The petitioner, on the contrary, sought to persuade the jury that he had acted with no more than criminal negligence, that is, he \u201cfail[ed] to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result[s] [would] occur.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14). We conclude that there is no reasonable probability that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s improper instruction into misapplying the state\u2019s burden of proof regarding the defendant\u2019s mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">First, the evidence of recklessness, rather than of criminal negligence, was very strong if not overwhelming. The petitioner, fleeing the police, went through a red light and drove down a four lane roadway, with heavy noontime traffic in both directions. While traveling at speeds ranging from thirty-five to seventy miles per hour, he passed a vehicle on the right, cut to the left and hit that vehicle, swerved back and forth in the westbound lane, left the road, crossed over into the eastbound lane, and straddled the center line missing another vehicle by inches. Then, traveling at sixty to seventy miles per hour, he crossed over the center line into the eastbound lane, where he struck the victims\u2019 vehicle head on. The evidence strongly supports the jury\u2019s actual finding that the petitioner\u2019s state of mind was one of awareness and conscious disregard of the risks created by his conduct rather than a negligent failure to perceive these risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s instructions consume fifty pages of transcript. The improper language was used only once. The court instructed the jury that the state had the burden to establish all the elements of the crimes charged, and of any lesser included offenses, beyond a reasonable doubt. Included in those elements were the various mental states necessary to establish guilt of the crimes charged and of each of the lesser included offenses. The court fully and properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>instructed the jury on the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, with no hint of a reference to a lesser standard. Throughout its instructions, the court specifically admonished the jury no less than thirty-one times that guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. Furthermore, the court instructed the jury, unduly favorably to the petitioner, that \u201cif a piece of evidence offered is capable of two reasonable constructions, one of which is consistent with innocence, it is to be given that construction\u201d; see <em>In re Keijam T., </em>221 Conn. 109, 602 A.2d 967 (1992); and that \u201cthe fact from which you are asked to draw the inference has itself been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 507-508, 590 A.2d 901 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>205 Conn. 352, 363-64, 533 A.2d 857 (1987) <em>(Callahan, J., </em>concurring), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 906, 108 S. Ct. 1079, 99 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Under all these circumstances, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury was misled by the one offending clause of one sentence of the court\u2019s instructions into applying a diluted burden of proof to the state\u2019s case regarding the defendant\u2019s state of mind. This record does not disclose a probability sufficient to undermine our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Shea, Callahan, Glass and Covello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\"> The petitioner appealed from the judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\"> In the habeas court, the petitioner also raised a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, based on that counsel\u2019s failure to take exception to the same instruction. The habeas court concluded that, because such a claim of instructional impropriety would have been reviewable on appeal under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), as modified by <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), the petitioner had not established prejudice with respect to his trial counsel\u2019s conduct. The petitioner also claimed in the habeas court that the jury instruction at issue had deprived him of his due process right to a fair trial. The habeas court rejected that claim. The petitioner has not challenged these conclusions of the habeas court in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> The habeas court, having concluded that the petitioner had not established prejudice, did not find \u201cthe underlying historical facts\u201d; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 131, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991); and did not reach a conclusion regarding the performance of the petitioner\u2019s appellate counsel. Since we agree with the habeas court that the petitioner has not established prejudice, it is unnecessary to consider the petitioner\u2019s claim regarding that performance or to remand to the habeas court for a finding of those facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when: (1) He recklessly causes the death of another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (2) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the third degree when ...

Eschewing the traditional scope of appellate review of improper jury instructions, namely, that they are to be considered as a whole in order to determine whether the jury was misled, we concluded that \u201c[w]e cannot bring the case within the purview of [that] rule\u201d; id., 58; because much of the state\u2019s case was circumstantial \u201cbearing on the issue of criminal intent.\" Id. <em>Rodgers, </em>however, was preceded by, but did not refer to, <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 130-33, 496 A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S.

In <em>Reddick, </em>we subjected the instruction to the \u201cwell established\u201d principle that \u201cindividual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge\u201d; id., 132; and we concluded that any dilution of the state\u2019s burden of proof, \u201cif it existed, was cured by the court\u2019s repeated correct instructions.\u201d Id., 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Thereafter, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 757, 513 A.2d 86 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), we reconciled the apparent contradiction between <em>Rodgers </em>and <em>Reddick </em>by adopting the analysis put forth by the Appellate Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>7 Conn. App. 149, 155-56, 508 A.2d 49, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 805, 512 A.2d 229 (1986) , which distinguished between cases in which the principal factual issue was intent and cases in which the principal issue was identity. Under that analysis, where the principal issue at trial was intent, characteristically proven by circumstantial evidence, this court was to subject the instruction to \u201cclose scrutiny\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra; rather than to consider it in the context of the overall charge. Where, however, the principal issue was identity, not classically dependent on circumstantial evidence, we would consider the improper instruction on circumstantial evidence in the context of the entire charge to determine whether it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Subsequently, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>204 Conn. 207, 210, 527 A.2d 694 (1987) , we elaborated on the meaning of \u201cclose scrutiny\u201d: \u201cWhere the principal factual issue at trial is intent, which is typically proven by circumstantial evidence, \u2018we will closely scrutinize the court\u2019s instructions\u2019 on circumstantial evidence, <em>in isolation from the remainder of the charge, </em>to determine whether the court misled the jury as to the state\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Robinson, </em>however, since the principal issue was not intent but identity, we reviewed the instruction in the context of the charge as a whole, and concluded that it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled. Id., 210-11. Nonetheless, the dictum in <em>Robinson </em>made explicit what had been implicit in <em>Whelan, </em>namely, that in an \u201cintent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>case the \u201cmore probable than not\u201d instruction would mandate a reversal of the conviction irrespective of its likely effect on the jury when viewed in the context of the entire charge.

See footnote 11, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b475-5\"> We have in dictum indicated that prejudice from appellate counsel\u2019s deficient performance must be gauged by the outcome of the trial that yielded the appeal. In <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>216 Conn. 678, 690, 583 A.2d 1277 (1990), we referred to the prejudice requirement as follows: \u201c[Tjhis lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>of competency contributed so significantly to the affirmance of [the petitioner\u2019s] conviction <em>as to have deprived him of a fair appeal, thus causing an unreliable conviction to stand.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) This language echoed similar language in <em>Valeriano </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>209 Conn. 75, 84, 546 A.2d 1380 (1988), where we stated: \u201c[0]nce a defendant is denied <em>a fair appeal that causes an unreliable conviction to stand under Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>it is obvious that his ineffective counsel worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his [appeal] with errors of constitutional dimension.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"Aze\">The other jurisdictions that have considered this issue are far from conclusive or unanimous. Two federal circuits have determined that the proper focus is the result of the appeal, and one state Supreme Court has determined that the proper focus is the result of the trial.

Id., 696.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\"> In most cases, the question of whether the result of an appeal would have been different would be essentially the same as the question of whether the result of the trial would have been different. This is because, ordinarily, the appellate standard for determining whether a particular trial error requires reversal focuses on the likely effect of that error on the verdict. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 667, 588 A.2d 127 (1991) (reversal of conviction based on unconstitutionally improper jury instruction appropriate only when it is reasonably possible that jury was misled by instruction). In this case, however, because of the particular direction that the <em>Rodgers </em>line of cases took; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 502 A.2d 360 (1985); see footnote 11, supra; the question of whether the result of the appeal would have been different is arguably different from the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>of whether the verdict would have been different, since, as the petitioner argues, under <em>Rodgers, </em>we would be required to consider the language of the charge in isolation from the remainder of the instructions and, thus, in isolation from its likely effect on the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"> We recognize that, where the prejudice claimed by a habeas corpus petitioner is that he was deprived of his entire appeal because his appellate counsel failed to file papers timely, this standard of prejudice would not apply. In that case, the remedy sought by the petitioner would not be a new trial but a first appeal as of right, and it would be impossible to determine whether the verdict was unreliable until the appeal had been heard. In such a case, therefore, prejudice would be established by the absence of his appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b483-9\"> It is true, as the dissent notes; see dissent, footnote 1, infra; that one who challenges his conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel must do so by way of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Noting that, however, does not diminish the validity of the reasons why a petitioner who mounts such a collateral challenge should be required to show that he is burdened by an unreliable conviction. Of course, despite the hyperbolic \u201cfear\u201d expressed by the dissent in the same footnote, we contemplate no \u201cassault on the writ of habeas corpus as a vehicle for justice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b485-8\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJ6W\">dissenting.

Ed. 2d 530 (1987) (petitioner failed to demonstrate reasonable probability that, but for appellate counsel\u2019s errors, result of appeal would have been different); <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>778 F.2d 350, 353 (7th Cir. 1985), vacated, 478 U.S. 1017, 106 S. Ct. 3328, 92 L.

Washington, [supra,] established the standard for ineffective assistance of counsel, and though it is phrased in terms of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, it can be used as a basis for establishing a standard for effective assistance of appellate counsel. . . . Had appellate counsel failed to raise a significant and obvious issue, the failure could be viewed as deficient performance. If an issue which was not raised may have resulted in a reversal of the conviction, or an order for a new trial, the failure was prejudicial.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Greer, </em>supra, 800 F.2d 646. In the present case, appellate counsel failed to raise an issue that, had it been raised, would have resulted in a new trial for the petitioner. That should be the remedy on this appeal. The practical result of the majority\u2019s decision today is that if the defendant is fortunate enough to have competent appellate counsel, he or she will get a new trial when there is reversible error. If, however, the defendant is unfortunate to have been assigned or has retained appellate counsel who fails to raise the same issue that, if properly raised, would on appeal have resulted in a new trial, he or she will have the additional burden of proving that the counsel\u2019s failure undermined the reliability of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Finally, it appears to me that the majority in its footnote 11, is setting the stage for a 180 degree reversal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>of <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 502 A.2d 360 (1985), for direct appeals. In <em>Rodgers, </em>the trial court, while instructing the jury on circumstantial evidence, stated that an inference may be drawn if \u201c \u2018it is more probable that the fact to be inferred is true.\u2019 \u201d Id., 57. This court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis that this instruction, which is identical to the one at issue in the present appeal, impermissibly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof. In reversing the conviction, we refused to follow the traditional route of reading the charge in its entirety to determine whether the jury was apt to have been misled by the instruction. We specifically held that \u201c[t]here exists such a contradiction between the erroneous instruction and the admixture of correct doctrine that as a whole it cannot be said that the incorrect statement did not influence the jury.\u201d Id., 59. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 757, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), this court reasoned that \u201c[wjhere the principal factual issue is intent, which is characteristically proven by circumstantial evidence . . . the court\u2019s instructions regarding the use of circumstantial evidence as proof of this essential element are subject to close scrutiny.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Because intent is routinely proven by circumstantial evidence, the need for the rule is evident; without it, there exists the likelihood that a jury could convict a defendant of the crime charged without the state proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt. By today\u2019s decision the majority eliminates this per se <em>Rodgers-Whelan </em>rule for collateral attacks, but claims that it is still adhering to the rule for direct appeals. That defies logic. If on a direct appeal we are concerned, as we should be, that such an incorrect statement by the trial judge probably influenced the jury, notwithstanding other ameliorating instructions, so must we also be concerned when the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>issue is presented on habeas corpus. Accordingly, I fear that the stage has been set for the eventual demise of the <em>Rodgers-Whelan </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-6\"> To support its conclusion, the majority notes that it is \u201csignificant\u201d that the petitioner sought \u201ca new trial by way of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d It should, however, go without saying that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may only be pursued on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 542, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986). Indeed, when the claim is one of ineffective assistance of <em>appellate </em>counsel, the only possible avenue of review is by way of habeas corpus. Therefore, I fear that the true purpose of this dicta is the beginning of an assault on the writ of habeas corpus as a vehicle for justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
