The trial court determined that because the excess personal liability policy provided that the insured maintain underlying automobile liability insurance, it was not required to provide uninsured motorist coverage under \u00a7 38-175c. Relying on our decision in <em>Mass </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>222 Conn. 631, 610 A.2d 1185 (1992), we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The facts are not in dispute. On April 22, 1987, the plaintiff was seriously injured when the automobile she was driving was struck head on by an automobile owned and operated by John F. Henry. The trial court found that the accident was caused by the negligence of Henry. Henry\u2019s insurance carrier paid the plaintiff $50,000, the full amount of Henry\u2019s automobile liability coverage. The automobile operated by the plaintiff was one of three automobiles owned by her father, Ward S. Curran (Curran), each of which was insured under an automobile liability insurance policy (primary policy) issued by Aetna. The plaintiff was an insured under the primary policy at the time of the accident. Although the personal injury liability limit was $300,000, Curran had in writing selected a lesser amount of uninsured motorist coverage. Separate premiums for liability, uninsured motorist, comprehensive and collision coverage were charged for each vehicle under the primary policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">At the same time that Curran purchased the primary policy from Aetna, he also purchased an excess personal liability policy (excess policy), which provided personal liability coverage of $1,000,000. The excess policy also specifically provided a limit of $25,000 per occurrence for uninsured motorist coverage. The declarations to the excess policy required that the insured maintain \u201cprimary insurance\u201d for automobile liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>coverage for \u201call automobiles owned by, leased to or regularly used by the insured\u201d with limits of $300,000 per occurrence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The excess policy provided that \u201c[Aetna] will only pay for the amount of loss which is . . . above the required primary insurance limits; and . . . above any other insurance collectible for an occurrence.\u201d Curran paid a basic premium of $102 for the excess policy, which included \u201cone auto and primary residence.\u201d He paid an additional premium of $40 for two \u201cadditional vehicles\u2014designed for road use.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">After exhausting the personal injury liability coverage under Henry\u2019s automobile liability policy, the plaintiff sought uninsured motorist coverage under the primary policy. The stated uninsured motorist liability limit was $40,000, which, after the coverage for the three insured automobiles was \u201cstacked,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provided a total of $120,000 in uninsured motorist coverage. The $50,000 paid to the plaintiff under Henry\u2019s automobile liability policy was deducted from the $120,000 available under the primary policy. The plaintiff was also paid $5000 in basic reparations benefits pursuant to the primary policy. Aetna thus paid the plaintiff a total of $65,000 under the primary policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Thereafter, the plaintiff sought uninsured motorist benefits under the excess policy. Aetna maintained that its uninsured motorist liability under the excess policy did not exceed $25,000. The plaintiff commenced this action against Aetna, alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and a violation of applicable Connecticut law in that Aetna had failed to provide uninsured motorist coverage equal to the liability limit of $1,000,000 in the excess policy. The plaintiff and Aetna filed motions for summary judgment on the legal issue of uninsured motorist coverage under the excess policy. The trial court reserved decision on these motions pending the jury\u2019s determination of damages for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">After a trial to a jury, the jury determined that fair, just and reasonable compensation for all of the plaintiffs injuries resulting from the accident was $300,000. During the course of the trial, Aetna filed an offer of judgment for $25,000. Thereafter, the trial court granted Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that the excess policy was not subject to the requirements of \u00a7 38-175c. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $25,000. The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict, which the trial court denied. This appeal to the Appellate Court followed. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. Thereafter, in response to this court\u2019s order for articulation, the trial court issued a supplemental memorandum of decision, in which it concluded that the $25,000 of uninsured motorist coverage provided by the excess policy was not subject to stacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff raises the following issues: (1) whether \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) is applicable to and governs the automobile coverage in the excess policy issued by Aetna; (2) whether excess liability insurance policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>that provide uninsured motorist coverage are exempt from the equality requirement of \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2); (3) whether the trial court properly determined that uninsured motorist coverage under the excess policy cannot be stacked; (4) whether the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and jury charge on issues relating to the nature and extent of the plaintiffs injuries were proper; and (5) whether the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and jury charge on issues relating to the amounts received by the plaintiff from collateral sources were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s first and second claims may be treated as one issue: whether the trial court properly concluded that the uninsured motorist coverage in the excess policy was not subject to the equality requirement of \u00a7 38-175c. In ruling on the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment, the trial court concluded that because the excess policy contained an \u201cunderlying insurance requirement,\u201d it was not required to provide uninsured motorist coverage in accordance with \u00a7 38-175c. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), an insurer is required to provide an insured with uninsured motorist coverage equal to the amount of automobile liability coverage purchased unless the insured requests a lesser amount in writing, although in no event may an insured elect less than the statutory minimum set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>because the excess policy covers liability for damages arising out of the ownership or use of Curran\u2019s three automobiles, it is an \u201cautomobile liability policy\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38-175c and, therefore, must provide uninsured motorist coverage equal to the liability limit of $1,000,000. The plaintiff distinguishes this court\u2019s holding in <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 540, 569 A.2d 544 (1990), on the basis that the policy involved in that case was, by its terms, an <em>indemnity </em>policy, whereas the excess policy purchased by Cur-ran provided <em>liability </em>coverage. In support of her argument, the plaintiff refers us to decisions in other jurisdictions holding that excess or umbrella policies must provide uninsured motorist coverage pursuant to the applicable uninsured motorist statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In <em>Mass </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>supra, we considered whether a personal excess policy that provided for liability and contained no provision for uninsured motorist coverage was an \u201cautomobile liability policy\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38-175c. We stated that \u201cexcess or umbrella policies . . . serve a purpose distinct from that served by policies that exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>sively cover liability from damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance or operation of an automobile.\u201d Id., 640. Therefore, the fact that the Masses\u2019 excess policy provided, among other coverages, coverage for automobile liability did not convert it into an automobile liability policy within the meaning of \u00a7 38-175c. We concluded that the language of the personal excess policy indicated that it was intended as \u201cexcess insurance designed solely to protect [the Masses] from the infrequent occurrence of catastrophic judgments against [them.]\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 640. We are persuaded that the excess policy in the present case was intended to serve a similar purpose, and, accordingly, is not an automobile liability policy within the meaning of the uninsured motorist statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In contrast to the personal excess policy at issue in <em>Mass, </em>however, the excess policy in this case specifically provided coverage for uninsured motorist claims. Under the excess policy, Aetna agreed to pay for \u201cpersonal injury sustained by an insured in an auto accident for which that insured has a legal right to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured auto or an underinsured auto.\u201d The excess policy provided, however, that Aetna\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to pay is subject to the terms and conditions of the uninsured or underinsured motorists coverage in [the insured\u2019s] primary insurance policy.\u201d Pursuant to the excess policy, Aetna agreed to pay \u201cthe amount of loss in excess of the greater of either: (a) the total amount of insurance any insured is entitled to receive under any other uninsured, underinsured motorists or auto liability insurance; or (b) the minimum limit for bodily injury liability required by law in the state in which the accident occurs.\u201d The excess policy specifically excluded coverage for \u201cany claim under the uninsured or underinsured motorists coverage for personal injury to any insured who does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>not have any underlying uninsured or underinsured motorists insurance, <em>if such insurance was rejected by or for the insured,\u201d </em>and \u201cany uninsured or underinsured motorists personal injury claim not covered by the uninsured or underinsured motorists coverage contained in the primary insurance policies.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Finally, the excess policy provided that \u201c[t]he limit of liability shown on the Declarations for this coverage is the most [Aetna] will pay for any one occurrence . . . regardless of the number of (a) insureds; (b) claims made; or (c) vehicles involved in the auto accident.\u201d The declarations to the excess policy limited Aetna\u2019s liability for uninsured motorist claims to $25,000 per occurrence after the deduction of a \u201cretained limit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In <em>O\u2019Hanlon </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>639 F.2d 1019 (3d Cir. 1981), the plaintiff sought reformation of an umbrella policy, denominated a \u201cPersonal Catastrophe Plan,\u201d that provided uninsured motorist coverage up to $35,000 after the deduction of a \u201cretained limit.\u201d The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that Delaware\u2019s uninsured motorist statute did not require the umbrella policy to provide uninsured motorist coverage equal to the statutory limits of $300,000. The court stated: \u201cPolicies such as the [insurer\u2019s] umbrella policy . . . with respect to their automobile coverages, would not exist but for underlying primary auto policies to which they provide excess liability insurance. Primary insurance policies . . . by their very existence, provide insureds with all the benefits accorded under [the uninsured motorist statute]. To place umbrella policies within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>ambit of [the uninsured motorist statute] would be to apply that section to require [uninsured motorist] coverage in addition to that provided by primary policies. We do not believe that [the uninsured motorist statute] can be so read, and hold that it is not applicable to policies that provide excess liability insurance.\u201d Id., 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Like the umbrella policy at issue in <em>O\u2019Hanlon, </em>the excess policy in this case expressly limited the amount of uninsured motorist coverage. The excess policy required the insured to maintain underlying primary insurance coverage for automobile liability with limits of $300,000 per occurrence. Moreover, the excess policy effectively required the insured to maintain uninsured motorist coverage in that it excluded coverage for uninsured motorist claims if the insured had rejected uninsured motorist coverage under the primary policy or if the primary policy did not cover the particular claim. Curran obtained the requisite primary automobile liability coverage, but selected uninsured motorist coverage of only $40,000 per accident, as permitted by \u00a7 38-175C (a) (2).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The excess policy, by its terms, provided coverage for specified catastrophic liability risks over and above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the primary or underlying insurance risk.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The limitation of uninsured motorist coverage to $25,000 in the excess policy did not affect Aetna\u2019s obligation, pursuant to \u00a7 38-175c, to provide uninsured motorist coverage equal to liability coverage in the primary policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Curran, however, waived the equality requirement of \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) when he purchased reduced uninsured motorist coverage under the primary policy. Because we conclude that the excess policy is not an automobile liability policy within the meaning of \u00a7 38-175c, the parties were free to contract for uninsured motorist coverage under the excess policy without regard to the statutory requirements. We are persuaded that the primary policy provided the plaintiff with all the benefits accorded her by \u00a7 38-175c, and, therefore, that the statute had been satisfied before the plaintiff sought uninsured motorist coverage under the excess policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the uninsured motorist coverage provided by the excess policy was not subject to stacking. Aetna argues that the trial court\u2019s conclusion was correct because the excess policy is not an automobile liability policy under \u00a7 38-175c. Our disposition of the plaintiff\u2019s first two claims leaves only the question of whether the $25,000 of uninsured motorist coverage specifically provided by the excess policy may be stacked. We conclude that because the excess policy is not an automobile liability policy within the meaning of \u00a7 38-175c, the doctrine of stacking does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Intrapolicy stacking is the aggregation of the limits of liability for uninsured motorist coverage of each automobile covered under one insurance policy. <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 388-89 n.2, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982). This court has permitted intrapolicy stacking where each of several vehicles insured pursuant to one policy was separately described and individual premiums were charged for uninsured motorist coverage of each vehicle. See, e.g., <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Empire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>189 Conn. 449, 453, 456 A.2d 335 (1983); <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>supra, 394-97; <em>Safeco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vetre, </em>174 Conn. 329, 333-35, 387 A.2d 539 (1978). While \u00a7 38-175c does not expressly address stacking, we have repeatedly held that the statute does not prohibit aggregation of coverage. <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 525, 529, 569 A.2d 541 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The rationale behind permitting stacking derives in large part from the reasonable expectations of the parties to the insurance contract. <em>u </em>\u2018[W]hen the named insured purchases uninsured motorist coverage on more than one automobile, he intends to buy extra protection for himself and his family, regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>his injury occurs in any one of his insured vehicles or elsewhere.\u2019 \u201d Id., 529-30. We have limited stacking of uninsured motorist coverage, however, to insurance policies that provide coverage exclusively for automobile liability, and thus fall within the ambit of \u00a7 38-175c.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Nicolletta </em>v. <em>Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>211 Conn. 640, 560 A.2d 964 (1989); <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Empire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>supra; <em>Safeco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vetre, </em>supra. We discern no persuasive reason to permit the stacking of uninsured motorist coverage under excess or umbrella policies, such as the policy in the present case, when we have held that such policies are not governed by \u00a7 38-175c.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The trial court awarded the plaintiff $25,000 in uninsured motorist coverage pursuant to the excess policy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The defendant had filed an offer of judgment for this amount. In addition, it is undisputed that the plaintiff has received the total amount of uninsured motorist coverage available to her under the primary policy. Because \u00a7 38-175c (b) (1) limits Aetna\u2019s liability to the amount of uninsured motorist coverage available; see footnote 2, supra; we need not address the plaintiff\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In this opinion Shea, Covello and Borden, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\"> Throughout this opinion, the term uninsured motorist coverage encompasses underinsured motorist coverage as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"> In 1991, General Statutes \u00a7 38-175a et seq. was recodified as \u00a7 38a-334 et seq.

This applies whether the other insurance is stated to be primary, contributing, excess or contingent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\"> The plaintiff argues that because the uninsured motorist coverage in the excess policy is expressly \u201csubject to\u201d the terms and conditions of the primary policy, the excess policy should be construed as an automobile liability policy pursuant to General Statutes S 38-175c. The fact that the excess policy refers to the required primary policy, however, no more converts the excess policy to an automobile liability policy than the reference to underlying homeowners\u2019 insurance converts the excess policy to a homeowners\u2019 policy. <em>In Matarasso </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>82 App. Div. 2d 861, 862, 440 N.Y.S.2d 40 (1981), aff'd, 56 N.Y.2d 264, 436 N.E.2d 1305, 451 N.Y.S.2d 703 (1982), the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York concluded that the insured\u2019s umbrella policy incorporated the provisions of an underlying automobile liability policy \u201cinsofar as they provide for protection against liability for damages to third parties,\u201d and, therefore, did not incorporate underlying uninsured motorist coverage because such coverage did not involve third party claims against the insured. We are similarly persuaded in the present case that \u201c[a]ny other interpretation would distort the actual purpose of the [excess] policy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\"> This court has drawn the line at \u201cfleet\u201d automobile liability policies, however, concluding that stacking was not within the reasonable expectations of the parties to the insurance contract despite the insured\u2019s payment of a separate uninsured motorist premium for each covered vehicle. <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 671, 591 A.2d 101 (1991); <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 525, 530, 569 A.2d 541 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\"> The plaintiff contends that whether uninsured motorist coverage may be stacked should depend on the reasonable expectations of the parties to the insurance contract, not whether the contract is an automobile liability policy pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c. The plaintiff argues that because additional premiums for two extra vehicles were paid under the excess policy, the insured could reasonably have expected that uninsured motorist coverage would be stacked. By its terms, however, the excess policy covers liability of the insured to third parties after primary policy liability limits have been exhausted. Furthermore, in deposition testimony that was presented to the trial court on Aetna\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Cur-ran acknowledged that the insurance agent who sold him the primary and excess policies represented that the $25,000 of uninsured motorist coverage in the excess policy was an \u201cextra.\u201d Finally, unlike the primary policy\u2019s declarations, which described each automobile covered and indicated the uninsured motorist premium for each, the declarations to the excess policy did not designate the additional premium charged or a portion thereof for uninsured motorist coverage of the two extra vehicles. In light of the foregoing evidence, we are satisfied that the reasonable expectations of the insured are not frustrated by our decision not to permit stacking under the excess policy in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b691-7\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_a\">dissenting in part and concurring in part. I disagree with the majority in part I of its opinion. The excess liability policy is clearly an automobile liability policy and subject to the mandatory uninsured motorist coverage under General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c (now recodified as \u00a7 38a-336). See <em>Mass </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>222 Conn. 631, 650-56, 610 A.2d 1185 (1992) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">In regard to part II of the decision, although I agree that pursuant to the terms of <em>this </em>excess liability policy there is no stacking, it is <em>not </em>because the policy fails to come within the mandatory uninsured motorist coverage under \u00a7 38-175c. Rather, I agree that there was no expectation of stacking on the part of the insured because the contractual uninsured motorist coverage in this case fails to describe separately the automobiles and assess individual premiums. See <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>Empire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>189 Conn. 449, 453, 456 A.2d 335 (1983); <em>Nationwide Ins.
