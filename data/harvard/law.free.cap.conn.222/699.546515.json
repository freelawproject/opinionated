The petitioner, Lucy M. Favrow, appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the order of the trial court directing the respondent, Jacqueline Vargas, to pay the petitioner $7.50 per week in current child support for each of two minor children of the respondent, and denying the petitioner\u2019s request for a finding of and order on an arrearage for past child support. The petitioner claims that the trial court improperly (1) deviated from the guidelines, and (2) denied her request for an arrearage order. We reverse the order on both issues, and remand the case for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The relevant facts are as follows. The petitioner is the legal guardian of two of the respondent\u2019s minor children, Noemi Maldonado, born February 27,1979, and Janet Mercado, born January 14,1985 (children), who reside with the petitioner and her husband.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These children were born to the respondent during her marriages to their fathers, Eduardo Maldonado and Edwin Mercado, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In May, 1991, the petitioner filed verified petitions for support pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>alleging that the respondent had \u201cfailed, neglected and refused\u201d to support the children, and requesting an order of support and a finding of and an order on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>arrearage. At the hearing on the petition, held on July 16,1991, the parties filed financial affidavits and presented oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The respondent\u2019s affidavit indicated that she was employed at an insurance company, that she had a gross weekly income of $261.51, and a net weekly income of $212.10 after deductions for federal income taxes and social security. Her affidavit also indicated total weekly expenses of $295.75, consisting of $133.75 for rent, $7.50 for electricity, $50 for telephone, $60 for food, $3 for public transportation, $10 for laundry, and $31.50 for church contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The petitioner\u2019s affidavit indicated that she was employed as a legal secretary, and that she had a gross weekly income of $600, and a net weekly income of $473.10 after deductions for federal income taxes, social security and medicare. Her affidavit also disclosed her husband\u2019s gross weekly income of $1127.17 and his net weekly income of $773.61 after deductions for federal income taxes, social security, medicare, various insurance expenses, and savings bonds and charities. The petitioner\u2019s affidavit also indicated total weekly expenses for both her and her husband of $1396.97. That figure included $373.14 in weekly payments on credit card and similar debts totaling $29,236.83.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The petitioner requested that the trial court order current support in the total amount of $75 per week for the children, which was in accordance with the guidelines.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The respondent argued that the guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>should not apply,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that a total weekly payment of $50 for the children was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">With regard to the arrearage sought by the petitioner,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the respondent represented that, following her participation in an alcohol rehabilitation program, she had begun working full time in May, 1991. She argued, nonetheless, that because the petitioner had not previously moved in court for a support order, there had been no neglect or refusal by the respondent to furnish support for the children, and thus that the petitioner had established no statutory basis for an order of arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The trial court found that application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. Its stated rationale for that finding was the \u201c[respondent\u2019s] liv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>ing costs.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After eliminating certain of the respondent\u2019s expenses as shown on her affidavit, the court entered an order of current support of $7.50 per week for each child, or a total weekly order of $15. The court denied the petitioner\u2019s claim for an arrearage upon the basis that, because the respondent \u201cwas never formally notified of any demand being made on her prior to this action being commenced . . . [t]he Court will not make a finding that she neglected or refused to provide support for the children.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">We first consider the petitioner\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s order of current child support. The petitioner<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> claims that the trial court improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>deviated from the child support guidelines for reasons not articulated or contemplated by the guidelines. Conversely, the respondent claims that the trial court was within its discretion because it properly found that application of the guidelines would have been inequitable and inappropriate in this case. We agree with the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Some history is in order. In 1984, by Special Act No. 84-74 the legislature established pilot programs of mediation and conciliation in the Fairfield and Litchfield judicial districts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Special Acts 1984, No. 84-74, \u00a7 1. The special act had two major goals: (1) to \u201c[establish pilot programs at the two court locations for the mediation of contested child custody, visitation, property and financial issues related to dissolution of marriage proceedings\u201d; and (2) \u201c[ajppointment of an inter-agency commission to develop family support guidelines to be used by Family Relations Counselors in the mediation of dissolution proceedings in the two Judicial Districts.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Report of the Commission on Family Support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Guidelines, Guidelines for Support Standards (October, 1985) p. 1 (1985 Guidelines). Thus, these guidelines were specifically for the use of family relations counselors in mediating and conciliating disputes and were not aimed at the discretion of the court in entering such orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Pursuant to that statutory mandate, the commission appointed thereunder developed a set of guidelines for support of minor children \u201cbased on expected levels of support to be provided by a spouse or parent depending on the income and current situation of each adult, total family income, and the number of persons in need of support.\u201d 1985 Guidelines, p. 2. The commission specifically made the guidelines flexible and nondirective. The commission stated that the guidelines \u201creflect an integration of national averages for the costs of child rearing in families of varying size and income levels as well as the usual range of obligations established by families and the courts. They are not intended to transform the sensitive process of determining the equitable allocation of family support responsibilities into a fixed and rigid mathematical formula. Rather, the purpose is to provide a framework within which the unique characteristics of each family can be examined in an orderly fashion to construct an allocation of financial responsibility responsive to the needs of all family members as well as to the community.\u201d 1985 Guidelines, pp. 1-2. In keeping with this flexible and nondirective approach, the commission also stated: \u201cIn most situations, support obligations are not dependent upon current adult expenses as it is anticipated that parents must adjust their expenses in accordance with the priority of their obligations, with the support of a depen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>dent spouse or child being the primary obligation. In appropriate circumstances, however, fixed obligations may be considered.\u201d 1985 Guidelines, p. 2. The commission also stated that the guidelines were not intended to preclude consideration of thirteen \u201cother factors relevant to the allocation of financial responsibility,\u201d the last listed of which was \u201c[ojther reasonable considerations.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 1985 Guidelines, pp. 2, 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Two provisions of these guidelines are relevant to the issue in this case. The provision entitled \u201cMaximum Family Support\u201d stated that the \u201cguidelines intend that the spousal support determination occur within the context of the disposable income of the non-custodial parent <em>after </em>the child support obligation is established and with the proviso that the retained income of the noncustodial parent in no case be reduced to below 40%, or $100.00, whichever is greater, for any combination of child support and spousal support. The amount of disposable income available for spousal support is the difference between the expected child support and the Maximum Family Support.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) 1985 Guidelines, p. 5. The provision entitled \u201cLimit On Maximum Support To Be Ordered\u201d provided as follows: \u201cThe guidelines presume that as a rule the retained income of the support obligor will not be reduced below 40%, or $100.00, whichever is greater. The rationale for this proviso is that reduction below 40%, or $100.00, may have the effect of undermining an obligor\u2019s incentive to remain employed.\u201d 1985 Guidelines, p. 6. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>these two provisions established as a baseline that, within the boundaries of the flexible and nondirective approach of the guidelines, the noncustodial parent would be permitted to retain the greater of 40 percent of his or her other disposable income or $100 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The commission also recommended that the proposed guidelines be used statewide by family relations counselors as part of the mediation process. 1985 Guidelines, Pilot Program Report and Recommendations addendum, p. 2. In a further addendum to the report, the mediators appointed under the statute recommended that the guidelines \u201cbe formally incorporated as guidelines to be considered by judges in the adjudication of family support matters.\u201d 1985 Guidelines, Commentary addendum, p. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Thereafter, in 1985 the legislature enacted No. 85-548 of the Public Acts, entitled \u201cAn Act Implementing the Federal Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 8 of that Public Act established a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>mission \u201cto develop guidelines, not later than January 1, 1987, for child support award amounts within the state. Such guidelines shall be available but not binding upon judges and other officials who have the power to determine child support awards.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This legislation, therefore, provided for a set of child support guidelines, and expanded their use from the family relations counselors to the court. The guidelines, although made \u201cavailable\u201d to the court, were in no way binding on it. These guidelines were in all essential characteristics identical to those established pursuant to Special Act No. 84-74. See Guidelines For Child Support Standards Developed Pursuant to Public Acts 1985, No. 85-548 by the Commission on Support Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In 1989, the legislature enacted No. 89-203 of the Public Acts, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Child Support Guidelines.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 1 of that act established a third \u201ccommission for child support guidelines.\u201d This commission was given three specific statutory mandates: \u201c[1] to review the child support guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>promulgated pursuant to section 8 of public act 85-548, [2] to establish criteria for the establishment of guidelines to ensure the appropriateness of child support awards and [3] to issue updated guidelines not later than January 1,1991 and every four years thereafter.\u201d Public Acts 1989, No. 89-203, \u00a7 1. Section 1 of that public act is now codified as General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215a.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Sections 2 and 3 of that public act are now codified as General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 46b-215b. See footnote 1, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Section 46b-215b (a) made four significant changes in the application of the guidelines to questions of child support. These four changes, moreover, displaced the flexible and nondirective approach taken by the previous sets of guidelines. First, \u00a7 46b-215b (a) provides that the guidelines \u201cshall be considered in all determinations of child support amounts within the state.\u201d Second, the statute provides that \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption that the amount of such awards which resulted from the application of such guidelines is the amount of support to be ordered.\u201d Third, in order for a court or magistrate \u201cto rebut the presumption in such case,\u201d it must make a \u201cspecific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>inequitable or inappropriate in a particular case.\u201d Fourth, such a specific finding must be \u201cdetermined under criteria established by the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In response to these statutory mandates, the commission promulgated new guidelines. In its final report, issued in January, 1991, the commission observed that the new guidelines \u201chave been working quite well since they have been used as a rebuttable presumption by judges and magistrates. The order establishment process has been expedited; and although there has been some inconsistent application, orders of support are generally more consistent. Generally, there is less litigation, and much more thought is being given to the reasons for deviation from the guidelines.\u201d Final Report of the Commission for Child Support Guidelines (January, 1991) p. 3 (1991 Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">With respect to the deviation criteria mandated by \u00a7 46b-215b (a), the commission found that the \u201cdeviation criteria should be more clearly specified. The guidelines therefore include a complete listing of specific deviation criteria. In addition, the Commission has expanded the general criteria to ensure that orders are in the best interests of the child and are equitable to the financial interests and needs of the parties.\u201d 1991 Guidelines, p. 3. Accordingly, the commission specified fourteen deviation criteria, the last of which, relevant here, was \u201cother equitable factors.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> 1991 Guidelines, p. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The commission, moreover, specifically addressed the issue of the noncustodial parent\u2019s actual living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>expenses. Under the heading, \u201cNon-Custodial Parent\u2019s Self Support Reserve,\u201d the commission stated: \u201cIn general, support obligations should not be dependent on current adult expenses because parents must adjust their expenses in accordance with the priority of their obligations, with the support of dependents being a primary obligation. However, it is important that the noncustodial parent be allowed to retain sufficient income to support him/herself at some minimal level in order not to undermine his/her incentive to remain employed. In view of these concerns, the Commission finds that the $100 or 40% of net income self-support reserve for the non-custodial parent under the current guidelines is too low due to the increased cost of living. Therefore, the Commission finds that the non-custodial parent\u2019s self-support reserve should be increased to $135 per week, taking into account that the poverty income level for one person is $120.44 as of July, 1990.\u201d 1991 Guidelines, p. 4.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">This history strongly suggests three conclusions. First, underlying the entire notion of the mandatory child support guidelines is the fundamental principle that, unless a specific deviation criterion applies, \u201csupport obligations should not be dependent on current adult expenses because parents must adjust their expenses in accordance with the priority of their obligations, with the support of dependents being a primary obligation.\u201d 1991 Guidelines, p. 4. Although this principle was specifically stated in the 1991 Guidelines mandated by the 1989 legislation, its applicability was evident even in the context of the precursor legislation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>In accordance with this principle, the commission specifically set $135 per week as the presumptive permissible ceiling on the noncustodial parent\u2019s reserve for living expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Second, the deviation criteria must be read so as to be consistent with this fundamental principle. Just as different statutes must be read so as to form a consistent whole; <em>84 Century Limited Partnership </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>207 Conn. 250, 265, 541 A.2d 478 (1988); the deviation criteria must be read, insofar as possible, so as to form a consistent whole with the guidelines, both of which were issued by the same commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Third, the guidelines evolved from an experimental, intentionally nondirective and flexible approach to the imposition of standards that are presumptively binding on the court or magistrate, from which deviations would be permitted only in accordance with specific findings related to specific criteria established by the commission. Thus, in general, the 1989 legislation and the ensuing work of the commission substantially circumscribes the traditionally broad judicial discretion of the court in matters of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">These conclusions lead us to conclude, further, that the trial court went beyond its permissible bounds in deviating from the guidelines in this case. The only deviation criterion at issue in this case is the fourteenth, namely, \u201cother equitable factors.\u201d The trial court did not rely on any other criterion, and the respondent does not argue for the applicability of any other. It is true that the language of that criterion is very broad and would, at first glance, appear to give the trial court almost as much discretion as it had before the promulgation of the guidelines. To read this criterion, however, so as to permit the court to deviate from the guidelines solely on the basis of the noncustodial par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ent\u2019s actual living expenses, even when they are relatively modest in amount, would in effect permit the exception to swallow the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Permitting such an application of the deviation criteria would be inconsistent with the fundamental principle underlying the guidelines, namely, that support obligations of parents should not be dependent upon their current living expenses but that those expenses must give way to support obligations. Furthermore, to give precedence to current living expenses would be to read the catch-all, fourteenth deviation criterion so as to be inconsistent with and, in effect, to govern the application of the guidelines themselves. Finally, to do so would be inconsistent with the circumscribed discretion that the guidelines have imposed on the trial court by the 1989 legislation that replaced the broad discretion that the trial court had in such matters before the promulgation of the guidelines. In sum, therefore, in the present case the trial court\u2019s order finding a deviation from the guidelines on the basis of the respondent\u2019s actual living expenses amounted to a disagreement with the guidelines themselves, rather than an application of the deviation criteria established by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">We recognize that, particularly at the lowest end of the financial spectrum as reflected in the guidelines, the amount left for the noncustodial parent\u2019s self-support reserve may well be penurious, if not inadequate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The legislature, however, left the difficult policy determination of the appropriate level of that reserve, not to the court, but to the commission. It was not the trial court\u2019s function, nor is it this court\u2019s function, to countermand that essentially legislative determination. See <em>Mercado </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Income Maintenance, </em>222 Conn. 69, 77, 607 A.2d 1142 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>We recognize, moreover, as is implicit in the work of the commission, that every dollar of deviation downward from the guidelines, as the trial court ordered in this case, shifts that dollar of support for the children involved from the shoulders of one primary obligor, namely, a parent, onto the shoulders of another person\u2014in this case, the custodian of the children. Thus, the legislative determination made by the commission in its guidelines must be regarded with some degree of deference, because it reflects that difficult policy choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The petitioner also claims that the trial court improperly denied her request for an arrearage order because there had been no formal demand made upon the respondent for support prior to this petition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe superior court or a family support magistrate shall have authority to make and enforce orders for payment of support against any person <em>who neglects or refuses </em>to furnish necessary support to . . . a child under the age of eighteen, according to his or her ability to furnish such support . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) There is nothing in this language, or in the important public policy that it reflects, to suggest that the obligation of a parent to support her child, according to her ability, is subject to a condition precedent of a formal demand. That obligation is ongoing, and does not require the trigger of a request by those persons who are shouldering that responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The order is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new hearing on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">In this opinion Peters, C.

She argued that application of the guidelines would cripple her attempt to rehabilitate herself and cripple her attempt to reunite with her children. In view of our conclusions that the trial court improperly employed the respondent\u2019s actual living expenses as the sole basis for its decision to deviate from the guidelines and that a new hearing is required, we need not determine whether either of these bases would satisfy the deviation criteria established under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215b.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b725-9\"> The petitioner sought an arrearage in the amount of $17,940, calculated on the basis of her belief that the respondent had been employed for the previous one and one-half or two years. The petitioner also suggested an order on this arrearage of $25 per week. That amount, however, was to be included in the total weekly order sought of $75, to be allocated $50 for current support and $25 on the arrearage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b726-8\"> Although in its oral decision from the bench the trial court also adverted to three other factors\u2014namely, (1) the absence of payments by the natural fathers of the children and the effect thereof on the respondent, (2) the presence of the \u201cstep-parent ... in the equation,\u201d and (3) the court\u2019s perception that the respondent\u2019s offer of $50 per week would set her up for defeat when she was trying to rehabilitate herself and regain custody of her children\u2014it is clear that the basis of its decision not to apply the guidelines was the fact that applying the guidelines would not leave the respondent with enough money for the basic necessities of living. In invoking the statutory exception to the guidelines, the court stated that \u201cwhat the guidelines don\u2019t always take into consideration is that shelter, food and utilities and clothing . . . are necessities of life. And before we get past necessities, we can\u2019t start talking about the ability to support.\u201d The court also stated that \u201cthe Commission members [who] . . . set up these guidelines . . . didn\u2019t take into consideration that there is a basic necessity level that people have to get by before we start talking about discretionary income.\u201d The court then concluded: \u201cTherefore, I am going to make a finding in this case that the application of the guidelines in this case would be unfair and inappropriate.\u201d Whatever slight ambiguity there may have been about the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision, moreover, is completely dispelled by its written order, as follows: \u201c(x) Order is outside Guidelines. Rationale: <em>/Respondent\u2019s] living costs. </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\"> Although the petitioner has phrased her claims on appeal somewhat differently than the state of Connecticut as amicus curiae has phrased the claims, we conclude that the phrasing of the claims of the amicus more accurately presents the issues.

The Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984, enacted as Public Law 98-378 and codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666 et seq., amended part D of title IV of the Social Security Act to require that states establish procedures to improve the effectiveness of child support enforcement (IV-D) programs. In those amendments, Congress conditioned the states\u2019 receipt of federal funds for AFDC programs and for IV-D programs upon compliance with these requirements. Among the requirements was a provision directing states to establish, by law or by judicial or administrative action, guidelines for child support award amounts that would be available to, but not binding upon, judges who had the authority to enter child support orders. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 667 (a). Such guidelines were intended to provide reliable benchmarks for use in quasi-judicial proceedings, to expedite awards of child support, and to guide courts to more equitable awards in order to address the \u2018feminization of poverty\u2019 resulting from consistent underestimates of the cost of rearing children by increasing the average level of awards.
