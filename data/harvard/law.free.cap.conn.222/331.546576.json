Upon a motion by the state to revoke the defendant\u2019s release, the trial court, <em>Barry, J., </em>after an evidentiary hearing, revoked the defendant\u2019s release on the basis that the state had established, by clear and convincing evidence, that another person would be endangered while the defendant was on release, and that there was probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed a federal, state or local crime while on release in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 54-64e.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response to the defendant\u2019s petition for review, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-63g,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Appellate Court granted review but denied the relief requested. This court thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>220 Conn. 922, 598 A.2d 365 (1991).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the order of the trial court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The record discloses the following undisputed facts. Subsequent to the defendant\u2019s arraignment on June 5, 1991, on charges that included burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101, unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95, risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 and assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendant was released after posting a $25,000 surety bond. His release was conditioned on orders that expressly required him, inter alia, to stay away from the named victim and not to commit any federal, state or local crime during the period of release. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-64e. On June 12, 1991, while on release, the defendant was arrested and charged with assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60. He was released after posting a $50,000 surety bond. Two days later, on June 14,1991, he was arrested and charged with threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 and was released after posting a $5000 surety bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The state filed a motion pursuant to \u00a7 54-64f to revoke the defendant\u2019s release alleging that (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>defendant had been released on bail following his arrest on June 4, 1991, for a criminal offense punishable by more than ten years imprisonment, and (2) the defendant had violated the conditions of his release by violating the criminal laws of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">At the June 20,1991 evidentiary hearing on the state\u2019s motion to revoke release held pursuant to \u00a7 54-64f (a), the state offered the testimony of I. Charles Mathews, deputy mayor of Hartford, who testified that, while on his way to a local radio station on the morning of June 12, 1991, he had been severely beaten about the head and body by a man wielding a steel pipe.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mathews, who remained in the hospital for two days following the assault, required treatment for a head wound and received stitches in both legs. At the hearing, Mathews positively identified the defendant as his assailant and then testified that he had never seen the defendant before and did not know what had precipitated the attack. He further testified that he was receiving police protection and was in fear of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The trial court, <em>Barry, J., </em>applying the criteria of subsection (c) of \u00a7 54-64f,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> found that probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>existed to believe that the defendant had committed a federal, state or local crime while on release, and further found by clear and convincing evidence that the safety of another person, namely Mathews, was endangered while the defendant was on release. It stated that these findings gave rise to a rebuttable presumption that the defendant\u2019s release should be revoked, which, it concluded, the defendant had failed to rebut. At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the trial court ordered that the defendant\u2019s release under the initial bond of $25,000 be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">On July 19,1991, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the first information or in the alternative to set new conditions of release. The trial court, <em>Kocay, J., </em>after hearing oral argument by the parties on July 31, 1991, denied the defendant\u2019s motion on August 2,1991, and declined to set bond. On August 8, 1991, the defendant filed a motion for review of bond in the Appellate Court pursuant to \u00a7 54-63g.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On September 8, 1991, the Appellate Court granted the motion for review and denied the relief requested. The defendant filed a petition for certification in this court. On October 9, 1991, by a corrected order on the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal; see footnote 5, supra; we granted certification on two questions: (1) procedurally, does this court have jurisdiction to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>sider the defendant\u2019s claim, and (2) substantively, does article first, \u00a7 8 of our state constitution, which establishes a right to bail in criminal prosecutions, render the bail revocation provisions of \u00a7 54-64f (c) unconstitutional in the circumstances of this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The first issue that we must address is whether this court has jurisdiction to consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s interlocutory appeal within the confines of our authority to certify appeals from the Appellate Court. If we conclude that such jurisdiction is lacking, the question then arises whether any other avenue of appellate review is appropriate in the particular circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The statute that governs our certification jurisdiction is General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f, which provides that this court may certify cases for review \u201c[ujpon final determination of any appeal by the appellate court . . . .\u201d This court has previously dismissed petitions for certification from decisions of the Appellate Court denying leave to appeal in a zoning matter; <em>Ingersoll </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>194 Conn. 277, 278-79, 479 A.2d 1207 (1984); and denying relief on a motion for review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>212 Conn. 811, 564 A.2d 1072 (1989). We have thus consistently observed the statutory mandate that our jurisdiction to review decisions of the Appellate Court is not plenary but is limited to final judgments by that court. We have never construed Practice Book \u00a7 4126, which describes our review of \u201ccauses\u201d decided by the Appellate Court, as having been intended to enlarge our statutory jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">In this case, the Appellate Court did not undertake finally to determine an appeal. Instead, in accordance with \u00a7 54-63g, the Appellate Court granted the defendant\u2019s petition for review of the revocation of his bail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>but denied the relief that he had requested. That decision was neither the determination of \u201can appeal\u201d nor action that constituted a final judgment. In a criminal proceeding, there is no final judgment until the imposition of a sentence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>202 Conn. 86, 89, 519 A.2d 1201 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grotton, </em>180 Conn. 290, 293, 429 A.2d 871 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">It may be true, as the defendant contends, that some interlocutory orders are directly appealable to a court that has the statutory jurisdiction to hear them. The general rule is, however, that interlocutory orders in criminal cases are not immediately appealable. <em>United States </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>435 U.S. 850, 857, 98 S. Ct. 1547, 56 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1978) (denial of motion for speedy trial); <em>Cogen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>278 U.S. 221, 227-28, 49 S. Ct. 118, 73 L. Ed. 275 (1929) (denial of motion for return of seized property); <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>203 Conn. 33, 34, 522 A.2d 1234 (1987) (finding of probable cause to believe criminal offense has been committed); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>195 Conn. 303, 306, 488 A.2d 778 (1985) (denial of a motion to transfer to the criminal docket); <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>192 Conn. 85, 89, 469 A.2d 1220 (1984) (denial of motion for youthful offender status); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spendolini, </em>189 Conn. 92, 97, 454 A.2d 720 (1983) (denial of motion for accelerated rehabilitation); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grotton, </em>supra, 295-96 (granting of state\u2019s motion to take nontestimonial evidence from defendant); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>124 Conn. 639, 646-47,1 A.2d 761 (1938) (permitting defendant access to grand jury minutes); compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>182 Conn. 124, 126, 438 A.2d 30 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1090, 101 S. Ct. 883, 66 L. Ed. 2d 817 (1981) (colorable double jeopardy claim immediately appeal-able). Notably, this court has reviewed, on appeal after a final judgment, a criminal defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court had violated his state constitutional right to be released on bail. <em>State </em>v. <em>Olds, </em>171 Conn. 395, 404, 370 A.2d 969 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Even when we have entertained the possibility that an interlocutory order in a criminal case might warrant an immediate appeal; see <em>State </em>v. Curcio, 191 Conn. 27, 463 A.2d 566 (1983); we have recognized that \u201c[t]he right of appeal is purely statutory.\u201d Id., 30. The legislature has the authority to make interlocutory orders immediately appealable; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-278l </em>(prejudgment remedies) and General Statutes \u00a7 52-405 (accounting); or to characterize interlocutory orders as final judgments for the purposes of an appeal. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 54-56e (denial of motion to dismiss upon completion of accelerated rehabilitation program or termination of participation in such a program). There is, however, no statutory authority that confers on the defendant a right to an interlocutory appeal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The legislature also has the authority to make interlocutory orders immediately reviewable, in summary fashion, by authorizing petitions for review, usually within a limited time period, and often specifically to the Appellate Court. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 51-164x (closure orders); General Statutes \u00a7 54-47g (a) (grand jury disclosures). With respect to the petition for review authorized in this case by \u00a7 54-63g, as with regard to \u00a7\u00a7 51-164x and 54-47g (a), the legislature has designated the Appellate Court, and not this court, as the appropriate forum for the disposition of such petitions. Statutory permission to file a petition for review does not authorize the filing of a full-fledged appeal, either in the Appellate Court or in this court. The limited review contemplated by \u00a7 54-63g does not confer jurisdiction on this court to grant certification to reconsider the merits of the action taken by the Appellate Court. Absent statutory authorization, this court has no inherent judicial authority to grant certification to hear appeals concerning contested orders of trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>judges. See <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 85-01, </em>221 Conn. 625, 605 A.2d 545 (1992); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>109 Conn. 738, 147 A. 670 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In light of these precedents, the petition for certification to appeal under \u00a7 51-197f must therefore be dismissed. As in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>supra, we have no jurisdiction to grant a certified appeal to review the Appellate Court\u2019s disposition of a petition for review under \u00a7 54-63g.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The question that remains, however, is whether there is any other jurisdictional basis for this court to consider the serious constitutional issues that the defendant has raised. The special circumstances of this case fit within the substantive ambit of General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a (a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which allows the chief justice to certify a direct appeal to the Supreme Court from an interlocutory order of the Superior Court on an issue of law that \u201cinvolves a matter of substantial public interest and in which delay may work a substantial injustice.\u201d To avail himself of this special right to appeal, however, a litigant must ordinarily request certification \u201cwithin two weeks from the date of the issuance of the order or decision\u201d of the Superior Court for which expedited review is being sought. Because of the defendant\u2019s recourse to the petition for review authorized by \u00a7 54-63g, he can no longer comply with these time constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The Supreme Court will, nonetheless, treat the defendant\u2019s petition for certification under \u00a7 51-197\u00cd as a late petition for certification under \u00a7 52-265a (a). The chief justice has agreed to waive the defendant\u2019s delay in filing this petition, and has determined that the defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 54-64f warrants an immediate appeal from the order of the Superior Court in accordance with \u00a7 52-265a (a). The merits of the defendant\u2019s appeal are therefore properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">We now turn, therefore, to consider the second certified question on appeal, that is whether General Statutes \u00a7 54-64f (c), as applied to the defendant, violated the right of bail provision of article first, \u00a7 8 of our state constitution. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Section 8 of article first provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right . . . to be released on bail upon sufficient security, except in capital offenses, where the proof is evident or the presumption great . . . .\u201d We have previously concluded that this provision guarantees bail in a reasonable amount in \u201call cases, even capital cases not falling within the exception.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>159 Conn. 264, 269, 268 A.2d 667 (1970); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>164 Conn. 661, 295 A.2d 666 (1972).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>a fundamental constitutional right to bail pending trial in all but certain capital offenses. <em>State </em>v. Olds, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Pursuant to bail reform undertaken in 1990, the legislature amended many of the provisions on bail contained in the General Statutes and added others. For persons arrested and charged with certain class A, B, C and D felonies, General Statutes \u00a7 54-64a, amended pursuant to Public Acts 1990, No. 90-213, \u00a7 51, authorizes a trial court to impose nonfinancial conditions of release that it determines will \u201creasonably assure the appearance of the arrested person in court and that the safety of any other person will not be endangered.\u201d Section 54-64e imposes as a nonfinancial condition of all pretrial and posttrial releases that \u201cthe person released not commit a federal, state or local crime during the period of release.\u201d Section 53 of Public Acts 1990, No. 90-213, codified as \u00a7 54-64f, enumerates possible sanctions for violation of a condition of release or the commission of a crime while on release, ranging from the imposition of different or additional conditions of release to the revocation of release where the defendant is on release with respect to an offense with a possible term of imprisonment of ten or more years. General Statutes \u00a7 54-64f (b) and (c). \u201cThe revocation of a defendant\u2019s release . . . shall cause any bond posted in the criminal proceeding to be automatically terminated and the surety to be released.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-64f (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Consequently, the condition that the defendant not commit any federal, state or local crime was automatically imposed upon the defendant\u2019s pretrial release from confinement on June 5, 1991. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 54-64e requires that, at the time of release, the defendant be notified in writing: \u201c(1) Of the condition specified in subsection (a) of this section and any additional conditions of release; (2) that violation of any condition of release may result in the imposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>different or additional conditions of release; (3) that if he is released with respect to an offense for which a term of imprisonment of ten or more years may be imposed and the court finds that he has violated any condition of release and the safety of any other person is endangered while he is on release, his release may be revoked.\u201d The defendant has not challenged the adequacy of the notice that he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In light of the certified questions that limited the defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to his right to bail in the circumstances of this case,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we construe the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal as having two components. First, the defendant urges us to construe \u00a7 54-64f (c), in order to preserve the statute\u2019s constitutionality, to require the setting of a new bond as the only penalty for breach of conditions of release. Second, the defendant maintains that if such a construction is not adopted, it was constitutionally imper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>missible for the trial court to apply the statute in this case to revoke his bond in its entirety.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">We reject the defendant\u2019s statutory construction argument as inconsistent with the language of \u00a7 54-64f (c). Subsection (c) provides that \u201c[i]f the defendant is on release with respect to an offense for which a term of imprisonment of ten or more years may be imposed and the court, after an evidentiary hearing, finds by clear and convincing evidence that the safety of any other person is endangered while the defendant is on release and that there is probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed a federal, state or local crime while on release, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that his release should be revoked.\u201d Despite its clear language, relying on the admonition that \u201cwhen presented with a constitutional challenge to a validly enacted statute, [we] construe the statute, if possible, to comport with the constitution\u2019s requirements\u201d; <em>Rules Committee of the Superior Court </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, 192 Conn. 234, 240, 472 A.2d 9 (1984); the defendant and the amicus urge us to construe \u00a7 54-64f (c) to require that a new and perhaps higher bond, with additional conditions, be ordered following revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u201cStatutory language is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning unless such meaning is clearly at odds with the legislative intent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Taylor, 153 Conn. 72, 82, 214 A.2d 362 (1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 921, 86 S. Ct. 1372, 16 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1966); see also <em>Kil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>duff v. Adams, Inc., </em>219 Conn. 314, 336-37, 593 A.2d 478 (1991). Section 54-64f (c) provides that a trial court may, in certain circumstances, <em>revoke </em>a defendant\u2019s <em>release. </em>Revoke means to \u201cannul or make void by recalling or taking back. To cancel, rescind, repeal, reverse, as to revoke a license or will.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). Absent language indicating that the legislature intended a new release to be granted in all cases, the use of the term \u201crevoke\u201d denotes finality. Read literally, therefore, \u00a7 54-64f (c) authorizes the permanent revocation of release.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The conclusion that the legislature in \u00a7 54-64f (c) contemplated permanent revocation is further bolstered by language in the first part of \u00a7 54-64f (b). Subsection (b) permits the trial court, upon a violation of a condition of release, to \u201cimpose different or additional conditions\u201d upon a defendant\u2019s release where the offense for which the defendant is released has a maximum sentence of less than ten years. If the legislature, by using the term \u201crevoke\u201d in the remaining part of subsection (b) and subsection (c), had intended that, following revocation of release, the trial court must always grant a new release on new or different terms, the language of the first part of subsection (b) would be rendered meaningless. \u201cSuch an interpretation undercuts the established principle that no part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 274, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">For three reasons, we conclude that \u00a7 54-64f (c) was not unconstitutionally applied in this case. First, the statute, properly viewed, implements the inherent judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>cial authority of trial courts to compel compliance with conditions of release. Second, revocation of release is consistent with ensuring a defendant\u2019s appearance in court. Third, good behavior while on pretrial release has been recognized historically as a legitimate purpose of bail in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The fundamental right to bail guaranteed under our state constitution must be qualified by a court\u2019s authority to ensure compliance with the conditions of release. While released on bail prior to trial, a defendant is still within the constructive custody of the law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>140 Conn. 326, 330-31, 99 A.2d 133 (1953). The trial court retains jurisdiction over the conditions of release; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 54-69 to 54-69b; Practice Book \u00a7 673; and possesses the inherent authority \u201c \u2018to exercise powers; to implement and enforce laws; to exact obedience.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Dodson, </em>214 Conn. 344, 350, 572 A.2d 328, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 896, 111 S. Ct. 247, 112 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1990); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>80 Conn. 668, 671, 69 A. 1057 (1908). One court has noted that \u201ca specific statute granting the trial court authority to revoke bail [upon the violation of a reasonable condition of release] is not necessary, since a court with jurisdiction over a criminal case has the power to enforce its orders as to bail just as it has control over other orders.\u201d <em>Mello </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>117 R.I. 578, 583-84, 370 A.2d 1262 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">We agree with the state that the power to enforce reasonable conditions of release is a necessary component of a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over a criminal case. Indeed, since 1976, the rules of court of this state have provided that \u201c[a]fter a hearing and upon a finding that the defendant has violated reasonable conditions imposed on his release, the judicial authority may impose different or additional conditions upon the defendant\u2019s release or <em>revoke his </em>release.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book, 1963 as amended to 1976, \u00a7 2094 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>(now \u00a7 683). In this case, an explicit condition placed upon the defendant\u2019s release on bail was to refrain from committing any federal, state or local crimes. The trial court allowed the defendant\u2019s pretrial release from confinement, and the defendant acquiesced in the trial court\u2019s condition of release. The defendant was subsequently arrested on charges that, while on release, he had engaged in an unprovoked brutal assault on Mathews in broad daylight. Upon the trial court\u2019s finding of probable cause to believe that the defendant had committed this crime, it had the power, either pursuant to its jurisdiction over the criminal case, or pursuant to \u00a7 54-64f (c),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to revoke the defendant\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Standards promulgated by the American Bar Association are in accord with this view. They note that \u201c[t]he concept of conditional pretrial release would be meaningless if courts lacked the power to rescind release after release conditions have been violated. . . . Defendants who have violated those terms have disregarded judicial orders. As long as they are proceeded against in a constitutionally fair fashion, they may be incarcerated in the same manner as persons convicted of contempt.\u201d American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice, Pretrial Release Standards (1985 Rev.) \u00a7 10-5.8 (a), p. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Revocation of the defendant\u2019s release did not encroach upon his constitutional right to be released on bail. The defendant\u2019s failure to abide by the conditions of his release resulted in a forfeiture of his right to release.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because the defendant was initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>released on bail, the requirements of article first, \u00a7 8, as announced by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>supra, were met. As one court noted, in effect, \u201cthe keys to continued freedom [were] left in the pocket of the accused.\u201d <em>Rendel </em>v. <em>Mummert, </em>106 Ariz. 233, 238, 474 P.2d 824 (1970). Having been released on bail, and having subsequently violated the condition placed upon the release that he not commit a federal, state or local crime, the defendant cannot be heard to complain that his constitutional right to bail was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Our conclusion that the trial court had the authority to revoke the defendant\u2019s bail is not inconsistent with our statement in <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>supra, 269, that the \u201cfundamental purpose of bail is to ensure the presence of an accused throughout all proceedings.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>supra, 330. It is reasonable to suppose that a defendant who is arrested and charged with the commission of additional and serious crimes while on pretrial release might, as a result of these charges, more readily be tempted to flee the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The historical roots of the right to bail in this state illuminate the proposition that the constitution of 1818 was not intended to provide the defendant with an unconstricted right to bail. To comprehend the true import of the right to bail under our constitution, it is helpful to consider the historical record of the period before and at the time of the adoption of the provision. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 538-39 n.4, 541 n.8, 594 A.2d 917 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 178-81, 579 A.2d 484 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Consideration of the customary purposes of bail prior to the adoption of the constitution of 1818 supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>conclusion that, while ensuring the appearance of the defendant is a <em>primary </em>purpose of bail in this state, it is not necessarily the sole purpose. The statutory right to bail in Connecticut is traceable to a 1672 legislative enactment declaring that \u201cno mans person shall be Restrained or Imprisoned by any Authority whatsoever, before the Law hath sentenced him thereunto if he can put in sufficient security, bayl or mainprize for his appearance and <em>good behaviour </em>in the mean time, unless it be in Crimes Capital, and Contempt in open Court, or in such cases where some express Law doth allow it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Laws and Liberties of Connecticut Colonie, reprinted in The Laws of Connecticut: An Exact Reprint of the Original Edition of 1673 (G. Brinley Ed. 1865) p. 32; see also The Public Statute Laws of Connecticut, tit. I, p. 24 n.7 (1808); C. Collier, \u201cThe Connecticut Declaration of Rights Before the Constitution of 1818: A Victim of Revolutionary Redefinition,\u201d 15 Conn. L. Rev. 87, 93 n.19 (1982). A substantially identical provision on bail was included in the 1750 revision of the Declaration of Rights; see The Public Statute Laws of Connecticut, supra; see also C. Collier, supra; which, we have stated, \u201chad constitutional overtones even though it was statutory in form.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra, 179; see also C. Collier, supra, 94; 2 Z. Swift, A System of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1796) p. 391 (\u201c[i]n respect of bail, our law determines that no man's person shall be restrained, or imprisoned by any authority whatever, before the law has sentenced him thereto, if he can or will give sufficient security, bail, or mainprize, for his appearance and good behaviour in the mean time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Neither the text of the 1818 constitution<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> nor that of any subsequent constitution has made express reference in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>its bail provision to the defendant\u2019s appearance or to the defendant\u2019s good behavior. Legislative references to either purpose were eliminated from statutes enacted after 1818 and before 1849, while language providing that bail was conditioned upon a defendant\u2019s appearance before the court reappeared in statutes enacted in 1949 and remained thereafter. There is no evidence, however, that the framers of the 1818 constitution intended to abandon the customary purposes of bail that were in effect at the time of the adoption of the constitution and had been for at least 145 years. This court has previously stated that \u201c[t]he constitution adopted in 1818 did not create a government but gave to that which had already been established the sanction of the people and, in very general language, formulated its framework.\u201d <em>Dowe </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>133 Conn. 112, 119, 48 A.2d 735 (1946); see also C. Collier, supra, 96 (\u201cthe substance of the ancient statutory and common law protections continued unchanged\u201d following the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1818).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In 1981 the legislature expressly authorized a defendant\u2019s pretrial release upon a written notice to appear with nonfinancial conditions imposed. Public Acts 1981, No. 81-437. Prior to 1981, a defendant was either released upon execution of a written promise to appear or upon a bond with or without surety. General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 54-64a. Conditioning pretrial release on a defendant\u2019s ability to meet a financial bond set by the court emphasizes the appearance aspect of bond more so than do many nonfinancial conditions commonly imposed now pursuant to \u00a7 54-64a (c). The use of nonfinancial conditions of release in addition to or in lieu of bond has broadened the focus of the purposes of bail to recognize, once again, that bail is a method for ensuring a defendant\u2019s good behavior while on release.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The courts of numerous other states with constitutional provisions similar to ours concur that a defendant\u2019s bail can be revoked following the violation of a condition of release or for the commission of a crime while on release. In <em>Taglianetti </em>v. <em>Langlois, </em>105 R.I. 596, 600, 253 A.2d 609 (1969), the Rhode Island Supreme Court held that its constitution, like ours, provided bail as a matter of right in all but capital cases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in <em>Mello </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, reasoning that a defendant\u2019s pressure to flee increases when he commits crimes while free on bail; id., 582; the court held that revocation of bail is a proper remedy for violating a condition imposed upon a defendant\u2019s release. Id., 585. It rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court may only set new and higher bail with more stringent conditions, stating that \u201cwe do not think our Constitution must be read as providing a continuing, renewable right to bail on the same charge where a bail condition has been breached. The state need not keep freeing the defendant while upping the ante.\u201d Id., 583. It further noted that \u201c[t]he authority of the court to revoke bail in certain situations ought not to be construed as authority to exercise preventive detention. The former is a sanction for past acts, the latter a prophylactic for the future. We are concerned with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>former.\u201d Id., 585; see also <em>Bridges </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>121 R.I. 101, 105 n.3, 396 A.2d 97 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In <em>People ex rel. Hemingway </em>v. <em>Elrod, </em>60 Ill. 2d 74, 83-84, 322 N.E.2d 837 (1975), the Illinois Supreme Court recognized a trial court\u2019s authority to revoke a defendant\u2019s release on bail for the violation of a condition of release or the commission of a serious crime while awaiting trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It concluded that, while \u201c[t]he object of bail, of course, is to make certain the defendant\u2019s appearance in court\u201d; id., 81; \u201c[t]he court has the inherent authority to enforce its orders and to require reasonable conduct from those over whom it has jurisdiction.\u201d Id., 83. The court emphasized that by concluding that a defendant\u2019s bail could be revoked for violating a condition of release, it was \u201cnot adopting the principle of preventive detention of one charged with a criminal offense for the protection of the public\u201d and declined to discuss \u201cthe wisdom or the constitutionality of that principle.\u201d Id., 80; see also <em>Rendel </em>v. <em>Mummert, </em>supra, 237-38; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>402 So. 2d 525, 526 (Fla.

In our view, the Connecticut constitution confers upon our trial courts a similar authority, in the proper circumstances, to revoke a defendant\u2019s bail for serious noncompliance with the conditions of his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The certified appeal is dismissed; upon the granting of review pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a, the order of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>In this opinion Callahan, Covello and Borden, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 54-64f. violation op conditions of release.

General Statutes \u00a7 51-197f provides that this court may certify cases for review \u201c[u]pon final determination of any appeal by the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>late court.\u201d The present appeal is from a final determination by the Appellate Court regarding the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be free on bail prior to conviction. Any judicial determination depriving a person of liberty, which never can be returned to him or her, constitutes a final judgment. Indeed, I cannot think of anything else more final. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 51-197f to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">If not a final judgment, the Appellate Court\u2019s denial of the relief requested surely comes within the second exception of <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983)\u2014that is, \u201cwhere the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Again, if the defendant was improperly denied bail, further proceedings cannot affect that right because his lost freedom cannot be returned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Furthermore, the procedural posture of this case requires that we exercise our general supervisory authority over the Appellate Court. Practice Book \u00a7 4127 (3). After the trial court refused to set a new bond once the defendant\u2019s pretrial release was revoked pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-64f, the defendant filed a petition for review with the Appellate Court raising substantial questions of first impression for this state, which included whether \u00a7 54-64f passes muster under our state constitution. Even though the defendant complained that he was being unconstitutionally deprived of his liberty, the Appellate Court denied the defendant\u2019s request for relief sought in the motion to review without setting forth its reasons, either in written or oral form.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Although I do not agree that it was necessary to invoke \u00a7 52-265a, I do agree that the defendant \u201cis aggrieved by an order or decision of the superior court in an action which involves a matter of substantial public interest and in which delay may work a substantial injustice.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a (a). Since the chief justice made her certification under \u00a7 52-265a (b), we surely have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">I am concerned, however, that since the statute provides for only vague statutory guidelines, the chief justice, in writing for the majority, did not provide an analytical framework for the application of \u00a7 52-265a. We, therefore, do not have the benefit of any guidance for future cases, especially in situations, such as this case, wherein the chief justice invoked the jurisdiction of this court under \u00a7 52-265a on her own motion, notwithstanding the requirements of that statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> am sure that the legislature, in granting this discretion to one justice, albeit the chief justice, did not intend to grant that justice unbridled discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>One further preliminary matter needs comment. It is implicit in the chief justice\u2019s certification under \u00a7 52-265a that she finds that the present issue \u201cinvolves a matter of substantial public interest,\u201d and I agree, as indicated above. Under these circumstances, the chief justice should have ordered reargument of this case before the full court so that the people of the state would have the benefit of all the justices\u2019 opinion on this important issue involving the deprivation of a person\u2019s liberty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 51-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s disposition of the merits of the present case. The plain, clear and concise language of our bail provision in the state constitution requires that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have a right ... to be released on bail upon sufficient security, except in capital offenses, where the proof is evident or the presumption great . . . .\u201d Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8. Today, the majority, in interpreting that \u00a7 54-64f permits the court to revoke the bond of the defendant without setting a new bond, imports on our state constitution a \u201cgood behavior\u201d clause that it claims was engrafted there as a result of statutory and common law precedent. It seems to me that if good behavior was an exception to the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>of bail, then the framers of our constitution would have made it explicit, just as they have done for certain capital offenses. Indeed, the chief justice wrote in her dissenting opinion in <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 77, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984), the following: \u201cWhen constitutional provisions, read in context with each other, guarantee constitutional rights, subject only to the explicit limitation that they shall not be abused, is it proper to add an additional limitation that the constitution itself does not contain? While the intent of the framers is an important resource to <em>resolve </em>ambiguity, it is not an appropriate resource to <em>create </em>ambiguity. As Dean Ely notes, it is important \u2018to bring to the fore what seems invariably to get lost in excursions into the intent of the framers, namely that <em>the most important datum hearing on what was intended is the constitutional language itself. \u2019 </em>(Emphasis in original.) J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980) p. 16. We have recognized the same rule of construction in <em>Borino </em>v. <em>Lounsbury, </em>86 Conn. 622, 625, 86 A. 597 (1913), where we relied on 1 Story on the Constitution (5th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 405, 407, to limit the role of evidence of the intent of the framers of the Connecticut constitution.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) This rule applies with equal force in the present case because, as we held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>159 Conn. 264, 269, 268 A.2d 667 (1970), \u201cthe bail provision of \u00a7 8 of article first of our constitution makes clear that it was intended that in all cases, even capital cases not falling within the exception, bail in a reasonable amount should be ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">I do not question the authority of the trial court or the legislature to place reasonable conditions on bail, including a \u201cgood behavior\u201d requirement. Because, however, our constitution does not expressly allow for the denial of bail for the breach of a condition, once the bond is revoked because of such a breach, the trial court must set new bail to provide again for the release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>of the accused. Undoubtedly, the trial court, in setting the new bail, may consider that the subsequent bad conduct of the accused would increase the likelihood that he or she might flee and, therefore, the trial court could command a higher surety. <em>Mello </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, 117 R.I. 578, 582, 370 A.2d 1262 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In <em>Mello, </em>the issue before the Rhode Island Supreme Court was similar to the issue in the present appeal; that is, whether the complete revocation of bail is a proper remedy for a violation of a condition imposed upon an accused\u2019s release. In his dissent, Justice Doris concluded that the violation of a good behavior condition to bail should not strip the accused of the right to be released on bail a second time. Id., 591 (Doris, J., dissenting). He stated that \u201c[i]f a condition of bail is breached, bail may be forfeited and a new bail set. If the breach is flagrant, citation for contempt may be appropriate. But a court should not be allowed to enforce its orders by attempting to withhold constitutional rights.\u201d Id., 592. I agree with Justice Doris in <em>Mello </em>where he aptly noted that \u201crevocation of bail solely for breach of a condition comes perilously close to preventive detention.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">In <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>State, </em>261 Ark. 384, 387, 548 S.W.2d 822 (1977), relying in part on article two, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9 of the Arkansas constitution (1874), the Supreme Court of Arkansas held that a criminal defendant \u201chas an absolute right before conviction, except in capital cases, to a reasonable bail.\u201d The court concluded that the imposition of bail with reasonable terms and conditions passes constitutional muster because, if the accused violates the terms of the present bail, the trial court is required to set new and reasonable bail and not refuse any future release of the petitioner on any bail. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The framers of our state constitution placed a high priority on the right to be free pending a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>tion of guilt. By drafting article first, \u00a7 8 of our constitution, which has its roots in our first constitution; see Conn. Const, of 1818, art. I, \u00a7 14;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the framers obviously recognized that more than liberty is lost when bail is denied. It is well documented that \u201c[p]retrial detention lessens [the presumption of innocence] because an accused is now treated as a convict before trial. An accused individual loses time and liberty, jobs frequently disappear, family and friend relationships are disrupted. The physical appearance of an accused is affected during this period of detention. This impedes upon the ability to prepare an effective defense. As a result, an accused individual is more likely to be convicted and there is a greater likelihood that a severe sentence will be imposed. This violates due process since an accused individual loses liberty during pretrial detention prior to an adjudication of guilt at trial.\u201d Comment, \u201c <em>United States v. Salerno: </em>A Reduction of Individual Rights,\u201d 15 New Eng. J. on Crim. and Civ. Confinement, 147, 161-62 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">I would hold that, although bail for the defendant may be revoked under \u00a7 54-64f, upon application by the defendant, new bail must be set in accordance with the provisions of article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution. I would, therefore, order that the Appellate Court remand the matter to the trial court with instructions to set new bail. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a provides: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 52-264 and 52-265, any party to an action who is aggrieved by an order or decision of the superior court in an action which involves a matter of substantial public interest and in which delay may work a substantial injustice, may appeal under this section from the order or decision to the supreme court within two weeks from the date of the issuance of the order or decision.
