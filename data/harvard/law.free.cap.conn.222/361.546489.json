The defendant partnerships, Valley Farms, Maple Shade Farms, Starr Farms and REM Motor Rental, appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court granting the application of the plaintiff, Shawmut Bank, N.A.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a prejudgment remedy of replevin of certain property of the defendants. The defendants claim that: (1) the statutory scheme authorizing replevin<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> violates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>federal due process clause; and (2) the property sought to be replevied is exempt from execution and, therefore, from replevin by way of a prejudgment remedy. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">For purposes of this appeal, the following facts are undisputed. The defendants operate farms in Connecticut. Pursuant to a series of documents consisting of certain letter agreements, demand promissory notes, security agreements and guaranties executed by the defendants in 1985,1986 and 1991, the plaintiff loaned the defendants $1,200,000, and the defendants granted the plaintiff a security interest in all the defendants\u2019 assets, including equipment, inventory, livestock and feed. The second of the letter agreements provided that, upon default, the defendants would voluntarily surrender possession of the collateral to the plaintiff. Despite the defendants\u2019 default on repayment of the loan, they refused to comply with the plaintiff\u2019s request for possession of the collateral. The plaintiff thereupon brought this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The plaintiff filed an application for a prejudgment remedy alleging that there was probable cause to believe that a judgment would be rendered against the defendants, and sought an order of the court \u201cdirecting that the following prejudgment remedy be issued to secure the sum of One Million Five Hundred Thousand ($1,500,000.00) Dollars, to wit: To replevy the goods and chattels described on Exhibit A A attached hereto.\u201d Exhibit AA listed, in general terms, all the livestock, feed and equipment owned by the four defendants, and also listed, by model year and serial number, certain equipment owned by the defendants Valley Farms and REM Motor Rental. Attached to the application was an eight page affidavit of Kevin C. Murphy, a vice president of the plaintiff, describing the transactions between the plaintiff and the defendants. Attached to the affidavit were copies of the various let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ter agreements, promissory notes, security agreements, and guaranties of the defendants. Also attached to the application was an unsigned writ, summons and complaint alleging, inter alia, that the defendants had wrongfully refused to turn the collateral over to the plaintiff, and requesting, in the prayer for relief, immediate possession of the collateral, monetary damages if the collateral could not be replevied to the plaintiff, damages for wrongful detention of the collateral, attorneys\u2019 fees, and other equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Pursuant to an order of the trial court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing on July 29,1991. After the hearing, the trial court found probable cause that judgment would be rendered in the matter in favor of the plaintiff, and also found the total indebtedness of the defendants to the plaintiff to be $1,080,000. The court did not, however, issue an order of replevin. Instead, it continued the case for two weeks in order for the parties to file briefs on the defendants\u2019 claim that the property was exempt from a prejudgment remedy. Also, in response to an argument of the defendants, the court ruled that the plaintiffs application was defective because it lacked an affidavit of the actual value of the property to be replevied and a proper bond. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-518 as set out in footnote 3, supra. The court instructed the plaintiff to amend its application in order to remedy these defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The parties returned to court on August 12, 1991. Prior to that date, the plaintiff had filed an affidavit evaluating the collateral at $3,150,000, and a bond in the amount of $6,300,000, twice the value of the collateral. After oral arguments, the trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s application. It ordered that the plaintiff could replevy the collateral to the value of $3,150,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">We first consider the defendants\u2019 claim, rejected by the trial court, that the property sought to be replevied was exempt from prejudgment remedy attachment because it constituted \u201c[tjools, books, instruments and farm animals which are necessary to the exemptioner in the course of his or her occupation or profession.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 52-352b (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>court and the plaintiff that the exemptions from post-judgment remedies, and therefore from prejudgment attachment, afforded by General Statutes \u00a7 52-352b, apply only to \u201cproperty of any natural person\u201d under that statute and, therefore, do not apply to property of partnerships, like the defendants.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Section 52-352b, which is part of chapter 906, entitled \u201cPostjudgment Procedures,\u201d exempts from postjudgment procedures certain \u201cproperty of any natural person.\u201d Although the term \u201cnatural person\u201d is not defined in chapter 906, it clearly means a human being, as opposed to an artificial or juristic entity. First, the types of property that are exempt under \u00a7 52-352b, other than the \u201c[tjools, books, instruments and farm animals\u201d referred to in subsection (b), are the types normally associated with individuals, not legal entities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, the legislature has consistently used the term \u201cnatural person\u201d in order to distinguish it from a partnership. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 1-18a (c) (\u201c \u2018Person\u2019 means natural person, partnership, association or society.\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 33-374d (10) (\u201c \u2018Person\u2019 means a natural person, company, partnership, foreign or domestic corporation, trust, unincor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>porated organization, government or any other entity or political subdivision, agency or instrumentality of a government. . . General Statutes \u00a7 34-9 (12) (\u201c \u2018Person\u2019 means a natural person, partnership, limited partnership, foreign limited partnership, trust, estate, association or corporation.\u201d). Finally, except where a word or phrase has a technical meaning or has acquired \u201ca peculiar and appropriate meaning in the law,\u201d a statutory word or phrase \u201cshall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). Consistent with that rule of construction, \u201cnatural person\u201d means \u201ca human being as distinguished in law from an artificial or juristic person.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">We are unpersuaded by the defendants\u2019 argument that excluding partnerships from the exemption of \u00a7 52-352b would \u201crender the exemption meaningless as applied to the few remaining small family farms\u201d because \u201cevery family that owns and operates a farm collectively could be deemed to be a partnership . . . .\u201d Unlike these defendants, who have chosen to operate their farms in the partnership form, others remain free to own their farm assets in individual or joint ownership forms and thereby retain the statutory exemption available to natural persons. See, e.g., <em>Gangl </em>v. <em>Gangl, </em>281 N.W.2d 574 (N.D. 1979) (family farm not a partnership). These defendants presumably saw some legal advantage to operating the farms as partnerships. Having done so, they must accept any legal disadvantage that arises from the limitation of \u00a7 52-352b to property owned by a natural person.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">We turn, therefore, to the defendants\u2019 principal claim, namely, that the statutory scheme for replevin of goods <em>on its face </em>fails to satisfy due process of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The defendants identify three \u201cprocedural inadequacies in the statutory scheme\u201d that, they argue, render the statutory scheme, and thus this replevin order, invalid: (1) an ex parte replevin is permitted upon a showing only of probable cause rather than of exigent circumstances; (2) General Statutes \u00a7 52-521 provides for a challenge to the amount and form of the bond only after the seizure has occurred; and (3) the statutes do not require that the property to be replevied be identified. Recognizing that, as the applicable statutes were interpreted and applied by the trial court in this case, each of these requirements was either met or was inapplicable,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the defendants argue that the statutes must be viewed facially, rather than as applied, because they \u201care unconstitutional in every application,\u201d and that, therefore, \u201cthe fact that the court was willing to give [the defendants] more process than the statutes authorize does not save the statutes from constitutional challenge.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">First, we reject the contention that we are required to gauge the constitutionality of our replevin statutes on their face, without regard to the particular facts of this case or the interpretation placed on the statutory language by the trial court. \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has noted that to mount a facial challenge to a statute, one must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid. The fact that the [Act] might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid, since we have not recognized an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>\u2018overbreadth\u2019 doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment. <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>[467 U.S. 253, 269 n.18, 104 S. Ct. 2403, 81 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1984)]. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 745, 753-55, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 95 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 344 n.12, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992). This well established principle is consistent with the equally well established principles that \u201c \u2018[d]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands\u2019 <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>222 Conn. 233, 242-43, 610 A.2d 574 (1992); and that we strive to read statutes so as to preserve, rather than to undermine, their constitutionality. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>218 Conn. 151, 156, 588 A.2d 179 (1991). We therefore view the question of the constitutionality of the statutes at issue as applied under the facts of this case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>supra. We conclude that the replevin statutes, as applied by the trial court to this case, comport with the requirements of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In support of their claim, the defendants offer no more than the bare assertion that the statutes at issue are unconstitutional under any conceivable set of circumstances. Indeed, the facts of this case belie that assertion, since the trial court, relying on its interpretation of the statutes, provided the defendants with nearly all the process that they claimed to be due, namely, the opportunity to challenge the amount and form of the bond before the seizure, and proper identification of the property to be replevied.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The trial court\u2019s interpretation, moreover, was firmly rooted in the statutory language and was not, as the defendants\u2019 argument suggests, a strained attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>salvage an obviously unsalvageable statutory scheme. General Statutes \u00a7 52-516 (b) provides that \u201c[a]n action of replevin, to the extent that it includes a prejudgment remedy as defined in section 52-278a, shall not be allowed unless the provisions of sections 52-278a to 52-2781, inclusive, are complied with.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 52-278a (d) specifically defines \u201c[p]rejudgment remedy\u201d to include the action of replevin.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-278a through 52-278h were \u201cenacted in response to the constitutional instructions of <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 92 S. Ct. 1983, 32 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 556 (1972), and <em>Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Finance Corporation, </em>395 U.S. 337, 89 S. Ct. 1820, 23 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1969).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. </em>v. <em>B. W. Beardsley, Inc., </em>208 Conn. 13, 16, 542 A.2d 1159 (1988). Thus, in order to obtain an order of replevin, the plaintiff was required to satisfy not only the requirements of the replevin statutes; General Statutes \u00a7 52-515 et seq.; but the requirements of due process as expressed in \u00a7\u00a7 52-278a through 52-278h.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">With regard to the identification of the property to be replevied, implicit in \u00a7\u00a7 52-278a through 52-278h is the requirement that property that is the subject of a prejudgment remedy be identified. The bench and bar of this state have always understood that identification to be a statutory requirement. Indeed, paragraph 2.a. of the statutory form for an application for a prejudgment remedy of attachment reflects that requirement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">With regard to the opportunity of the defendants to challenge the amount and form of the bond before the seizure, General Statutes \u00a7 52-521 (b) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[i]f the defendant is not satisfied with the recognizance, he may, at any time before the return day of the writ, cite the plaintiff or his attorney, or the officer serving the writ, if the property still remains in his custody, to appear at once before a judge of the superior court where the replevin was effected, to respond to a motion for a new bond.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is true, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the defendants argue, that \u00a7 52-521, as drafted, ordinarily contemplates a challenge to the bond after the seizure. That does not mean, however, that it is not subject to a construction, in order to save its constitutionality, that would require an opportunity by the defendant to challenge the amount and form of the bond prior to the seizure of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Section 52-521 (b) requires, as a matter of timing, only that the plaintiff challenge the bond \u201cat any time before the return day of the writ.\u201d That language does not preclude a construction that, for constitutional reasons, advances the time for such a challenge. Since, as the defendants point out, the effect of a replevin of their cattle on their property interest therein was substantial, because it would work \u201ca complete and physical taking of the cattle,\u201d and since \u201c[i]n order to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>with due process, notice and an opportunity to be heard must be afforded litigants at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. </em>v. <em>B. W. Beardsley, Inc., </em>supra, 17; it was consistent with the purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 52-278a through 52-278h for the trial court to interpret the time requirement of \u00a7 52-521 (b) so as to afford the defendants a preseizure opportunity to challenge the amount and form of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We are unpersuaded by the defendants\u2019 claim that the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Doehr, </em>500 U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 2105, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1991), required the plaintiff in this case to establish more than probable cause, namely, exigent circumstances, in order to obtain an order of replevin. In <em>Doehr, </em>\u201can ex parte attachment pursuant to the Connecticut [prejudgment remedy] statute in a tort action was held to violate due process . . . .\u201d <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Heggelund, </em>219 Conn. 620, 624 n.3, 594 A.2d 464 (1991). In that procedural context, the court held that exigent circumstances, rather than probable cause, were required in order to justify an ex parte deprivation of the defendant\u2019s property. <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Doehr, </em>supra, 2116.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Doehr. </em>Here, there was no ex parte deprivation. The replevin order did not issue until after the defendants had a full opportunity for an evidentiary hearing. Furthermore, unlike the situation in <em>Doehr, </em>in this case the probable cause standard was constitutionally sufficient because the facts at issue, namely, the existence of the debt and whether it was in default, were \u201c \u2018ordinarily uncomplicated matters that lend themselves to documentary proof.\u2019 \u201d Id., 2114, quoting <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 609, 94 S. Ct. 1895, 40 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1974). Therefore, \u201cthe risk of error was minimal . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Connecticut </em>v. <em>Doehr, </em>supra, 2115; see also <em>Union Trust Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>v. <em>Heggelund, </em>supra. Finally, unlike the situation in <em>Doehr, </em>where the \u201c[plaintiff had no existing interest in [the defendant\u2019s] real estate when he sought the attachment\u201d; <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Doehr, </em>supra; in this case the plaintiff had a preexisting security interest in the property sought to be replevied.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b382-5\"> The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\"> Shawmut Bank, N.A., is the successor in interest to Shawmut Bank of Boston, N.A., the original party to the transactions with the defendants.

Finally, the property to be replevied was fully identified in the documents presented to the court in the plaintiffs application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\"> We discuss, infra, the only other statutory deficiency identified by the defendants, namely, a provision that replevin may be ordered upon a finding of exigency rather than of probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\"> We recognize that, under some circumstances, it may be something of a misnomer to call a replevin action a \u201cprejudgment remedy,\u201d since the principal purpose of such an action is often, as in this case, to obtain a judgment authorizing possession of and the right to dispose of the property sought to be replevied in order to satisfy a preexisting debt; cf. <em>General Motors Acceptance Corporation </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>137 Conn. 145, 75 A.2d 391 (1950); and any other aspects of the judgment would be merely incidental to that purpose. It is clear, nonetheless, that the legislature has included replevin in the panoply of prejudgment remedies; General Statutes \u00a7 52-278a (a); and that the strictures of the due process clause apply to such an action. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>416 U.S. 600, 94 S. Ct. 1895, 40 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-278a provides: \u201cdefinitions.
