The ten original plaintiffs,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who are individual property owners in Bethany, filed an administrative appeal in Superior Court to challenge the action of the defendant inland wetlands commission of the town of Bethany (commission) granting the application of DJM Development Corporation (DJM) for a permit for a subdivision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (c) and (d). The commission moved the trial court to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal on the ground that one of the original plaintiffs, Attorney Max F. Brunswick,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had signed the citation in their appeal. The trial court denied the commission\u2019s motion to dismiss, but subsequently rendered judgment on the merits for the commission and DJM. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, which determined that Brunswick\u2019s signature on the citation had deprived the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal. The Appellate Court accordingly ordered that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal be dismissed. <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands </em>Commission, 25 Conn. App. 543, 596 A.2d 463 (1991). We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification to appeal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The following facts are not in dispute. DJM applied to the commission for a permit for a fourteen lot subdivision on property it owned in Bethany. The commission granted DJM\u2019s application. Ten individuals owning property that abuts DJM\u2019s parcel filed an administrative appeal challenging the propriety of the commission\u2019s approval of DJM\u2019s subdivision application. Brunswick, one of the plaintiffs, who is an attorney admitted to practice law in Connecticut and a commissioner of the Superior Court; see General Statutes \u00a7 51-85; Practice Book \u00a7 18; signed the citation that accompanied the complaint and caused it to be served on the defendants. Approximately eleven months later, the commission filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal \u201con the grounds that the writ and citation were not signed by a Commissioner of the Superior Court . . . .\u201d Four days later, Brunswick withdrew from the case and indicated that he would limit his future involvement in the case to the role of counsel for the remaining nine plaintiffs. The trial court, <em>Berdon, J., </em>after hearing oral argument on the motion to dismiss, denied the motion on the basis that the nine remaining plaintiffs \u201chave a right to be in this Court.\u201d The trial court, <em>Flanagan, J., </em>subsequently adjudicated the case on the merits and affirmed the commission\u2019s approval of DJM\u2019s application for a subdivision permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court. After supplemental briefing on the jurisdictional issue, the Appellate Court, relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Doolittle </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>47 Conn. 316 (1879), concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the plaintiffs' administrative appeal should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Doolittle </em>held that' an attorney cannot sign a writ in his own case. Id., 320-23. The Appellate Court ruled that <em>Doolittle </em>was still good law, both on its merits; <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>supra, 546-47; and because any reevaluation of its continued validity should be undertaken by this court. Id., 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">We granted certification to consider whether we should continue to adhere to the rule of law established in <em>Doolittle. </em>The plaintiffs urge this court to overrule <em>Doolittle </em>because the policy reasons underlying the court\u2019s decision in 1879 no longer exist. In the alternative, the plaintiffs argue that Brunswick\u2019s withdrawal from the administrative appeal cured any defect as to the other nine plaintiffs and that General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (p)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> authorizes such a cure of their appeal. The commission and DJM assert, to the contrary, that the policy considerations of the rule that an attorney may not sign the writ in his own case \u201ccontinue to be as viable in the late twentieth century as in 1879 . . . .\u201d They further contend that Brunswick\u2019s withdrawal from the appeal did not cure the defect as to the remaining plaintiffs because the citation was \u201cdefective ab initio as to all plaintiffs\u201d and that \u00a7 8-8 (p) does not cure such a defect. We agree with the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tiffs that current procedural safeguards have eroded many of the concerns upon which the <em>Doolittle </em>rule was predicated. We, therefore, overrule <em>Doolittle </em>and reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The procedures that govern an administrative appeal from the decision of an inland wetlands commission are, by virtue of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 (a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the procedures specified by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. Under \u00a7 4-183 (b), an administrative appeal must include a proper citation in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the court. See <em>McQuillan </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>216 Conn. 667, 671, 583 A.2d 633 (1990); <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>201 Conn. 350, 356, 514 A.2d 749 (1986); see also <em>Village Creek Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>148 Conn. 336, 339, 170 A.2d 732 (1961). \u201cIn administrative appeals, the citation is the writ of summons that directs the sheriff or some other proper officer to seek out the defendant agency and to summon it to a particular sitting of a particular court on a specified day. 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1970 &amp; Sup.) \u00a7 18. \u2018The citation, signed by a competent authority, is the warrant which bestows upon the officer to whom it is given for service the power and authority to execute its command. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>McQuillan </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Section 22a-43 (a) provides that an appeal from an inland wetlands commission \u201cshall be made returnable to said court in the same manner as that prescribed for civil actions brought to said court.\u201d A proper citation, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-45a,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is a document that, in addition to describing the parties, the court to which it is returnable, the return date and the date and place for filing an appearance, is \u201csigned by a commissioner of the superior court or a judge or clerk of the court to which it is returnable.\u201d As in <em>Doolittle, </em>the issue in this case is whether a citation is jurisdictionally defective if it is signed by a commissioner of the Superior Court who is himself a party to the litigation. The commission and DJM contend, as the Appellate Court held, that such a citation fails to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Construing the statute on mesne process in effect in 1879,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> this court in <em>Doolittle </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, concluded that an attorney was precluded from signing a writ in a case in which he was a plaintiff. Id., 322-23. The plaintiffs in that case were partners in a law firm. One of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the plaintiffs had signed the writ in a contract action brought in the name of the law firm. The defendants filed a plea in abatement on that ground. We stated that \u201c[i]t would not seem to require any extended argument to show that this ought not to be allowed under the laws of this state. ... It would be putting altogether too much power into the hands of one man, to be exercised for his own individual benefit, for if a plaintiff can sign his own writ in an ordinary action arising upon contract, he may sign it in an action arising from a tort, and without responsibility other than his own bond, may attach all the estate of the defendant or attach his body and commit him to prison.\u201d Id., 320-21. This court further stated that \u201c[o]ne object of the [mesne process] statute clearly is to throw some safeguard around the rights of a defendant, and that he might presume at least that the officers named in the act would not sign a writ for a groundless cause, nor grant one against his person or property to gratify the inclination of a litigious plaintiff. Another purpose which the statute has in view is that the writ shall be an instrument of dignity, bearing the impress of the power and authority of the state, and be respected and obeyed by the citizen against whom it is directed, its purpose being to compel his attendance before a proper tribunal, that justice may be done. But if each man who happens to be a justice of the peace, or commissioner of the Superior Court, or senator, may sign and issue a writ in his own name, there is no safeguard thrown around the process and no dignity attached to it.\u201d Id., 322-23. We abated the writ on these public policy grounds. Id., 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Seventy years after our decision in <em>Doolittle, </em>we extended its holding to apply as well to citations signed by attorneys who are plaintiffs in administrative appeals. In <em>Willard </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>135 Conn. 303, 305, 63 A.2d 847 (1949), an appeal from the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>of a zoning board of appeals, we stated that \u201c[t]he plaintiff is a commissioner of the Superior Court and himself signed the citation. This he may not do.\u201d In recent years, however, numerous trial court decisions have questioned the continued validity of the <em>Doolittle </em>principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The Appellate Court\u2019s ruling in this case construed <em>Doolittle </em>as stating a rule relating to the Superior Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>supra, 545-49. \u201c \u2018The requirement of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by any party and can be raised at any stage of the proceedings.\u2019 <em>\u201dNeyland v. Board of Education, </em>195 Conn. 174, 177, 487 A.2d 181 (1985); see also Practice Book \u00a7 145; <em>McQuillan </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 670; <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 351, 542 A.2d 672 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">Just three months after our decision <em>in Doolittle, </em>this court decided, however, that defendants who had not objected to the plaintiff attorney\u2019s signature on the writ \u201cuntil the case had been in court for nearly two years\u201d had waived their objection to the defect. <em>Parrott </em>v. <em>Housatonic R.R. Co., </em>47 Conn. 575, 576 (1880). Because the defendants had pleaded the general issue and the case was awaiting trial upon its merits, we did \u201cnot hesitate to regard the objection to the legal signing and issuing of the writ as waived,\u201d and, therefore, found no error. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\"><em>In Brown </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>166 Conn. 174, 175-76, 348 A.2d 666 (1974), this court similarly declined to dismiss an action on the basis that the writ had \u201cnot in fact [been] signed by a commissioner of the Superior Court . . . but, rather, [had been] signed by the plaintiff acting by an agent,\u201d and, therefore, the defendant contended, had not complied \u201cwith statutory requirements for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>issuance of mesne process.\u201d We noted that, despite the claimed defect in the writ, \u201cthe defendant nevertheless [had] entered a general appearance and [had] filed no pleading to open the default or to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction but [had] proceeded to contest the merits of the plaintiffs contentions and the relief which should be granted to him. Under these circumstances and the fact that the defendant failed to enter a special appearance . . . and properly to plead his jurisdictional contentions, it must be held that the defendant submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court and waived any right to claim that the court lacked jurisdiction over him because of any defect in the process to which he had responded.\u201d Id., 176-77; see also 1 E. Stephenson, supra, (1982 Sup.) \u00a7 17 (a) (\u201cA claim that a writ is improperly executed is waived by failure to file a timely motion to dismiss.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Although <em>Parrott </em>and <em>Brown </em>were civil causes of action and not administrative appeals, we conclude that the alleged defect in the citation in the present case affected only the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over the defendants. While we require strict compliance with statutory provisions upon the initiation of an administrative appeal; see <em>Chestnut Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 356; the statute on mesne process, \u00a7 52-45a, does not on its face exclude an attorney from signing a writ in a case in which he is a plaintiff. The rule that an attorney may not sign a writ in his own case, and the application of that rule to an administrative appeal, has developed solely through case law. See, e.g., <em>Doolittle </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 320; <em>Yudkin </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>60 Conn. 426, 428, 22 A. 776 (1891) (applying rule to judge or clerk); <em>Willard </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>supra, 304. Because the writs used to commence civil actions are analogous to the citations used to commence administrative appeals, there is no basis for regarding such a defect in the one as impli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>eating subject matter jurisdiction, while regarding the defect in the other as relating only to personal jurisdiction. Indeed, we have held in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>166 Conn. 102, 107-108, 347 A.2d 53 (1974), that an improperly executed citation implicates the personal jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">An improperly executed writ or citation does not, therefore, affect the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court. As a defect in having the court acquire personal jurisdiction over the defendant, an improperly executed citation may be waived by the defendant. In this case, such a waiver occurred when the commission and DJM failed to file a timely motion to dismiss the administrative appeal in the trial court. A defendant may contest the personal jurisdiction of the court \u201ceven after having entered a general appearance, but must do so by filing a motion to dismiss within thirty days of the filing of an appearance.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 142. The commission\u2019s motion to dismiss was not filed until December 19,1989, approximately eleven months after the commission had filed its appearance. DJM did not, so far as the record indicates, contest the execution of the citation at any time. The commission and DJM, therefore, had submitted to the jurisdiction of the trial court and the Appellate Court was mistaken in ruling to the contrary. The Appellate Court\u2019s mischaracterization of the jurisdictional implications of <em>Doolittle </em>requires a reversal of its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Because the commission and DJM failed to preserve their jurisdictional challenge in timely fashion, we need not consider the continuing validity of the rule <em>in Doolittle </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra. Because the issue has been fully briefed, however, and has frequently arisen in the Superior Court, we will, in the interests of our supervisory role over the administration of justice in this state, reex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>amine the propriety of a citation signed by an attorney in a case in which the attorney is a plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">There were three bases for this court\u2019s decision in <em>Doolittle </em>that an attorney may not sign a writ in his own case. First, we were attempting to safeguard against attorneys who, acting in their own interests, could summarily \u201cattach all the estate of the defendant or attach his body and commit him to prison\u201d merely upon their signature. Id., 321. Second, this court was responding to the concern that, if allowed to sign writs in their own cases, litigious attorneys would commence groundless claims or claims intended solely to harass another. Id., 322. Third, we were concerned that allowing attorneys to sign their own writs would degrade the dignity of the writ and the process of law. Id., 322-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The law governing attachments has changed dramatically since 1879. \u201cPrior to the adoption of Public Act 73-431 [in 1973], writs of attachment signed by a commissioner of the Superior Court could be, and commonly were, issued by attorneys as commissioners of the Superior Court without notice, hearing or any judicial action.\u201d <em>E. J. Hansen Elevator, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stoll, </em>167 Conn. 623, 624, 356 A.2d 893 (1975). Under current law, however, statutory authorization for body attachments has been eliminated; see Public Acts 1981, No. 81-410; and a writ of attachment can no longer \u201cbe issued at the discretion of the commissioner of the Superior Court and without a judicial order. It can now be issued only after a due process judicial hearing on notice and pursuant to an order of the court.\u201d Id., 628; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-278a through 52-278d; see also <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Doehr, </em>500 U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 2105, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1991) (invalidating as unconstitutional General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e, which allowed ex parte attachments under certain circumstances). Thus, the concerns stemming from an attorney\u2019s authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>to attach another\u2019s body or property for his own benefit merely upon his signature are no longer viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The fear that litigious attorneys will bring groundless claims to harass defendants merely because they are authorized to sign writs on their own behalf does not warrant adherence to the rule in <em>Doolittle. </em>All attorneys in this state are bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct not to \u201cbring . . . a proceeding . . . unless there is a basis for doing so that is not frivolous\u201d; Rules of Professional Conduct 3.1; and have taken an oath not to \u201cwittingly or willingly promote, sue or cause to be sued, any false or unlawful suit, or give aid, or consent, to the same,\u201d and to delay \u201cno man for lucre or malice.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-25; see also <em>Sharkiewicz </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>142 Conn. 410, 412-13, 114 A.2d 691 (1955). \u201cAn attorney \u2018as an officer of the court in the administration of justice, is continually accountable to it for the manner in which he exercises the privilege which has been accorded him.\u2019 <em>In re Peck, </em>88 Conn. 447, 450, 91 A. 274 (1914). This \u2018unique position as officers and commissioners of the court . . . casts attorneys in a special relationship with the judiciary and subjects them to its discipline.\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>190 Conn. 510, 524, 461 A.2d 938 (1983).\u201d <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 237-38, 558 A.2d 986 (1989). These professional responsibilities govern the conduct of attorneys whether they represent themselves or others. The accountability of all attorneys for their professional conduct provides an adequate safeguard to protect defendants against groundless claims brought by litigious attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Lastly, the apprehension that allowing an attorney to sign a writ of process will somehow degrade the process of law is no longer sustainable. This court concluded, in 1955, that a plaintiff cannot compel a commissioner of the Superior Court to sign a writ of mesne process. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>Sharkiewicz </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 412. We emphasized, in that case, that the signing of a writ is not a mere ministerial act and that it should not be undertaken indiscriminately. Id.; see also <em>In re Application of Griffiths, </em>162 Conn. 249, 255, 294 A.2d 281 (1972), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 413 U.S. 717, 93 S. Ct. 2851, 37 L. Ed. 2d 910 (1973); <em>Doolittle </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 320. In 1978, however, the Practice Book section concerning mesne process was amended to provide that \u201c[i]f any person is proceeding without the assistance of counsel, he shall sign the complaint and present the complaint and proposed writ of summons to the clerk . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 49. It further provides that \u201cthe clerk shall review the proposed writ of summons and, unless it is defective as to form or does not contain a bond for prosecution . . . shall sign it.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 49; see also 1 E. Stephenson, supra, \u00a7 17. The purpose of the amendment was no doubt to provide greater access to the courts of this state. The act of the clerk in signing the writ on behalf of a pro se plaintiff is, however, purely ministerial. The clerk has no discretion whatsoever to refuse to sign the writ of a pro se litigant in a cause of action unless the writ is defective as to form or lacks a bond for prosecution. At this stage of our law, when an attorney who is representing himself pro se can have his writ signed by a clerk acting in a ministerial role, we cannot discern how allowing that same attorney to sign his or her own writ could diminish in any way the dignity of the process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Absent the public policy reasons that existed in 1879, and in light of the change in the Practice Book, adherence to the rule that an attorney may not sign a writ in a case in which he or she is a party plaintiff no longer serves any purpose. \u201cIt is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.\u201d O. Holmes, \u201cThe Path of the Law,\u201d 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457, 469 (1897). We, therefore, overrule <em>Doolittle </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, and its progeny.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court for consideration of the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims challenging the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-13\"> The citation that is used to commence an administrative appeal is analogous to the writ used to commence a civil action.
