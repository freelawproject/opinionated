App. 286, 600 A.2d 1374 (1991). We granted certification to permit the defendant to appeal solely on the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a reasonable finding that the defendant had acted \u201ccorruptly\u201d within the meaning of the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The opinion of the Appellate Court reports in full the facts that the jury might reasonably have found to support the conviction of the defendant. The defendant contests the reasonableness of an inference of a corrupt motive that a jury might have drawn from evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>dence establishing that: (1) without the authority to do so, he signed a contract for the purchase of a computer system; (2) in response to an official inquiry, he lied about having signed this contract; and (3) he thereafter destroyed the contract and documentation relating thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we have concluded that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. The certified issue was fully considered in the opinion of the Appellate Court; id., 292; and it would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion therein contained.
