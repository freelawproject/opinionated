The application was filed on October 20, 1988, and the commission\u2019s next regularly scheduled meeting was November 1, 1988. The plaintiffs requested and were granted a continuance. The commission considered the plaintiffs\u2019 application on December 6, 1988. On January 3, 1989, two days before the sixty-five day period for <em>holding </em>a hearing expired, the commission <em>voted </em>to hold a public hearing on the application. After the public hearing was held on February 7,1989, the commission denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application on February 14, 1989. The plaintiffs then appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Although the plaintiffs raised several claims in their administrative appeal, including that concerning automatic approval of the application,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court concluded, without reaching the automatic approval issue, that the commission had failed to give proper notice of the public hearing. The court remanded the case to the commission for a new hearing after proper notice. The plaintiffs appealed the trial court\u2019s decision to the Appellate Court, claiming entitlement to automatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>approval of their application because no public hearing thereon was held within sixty-five days from its receipt, as \u00a7 22a-42a (c) required. The Appellate Court held that the commission\u2019s failure to act within the requisite time period did not result in automatic approval and, therefore, that the trial court had properly remanded the case to the commission for a new hearing because of the defective notice. <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Commission, </em>25 Conn. App. 61, 592 A.2d 964 (1991). We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification to appeal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and now affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We begin our analysis with the language of the relevant statute and regulation. When the plaintiffs filed their application,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 22a-42a (c) provided in relevant part: \u201cNo later than sixty-five days after the receipt of [an] application, the inland wetlands agency may hold a public hearing on such application. . . . Action shall be taken on applications within thirty-five days after the completion of a public hearing or in the absence of a public hearing within sixty-five days from the date of receipt of the application.\u201d Section 5.6 of the Berlin inland wetlands and watercourses regulations similarly provided that \u201c[a]ll public hearings shall commence not sooner than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>thirty (30) days nor later than (65) sixty-five days after receipt of a complete application.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although both provisions contain the word \u201cshall,\u201d that word alone does not automatically make the requirement mandatory. <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>BVD Associates, </em>196 Conn. 270, 278, 492 A.2d 180 (1985). \u201cIn determining whether a statute is mandatory or merely directory, the most satisfactory and conclusive test is whether the prescribed mode of action is of the essence of the thing to be accomplished or, in other words, whether it relates to matter of substance or to matter of convenience.\u201d <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 550, 554, 235 A.2d 643 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">We have held a time limit to be mandatory, so that a land use agency\u2019s failure to comply with it results in the automatic approval of an application in three situations: (1) the statute contains express language invalidating belated action by the agency or automatically approving an application not acted upon within the requisite time period; id., 554-55; see also <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 540, 554, 244 A.2d 391 (1968); (2) the statute contains a provision requiring an applicant\u2019s consent for an extension of the statutory time period; <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 363-64, 472 A.2d 336 (1984); see also <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Woolwich, </em>7 Conn. App. 684, 694-95, 510 A.2d 1358, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 804, 513 A.2d 698 (1986); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>(3) the statute incorporates by reference another statute that contains automatic approval or consent to extension language, thereby creating an express administrative linkage to the mandatory requirement. <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>supra, 361-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The plaintiffs concede that the applicable statute and regulation contain neither express invalidating language nor consent to extension provisions. They claim, however, that \u00a7 22a-42a (c) is mandatory because it is administratively linked to General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which forbids a zoning commission from rendering a decision on a site plan application until the inland wetlands agency has submitted a report with its final decision, and to General Statutes \u00a7 8-7d (e),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which extends the time period within which a zoning commission must act to thirty-five days from the date of the decision of the inland wetlands agency, when the time period for action by the zoning commission would otherwise elapse before the thirty-fifth day after the decision of the wetlands agency. Although these statutory sections make reference to the relationship between an inland wetlands agency\u2019s decision on an application and a zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>commission\u2019s subsequent decision on it, we are not persuaded that they link \u00a7 22a-42a (c) to any mandatory time requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>supra, this court interpreted the time limitation contained in the Coastal Management Act, General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 22a-109 (f),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as mandatory because another subsection of the act provided that \u201c[t]he coastal site plan review . . . shall be subject to the same statutory requirements as subsection (b) of section 8-7d for the purposes of determining the time limitations on the zoning commission in reaching a final decision.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 22a-109 (e). Section 8-7d (b) in turn provided that \u201ca decision on an application for approval of such site plan shall be rendered within sixty-five days after receipt of such site plan\u201d and that an applicant \u201cmay consent to one or more extensions of such period . . . .\u201d Not only did \u00a7 8-7d (b) contain a consent to extension provision, which inferentially rendered the time limitation mandatory, but \u00a7 8-3 (g) explicitly stated that \u201c[ajpproval of a site plan shall be presumed unless a decision to deny or modify it is rendered within the period specified in section 8-7d.\u201d The direct references in \u00a7 22a-109 (e) to \u00a7 8-7d (b), which contained consent to extension language as well as an automatic approval provision by virtue of \u00a7 8-3 (g), eliminated any doubt that the time requirement for rendering a decision on a coastal site plan was mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Unlike the statutory scheme in <em>Vartuli, </em>the inland wetlands statutes in existence at the time the plaintiffs\u2019 application was pending contain no language directly connecting the wetlands time limitation to any statutory provisions for automatic approval or consent to an extension. The zoning statutes mentioned by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>plaintiffs in support of their argument contain only general references to the effect that the zoning commission must wait until the wetlands agency issues a final report before rendering its decision and that the time period for deciding a zoning application may be tolled because of the pendency of a wetlands decision. Those references do not address in any way the nature of the time limitation in \u00a7 22a-42a (c) that governs inland wetlands agencies. This fundamental difference in statutory schemes distinguishes this scenario from that presented in <em>Vartuli </em>and leads us to conclude that no express administrative linkage exists to make the time limit of \u00a7 22a-42a (c) mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The plaintiffs also advance the argument that, even if no express administrative linkage exists, the statute and regulation must be interpreted as mandatory in order to promote uniformity among the time constraints placed on land use agencies. They claim that, since the legislature placed the same sixty-five day time limitation on site plan review; General Statutes \u00a7 8-7d (b); coastal site plan review; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-109 (g); subdivision applications; General Statutes \u00a7 8-26d (b); and inland wetlands and watercourses applications; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (c); all those time limitations should be interpreted as creating a mandatory duty. The commission points out, however, that in 1977, the legislature enacted Public Acts 1977, No. 77-450, which amended the existing planning and zoning statutes to include a uniform time limitation of sixty-five days within which a planning and zoning commission must take action on an application and a provision for automatic approval of applications not acted upon within the requisite time period.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>sion argues that the fact that the 1977 act did not affect the time limitations on inland wetlands agencies is strong evidence that, contrary to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument, the legislature did not intend to include inland wetlands agencies within the comprehensive scheme it had developed with respect to time constraints on other land use agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">We agree with the commission that the legislature\u2019s failure to amend the time limitations on inland wetlands agencies in 1977, when it amended the time limitations on several other land use agencies, is a significant indication that it did not intend to impose the same mandatory strictures on inland wetlands agencies. The legislature enacted \u00a7 22a-42a (c) in 1973, fours years before the 1977 act. Because \u201cthe legislature is presumed to exercise its statutory authority with knowledge of existing statutes and with the intention of creating one consistent body of law\u201d; <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 65, 566 A.2d 670 (1989); we conclude that its omission of inland wetlands agencies from the purview of the 1977 act indicates its intention not to make the time limitation on wetlands decisions mandatory, as it did in planning and zoning decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Both the plaintiffs and the commission claim support for their diverse interpretations of \u00a7 22a-42a (c) in a subsequent amendment to that statute, Public Acts 1989, No. 89-356, \u00a7 16<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which added three provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>relevant to this appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> First, a consent to extension provision was added. Second, applicants were granted the right to file their applications with the commissioner of the department of environmental protection if the inland wetlands agency failed to take action within the requisite time period. Third, the failure of an inland wetlands agency to act within the time period specified would not be deemed to constitute approval of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Relying on the precept of statutory construction that the legislature intends to change existing law when it enacts new statutory language unless a contrary legislative intent appears; see <em>Hall Manor Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>212 Conn. 147, 155, 561 A.2d 1373 (1989); the plaintiffs maintain that the 1989 amendment changed the time constraint in \u00a7 22a-42a (c) from mandatory to directory. The commission counters with the argument that the amendment merely clarified what was already a directory time constraint. It claims that the legislature amended the statute to avoid any confusion that might have existed about the nature of the time requirement, since that requirement had not yet been construed by an appellate court in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Although both interpretations are arguable, we are inclined to adopt the commission\u2019s view that the 1989 amendment clarified what was already a directory time constraint. Unfortunately, the legislative history of the 1989 amendment does not shed any light upon the reasons for its passage. This void, however, does not preclude construction of the 1989 amendment as intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>to clarify the original intent of \u00a7 22a-42a (c). <em>Circle Lanes of Fairfield, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>195 Conn. 534, 540-41, 489 A.2d 363 (1985); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 280-81, 528 A.2d 760 (1987). In all likelihood the legislature recognized the ambiguity in the time limit referred to in \u00a7 22a-42a (c) and enacted the 1989 amendment to eliminate any doubt that the provision was directory. Before the amendment was enacted, at least one Superior Court decision had interpreted \u00a7 22a-42a (c) as creating a mandatory duty. See <em>Westwood Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Environmental Protection Board, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket Nos. 060244, 061645 and 061646 (April 18, 1983). Because the legislature is presumed to be aware of judicial interpretations of a statute; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 719, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 (1991); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 72, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985); we conclude that the legislature added explicit directory language to \u00a7 22a-42a (c) to avoid the risk that the statute would again be erroneously construed as mandatory. Unlike the time requirements imposed on other land use agencies, \u00a7 22a-42a (c) had not been construed by an appellate court and had not been amended in 1977, along with the other time provisions, to indicate that automatic approval would result from a failure to act within the sixty-five day period. The amendment, therefore, appears to have been the legislature\u2019s attempt to clarify what it recognized as a potential ambiguity in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Finally, we note that the presumption that the 1989 amendment changed the nature of the time limitation is rebutted by the language of the statute before it was amended. The time requirement contains no negative words or express invalidation language. As we stated in <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 535, 525 A.2d 940 (1987), \u201c[t]he require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ment [in \u00a7 22a-42a (c)] that the agency [act] within the prescribed 65 day period is to insure prompt and expeditious action for the protection of the applicant.\u201d It is a well established maxim of statutory construction that \u201cprovisions designed to secure order, system and dispatch in proceedings are generally held directory unless accompanied by negative words.\u201d <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>138 Conn. 57, 67, 82 A.2d 345 (1951); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 238, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, 96 S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1975); <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>143 Conn. 381, 388, 122 A.2d 789 (1956). Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that their application was automatically approved when the commission failed to hold the hearing within the statutory time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 22a-42a (e) provided in relevant part: \u201cNo later than sixty-five days after the receipt of such application, the inland wetlands agency may hold a public hearing on such application. . . .Action shall be taken on applications within thirty-five days after the completion of a public hearing or in the absence of a public hearing within sixty-five days from the date of receipt of the application.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-12\"> At the time of the plaintiffs\u2019 application, \u00a7 5.6 (a) of the Berlin inland wetlands and watercourses regulations provided: \u201cAll public hearings shall commence not sooner than thirty (30) days nor later than (65) sixty-five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>days after receipt of a complete application.\u201d We confine our analysis to the relevant statute since the language of the regulation is substantially similar to that of the statute and the plaintiffs have not differentiated between the two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\"> The plaintiffs also named as defendants Clyde Seylner, chairman of the Berlin inland wetlands and watercourses commission, the town of Berlin, Joanne Ward, Berlin town clerk, and Leslie Carothers, commissioner of the department of environmental protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b291-10\"> Some of the claims raised were that the commission denied the plaintiffs a fair hearing, that the commission\u2019s decision was not supported by the evidence before it, that the commission had predetermined the outcome of the case and that the commission had failed to hold a public hearing within sixty-five days of receipt of the application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b292-5\"> We granted certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cIn the circumstances of this case, have the plaintiffs established their entitlement to automatic approval of their application for a wetlands permit because of the defendant\u2019s failure to act within the time period specified by the relevant statute and regulation?\u201d <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Commission, </em>220 Conn. 906, 593 A.2d 971 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\"> The Appellate Court determined that the case was governed by the relevant statute and regulation in effect when the plaintiffs filed their application despite subsequent amendments made to each during the pendency of the application. <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Commission, </em>25 Conn.
