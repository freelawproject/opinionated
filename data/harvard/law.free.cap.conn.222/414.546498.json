Papandrea, in his official capacity as commissioner of the Connecticut department of housing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking to enjoin him from operating a rental assistance, existing housing and housing voucher program pursuant to section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (section 8 program) in East Hartford. The plaintiff alleged that it had exclusive statutory authority to administer a section 8 program in East Hartford. The plaintiff alleged further that the commissioner\u2019s authority to administer a section 8 program had been transferred from the Connecticut department of housing to the Connecticut housing authority by the enactment of No. 86-281 of the 1986 Public Acts, and that, therefore, the commissioner\u2019s administration of such a program in East Hartford was ultra vires. The commissioner filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff lacked standing and had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The trial court denied the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss. The trial court, after a hearing, granted the plaintiff the requested injunctive relief. The commissioner appealed to the Appellate Court from the trial court\u2019s judgment. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">On appeal, the commissioner claims that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that the plaintiff was not required to exhaust administrative remedies; (2) granted the plaintiff a permanent injunction prohibiting the commissioner from operating a section 8 program in East Hartford; and (3) concluded that the commissioner had acted in excess of his statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>authority. We agree with the commissioner\u2019s first claim and, therefore, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. The section 8 program that is the subject of this litigation is a federal housing subsidy administered by the United States department of housing and urban development (HUD).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The purpose of the program is to assist low income families in obtaining decent, safe and sanitary rental accommodations and to promote \u201ceconomically mixed housing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (a); see also 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 882.101. The program works essentially as follows. First, the public housing authority (housing authority) enters into an annual contribution contract with HUD. The housing authority, applying the qualification guidelines set forth in regulations promulgated by HUD, determines if an applicant qualifies for section 8 low income housing. If found to be qualified, the applicant is issued a certificate or voucher by the housing authority. The applicant then finds an acceptable rental unit and presents the certificate to the landlord. If the housing authority determines that the selected unit meets HUD\u2019s standards of habitability, that the rent is approvable and that the proposed lease complies with HUD\u2019s regulations, the housing authority approves the lease. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 882.209. The applicant pays no more than 30 percent of his or her income toward rent and the housing authority pays the remainder from moneys received under its contract with HUD. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1437a (a) (1) and 1437f (c) (3) (A). When the housing authority successfully places a section 8 tenant, it receives an initial placement fee as well as a payment for each month that the tenant remains in the section 8 program.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The plaintiff administers a section 8 program in East Hartford. At the time of trial, approximately 111 tenants were participating in the plaintiffs program. The commissioner has administered a section 8 program in the state sinceT976. At the time of trial, approximately 1700 rental units throughout the state had been filled by participants in the section 8 program administered by the commissioner. Since 1988, twenty-two families holding certificates issued by the commissioner have obtained housing in East Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the trial court made the following findings. A public housing authority is required by HUD to utilize at least 95 percent of the certificates granted to it under its contract. Since 1988, the commissioner had administered a section 8 program in East Hartford without the permission of either the plaintiff or East Hartford\u2019s governing body. One East Hartford landlord who owned multiple units had informed the plaintiff that he would no longer rent to section 8 tenants due to late rent payments made by the commissioner. The plaintiff had a waiting list of forty-four eligible families and, had the commissioner not placed section 8 tenants in East Hartford, the plaintiff would have done so. The trial court concluded that the commissioner had acted without statutory authority in operating a section 8 program in East Hartford, and that as a result of the commissioner\u2019s actions, the plaintiff had lost fees it would otherwise have received from HUD. The trial court concluded further that the plaintiff had suffered irreparable harm and granted the plaintiff permanent injunctive relief against the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">On appeal, the commissioner argues that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss made on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>administrative remedies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner argues further that the trial court improperly concluded that he had exceeded his statutory authority in operating a section 8 program in East Hartford, and that, therefore, the trial court improperly granted the plaintiff injunctive relief. The commissioner contends that the expansion of the state\u2019s section 8 program into East Hartford is within his statutory authority and \u201ccoincides with the State\u2019s attempt to better utilize its Section 8 allocation and to help homeless people, and those families residing in \u2018welfare\u2019 hotels and motels, find permanent, decent, safe and sanitary dwellings.\u201d The plaintiff argues that the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiff had the exclusive right to operate a section 8 program in East Hartford and that, therefore, the trial court properly enjoined the commissioner from operating such a program. The plaintiff contends that without a permanent injunction, the approximately 2000 certificates issued by the commissioner for use statewide could be \u201cmisused\u201d to \u201csaturate\u201d East Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The commissioner\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiff was not required to exhaust administrative remedies. The commissioner argues that the plaintiff, prior to filing this action in the Superior Court, was required to seek a declaratory ruling from the commissioner pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the trial court\u2019s ruling to the contrary was incorrect. The plaintiff contends that the trial court, in ruling on the commissioner\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>dismiss, correctly concluded that: (1) \u00a7 4-176 (a) was inapplicable because the plaintiff\u2019s complaint sought injunctive relief; (2) the commissioner had not established a procedure whereby the plaintiff could contest the agency action alleged in the complaint; and (3) the commissioner\u2019s June 13, 1989 letter to the president of the Connecticut chapter of the national association of housing and redevelopment officials constituted the commissioner\u2019s decision on the matter and, therefore, further administrative review would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u201c \u2018It is a settled principle of administrative law that, if an adequate administrative remedy exists, it must be exhausted before the Superior Court will obtain jurisdiction to act in the matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>199 Conn. 70, 83-84, 505 A.2d 1233 (1986). Furthermore, \u201c[bjecause the exhaustion doctrine implicates subject matter jurisdiction, we must decide as a threshold matter whether that doctrine requires dismissal of the plaintiff[\u2019s] claim.\u201d <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>204 Conn. 551, 556, 529 A.2d 666 (1987). \u201c \u2018 \u201c[Wjhenever a court discovers that it has no jurisdiction, it is bound to dismiss the case, without regard to its previous rulings.\u201d \u2019 . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion is grounded in a policy of fostering an orderly process of administrative adjudication and judicial review in which a reviewing court will have the benefit of the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions.\u201d Id. \u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion furthers the salutary goals of relieving the courts of the burden of deciding questions entrusted to an agency ... in advance of possible judicial review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Moreover, resolution of the issues at the administrative level may render judicial review unnecessary. As the United States Supreme Court has noted: \u201c \u2018A complaining party may be successful in vindicating his rights in the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>process. If he is required to pursue his administrative remedies, the courts may never have to intervene.\u2019 <em>McKart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 195, 89 S. Ct. 1657, 23 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1969).\u201d <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 351-52, 542 A.2d 672 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The plaintiff first claims that it was not required to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to \u00a7 4-176 (a) because that section does not apply to actions seeking injunctive relief. Section 4-176 (a) provides that \u201c[a]ny person may petition an agency . . . for a declaratory ruling as to the validity of any regulation, or the applicability to specified circumstances of a provision of the general statutes, a regulation, or a final decision on a matter within the jurisdiction of the agency.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-175 (a) in turn sets forth the circumstances under which a party aggrieved by a provision of the general statutes, a regulation or a final decision of an agency may directly seek a declaratory judgment in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff seeks to avoid the broad language of these statutes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the inclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>sion in the plaintiffs complaint of a claim for injunctive relief did not excuse the plaintiff from having to exhaust administrative remedies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra, we considered the claims of the plaintiff psychiatrist, who was the subject of a disciplinary action brought by the defendant department of health services before the defendant state medical examining board. The plaintiff brought an action in the Superior Court for interlocutory injunctive relief. The trial court concluded that the plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law and, therefore, granted certain of the relief requested. On appeal, we concluded that the plaintiff had not proven the futility of recourse to the available administrative remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and that, therefore, the trial court had improperly intervened in the administrative process. Id., 367-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">We affirm the principle adhered to in <em>Pet, </em>that a claim for injunctive relief does not negate the requirement that the complaining party exhaust administrative remedies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>supra (plaintiffs\u2019 bringing of action to enjoin defendant town from selling certain property prior to filing complaint with state elections enforcement commission constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies despite commission\u2019s lack of statutory authority to seek injunctive relief directly). \u201c \u2018[W]hen a party has a statutory right of appeal from a decision of the administrative agency, he may not, instead of appealing, bring an independent action to test the very issues which the [administrative] appeal was designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>test.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra, 352. \u201c[W]e have never held that the mere possibility that an administrative agency may deny a party the specific relief requested is a ground for an exception to the exhaustion requirement.\u201d <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>supra, 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Thus, in the present case, the plaintiff cannot avoid the operation of \u00a7 4-176 (a) by the mere inclusion in its complaint of a claim for injunctive relief. \u201cEven a claim that an administrative agency has exceeded its statutory authority or jurisdiction may be the subject of an administrative appeal.\u201d <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Fairfield Hills Hospital, </em>215 Conn. 675, 679, 578 A.2d 1025 (1990). We have stated, moreover, that \u201c[i]n the event that a declaratory judgment action should decide that certain acts of state officials violated the constitution, we presume that the officials would accede to that decision.\u201d <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>184 Conn. 339, 344, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981). The same reasoning is applicable here, where the acts complained of allegedly exceeded the commissioner\u2019s statutory authority. \u201cSimultaneous or subsequent injunctive relief would therefore be redundant; <em>Spector Motor Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>135 Conn. 37, 41, 61 A.2d 89 (1948); because declaratory relief controls state activity no less completely than injunctive relief.\u201d Id. We therefore reject the plaintiffs claim that its request for injunctive relief obviated the requirement that it exhaust the available administrative remedies before filing an action in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the commissioner had not established a procedure whereby the plaintiff could contest the agency action alleged in the complaint. We find this claim to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Pursuant to \u00a7 4-176 (a), any person may petition an agency for a declaratory ruling as to, inter alia, the applicability to specified circumstances of a provision of the general statutes or a final decision on a matter within the jurisdiction of the agency. Section 4-176 (b) provides that each agency shall adopt regulations with respect to the procedure for obtaining such a declaratory ruling.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In accordance with \u00a7 4-176 (b), \u00a7\u00a7 8-203-1 through 8-203-5 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies establish procedures for the administrative review of an action or decision of the commissioner of housing. Section 8-203-2 defines \u201ccommissioner\u201d as the \u201ccommissioner of community affairs.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-206a (g),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> however, transferred all powers and duties formerly assigned to the commissioner of community affairs under chapters 128,129 and 130 of the General Statutes to the commissioner of economic development, in accordance with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 4-38d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These powers were subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>quently vested in the commissioner of housing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-206a (h).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The corresponding regulatory powers were thereby transferred in accordance with \u00a7 4-38d (b). See footnote 9, supra. Under \u00a7 8-203-5 (e) of the regulations, an aggrieved party may petition the commissioner to issue a declaratory ruling on \u201cthe validity or applicability of any statutory provision, regulation or order of the department, if the statutory provision or regulation or order, or the threatened application thereof, interferes with or impairs, or threatens to interfere [with] or impair, the legal rights or privileges of [the] complaining party.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>8-203-5 (f) of the regulations in turn provides that an aggrieved party may petition for judicial review of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>declaratory ruling or other final decision of the commissioner after having \u201cexhausted administrative remedies available with the department . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reject this claim of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the commissioner effectively decided the plaintiffs claim in a June 13, 1989 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>letter to Samuel Kasparian, president of the Connecticut chapter of the national association of housing and redevelopment officials (CONN-NAHRO), and, therefore, further agency review would have been futile. The plaintiff is a member of CONN-NAHRO. The commissioner\u2019s letter was written in response to a letter from Kasparian requesting a meeting with the commissioner to address CONN-NAHRO\u2019s concerns about the commissioner\u2019s plan to engage a private contractor to administer the state\u2019s section 8 program. While Kasparian did not specifically mention East Hartford, his letter raised issues similar to those raised by the plaintiff in this appeal, including the commissioner\u2019s authority to operate a section 8 program in towns where a local public housing authority runs such a program. The plaintiff points to the following language in the commissioner\u2019s letter to Kasparian: \u201cBased upon the review of the request, the recommendations of the select committee and evaluation of the impact of the request upon the Department\u2019s Section 8 Program, please be informed that we will not limit, when we make the selection, the contractor\u2019s area of operation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>plaintiff argues that this passage demonstrates that \u201call administrative remedies ha[d] been exhausted and it would have been futile for the Plaintiff in its individual capacity to petition the Defendant further on these issues even if the Defendant had appropriate procedures in place for the same.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, we rejected a similar argument. In that case, a tenured teacher challenged, on due process and breach of contract grounds, the termination of his contract of employment by the defendant board of education. A hearing was scheduled after a termination approval vote by the board. The plaintiff did not attend the hearing nor did he request a subsequent hearing, as he was entitled to do. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The plaintiff then brought an action in the Superior Court for damages and other relief. The trial court awarded the plaintiff damages but denied him reinstatement. On appeal, the Appellate Court ordered the plaintiffs reinstatement and a new trial to determine additional damages, and we granted certification to review the judgment of the Appellate Court. <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>2 Conn. App. 36, 475 A.2d 1110, cert. granted, 194 Conn. 802, 477 A.2d 1021 (1984). We concluded that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust administrative remedies and, therefore, v/e reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court. <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 87.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We rejected the plaintiffs argument that resort to administrative remedies was not required because the remedy would have been inadequate or futile. We stated: \u201c[T]he statutory remedies are not rendered futile by the plaintiffs conclusory assertion that requesting and attending a hearing before the defendant board would have been pointless in the face of the board\u2019s earlier decision to terminate his employment. . . . Had the plaintiff requested and attended a hearing following the board\u2019s . . . letter, he would have been able to raise the issue of lack of impartiality in an administrative appeal. \u2018By not appearing before the board, the plaintiff not only deprived the defendant board of the opportunity to hear, analyze and review a matter within its responsibility and expertise, but also deprived [him] self of the opportunity to put on [his] case and to make a proper record on which to seek judicial relief in the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>[he] was terminated.\u2019 <em>[Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 241-42, 502 A.2d 410 (1985).]\u201d Id., 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We are persuaded that the reasons for requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies in <em>Lacroix </em>are equally applicable in the present case. The fact that the commissioner, in his June 13, 1989 letter to Raspar\u00edan, indicated his intention not to restrict the geographic area of the state\u2019s section 8 program did not relieve the plaintiff of its obligation to pursue its administrative remedies in an effort to persuade the commissioner that his position was legally incorrect. Other than the June 13,1989 letter, we find nothing in the record to show that the plaintiff sought an administrative ruling that the commissioner\u2019s operation of a section 8 program in East Hartford was improper.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We therefore reject the plaintiff\u2019s futility claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Because the plaintiff failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies, the trial court did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction to entertain this action.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss was improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

In <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>32 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Sup. 153, 344 A.2d 273 (1975), the plaintiffs, faculty members of certain state colleges and collegial institutions, sought a temporary injunction prohibiting the defendants, the board of trustees and its individual members, from adopting certain proposed employment procedures and personnel policies on the basis that they were invalid under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq. The trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 application because they had not sought a declaratory ruling pursuant to \u00a7 4-176 (a) and, thus, had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The court in <em>Beck </em>stated: \u201cIn the first instance, a petition requesting a declaratory ruling respecting the applicability of a particular regulation is to be made to the agency itself. . . . The agency has discretionary authority to issue such rulings. Rulings disposing of the petition are given the same status as agency decisions or orders in contested cases and are therefore subject to judicial review by petition to the [Superior Court]. . . . Failure of the agency to exercise its discretionary authority to issue a declaratory ruling permits the petitioner to institute an action in the [Superior Court] for a declaratory judgment respecting the validity or applicability of the regulation in question. . . . <em>The UAPA thus provides a comprehensive, potentially inexpensive, and completely adequate method of resolving the issues raised in the present application. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 155. The trial court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Beck </em>that the procedures set forth in \u00a7 4-176 (a) must be exhausted before an action challenging the applicability of a regulation may be brought in the Superior Court applies with equal force to the plaintiffs challenge in the present case to the commissioner\u2019s statutory authority to.place section 8 eligible tenants in East Hartford. See <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>214 Conn. 256, 269, 571 A.2d 696 (1990) (petitioners could have challenged <em>statutory </em>basis for regulation limiting emergency housing to 100 days by seeking declaratory ruling under \u00a7 4-176).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\"> The dissent asserts that the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 542 A.2d 672 (1988), is inapposite, on the basis that, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, the plaintiff in that case could have sought review of an adverse preliminary ruling under certain circumstances as well as a stay of a final agency decision pending appeal. The dissent contends that in the present case, there are no adequate administrative remedies available to the plaintiff and, therefore, this court should address the merits in accordance with the reasoning in <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>214 Conn. 256, 268-70, 571 A.2d 696 (1990). While General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 does not itself provide for a stay pending appeal, an agency ruling issued pursuant to that section is subject to the appeal provisions of \u00a7 4-183; General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (h); including the right to review of a preliminary ruling under specified circumstances and the right to seek a stay. In contending that the present case should follow <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Aronson, </em>supra, the dissent overlooks the fact that this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Savage </em>turned in substantial part on the fact that the plaintiffs had raised <em>constitutional </em>claims regarding the challenged regulation, the adjudication of which is exclusively a judicial function. In addition, the plaintiffs\u2019 emergency housing benefits were subject to termination immediately pursuant to the challenged regulation and, thus, \u201csuch relief as might be afforded by the administrative process would come too late to protect their interests, if the plaintiffs should ultimately prevail.\u201d Id., 270. In the present case, the plaintiff has challenged only the commissioner\u2019s <em>statutory </em>authority to place section 8 eligible tenants within East Hartford, and, therefore, $ 4-176 (a) is an appropriate administrative remedy.

As you recall, the purpose of the meeting and letter was the same\u2014for Conn NAHRO to express its concerns regarding the activities of a contractor selected in response to the [Request for Proposal].</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Conn NAHRO requested that the contractor be instructed not to lease any additional units in the present areas of operation of the 48 housing authorities who have an [Annual Contribution Contract] with HUD. I informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>you that I would communicate the Chapter\u2019s request to the reviewing committee for consideration and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"Avx\">Based upon the review of the request, the recommendations of the select committee and evaluation of the impact of the request upon the Department\u2019s Section 8 Program, please be informed that we will not limit, when we make the selection, the contractor\u2019s area of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"AqL\">To provide support to what we believe is Conn NAHRO\u2019s basic intent; namely, not to saturate any particular housing market with subsidized units, we will instruct the contractor not to steer or in any way direct certificate or voucher holders. The contractor will be instructed not to take any action which in any way causes an applicant to locate in any particular area. Further, the contractor will be instructed that if an applicant, through the normal \u2018finders keepers\u2019 process, finds a unit which is located in the present area of operation of one of the 48 housing authorities, to honor and process a request for lease approval.</p>\n<p id=\"AWd\">Thank you for taking the opportunity to share with me your concerns and opinions. I believe you will agree that the course of action set forth above will promote the greatest choice of housing opportunities for the needy, eligible families in the State of Connecticut, as set forth in the Federal Regulations governing the program.</p>\n<p id=\"ADe\">If you have any questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>\n<p id=\"Ara\">Sincerely,</p>\n<p id=\"ATA\">/s/John F.

We upheld the trial court\u2019s award of damages as to the June termination but reversed the Appellate Court with respect to its ruling ordering the plaintiff\u2019s reinstatement and a new trial to determine additional damages for the school years subsequent to 1972-73. Id., 82, 87.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\"> The commissioner argues that this court may treat Kasparian\u2019s letter as a request for a declaratory ruling pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (a), and thus treat the commissioner\u2019s response as a declaratory ruling from which the plaintiff could have appealed in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (h). Section 4-176 (h) provides in pertinent part that a declaratory ruling \u201cshall have the same status and binding effect as an order issued in a contested case and shall be a final decision for purposes of appeal in accordance with the provisions of section 4-183.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c), an appeal from a final decision of an administrative agency must be filed in the Superior Court within forty-five days of the mailing of such decision. The plaintiff brought this action nearly eight months after the mailing of the commissioner\u2019s letter to Raspar\u00edan. If the commissioner\u2019s letter had constituted a declaratory ruling, and thus a final decision pursuant to \u00a7 4-183, the plaintiff\u2019s failure to appeal within the time prescribed would have been a failure to exhaust administrative remedies and would have deprived the Superior Court of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>195 Conn. 543, 550, 489 A.2d 368 (1985). Because the commissioner\u2019s letter did not comply with the requirements set forth in \u00a7 4-176 (f) and (h) as to the mailing and contents of a declaratory ruling, however, we are persuaded that it did not constitute a final decision for purposes of appeal pursuant to \u00a7 4-183.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\"> Because we conclude that the plaintiff has improperly failed to exhaust administrative remedies, we do not address the propriety of the trial court\u2019s granting of injunctive relief against the commissioner. We note, however, that once the plaintiff has pursued the available administrative remedies, injunctive relief may be unnecessary because the trial court\u2019s injunction operates only to preclude <em>future </em>placement in East Hartford of participants in the state\u2019s section 8 program. See <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>184 Conn. 339, 344, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981) (\u201cdeclaratory relief controls state activity no less completely than injunctive relief\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b453-7\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AyVN\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I would get to the merits of the claim of the plaintiff, the housing authority of the town of East Hartford, on this important issue involving housing for the poor. That issue is whether poor families, who hold state administered rental assistance certificates and vouchers issued by the defendant, commissioner of the department of housing (commissioner), pursuant to section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, (section 8), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1487f, have the statutory and constitutional right freely to use the certificates and vouchers for rental living accommodations in any town in this state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The rental certificates and vouchers are part of a federal financial assistance program designed to aid \u201clower income families in obtaining a decent place to live\u201d and to promote \u201ceconomically mixed housing.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The plaintiff zeroed in on the importance of this case when it expressed its concern that the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>\u201chas approximately 2,000 statewide certificates and/or [rental certificates and] vouchers <em>that could conceivably be misused to saturate East Hartford.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) If, by that statement, the plaintiff is pleading \u201cNIMBY\u201d\u2014that is, not in my backyard\u2014as a basis of its claim for an injunction, thereby attempting to use the power of the judiciary to prevent the poor from having access to housing in East Hartford, justice necessitates a resolution of the underlying issues <em>today. </em>Indeed, at the time of trial, the state had a waiting list of 5000 families eligible for the section 8 program.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority, however, allows itself to be led down the procedural path of reversing on the dubious claim that we lack jurisdiction to decide the issue because the plaintiff failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. By so doing, the majority avoids a decision on this issue, which is important not only for the poor, but for all of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The majority\u2019s claim that the plaintiff was required first to seek a declaratory ruling before the commissioner is based upon General Statutes \u00a7 4-176, which provides in part that \u201c[a]ny person <em>may </em>petition an agency ... for a declaratory ruling . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Nevertheless, it is clear from the plain language of \u00a7 4-176 that a party is not statutorily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>required to travel this administrative route. Section 4-176 (a)\u2019s use of the word \u201cmay\u201d makes this administrative remedy optional for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">It is clear that when the words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d are selectively used in a statute, they are words \u201ccommonly mandatory and directory in connotation,\u201d and, therefore, they \u201cmust then be assumed to have been used with discrimination and a full awareness of the difference in their ordinary meanings .... Thus, the words <em>shall </em>and <em>may </em>should be interpreted according to their plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d (Internal quotations marks omitted.) <em>Farricielli </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 203, 440 A.2d 286 (1982). Since \u00a7 4-176 (a) provides that the plaintiff \u201cmay\u201d seek a declaratory ruling and since the statute selectively uses the words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d within its several subsections,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the \u201cmay\u201d is clearly permissive and the plaintiff was not required to seek a ruling from the commissioner. In the present case, may means may.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Even if there was a mandatory route that provided a remedy, exhaustion is not carved in stone\u2014there are several well recognized exceptions. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 394, 402, 515 A.2d 134 (1986). One applicable exception is that exhaustion is not required if the administrative remedy would be futile. <em>Kosinski </em>v. <em>Lawlor, </em>177 Conn. 420, 424-25, 418 A.2d 66 (1979); see <em>Sharkey </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>196 Conn. 253, 257, 492 A.2d 171 (1985); <em>Friedson </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>181 Conn. 230, 435 A.2d 17 (1980); <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>157 Conn. 548, 554, 254 A.2d 898 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">In this case, the very question that the majority sends back to travel through the administrative route has already been answered by the commissioner. On May 4,1989, Samuel Kasparian, president of the Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>cut Chapter of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (CONN-NAHRO), of which the plaintiff is a member, wrote to the commissioner raising essentially the same claims the plaintiff raises herein.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This letter was followed by a meeting on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>May 18,1989, with the commissioner and a liaison committee of CONN-NAHRO, at which time the same issues were discussed. In answering these claims, which included the question of whether the commissioner had \u201cthe legal authority to operate the same program in a city or town in which a housing authority currently operates the same program,\u201d the commissioner made it abundantly clear that he would \u201cnot limit . . . the . . . area of operation\u201d of the contractor who was to be retained to operate the section 8 program for him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The commissioner emphatically stated that needy persons eligible for the program would not be steered to any particular area. On the contrary, he wrote that if a person who holds a section 8 rental certificate or voucher from his office finds, \u201cthrough the normal \u2018finders keepers\u2019 process,\u201d a living unit in any area, including East Hartford, it would be honored and processed for approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>The commissioner\u2019s position that he has the authority to issue section 8 rental certificates and vouchers to applicants for use in any part of the state is underscored by his vigorous defense in this suit. The majority, however, would have the plaintiff return to the administrative level, appear before the commissioner, and argue the very point that the commissioner has already decided. The futility of seeking the commissioner\u2019s declaratory ruling is evident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">On the merits of the plaintiffs claim, I believe that the trial court improperly concluded that the commissioner lacks the authority to issue section 8 rental certificates and vouchers to eligible persons for residence in East Hartford. The trial court found that this function is now vested in the Connecticut Housing Authority (CHA), which could only be exercised, <em>\u201cprovided (1) the local governing body of the municipality shall, by resolution, approve the housing project and (2) if an active local housing authority exists in the municipality, such local housing shall, by resolution, approve the housing project. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 8-120. In effect, the trial court construed the section 8 rental certificate and voucher program to be a \u201chousing project,\u201d which would require a vote by the local governing body or the plaintiff. Because neither the legislative body nor the plaintiff has given its permission, the plaintiff argues that families cannot utilize their rental assistance rental certificates and vouchers to rent apartments from private landlords in East Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In making this argument, the plaintiff, however, ignores General Statutes \u00a7 8-206 (d) which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe commissioner of housing is authorized to do all things necessary to apply for, qualify for and accept any federal funds made available or allocated under any federal act for any activities which may be pertinent to the purposes of [chapter 133] and chapters 128,129,130,135, and 136 and said commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>shall administer any such funds allocated to the department in accordance with federal law.\u201d The statutory chapters listed in \u00a7 8-206 have reference to providing decent, safe and sanitary housing for all the residents of our state. Accordingly, the commissioner does have the authority to issue section 8 rental certificates and vouchers for housing through the state. Also, even if \u201chousing project\u201d were to be construed to include the section 8 program, the restriction referred to in General Statutes \u00a7 8-121 (a), which provides for approval by the local legislature and housing authority, is applicable only to the CHA and not the commissioner of housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Likewise, under federal law, the commissioner has authority to issue section 8 rental certificates and vouchers within the state without limitation. A public housing agency is defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437a (b) (6) as \u201cany State, county, municipality or other governmental entity or public body . . . which is authorized to engage in or assist in the development or operation of low-income housing.\u201d According to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437a (b) (1), \u201c \u2018lower income housing\u2019 means decent, safe and sanitary dwellings assisted under [chapter eight of title 42].\u201d It is stated throughout chapter eight that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) may enter into a contract with a \u201cpublic housing agency,\u201d which, in turn, may use HUD\u2019s financial assistance to aid in the development of decent, safe and sanitary dwellings. It is clear that the commissioner of housing meets the federal definition of a \u201cpublic housing authority\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and is authorized to issue section 8 rental certificates and vouchers within the state without any limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Moreover, any restriction on where families, who are issued section 8 rental certificates and vouchers by the commissioner, may use their subsidies would conflict with state and federal fair housing laws. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-64b et seq. prohibits discrimination on the basis of the tenant\u2019s \u201clawful source of income.\u201d A lawful source of income is defined to include \u201cincome derived from . . . housing assistance.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46a-63. Pursuant to the federal Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3608, all the parties in the present appeal have an affirmative duty to promote fair housing in the administration of the section 8 program. The trial court\u2019s ruling is contrary to this duty. Finally, through the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, codified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (r), Congress declared that section 8 rental certificates and vouchers are portable within the same state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">It is clear to' me that portability must be the password for the section 8 rental certificates and vouchers issued by the commissioner. No person should be restricted in the right to obtain decent housing in any town, whether it be in towns as far west as Greenwich or as far east as Stonington. A person cannot be restricted from obtaining housing in any of our 169 towns merely because he or she is being aided by the federal government through a section 8 rental assistance certificate or voucher program administered by the commissioner. Our federal constitution guarantees the right to intrastate travel. <em>King </em>v. <em>New Rochelle, </em>442 F.2d 646, 648 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 863, 92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>S. Ct. 113, 30 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1971). In <em>King, </em>the Second Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a five-year residency requirement for public housing. Finding \u201cour thinking to be substantially in accord with\u201d the appeals court in <em>King, </em>this court quoted with approval the following: \u201c \u2018[I]t would be meaningless to describe the right to travel between states as a fundamental precept of personal liberty and not to acknowledge a correlative constitutional right to travel within a state.\u2019 Id., 648.\u201d <em>Bruno </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>192 Conn. 335, 346-47, 472 A.2d 328 (1984). Any restriction preventing a section 8 tenant from living in East Hartford or any other town would impinge on that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">I agree with the position of the amici curiae\u2014the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union Foundation, Connecticut State Conference of the NAACP, Connecticut Housing Coalition, Hartford Neighborhood Housing Coalition, Fair Housing Association of Connecticut, Connecticut Legal Services, Legal Aid Society of Hartford County, Inc., New Haven Legal Assistance Association, Inc., and Neighborhood Legal Services\u2014when they reasoned as follows: \u201cThe concept of a municipal \u2018veto\u2019 to prevent a section 8 tenant\u2019s entry into a town is offensive to the constitution. . . . [If such a construction is not avoided] the plaintiff or any other municipality could refuse entry to an entire class of low-income families, or insist that they take a place on the local housing authority waiting list. One town after another could close their doors to the over 2,000 low income families receiving Section 8 rental certificates and vouchers administered by the state.\u201d The result of the majority\u2019s decision today\u2014that is, merely reversing on the grounds that the plaintiff should have sought a declaratory ruling from the commissioner\u2014leaves the commissioner of housing to grapple with an unresolved claim that is squarely before us, fully briefed and argued before a full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Accordingly, I would reverse the trial court, not on jurisdictional grounds, but because the commissioner has the authority to issue section 8 rental certificates and vouchers to any eligible citizen for housing that can be used in any of the 169 towns of this state.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\"> Put another way, does the commissioner have the authority to issue such certificates and vouchers to persons for use in any town in the state?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\"> A representative of the contractor who administers the program for the commissioner testified that on a statewide basis, there was no shortage of eligible rental units for the program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 provides: \u201c(a) Any person <em>may </em>petition an agency, or an agency may on its own motion initiate a proceeding, for a declaratory ruling as to the validity of any regulation, or the applicability to specified circumstances of a provision of the general statutes, a regulation, or a final decision on a matter within the jurisdiction of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u201c(b) Each agency <em>shall </em>adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, that provide for (1) the form and content of petitions for declaratory rulings, (2) the filing procedure for such petitions and (3) the procedural rights of persons with respect to the petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">\u201c(c) Within thirty days after receipt of a petition for a declaratory ruling, an agency <em>shall </em>give notice of the petition to all persons to whom notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>is required by any provision of law and to all persons who have requested notice of declaratory ruling petitions on the subject matter of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"Apj\">\u201c(d) If the agency finds that a timely petition to become a party or to intervene has been filed according to the regulations adopted under subsection (b) of this section, the agency: (1) <em>May </em>grant a person status as a party if the agency finds that the petition states facts demonstrating that the petitioner\u2019s legal rights, duties or privileges shall be specifically affected by the agency proceeding; and (2) <em>may </em>grant a person status as an intervenor if the agency finds that the petition states facts demonstrating that the petitioner\u2019s participation is in the interests of justice and will not impair the orderly conduct of the proceedings.

Papandrea, Commissioner</p>\n<p id=\"AV8k\">STATE OF CONNECTICUT</p>\n<p id=\"Arzc\">Department of Housing [DOH]</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">1179 Main Street</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Hartford, Connecticut 06103-1089</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Dear Commissioner Papandrea:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The Connecticut Chapter of NAHRO would like to formally request that a DOH-CONN-NAHRO liaison meeting be scheduled as soon as possible. The purpose of the meeting would be to discuss an issue that is of extreme concern to the local housing authorities in the State of Connecticut. CONN-NAHRO members have expressed serious concerns regarding your department\u2019s plans to award a contract to a private entity to administer the Section 8 Existing/Housing Voucher program your department now operates throughout the State. The major concerns and issues raised, albeit not totally inclusive, are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">(1) local authorities have been operating these programs within their communities for approximately ten (10) to fifteen (15) years. During that time they have fostered good relationships with local landlords, assisted many state residents, and generally, have operated the programs in an efficient and effective manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">(2) In the mid-1970\u2019s when DOH (DCA) [Department of Community Affairs] initially became involved in the administration of the program, we believe that the original intent of the state was to operate exclusively in non-metro areas where no PHA program was operating.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">(3) There has been significant confusion and serious perception problems, over the past three years, among both program participants and participating landlords concerning which entity had authority and responsibility for particular units.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-14\">(4) During the past year and a half, while DOH was significantly increasing its certificate/voucher issuances and increasing its lease-up rate, the issue of untimely payments to landlords hurt the program\u2019s reputation in many communities. The local authorities have the capability to make timely payments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-15\">(5) Local authorities are required to maintain 95% utilization by HUD. If the state, and/or its contractor, were allowed to lease units in a city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>or town that operated a program, this could seriously jeopardize our local programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGn\">(6) There may be a question as to whether or not DOH has the legal authority to operate the same program in a city or town in which a local housing authority currently operates the same program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdJ\">(7) As a suggestion, some LHAs (Local Housing Authority] have expressed an interest in operating the DOH units, for DOH, on a cooperative basis in certain areas of the state e.g., Torrington and Willimantic. Perhaps some consideration could be given to this idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apt\">We understand that the decision date for the selection and/or designation of a private contractor is May 25,1989. We would most certainly expect that our requested liaison meeting be held prior to that date in order for us to express our views on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6r\">We would like to thank you for your attention to this serious matter and await your reply. Thank you also for your continued cooperation and assistance with CONN-NAHRO.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoK\">Samuel Raspar\u00edan</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJZ\">President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALPv\">CONN-NAHRO\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b458-15\"> See footnote 14 of the majority opinion for the text of the commissioner\u2019s letter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><em> </em>Furthermore, even if there was a mandated administrative remedy, I disagree with the majority that the plaintiff\u2019s claim for equitable relief did not make that remedy inadequate. The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 542 A.2d 672 (1988), is inapposite. In <em>Pet, </em>we pointed out that in a disciplinary proceeding before the department of health services, the plaintiff physician had an adequate remedy under General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. We further noted that \u201c[n]ot only does that statute provide a right of appeal from a final agency decision by an aggrieved party, but it also includes an immediate right to appeal from an adverse preliminary ruling if review of the final agency decision would not provide an adequate remedy. Moreover, the statutory framework includes a means of staying an agency decision pending appeal. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c). Thus, a potentially aggrieved party is well protected by statute.\u201d Id., 352. Accordingly, we concluded in <em>Pet </em>that the plaintiff had not proven that the administrative remedy was inadequate. Id., 367-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In this case, there are no adequate administrative remedies available to the plaintiff. Indeed, the facts of this case bring it within our holding in <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Aaronson, </em>214 Conn. 256, 571 A.2d 696 (1990). In <em>Savage, </em>the issue was whether the defendant commissioner of income maintenance could be enjoined from reducing the period of eligibility for its emergency housing program to the plaintiffs, recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, from 80 to 100 days following their displacement from their former homes. Just as in this case, the commissioner argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies by not first filing a petition for a declaratory ruling from the commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 4-176 (a). We concluded in <em>Savage, </em>however, that the plaintiffs were not barred from the courthouse as a result of failing to seek a declaratory ruling from the administrative agency. We held \u201cthat when [t]he relief sought and the issues raised are distinctly equitable in nature, administrative remedies were not adequate, even though some of the issues involved could have been resolved before an administrative agency. <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>157 Conn. 548, 554, 254 A.2d 898 (1969). In order that another remedy be adequate, it must be equally complete and completely practical. <em>State ex rel. Golembeske </em>v. <em>White, </em>168 Conn. 278, 283, 362 A.2d 1354 (1975). We agree with the trial court that the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>tive route would not have provided the plaintiffs with a sufficiently expeditious remedy by which to resolve all the issues raised in challenging the regulation in time to afford the plaintiffs effective relief. The motion to dismiss on the ground of failure to exhaust administrative remedies was, therefore, properly denied.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 270. This case warrants the same treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> In addition to providing a low-income housing program pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-119b et seq., there are many programs that bring the department of housing within the meaning of a public housing agency. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 8-44a (state, acting through the commissioner may provide financial assistance for housing projects); General Statutes \u00a7 8-45 (commissioner provides oversight concerning low rental housing projects).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b462-6\"> The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, codified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (r), reads in part: \u201cAny family assisted under subsection (b) or (o) of this section may receive such assistance to rent an eligible dwelling unit if the dwelling unit to which the family moves is within the same, or a contiguous, metropolitan statistical area as the metropolitan statistical area within which is located the area of jurisdiction of the public housing agency approving such assistance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
