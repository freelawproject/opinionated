We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Most of the facts essential to the disposition of this appeal were stipulated to by the parties. On April 18, 1988, an automobile operated by Sara Louise Mass, in which her two minor children, Daniel Mass and Jessica Mass, were passengers, was struck broadside on a residential street in Fairfield by an automobile driven by Christopher Flynn, who was intoxicated, while traveling at a speed in excess of fifty miles per hour. The accident resulted in the death of Sara Mass and in personal injuries to Daniel and Jessica Mass. On and prior to April 18,1988, USF&amp;G and Norman Mass, the husband of Sara and father of Daniel and Jessica, were parties to an automobile insurance contract. The contract, which covered the Masses\u2019 two automobiles, provided uninsured motorist coverage<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the amount of $500,000 for each vehicle. The contract also provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>for arbitration in case of a disagreement between the parties concerning uninsured motorist claims. On and prior to April 18,1988, Norman and Sara Mass were also parties to another insurance contract with USF&amp;G, denominated a \u201cPersonal Excess Policy,\u201d with a face value of $1,000,000, which listed the automobile insurance contract as underlying coverage. Because Flynn carried inadequate liability insurance, Mass sought uninsured motorist recovery under both USF&amp;G policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On November 1, 1989, a panel of three arbitrators rendered a decision regarding the amount of insurance coverage available under the Masses\u2019 policies with USF&amp;G and the amount of damages suffered by the estate of Sara Mass and the Masses\u2019 two minor children. The arbitrators ruled that $2,000,000 was available to the claimants: $500,000 on each of the Masses\u2019 two automobiles under the automobile insurance contract plus $1,000,000 under the personal excess policy. The arbitrators determined that the damages suffered were as follows: $1,700,000 by the estate of Sara Mass; $50,000 by Daniel Mass; and $50,000 by Jessica Mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Both USF&amp;G and Mass applied to the trial court to vacate the arbitration award. In its application, USF&amp;G asserted that the personal excess policy issued to the Masses did not, by its terms and conditions, provide uninsured motorist coverage, and, further, that USF&amp;G was not obligated under General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c to provide such coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> USF&amp;G claimed, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>that the arbitrators\u2019 ruling should be vacated to the extent that it concluded otherwise. In his application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>to the trial court, Mass sought to have the arbitrators\u2019 award vacated in part or modified to increase the amount of damages found to have been suffered by Sara, Daniel and Jessica Mass and of uninsured motorist coverage found to exist under the two USF&amp;G policies. Mass claimed that the arbitrators incorrectly computed the amount of uninsured motorist coverage as $2,000,000, rather than $3,000,000, because they did not stack the $1,000,000 of coverage available under the personal excess policy. Mass also sought to have the amount of damages increased to at least $7,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The trial court, relying on <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 540, 569 A.2d 544 (1990), concluded that the personal excess policy did not extend the Masses\u2019 underlying uninsured motorist coverage because it (1) required that the insured be responsible for maintaining uninsured motorist coverage, and (2) lacked any agreement requiring USF&amp;G to provide excess uninsured motorist coverage. The trial court therefore granted USF&amp;G\u2019s application to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 award to the extent that the award included the personal excess policy. The trial court did not find the miscalculation of damages that Mass had claimed, however, and, therefore, denied Mass\u2019 application. This appeal to the Appellate Court followed. We transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">On appeal, Mass claims that the trial court improperly failed to conclude that: (1) the personal excess policy provided uninsured motorist coverage; (2) $3,000,000 in uninsured motorist coverage was available under the two policies with USF&amp;G; and (3) the estate of Sara Mass was entitled to at least $3,000,000 in damages. USF&amp;G presents only one issue on appeal, which we shall address in conjunction with Mass\u2019 first claim: whether General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c requires that the personal excess policy that USF&amp;G <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>issued to the Masses provide uninsured motorist coverage when such coverage had already been provided in a separate policy purchased exclusively for automobile liability protection in accordance with \u00a7 38-175c.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Mass first claims that the trial court improperly failed to conclude that the personal excess policy issued by USF&amp;G provided uninsured motorist coverage. Mass argues that the trial court misapplied this court\u2019s holding in <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>supra, because the personal excess policy in this case is a <em>liability </em>policy, not an <em>indemnity </em>policy, as was the policy at issue in <em>Cohn. </em>Mass contends that since the personal excess policy covers liability for damages arising out of the operation of an automobile,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is an \u201cautomobile liability policy\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38-175c and, therefore, must provide uninsured motorist coverage pursuant to \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2). USF&amp;G argues that the personal excess policy issued to the Masses was not required to provide uninsured motorist coverage under \u00a7 38-175c because such coverage had already been provided in accordance with \u00a7 38-175c in a separate automobile insurance contract. We are persuaded that the personal excess policy is not an \u201cautomobile liability policy\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and, therefore, that the trial court properly concluded that the policy is not required to provide uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In support of his argument, Mass places substantial reliance on the distinction between an indemnity policy and a liability policy that this court made in <em>Cohn. </em>In that case, we affirmed the conclusion of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>that an excess policy issued to the plaintiff was not an automobile liability policy within the meaning of \u00a7 38-175c because the terms of the policy unequivocally established that it was an <em>indemnity </em>policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> What we did not decide in <em>Cohn, </em>however, was whether an excess policy whose language provided for <em>liability </em>must comply with the uninsured motorist statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">Unlike the policy involved in <em>Cohn, </em>the personal excess policy issued to the Masses by USF&amp;G did not require that the insured\u2019s liability be discharged before a cause of action against the insurer would accrue. Id., 547. The policy provided that USF&amp;G would pay damages on behalf of the insured, subject to certain exclusions. Uninsured motorist coverage was not specified in the list of exclusions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The policy further provided that \u201c[rjegardless of the number of insureds, claims or injured persons, the most [USF&amp;G will] pay as damages resulting from one occurrence shall not exceed [$1,000,000],\u201d but that \u201c[i]f primary insurance and this policy cover an occurrence which results in personal injury or property damage, [USF&amp;G will] pay damages which exceed the total applicable primary insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>limits.\u201d The declarations to the policy provided, inter alia, that the insured shall have \u201cprimary insurance\u201d for \u201cauto liability,\u201d with limits of $500,000 per accident or occurrence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> According to the evidence presented at the arbitration hearing, the Masses paid a total premium of $173 for the personal excess policy during the relevant policy period. The evidence also established that they paid a separate premium of $1000 for the automobile insurance contract for the six month period during which the accident occurred, of which fifty-four dollars went to uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), an insurer is required to provide an insured with uninsured motorist coverage equal to the amount of automobile liability coverage purchased unless the insured elects a lesser amount in writing, although in no event may he elect less than the statutory minimum specified in General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Malec, </em>215 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Conn. 399, 576 A.2d 485 (1990), we examined the legislative history and development of \u00a7 38-175c. \u201cPrior to the enactment of \u00a7 38-175c; see Public Acts 1967, No. 510; [uninsured motorist] coverage, although available, was not required. Coverage was limited to the amount requested by the insured. In 1969, \u00a7 38-175c was amended to require parity of [uninsured motorist] coverage with the minimum limits of liability coverage required by General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a). See Public Acts 1969, No. 202. In 1983, \u00a7 38-175c was again amended now to require parity of [uninsured motorist] coverage with the amount of liability coverage purchased by the insured unless the insured specifically requested a lesser amount. See Public Acts 1983, No. 83-461.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) Id., 402-403. We concluded that the recent history of the statute reveals: \u201c(1) a heightened legislative interest in uninsured motorist protection; (2) a mandate to raise the amount of this protection; and (3) an intention to increase the public\u2019s consciousness as to the availability of this kind of insurance by requiring increased coverage unless the insured specifically requested otherwise.\u201d Id., 403. \u201cA statute is to be construed by considering its legislative history, language, purpose and the circumstances surrounding its enactment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Accordingly, we must determine whether these factors, including the policies enumerated in <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Malec, </em>supra, compel the conclusion that \u00a7 38-175c applies to personal excess policies, such as the policy involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In discussing the relationship of uninsured motorist coverage to excess (or umbrella) policies, one leading commentator has stated: \u201cUmbrella policies serve an important function in the industry. In this day of uncommon, but possible, enormous verdicts, they pick up this exceptional hazard at a small premium. Assuming one\u2019s automobile and homeowner\u2019s policies have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>liability limits of $100,000 or even $500,000, the umbrella policy may pick up at that point and cover for an additional million, five million, or ten million. It may assume as a primary carrier certain coverages not included elsewhere . . .. but <em>there is no intention to supplant the basic carriers on the homeowners or automobile coverages. . . . However, because of the misunderstanding of the courts as to the nature of such coverages, they have been held to fall within the definition of automobile liability insurance.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 8C J. &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1981) \u00a7 5071.65, p. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We are persuaded that excess or umbrella policies, such as the policy issued to the Masses by USF&amp;G, serve a purpose distinct from that served by policies that exclusively cover liability from damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance or operation of an automobile. While the Masses\u2019 personal excess policy provides, among other coverages, coverage for automobile liability, this does not convert it into an \u201cautomobile liability policy\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38-175c. Rather, the language of the personal excess policy indicates that it was intended as <em>\u201cexcess </em>insurance designed solely to protect [the Masses] from the infrequent occurrence of catastrophic judgments against [them].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Metzger, </em>360 So. 2d 960, 962 (Ala. 1978).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The personal excess policy issued to the Masses by USF&amp;G did not expressly refer to uninsured motorist coverage. In addition, the record is devoid of evidence that the parties intended to include uninsured motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>ist coverage at the time they entered into the contract. Although the Masses did not explicitly waive uninsured motorist coverage under the excess policy; see footnote 6, supra; no premium for such coverage was paid to USF&amp;G. In contrast, the Masses\u2019 automobile insurance contract with USF&amp;G specifically included a premium for uninsured motorist coverage. Moreover, while it is true that the excess policy did not expressly exclude uninsured motorist coverage, this omission does not create any ambiguity in light of other express terms limiting the policy to <em>excess </em>liability coverage. See <em>Hartbarger </em>v. <em>Country Mutual Ins. Co., </em>107 Ill. App. 3d 391, 394, 437 N.E.2d 691 (1982). Because the Masses\u2019 personal excess policy did not expressly provide uninsured motorist coverage, USF&amp;G was under no obligation to exclude such coverage expressly.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 588-89, 573 A. 2d 699 (1990) (before need for exclusion arises, there must be coverage within defined scope of policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Mass argues, in essence, that uninsured motorist coverage should be provided under the personal excess policy for the premium the Masses paid for such coverage under the primary automobile insurance contract only. Although \u00a7 38-175e does not prohibit such a result, we decline to read it into the policy when the language of the policy does not clearly indicate an intent to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>vide uninsured motorist coverage. See, e.g., <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co., </em>186 Conn. 507, 512, 442 A.2d 920 (1982) (determinative question in construing insurance contract is intent of parties, i.e., what coverage insured expected to receive and what insurer was to provide as disclosed by policy provisions). \u201cIt is obvious that the present [excess] policy was intended by both parties to protect the insured against excess judgments, and the risks and premiums were calculated accordingly. To require that policy to furnish uninsured motorist coverage would work a substantial revision of that policy.\u201d <em>Hartbarger </em>v. <em>Country Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Mass refers us to certain decisions in jurisdictions in which the courts have concluded that excess or umbrella policies are automobile liability policies that must provide uninsured motorist coverage. See, e.g., <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>327 So. 2d 65 (Fla. App.), cert. denied, 336 So. 2d 1179 (Fla. 1976); <em>Southern American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>441 So. 2d 1185 (La. 1983); <em>Duriak </em>v. <em>Globe American Casualty Co., </em>28 Ohio St. 3d 70, 502 N.E.2d 620 (1986); <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Siemens, </em>16 Ohio App. 3d 129, 474 N.E.2d 655 (1984). Mass argues that this court should adopt the reasoning of these cases because the applicable uninsured motorist statutes are similar to \u00a7 38-175c in that they require an insurer to provide uninsured motorist coverage in amounts <em>equal to </em>liability coverage. In other jurisdictions that have considered whether excess policies must provide uninsured motorist coverage pursuant to statute, however, courts have answered the question in the negative. See <em>O\u2019Hanlon </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>639 F.2d 1019, 1029 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Metzger, </em>supra; <em>Hartbarger v. Country Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>United Services Automobile Assn. </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>132 N.H. 439, 569 A.2d 749 (1989); <em>Matarasso </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>82 App. Div. 2d 861, 440 N.Y.S.2d 40 (1981), aff'd, 56 N.Y.2d 264, 436 N.E.2d 1305, 451 N.Y.S.2d 703 (1982); <em>Moser </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>731 P.2d 406 (Okla. 1986); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Grange Ins. Assn., </em>34 Wash. App. 151, 660 P.2d 307 (1983). Mass contends that these decisions are inapposite because the relevant statutes provide for <em>minimum </em>uninsured motorist coverage rather than uninsured motorist limits equal to liability limits, as does \u00a7 38-175c. But see <em>United Services Automobile Assn. </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>supra.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are persuaded, nonetheless, that the reasoning of these latter cases applies to \u00a7 38-175c.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In <em>Matarasso </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>supra, the insured sought uninsured motorist coverage under a \u201cCommercial Umbrella Liability Policy\u201d issued by the defendant insurance company. The umbrella policy protected the insured against claims by third parties in excess of the total applicable limits of liability of certain underlying liability policies, including an automobile liability policy. The umbrella policy, which incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>by ref\u00e9rence provisions of the underlying policies with respect to liability coverage, did not include an uninsured motorist endorsement or supplementary uninsured motorist coverage. In concluding that the uninsured motorist endorsement in the underlying automobile liability policy did not apply to the umbrella policy, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York stated: \u201cThe umbrella policy clearly provides <em>excess protection </em>for [the insured] and his business <em>against liability from third party claims. </em>It incorporates the underlying policies insofar as they provide for protection against liability for damages to third parties. <em>The uninsured motorist coverage provided by the underlying automobile liability policy does not involve claims of liability against the insured from third parties and is not incorporated by the umbrella policy. Any other interpretation would distort the actual purpose of the umbrella policy. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 862. The court held that New York\u2019s uninsured motorist statute did not mandate uninsured motorist coverage in the umbrella policy because the umbrella policy was not an automobile liability policy within the meaning of the statute, but rather had been purchased to provide excess liability coverage for a variety of potential claims and had been issued upon underlying liability policies. The court concluded that the insured had received the protection of the uninsured motorist statute through his underlying automobile liability policy and, therefore, had not been left without relief. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Metzger, </em>supra, involved facts similar to those presented in <em>Matarasso. </em>In <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co., </em>the insured\u2019s executor sought uninsured motorist coverage under a \u201cPersonal Excess Umbrella Policy\u201d that covered \u201c 'ultimate net loss in excess of the underlying limit which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal injury or property damage.\u2019 \u201d Id., 961. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201cunderlying limit\u201d referred to the limits on two underlying policies, including an automobile liability policy. In concluding that the state\u2019s uninsured motorist statute<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> did not require uninsured motorist coverage in the umbrella policy, the Alabama Supreme Court stated: \u201cAutomobile liability policies and motor vehicle liability policies insure against the risk of loss through the operation of specific automobiles. <em>An umbrella policy, </em>on the other hand, <em>is fundamentally excess insurance designed to protect against catastrophic loss. Before an umbrella policy is issued, a primary policy (the \u2018underlying policy\u2019) must be in existence and this primary policy must by law provide uninsured motorist coverage. </em>The umbrella policy assumes a risk of much less frequent occurrence, i.e., the risk of judgments in excess of primary policy limits, and accordingly carries premiums which reflect the lesser magnitude of this risk. <em>The umbrella policy ... is an inherently different type of insurance from an automobile or motor vehicle liability policy, and consequently does not come within the scope of the uninsured motorist statute. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In <em>O\u2019Hanlon </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>supra, the plaintiff sought reformation of an umbrella policy, denominated a \u201cPersonal Catastrophe Plan,\u201d which included automobile liability coverage up to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>statutory uninsured motorist limits of $300,000.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The policy provided uninsured motorist coverage up to $35,000 after the deduction of a \u201cretained limit.\u201d The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that Delaware\u2019s uninsured motorist statute did not require the umbrella policy to provide uninsured motorist coverage equal to the statutory limits. The court stated: \u201cPolicies such as the [insurer\u2019s] umbrella policy . . . with respect to their automobile coverages, would not exist but for underlying primary auto policies to which they provide excess liability insurance. Primary insurance policies ... by their very existence, provide insureds with all the benefits accorded under [the uninsured motorist statute]. To place umbrella policies within the ambit of [the uninsured motorist statute] would be to apply that section to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>require [uninsured motorist] coverage in addition to that provided by primary policies. We do not believe that [the uninsured motorist statute] can be so read, and hold that it is not applicable to policies that provide excess liability insurance.\u201d Id., 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The reasoning of the courts in Matarasso, <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. </em>and <em>O\u2019Hanlon </em>applies with equal force to the present case. The personal excess policy that the Masses purchased from USF&amp;G would not have existed but for the underlying primary insurance policies listed in the declarations, including the automobile insurance contract. The underlying automobile insurance contract, which complied with the provisions of \u00a7 38-175c, provided the plaintiffs with all of the benefits accorded them pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Mass contends that the policy behind \u00a7 38-175c is \u201cto ensure that insureds receive more than the bare minimum of [uninsured motorist] coverage in recognition of the often catastrophic consequences of automobile collisions and the gross inadequacy of statutory minimum coverages.\u201d While we do not disagree with this contention, we believe that this policy is adequately served by the conclusion we reach in this case. The purpose of \u00a7 38-175c is to compensate an insured to the same extent as he would have been if he had been injured by a motorist carrying liability insurance equal to the coverage carried by the insured, unless the insured has elected in writing uninsured motorist coverage in an amount less than his liability coverage. In the present case, it is undisputed that Daniel and Jessica Mass and the estate of Sara Mass were compensated in an amount equal to the liability limits under the Masses\u2019 automobile insurance contract with USF&amp;G.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Accordingly, we are persuaded that the Masses received the full protection contemplated by the statute when they purchased the underlying automobile liability policy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">USF&amp;G also points us to \u00a7 38-175a-4 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies in support of its argument that it was not required to provide uninsured motorist coverage to the Masses under the personal excess policy. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38-175a, the insurance commissioner has the authority to enact regulations governing uninsured motorist coverage. In enacting such regulations, however, the commissioner must effectuate the purpose and intent of the uninsured motorist statute. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 196, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). In accordance with his statutory authority, the commissioner has promulgated \u00a7\u00a7 38-175a-1 through 38-175a-9 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which define minimum provisions to be included in automobile liability insurance policies, including uninsured motorist coverage. Section 38-175a-4, entitled \u201cExceptions,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201cThese regulations do not apply to the insurance afforded under any policy . . . if the policy contains an <em>underlying insurance requirement . . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Mass argues that \u00a7 38-175a-4 is not valid because it conflicts with the purpose and intent of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>utes \u00a7 38-175c.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We disagree. It is well established that \u201can administrative agency\u2019s regulations are presumed valid and, unless they are shown to be inconsistent with the authorizing statute, they have the force and effect of a statute.\u201d <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kulla, </em>216 Conn. 390, 399, 579 A.2d 525 (1990). Moreover, \u201c[a] person claiming the invalidity of a regulation has the burden of proving that it is inconsistent with or beyond the legislative grant.\u201d Id. Finally, the insurance commissioner has a \u201cvery broad grant of regulatory authority in filling in the interstices of the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage legislation, and in doing so his regulation is entitled to great deference.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 463, 473, 370 A.2d 1011 (1976). We are persuaded that \u00a7 38-175a-4 of the regulations is consistent with General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c.

Therefore, the trial court properly determined that the total amount of uninsured motorist coverage available to the estate of Sara Mass and to Daniel and Jessica Mass was $1,000,000, pursuant to the automobile insurance contract. Our determination regarding this first claim disposes of Mass\u2019 second claim that $3,000,000 in uninsured motorist coverage was available under the personal excess policy.

To avoid the mandate of \u00a7 38-175c, however, the majority claims that the excess policy is not an <em>\u201cautomobile </em>liability policy,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>but merely a liability policy and, therefore, not a policy requiring uninsured motorist coverage. (Emphasis added.) It is clear to me, however, that in reaching its conclusion, the majority disregards the plain language of the statute and finesses established precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">First, the majority justifies its decision by construing the statute in light of its legislative history. In doing so, it ignores a fundamental rule that when a statute is clear and the language is unambiguous there is no room for construction. <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>221 Conn. 41, 44, 601 A.2d 539 (1992); <em>Cilley </em>v. <em>Lamphere, </em>206 Conn. 6, 9-10, 535 A.2d 1305 (1988). Moreover, we cannot read into the legislation provisions that are not clearly stated. <em>Local 218 Steamfitters Welfare Fund </em>v. <em>Cobra Pipe Supply &amp; Coil Co., </em>207 Conn. 639, 645, 541 A.2d 869 (1988). But even if we should consider this legislative history and the underlying policies of the statute mandating uninsured motorist coverage, we should still be led to the conclusion that coverage is required under the excess policy. In <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Malec, </em>215 Conn. 399, 403, 576 A.2d 485 (1990), we made clear that one of the major purposes of the statute requiring uninsured motorist coverage was \u201cto raise the amount of this protection.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Second, the majority seems to be saying that, because the excess policy does not specifically provide for uninsured motorist coverage and does not specify a separate premium for it, there is no coverage. Section 38-175c, however, requires such a provision; and if the policy fails to contain it, then the provision should be included as a matter of law. General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c (a) (1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To support its position, the majority relies on <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 590-91, 573 A.2d 699 (1990), wherein this court used a reasonable expectation test to determine whether the contested coverage\u2014that is, complications arising from proper treatment\u2014was included in the policy terms. In <em>Hammer, </em>however, the contested coverage was not mandated by the legislature. Unlike <em>Hammer, </em>this case concerns uninsured motorist coverage, for which the legislature directed that it be provided to the same extent as the liability limits in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Finally, the majority points to \u00a7 38-175a-4 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]hese regulations [providing for uninsured motorist coverage] do not apply to the insurance afforded under any policy ... if the policy contains an underlying insurance requirement . . . .\u201d First, it must be noted that these regulations were adopted in 1975, eight years before the legislature mandated that insurers provide uninsured motorist coverage in amounts equal to an insured\u2019s liability limits. More important, the regulations conflict with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the plain language of \u00a7 38-175c. Although we normally place great weight on an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110, 119-20, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991); <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>216 Conn. 253, 263, 579 A.2d 505 (1990); any regulation that exceeds the authority granted to the administrative agency is void. <em>Berlinski </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>164 Conn. 482, 492, 325 A.2d 239 (1973); see also <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 597, 590 A.2d 447 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 540, 569 A.2d 544 (1990), this court went to great lengths to distinguish an indemnity policy from that of a liability policy. This distinction afforded the basis for our decision in <em>Cohn </em>that an indemnity policy, as distinguished from a liability policy, did not trigger the mandatory uninsured motorist coverage. In <em>Cohn </em>we stated the following: \u201cThe entire orientation of this contract, as evidenced by its unequivocal language, is to indemnify the insured rather than to assume direct liability to injured third parties. To the extent that there may be similarities in the environment of underlying automobile policies vis-a-vis excess blanket catastrophe liability policies, we conclude that the term automobile liability policy as referred to in \u00a7 38-175e includes only those policies that extend underlying coverage before the operation of any indemnity policy that might otherwise exist.\u201d Id., 547-48. Although it was dicta, this preview of our opinion two years ago has additional significance. \u201c[T]he legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation of a statute and ... its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation. <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 134, 527 A.2d 672 (1987), quoting <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 439, 525 A.2d 91 (1987). This presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>tion is strengthened when the legislature has affirmatively reenacted the statute after the interpretation in question. <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>supra, 134; see also <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>146 Conn. 149, 156, 148 A.2d 334 (1959).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Heggelund, </em>219 Conn. 620, 627, 594 A.2d 464 (1991). Indeed, since the date of our decision in <em>Cohn, </em>the legislature amended the statute; Public Acts 1990, No. 90-243, \u00a7 127; and did not alter the wording of the statute in regard to requiring uninsured motorist coverage in the amount of an insured\u2019s liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">To support its position, the majority relies on the following cases from other jurisdictions. See <em>O\u2019Hanlon </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>639 F.2d 1019, 1029 (3d Cir. 1981); <em>Trinity Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Metzger, </em>360 So. 2d 960 (Ala. 1978); <em>Hartbarger </em>v. <em>Country Mutual Ins. Co., </em>107 Ill. App. 3d 391, 437 N.E.2d 691 (1982); <em>United Services Automobile Assn. </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>132 N.H. 439, 569 A.2d 749 (1989); <em>Matarasso </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>82 App. Div. 2d 861, 440 N.Y.S.2d 40 (1981), aff'd, 56 N.Y.2d 264, 436 N.E.2d 1305, 451 N.Y.S.2d 703 (1982); <em>Moser </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>731 P.2d 406 (Okla. 1986); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Grange Ins. Assn., </em>34 Wash. App. 151, 660 P.2d 307 (1983). That reliance, however, is misplaced. The majority concedes that in those jurisdictions, \u201cthe relevant statutes provide for minimum uninsured motorist coverage rather than uninsured motorist limits equal to liability limits, as does \u00a7 38-175c.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. Despite this acknowledgment, the majority applies the reasoning of those cases to the provisions of \u00a7 38-175c. All but <em>United Services Automobile </em>Assn. v. Wilkinson, supra, however, turned on the legislative decision to provide for minimum uninsured motorist coverage. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma in Moser v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 409, summed up the primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>reason for its holding that the uninsured motorist provision applies only to the underlying automobile liability insurance but not to \u201cumbrella\u201d or excess insurance as follows: \u201cThis result, and <em>the distinction inherent in the legislation\u2019s aim of providing minimum coverage </em>is demonstrated from the results reached in other jurisdictions where the same question has been considered. Courts in Delaware [in <em>O\u2019Hanlon </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>supra, construing Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, \u00a7 3902,] and Illinois [in <em>Hartbarger </em>v. <em>Country Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra,] considering uninsured motorist statutes containing the same . . . language as contained in Oklahoma\u2019s [uninsured motorist] statute, concluded that the legislative intent of providing protection against uninsured motorists was fully met by application to primary liability policies. Application of the provisions to supplemental or excess policies was considered to be beyond the intent of the legislation. <em>In both cases the statutes under consideration provided that the amount of uninsured motorist coverage be commensurate with the limits of liability required under the state financial responsibility laws. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The majority, therefore, incorrectly ignores the major distinction between the applicable statutes in those jurisdictions that merely mandate a minimum coverage and \u00a7 38-175c, which requires that insurers provide uninsured motorist coverage in amounts equal to an insured\u2019s liability coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">In holding that excess liability insurance came within the purview of a similar statute, the Ohio Supreme Court held: \u201cClearly, under the express terms of [Ohio\u2019s uninsured motorist statute], no exception is made with respect to excess insurance coverage. If the legislature desires to exempt excess liability carriers, they are free to do so. In the meantime, however, we are compelled to hold that excess liability insurance must comport with [the uninsured motorist statute]. In this holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>we approve of <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Siemens, </em>(1984) 16 Ohio App. 3d 129, 474 N.E.2d <em>655.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> Duriak </em>v. <em>Globe American Casualty Co., </em>28 Ohio St. 3d 70, 72, 502 N.E.2d 620 (1986). Indeed, the Court of Appeals of Ohio concluded that, in light of its statute requiring the offering of equivalent uninsured motorist coverage upon the issuance of automobile liability insurance, any distinction between automobile liability insurance and excess insurance amounted to \u201ca distinction without a difference.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Siemens, </em>supra, 132; see also <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>327 So. 2d 65 (Fla App.), cert. denied, 336 So. 2d 1179 (Fla. 1976); <em>Southern American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dobson, </em>441 So. 2d 1185 (La. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Finally, the majority quotes 8C J. &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1981) \u00a7 5017.65, p. 107, wherein it states that excess policies \u201cpick up this exceptional hazard at a small premium.\u201d The amount of the premium should not be a concern of ours in determining the law of this state when specific coverage is mandated by our legislature. If the additional risks to the insurer on the excess policy have not already been accounted for, they can be factored into the premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">I would find that the excess policy provides for uninsured motorist coverage to the extent of $1,000,000, the amount of liability protection afforded to the insureds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\"> See footnote 2 of the majority opinion for the text of General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b670-10\"> As the majority notes, the parties agree that Mass had not requested a reduction in the uninsured motorist coverage from USF&amp;G.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b671-5\"> When General Statutes \u00a7 38-175e was amended to require uninsured motorist coverage to equal liability coverage, the intent of the framers was clear. \u201cWe have no doubt that the General Assembly contemplated that an insured should make a purposeful and knowing decision to request a lesser amount of [uninsured motorist] coverage. The legislative history of Public Acts 1983, No. 83-461 demonstrates the importance that the legislature attached to specific awareness of the content of the statute: \u2018Under subsection 2, it would require each insured who purchases more than the legally required amount of liability insurance would [sic] receive the same amount of uninsured motorist coverage. The insured would have an opportunity to waive in writing the additional uninsured motorist coverage. <em>This change would increase the consumer\u2019s awareness </em>of the value of low-cost uninsured motorist coverage which protects the insured and his family members. Apparently many drivers purchase $100,000.00 or more of liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>coverage but leave their uninsured motorist coverage at the minimum of $20,000.00\u2014$40,000.00. Subsection 2 which <em>gives such a driver an increased amount of uninsured motorist coverage, unless he makes a conscious decision not to purchase it. \u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) 26 S.
