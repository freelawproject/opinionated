J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHj\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether an employee who is injured in an automobile accident while operating his employer\u2019s vehicle during the course of his employment is precluded by General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from collecting uninsured motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ist benefits<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from his self-insured employer. The plaintiff, Bruce A. Bouley,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was injured when the police vehicle he was operating collided with another vehicle. After exhausting the third party tortfeasor\u2019s automobile liability coverage, the plaintiff, who had also received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, brought an action for uninsured motorist benefits against his self-insured employer, the police department of the city of Norwich and the city of Norwich (city). The trial court granted the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>25 Conn. App. 492, 595 A.2d 884 (1991). We granted certification to appeal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The record discloses the following undisputed facts. The plaintiff was a police officer employed by the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>of Norwich. On August 31, 1985, while operating a municipal police vehicle during the course of his employment, he sustained injuries in a collision with a third party tortfeasor. The plaintiff received $18,000 in workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the city. He also made a claim for damages against the tortfeasor and recovered, by way of settlement, the sum of $20,000, which represented the full amount of the tortfeasor\u2019s automobile liability insurance. The city was entitled to reimbursement for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to the plaintiff. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 31-293.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the plaintiff\u2019s economic and medical damages allegedly exceeded $20,000, he sought uninsured motorist benefits under the insurance policy covering the police vehicle the plaintiff had been operating at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The city denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>plaintiff's claim for uninsured motorist benefits. The plaintiff then commenced this action for damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>against the city alleging that its failure to provide uninsured motorist benefits violated General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2). See footnote 6, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The city moved for summary judgment on the basis that the plaintiff had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and that, pursuant to \u00a7 31-284 (a), those benefits represented the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy as to the city. The trial court granted the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment in reliance on the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>19 Conn. App. 169, 561 A.2d 456, cert. granted, 212 Conn. 814, 565 A.2d 536 (1989),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which had held that a police officer injured in the course of employment was barred from seeking uninsured motorist benefits from his self-insured employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>The Appellate Court reversed the decision of the trial court upon concluding that, notwithstanding \u00a7 31-284 (a) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the city was required to provide uninsured motorist benefits, as well as workers\u2019 compensation benefits, to the plaintiff for injuries incurred during the course of the plaintiff\u2019s employment. <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 502. The court indicated that the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, to provide the exclusive tort remedy for an employee against an employer, was not compromised by a claim to pay statutorily mandated uninsured motorist benefits. Id. The court further reasoned that in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 814, 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990), a case with almost identical facts, this court had concluded that it was permissible for an employee to receive uninsured motorist benefits in addition to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Although the employer in <em>Wilson </em>was not self-insured, the Appellate Court stated that \u201can injured employee of a self-insured employer is entitled to receive the same benefits as an employee of an employer that is not self-insured,\u201d and reversed the judgment of the trial court granting the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 502. In doing so, the Appellate Court stated that its decision in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, which was relied upon by the trial court, had been \u201ceffectively overruled by <em>Wilson.\u201d Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 495. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The city argues that the exclusivity provision of \u00a7 31-284 (a) was triggered in this case by the undisputed fact that the plaintiff was entitled to and did receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries sustained during the course of his employment. The exclusivity provision, according to the city, bars the plaintiff, in the circumstances of this case, from uninsured motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>ist coverage even though the city is required by statute to maintain such coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The plaintiff makes a two part argument in support of his contention, to the contrary, that uninsured motorist claims against his self-insured employer do not fall within the prohibition of \u00a7 31-284 (a). First, the plaintiff claims that \u00a7 31-284 (a) is inapplicable because he is suing the city, not in negligence, but pursuant to a statutorily created right to recover uninsured motorist benefits and pursuant to the city\u2019s contractual obligation to provide uninsured motorist coverage. Second, the plaintiff contends that he is suing the city in its capacity as an insurer, not as an employer, and thus the action is not barred by \u00a7 31-284 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">We agree with the city. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the statute mandating uninsured motorist coverage appear in separate chapters of the General Statutes. The first Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was enacted in this state in 1913; Public Acts 1913, c. 138, pt. A, \u00a7 2; see also <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 539-40, 494 A.2d 555 (1985); A. Grillo, \u201cFifty Years of Workmen\u2019s Compensation\u2014An Historical Review,\u201d 38 Conn. B J. 239,246 (1964); while \u00a7 38-175c requiring uninsured motorist coverage on all automobile liability insurance policies, was enacted fifty-four years later in 1967. Public Acts 1967, c. 510, \u00a7 4. Neither statutory scheme expressly refers to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">\u201cThe purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation statute is to compensate the worker for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, without regard to fault, by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer.\u201d <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>A.2d 1263 (1979); see also <em>Perille </em>v. <em>RaybestosManhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>supra, 541; <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 669, 425 A.2d 131 (1979). Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, both the employer and the employee have relinquished certain rights to obtain other advantages. The employee no longer has to prove negligence on the part of the employer, but, in return, he has to accept a limited, although certain, recovery. See <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 97, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). The employer, in turn, guarantees compensation to an injured employee in return for the exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation liability to its employees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>219 Conn. 439, 455, 594 A.2d 446 (1991); <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra; <em>Velardi </em>v. <em>Ryder Truck Rental, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 371, 376, 423 A.2d 77 (1979); see generally J. King, \u201cThe Exclusiveness of an Employee\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Remedy Against His Employer,\u201d 55 Tenn. L. Rev. 405, 406-408 (1988); A. Larson, \u201cThe Nature and Origins of Workmen\u2019s Compensation,\u201d 37 Cornell L.Q. 206 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Section 31-284 (a), known as the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, provides that \u201c[a]n employer shall not be liable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment .... All rights and claims between employer and employees, or any representatives or dependents of such employees, arising out of personal injury or death sustained in the course of employment as aforesaid are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter . . . .\u201d This provision does not, however, preclude an injured employee from bringing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>claim against a third party tortfeasor responsible for such injury. Rather, the legislature has specifically allowed for such a cause of action. See footnote 5, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The plaintiff does not dispute that he was injured during the course of his employment and that he has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. He claims that he is nonetheless entitled to uninsured motorist benefits from the city because the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is inapplicable to a claim for uninsured motorist benefits that derives from statutorily mandated uninsured motorist coverage and a contractual obligation to provide such coverage undertaken by the city when it became self-insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The Appellate Court originally concluded that a claim for uninsured motorist benefits was within the purview of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 171. It emphasized that \u00a7 31-284 (a) \u201chas been repeatedly and uniformly construed by the courts of this state to exclude further recovery from the employer by an employee who has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits,\u201d and held that an employee, injured in the course of his employment, was barred from receiving uninsured motorist benefits from his employer. Id. The Appellate Court subsequently determined, however, in <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>25 Conn. App. 492, 495, 595 A.2d 884 (1991), and <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>25 Conn. App. 651, 653, 595 A.2d 949 (1991), that <em>Ross </em>was no longer controlling following this court\u2019s decision in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">The issue presented in <em>Wilson </em>was not whether a claim for uninsured motorist benefits brought against an employer for injuries sustained in the course of employment was precluded by the Workers\u2019 Compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>sation Act. Rather, the principal issue in that case was \u201cwhether coverage for uninsured motorists contained in a fleet automobile liability policy may be combined or \u2018stacked\u2019 in determining the total amount of coverage available to a single claimant.\u201d Id., 533. The only issue in <em>Wilson </em>that concerned workers\u2019 compensation was whether the insurance commissioner was empowered to offset workers\u2019 compensation payments against uninsured motorist limits. Id., 536-39. The plaintiff had raised the issue on cross appeal claiming that the trial court had erred in offsetting his workers\u2019 compensation award against his uninsured motorist award. We held that \u201c[i]f damages are paid pursuant to the workers\u2019 compensation law, the uninsured motorist coverage may be reduced accordingly.\u201d Id., 538. The exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was neither raised nor addressed in <em>Wilson. </em>Consequently, the issue of whether a claim for uninsured motorist benefits is prohibited by \u00a7 31-284 (a) is one of first impression for this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The plaintiff advances the argument that the language of the statute and the cases that have interpreted the exclusive remedy provision limit its application to common law claims against an employer. Because his claim is statutory and contractual in nature, he contends that it is not barred by the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s representations, neither the language of the statute nor the weight of judicial authority supports such a limited interpretation of \u00a7 31-284 (a). The statute does not distinguish between common law tort claims, statutory claims and contract claims. It states that <em>\u201c[a]ll </em>rights and claims between employer and employees . . . arising out of personal injury . . . sustained in the course of employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>. . . are abolished . . . (Emphasis added.) In clear and unambiguous terms, the statute provides that liability under the Workers' Compensation Act is an employer\u2019s exclusive liability to an employee for a personal injury that occurs during the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">This court has repeatedly stated that workers\u2019 compensation is an employee\u2019s only remedy for injuries that arise during the course of his employment. See <em>Pokorny </em>v. <em>Getta\u2019s Garage, </em>supra, 455; <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>Borkowski, </em>206 Conn. 495, 500, 538 A.2d 1031 (1988); <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>supra, 541-42; <em>Velardi </em>v. <em>Ryder Truck Rental, Inc., </em>supra, 376. The exclusivity provision \u201coperatejs] as a total bar to actions brought by employees against their employers for job related injuries.\u201d <em>Sgueglia </em>v. <em>Milne Construction Co., </em>212 Conn. 427, 433, 562 A.2d 505 (1989); see also <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>209 Conn. 59, 66, 546 A.2d 846 (1988); <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corporation, </em>208 Conn. 589, 599, 545 A.2d 1086 (1988).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While we have stated that the exclusivity provision bars \u201ctort action[s] for work related injuries\u201d; see <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>97; <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>supra, 217; the clear language of the statute is not so limited in its application. Moreover, we have previously concluded that \u00a7 31-284 (a) barred a statutory action against an employer. In <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>supra, 535, we held that the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act precluded an employee, allegedly injured during the course of his employment, from bringing a direct action against his employer for breach of the <em>statutory </em>duty to \u201cprovide his employees with a safe place to work.\u201d See also <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 100-108.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">One commentator has noted that \u201c[t]he exclusiveness rule relieves the employer not only of common-law tort liability, but also of statutory liability under all state and federal statutes, as well as of liability in contract and in admiralty, for an injury covered by the compensation act.\u201d 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1992) \u00a7 65.30, p. 12-21. In addition, courts from other jurisdictions have ruled that their workers\u2019 compensation statutes bar actions brought pursuant to various state and federal statutes. See, e.g., <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Panama Canal Co., </em>215 F. Sup. 726 (D.D.C. 1963) (the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act); <em>Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 7320 </em>v. <em>Sheffield, </em>398 So. 2d 262 (Ala. 1981) (state Employer\u2019s Liability Act); <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Burgess Construction Co., </em>425 P.2d 602 (Alaska 1967) (Defective Machinery Act); <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>51 Ill. App. 3d 842, 366 N.E.2d 1052 (1977) (Structural Work Act); <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, </em>256 Pa. Super. 43, 389 A.2d 591 (1978) (No-Fault Automobile Insurance Act). The statutory or contractual basis for uninsured motorist coverage does not, therefore, abrogate the exclusivity of the Workers', Compensation Act for personal injuries that arise during the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The plaintiff asserts, however, that the policy underlying mandatory uninsured motorist coverage, to place the injured party in the same position as if he had been injured by an insured motorist; <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982); obligates the city to pay him uninsured motorist benefits for his injuries. The policy would be compromised, he asserts, by denying benefits to employees injured in the course of their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">While uninsured motorist coverage has been mandated by statute, we have recognized that such coverage is less an independent source of recovery than it is a \u201csafety net.\u201d Section 38-175c \u201cdoes not require that uninsured motorist coverage be made available when the insured has been otherwise protected, such as when the uninsured motorist is only one of two or more joint tortfeasors, or when the uninsured motorist has other resources available to protect the insured. Nor does the statute provide that the uninsured motorist coverage shall stand as an independent source of recovery for the insured, or that the coverage limits shall not be reduced under appropriate circumstances.\u201d <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 463, 472, 370 A.2d 1011 (1976); see also <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 538. When an employee is eligible for and has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the policies underlying uninsured motorist coverage are not sufficiently compelling to override the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. While a self-insured employer must maintain uninsured motorist coverage, such insurance does not compel the provision of coverage to an employee covered by workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">We are also unpersuaded by the plaintiff\u2019s claims that, in mandating uninsured motorist coverage, the legislature had either created an exception to the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act or had impliedly repealed the exclusivity of the act as it per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>tains to claims for uninsured motorist benefits. The express language of \u00a7 31-284 (a) relieves an employer of all liability for personal injuries beyond the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and there is no language within \u00a7 38-175c indicating a legislative intent to create an exception to the exclusivity of the act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Where the legislature has intended an exception to \u00a7 31-284 (a), it has expressly so provided. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a (exempting from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act an action against a fellow employee for his wilful or malicious acts or his negligent operation of a motor vehicle). Moreover, \u00a7 31-284 (a) exempts from its coverage only rights and claims \u201cgiven by this chapter.\u201d The statutory provisions concerning workers\u2019 compensation appear in chapter 568 of the General Statutes, while statutory provisions concerning uninsured motorist coverage appear in chapter 700 of the General Statutes. Construing the mandatory uninsured motorist coverage as an \u201cexception\u201d to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is irreconcilable with the express language of \u00a7 31-284 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">\u201cThe rule disfavoring implied repeals is a \u2018well established principle of statutory construction.\u2019 <em>Southern Connecticut Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>191 Conn. 514, 521, 468 A.2d 574 (1983). The legislature is presumed to have acted with the intent to create a consistent body of law. <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Leslie-Elliott Constructors, Inc., </em>194 Conn. 129, 134, 479 A.2d 231 (1984). If two statutes appear to be in conflict but can be construed as consistent with each other, then the court should give effect to both. <em>Hirschfeld </em>v. <em>Commission on Claims, </em>172 Conn. 603, 607, 376 A.2d 71 (1977). \u2018[EJnactments by the General Assembly are presumed to repeal earlier inconsistent ones to the extent that they are in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>flict.\u2019 <em>Southern Connecticut Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>supra. Because repeal by implication is generally disfavored, however, the principle applies only when the relevant statutes \u2018cannot stand together.\u2019 Id.; <em>Hirschfeld v. Commission on Claims, </em>supra, 606-607.\u201d <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>217 Conn. 631, 641, 587 A.2d 415 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Only one interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 31-284 (a) and 88-175c enables the statutes to \u201cstand together.\u201d Our conclusion that an employee is limited to the recovery of workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his employer for injuries that occur during the course of his employment does not render the two statutes inconsistent. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act remains an employee\u2019s exclusive remedy against an employer for workplace injuries, while uninsured motorist coverage remains mandatory on all automobile liability insurance policies.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because workers\u2019 compensation is a bar to uninsured motorist recovery only when the employee has already been made whole by workers\u2019 compensation, the \u201csafety net\u201d function of uninsured motorist insurance coverage remains unimpaired. The opposite conclusion, however, that the legislature, in enacting a statutory scheme mandating uninsured motorist cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>age on all automobile liability insurance policies, had intended that an employee injured during the course of his employment could collect uninsured motorist benefits from his employer, would render the two statutes inconsistent. We will therefore not presume that the subsequent enactment of a statute mandating uninsured motorist coverage impliedly repealed the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Because the legislature in \u00a7 31-284 (a) has unambiguously provided that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to be an employee\u2019s exclusive remedy for \u201c[a]ll rights and claims between employer and employees\u201d arising out of work-related personal injuries, it is for the legislature, and not the courts, to carve out an exception to the act for uninsured motorist benefits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>supra, 106. \u201cWe recognize that over the years the legislature has worked out a complex statutory scheme in promulgating workers\u2019 compensation statutes and that \u2018[a]n integral part of this complex structure is the accepted proposition that an employee surrenders other claims for the certainty of the exclusive workers\u2019 compensation remedy.\u2019 <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Breme, [187 N.J. </em>Super. 129, 132, 453 A.2d 1335 (1982)]. Such a \u2018comprehensive, well thought out legislative scheme should not be tinkered with by the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corporation, </em>supra, 605; see also J. King, supra, 411 (\u201c[A]ny serious threat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>to the integrity and continued survival of the workers\u2019 compensation system must be viewed with concern. Abrogation of the exclusive remedy rule by expansion or creation of new exceptions to the rule could pose such a threat.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">We are aware that the four jurisdictions that have considered whether an employee who has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits is precluded from receiving uninsured motorist benefits from his self-insured employer or his insurance carrier have decided that the employee is not so precluded. See <em>Heavens </em>v. <em>LaClede Gas Co., </em>755 S.W.2d 331 (Mo. App. 1988) (self-insured employer); <em>Christy </em>v. <em>Newark, </em>102 N. J. 598, 510 A.2d 22 (1986) (self-insured employer); <em>Boris </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>356 Pa.

We are, however, unpersuaded by the reasoning of those cases. We are constrained by the express language of our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to preclude an employee\u2019s recovery of uninsured motorist benefits from an employer for his work-related injuries.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We now turn to the plaintiffs second claim that, in providing uninsured motorist coverage as a self-insured municipality, the city shed the protection of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Essentially, the plaintiff asserts that he was suing the city, not as an \u201cemployer,\u201d but as an \u201cinsurer.\u201d As \u00a7 31-284 (a) is applicable only to actions against an employer, the plaintiff argues that the present action for uninsured motorist benefits against the city in its capacity as insurer was not barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">This effort to invoke the \u201cdual capacity\u201d doctrine for self-insured employers is unavailing. We have previously considered and expressly rejected the dual capacity doctrine in the context of a claim that a company-employed nurse was acting as an independent contractor in treating a plaintiff employee. <em>Panaro </em>v. <em>Electrolux Corpo</em>ration, supra, 600, 606. In doing so, we recognized that the weight of authority in nearly all jurisdictions had rejected similar dual capacity arguments. Id., 596-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">While <em>Panaro </em>did not address the aspect of the dual capacity doctrine asserted by the plaintiff in the present appeal,, the dual capacity doctrine in general has been found unpersuasive by commentators and courts alike. See, e.g., 2A A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 72.81 (a), p. 14-229 (the dual capacity doctrine \u201ccould go a long way toward demolishing the exclusive remedy principle\u201d when \u201cone considers how many such added relations an employer might have in the course of a day\u2019s work\u201d); J. King, supra, 492-96 (\u201cIt is easy to see how the dual capacity genie, once allowed out of its bottle, could quickly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>devour the exclusive remedy rule completely.\u201d Id., 496.). In rejecting the dual capacity doctrine, the Tennessee Supreme Court succinctly stated that \u201c[t]he employer is the employer; not some person other than the employer. It is that simple.\u201d <em>McAlister </em>v. <em>Methodist Hospital of Memphis, </em>550 S.W.2d 240, 246 (Tenn. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Courts and commentators have also specifically criticized the application of the dual capacity doctrine to self-insured employers. Professor Larson refers to attempts to assert a dual capacity on the basis of an employer\u2019s status as a self-insured entity as \u201crather far-out\u201d and notes that even California, which at one time had accepted the dual capacity doctrine, has subsequently rebuffed such attempts. 2A A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 72.89, p. 14-287; see <em>Denman </em>v. <em>Duval Sierrita Corporation, </em>27 Ariz. App. 684, 685, 558 P.2d 712 (1976) (theory that self-insured employer acted in a dual capacity \u201cis without support in the case law or logic\u201d); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>International Paper Co., </em>129 Cal. App. 3d 810, 815-16, 181 Cal. Rptr. 342 (1982) (\u201cBy becoming self-insured, the employer simply does not create an <em>\u2018 </em>\u201cextra\u201d employer status or a relationship that is distinct from that of employer and employee\u2019 \u201d; self-insurance did not transform the employer \u201cinto two legal entities where there was but one before.\u201d); <em>Swain </em>v. <em>J.L. Hudson Co., </em>60 Mich. App. 361, 230 N.W.2d 433 (1975) (court dismissed suit brought against employer in capacity as self-insurer as barred by exclusivity provision of workers\u2019 compensation act).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">We will not circumvent the clear language of \u00a7 31-284 (a) by invoking the fiction of the dual capacity doctrine for self-insured employers. The city was not transformed into something other than an employer for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because it chose to become self-insured. Due to the cost of liability insurance premiums, it is conceivable that many employers, including municipalities like the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>of Norwich, might choose to provide their own automobile liability insurance coverage pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-371 (c). Excluding such employers from the protection of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act with regard to uninsured motorist benefits would impinge upon their statutory right to be self-insured and upon the exclusivity of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Moreover, in this court\u2019s decision in the companion case of <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>222 Conn. 769, 610 A.2d 1257 (1992), issued today, we concluded that an employer\u2019s automobile liability insurance provider was entitled to the same immunity from suit for uninsured motorist benefits for work-related injuries as the employer. We cited the increased costs that would ultimately be borne by the employer for benefits paid by its insurer and concluded that, for purposes of \u00a7 31-284 (a) and uninsured motorist benefits, the employer\u2019s insurer was the \u201calter ego\u201d of its insured. Id., 773-74. If an employer\u2019s automobile liability insurance provider is deemed an \u201cemployer\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-284 (a), it would be illogical and inconsistent to conclude that the self-insured employer is anything other than an \u201cemployer.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">In this opinion Glass, Borden and F.X.

As the Appellate Court noted in <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>25 Conn.

While an employee cannot recover uninsured motorist benefits from his employer for work-related injuries, others might be eligible for such benefits, i.e., a passenger in the automobile who is not an employee. Consequently, requiring an employer to maintain uninsured motorist coverage on its automobiles is not absurd. WThether an employer\u2019s uninsured motorist policy may make an outright exclusion in coverage for an employee occupying an automobile during the course of employment is an issue to be addressed by the legislature and the insurance commissioner, not the courts. See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 539, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 814, 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990); see also Regs., Conn.

Section 38-175a-6 (d) (2) provides in relevant part that a policy for uninsured motorist coverage \u201cmay provide for the reduction of limits to the extent that damages have been . . . paid or are payable under any workers\u2019 compensation . . . law.\u201d The plaintiff emphasizes that we accepted the validity of the regulation in <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 569 A.2d 40 (1990), and that the regulation \u201cnecessitates a finding that a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and a claim for [uninsured motorist] benefits can co-exist and that the former does not bar the latter.\u201d To the contrary, this regulation does not lead to such a conclusion. Section 38-175a-6 (d) does no more than authorize a setoff whereby an insurer may deduct from the limits of its uninsured motorist policy any amounts that have been paid pursuant to a workers\u2019 compensation policy. For example, an employee who has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits would not be precluded by General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 31-284 (a) from making a claim for uninsured motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>ist benefits under his own personal automobile insurance policy.

Ed. 2d 28 (1990). <em>Wilson </em>was one reason advanced by the Appellate Court; however, the crux of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision was not <em>Wilson, </em>but its analysis of the purposes and policies of workers\u2019 compensation benefits and uninsured motorist benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Landau, writing a well reasoned and analytical decision for the Appellate Court, distinguished between these two bodies of law and concluded that \u00a7 31-284 does not preclude the right to uninsured motorist coverage whether or not the employer was self-insured. <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>25 Conn. App. 492, 502, 595 A.2d 884 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides an exclusive remedy for an employee for work related injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>on the basis of <em>tort </em>law; General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 31-284; <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 97, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). \u201cIn a word . . . [workers\u2019 compensation] statutes compromise an employee\u2019s right to a common law <em>tort </em>action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, however, does not preclude an employee from bringing a claim against a third party tortfeasor who contributed to the injury for which he or she is receiving workers\u2019 compensation. General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 31-293. Indeed, \u00a7 31-293 authorizes an employee who is injured in an automobile collision during the course of employment to bring suit against the third party tortfeasor who caused the injury. Automobile insurance laws mandate that all automobile insurance policies, including policies that cover vehicles owned by employers and operated by employees, must provide uninsured motorist coverage so that the insured is able to recover for the damages he or she would have been able to recover from the uninsured tortfeasor. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336; <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982). Although the law allows the owner of an automobile to be a self-insurer, it requires the self-insurer \u201cto pay basic reparations benefits and the liabilities covered by residual liability insurance and to perform all other obligations imposed\u201d upon an insurer. General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 38-327 (c). While an employee may operate an employer\u2019s vehicle in the course of his or her employment, that employee is an insured and enjoys a contractual right to uninsured motorist coverage as mandated by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The plaintiff employee brought the present action seeking to enforce his <em>contractual </em>right to recover damages he sustained as a result of the <em>negligence of a third party </em>tortfeasor\u2014rights created by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>employer\u2019s statutory obligation to provide uninsured motorist protection. This action is simply not precluded by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. To hold otherwise is as farfetched as to conclude that an employee would be precluded under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act from bringing an action against his employer over a contractual term of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Furthermore, such a holding undermines the statutory requirement that an employer provide uninsured motorist coverage. In footnote 11 of its opinion, the majority suggests that it is not absurd to require the city to provide uninsured motorist coverage, even though employees are precluded from benefitting from such coverage. The majority takes comfort in the fact that other individuals, such as a passenger in the car who is not an employee, might be eligible for benefits. The possible benefit to other individuals, however, does absolutely nothing to help the insured employee recover for the damages he or she would have been able to recover from the uninsured tortfeasor, which was the purpose of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 249. Section 38a-336 does not distinguish between employees and nonemployees; rather, it gives all insureds\u2014employees and nonemployees alike\u2014a contractual and statutorily mandated right to uninsured motorist coverage. See id., 249-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Indeed, the majority is unable to point to any other jurisdiction to support its conclusion that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act bars an employee\u2019s recovery of uninsured motorist benefits from an employer for work related injuries. On the contrary, other jurisdictions that have had occasion to consider the issue have held that their workers\u2019 compensation act is not a bar. The New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Christy </em>v. <em>Newark, </em>102 N. J. 598, 510 A.2d 22 (1986), a case strikingly similar to this, ruled that its workers\u2019 compensation act did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>not preclude the employee from recovering uninsured motorist benefits from his self-insured employer. In <em>Christy, </em>the plaintiff, a police officer, was injured when a \u201chit-and-run\u201d vehicle struck the police vehicle that the officer was operating in the course of his employment.

App. 1988) (self-insured employer was bound to provide uninsured motorist coverage to employee injured in the course of employment); <em>Boris </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>356 Pa. Super. 532, 515 A.2d 21 (1986) (a claim for uninsured motorist benefits addresses the wrongs of a third party, not the wrongs of the employer or coworkers, and thus takes such claims outside the scope of workers\u2019 compensation \u201cimmunity\u201d); <em>William </em>v. <em>Newport News, </em>240 Va. 425, 397 S.E.2d 813 (1990) (the \u201cexclusivity provision\u201d does not prevent an employee from exercising rights granted under the uninsured motorist provision).</p>\n<p id=\"AR3b\">Not only did the court in <em>Christy </em>hold that the New Jersey workers\u2019 compensation act does not bar an employee from recovering uninsured benefits from his self-insured employer, but it also noted that such uninsured coverage does not give the employee a windfall, but merely recoverable damages. The employer is entitled to reimbursement from the damages paid by the third party tortfeasor or pursuant to the uninsured motorist. coverage. <em>Christy </em>v. <em>Newark, </em>supra, 609. Likewise, the employer in Connecticut, subject to the provision of \u00a7 31-293, would also be entitled to reimbursement. Indeed, in the present case, the defendant was reimbursed by approximately $18,000 out of the $20,000 paid to the plaintiff by the third party tortfeasor\u2019s insurer, leaving the plaintiff $2000 to. cover his other damages which were not compensated for under workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-6\"> See footnote 1 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-7\"> Here, as in the majority opinion, the term uninsured motorist benefits encompasses underinsured motorist benefits as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\"> \u201cWe further conclude that a self-insured entity, in its capacity as an employer, is required to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and, as an insurer, is required to provide uninsured motorist benefits. An employee\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits from a self-insured employer does not, therefore, preclude his right to receive uninsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">\u201cA review of the purposes and policies underlying workers\u2019 compensation benefits and uninsured motorist benefits indicates that they exist for separate and distinct reasons.\u201d <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>25 Conn.
