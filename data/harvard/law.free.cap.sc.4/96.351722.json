The effect of the Act was to place all the past indebtedness of the County, whether contracted for building a Court House, or otherwise, upon the same footing.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">This was an application by Samuel Marco against the County Treasurer of Darlington County, to compel him to pay a warrant for $5,500, drawn in favor of the applicant, by the County Commissioners of said County, and dated the 3d of June, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">The facts, as stated in the petition and admitted by the answer, were that the consideration of the warrant was money due the petitioner under a contract for building a Court House for the County, dated April 23d, 1870; that when the warrant was presented to the County Treasurer for payment he had in his hands a fund sufficient to pay the same; that said fund had been raised under the Act approved February 19th, 1870, and the Joint Resolution of December 3d, 1870, authorizing the levy of taxes for the construction and completion of a Court House at Darlington, and had been deposited in the Carolina National Bank at Columbia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">The County Treasurer refused to pay the warrant on the ground that he was prevented from doing so by the 4th Section of the \u201c Act to provide for the payment of the past indebtedness of Darlington County, and for other purposes,\u201d approved March 9, 1872, which provides \u201c that it is hereby made the duty of the County Commissioners of Darlington County to draw their warrants on the County Treasurer, against any funds in his hands, including the money now in bank which was appropriated for building of a Court House, for the payment and liquidation of the past indebtedness of the County, and the County Treasurer, on presentation of said warrants, shall pay the same.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-10\">Harttee, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-11\"><em>Chamberlain, </em>Attorney General, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b104-12\">Jan. 16, 1873.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AO\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b104-13\">Willard, A. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3R\">The relator demands the vrrit of <em>mandamus </em>to compel the County Treasurer of Darlington County to pay a check drawn upon him by the County Commissioners of that County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>in favor of the relator, for the sum of 85,500, being the amount due the relator on account of a contract for the building of a Court House for said County, authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">It appears that the respondent, as County Treasurer, holds funds to an amount sufficient to pay the relator\u2019s demand, raised and held under authority of an Act of the General Assembly, providing means for defraying the expenses of building such Court House.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The only question presented is whether the payment of this amount is prevented by the operation and effect of the Act entitled \u201c An Act to provide for the payment of the past indebtedness of Darlington County, and for other purposes,\u201d approved March 9, 1872. The portion of this Act in question is the 4th Section, which reads as follows: \u201c That it is hereby made the duty of the County Commissioners of Darlington County to draw their warrants on the County Treasurer against any funds in his hands, including the money now in bank which was appropriated for building of a Court House, for the payment and liquidation of the past indebtedness of the County; and the County Treasurer, on presentation of said warrants, shall pay the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The effect of this Act was not to render the fund in question inapplicable to the payment of the relator\u2019s demand. Its design was to place certain other demands on the same footing, as to such fund, as that occupied by the relator\u2019s demand. It does not appear, by the proceedings in this case, that there is any outstanding demand against the County Treasury, of the class contemplated by that Act. No question, then, can arise in this ease between the relative claims of the relator and the creditors of the general class intended to be favored under the Act in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Previous to this Act the fund stood appropriated by law for the payment of the relator\u2019s demand; and unless the Act in question operated as an absolute repeal of the authority for such appropriation, the relator is entitled to receive payment out of the fund in question. The Act cannot bear that construction; at most, it could only operate as a repeal on the contingency of the prior presentation of demands against the Treasury of the class contemplated by its provisions. It does not appear that any such demands exist; accordingly the fund stands appropriated to the payment of relator\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The writ must issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-10\">Hoses, C.
