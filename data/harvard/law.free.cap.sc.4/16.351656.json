Edward Eaton Swann was the nearest heir of his mother at her death, and, if not entitled to the fee under the direct limitations of the will to the two sons and their \u201c legal heirs,\u201d was clearly vested with it under the contingent limitation to her \u201cnearest heirs-at-law,\u201d and, being so vested, had the right to convey the land.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b25-10\">Nov. 27, 1872.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"ALp\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b25-11\">Moses, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7\">The non-suit granted by the Circuit Judge must be sustained. The action is trespass to try title, and before the plaintiff can recover it devolves upon him to show a title to the premises vesting in him. He claims- to derive it from the will of Mrs. Mary IT. Swann, as representing the person who is to take as her nearest heir-at-law, in t,he event of a failure of the conditions on which a fee simple estate was to pass under'it to her son, Edward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Eaton Swann, who survived her, and in his life-time, after her death, conveyed the land to Samuel G. Poag, who was the husband of the defendant, Anna H. Poag, who has survived him.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">It may be necessary, first, to determine what estate the said Edward Eaton Swann took\u00bf on the death of his brother, Joseph Addison Eaton. By the terms of the will, an estate for life was devised to him, with remainder to his legal heirs, which would confer upon him an estate in fee. This is on the assumption that a technical definition is to be given to the word \u201c heirs\u201d for, if so, it must be held a word of limitation, and not of purchase, according to the recognized rule in <em>Shelly\u2019s case. </em>\u2014 Fewell vs. <em>Fewell, </em>6 Rich. Eq., 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\"Where technical words, however, are used, if there is a clear intention on the part of the testator, to be collected from the context, not to employ them in their legal sense, they should be accepted in the sense in which they appear to have been designed. \u20142 Williams on Executors, 778, 779 ; 2 Jarman on Wills, 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">It is apparent, from the language of the will, that the testatrix used the term \u201c legal heirs,\u201d in the sense of children, for she directs \u201c each son\u2019s heirs to hold their father\u2019s part of said land forever,\u201d and in the event of the death of both sons dying without such heirs, \u201c as above mentioned,\u201d to use her language, she bequeaths the land to her \u201c nearest heirs-at-law forever.\u201d It is in the character of her \u201c nearest heir \u201d that the plaintiff asserts his legal title. Where, however, there is a devise to the testator\u2019s heirs, they do not take under the will, but by <em>descent. </em>\u2014 Seabrook vs. <em>Seabrook et al., </em>10 Rich. Eq., 495. John M. Sw7ann, the plaintiff here, is not the heir-at-law, in any view, of the said Mary H. Swann, for at her death her son, Edward Eaton Swann, through whom the respondent claims, was alive, and, as her sole heir, was entitled to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">The motion is refused\u2019, and the appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b26-9\"><em>Willard, </em>A.
