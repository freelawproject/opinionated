Because, by the provisions of the Act of March 2, 1872, no portion of the said certificates are required to be retired until after the expiration of twelve months from their date; that before the expiration of that time no suit can be had in behalf of any private individual under the said Act; and that if any wrong has been done, or any breach of duty required by the said Act, such wrong or breach is a public wrong, and can only be remedied at the suit of the Governor or Attorney General, or some officer of the Executive Department.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>2. Because no demand has ever been made upon the Comptroller General to give notice to the County Auditors of each County of the annual tax of three mills on the dollar on the assessed value of all taxable property in the State for the redemption of the said Treasury Certificates, (styled Revenue Bond Scrip,) held by the petitioners, and to levy and collect, and cause to be levied and collected, the said taxes provided for by the fourth Section of the Act of the General Assembly passed on 2d March, 1872, and recited in the petition filed in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">3.

Because the Act of March 2, 1872, evinces in its various provisions a design to effect what is declared unconstitutional by the State and Federal Constitutions; that all its provisions are connected in subject matter, depending on each other, and operating together for the same purpose, and are illegal and void; that more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>especially the provision which makes the levy and requires the collection of the tax of three mills is intended to give effect to this violation of the Constitution, and is, therefore, unconstitutional and void; and that the said provision does not impose upon this respondent any duty which can be enforced by the judgment of any Court, either by writ of <em>mandamus </em>or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-5\">7. Because, in conformity with the Constitution of the State, (Article II, Section 30,) this respondent has taken his oath of office, by which he has sworn to support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of South Carolina, and he cannot be required to levy or collect a tax, or perforin any other act in furtherance of objects inconsistent with either of said Constitutions, or with this respondent\u2019s oath of office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">8.

Because, even should the said proceedings terminate in declaring the provisions of the said Act to be legal, it will become a financial question at what time to levy and collect the tax set forth in the said Act, the solution of which belongs to the discretion of the Executive Department of the Government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-9\">To the above return the relators filed a reply as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-10\">I. These relators, replying to the first cause set forth in the return of the respondent herein, say :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-11\">That by the fourth Section of the said Act of March 2, 1872, it is expressly enacted that \u201c to provide for the redemption of said Revenue Bond Scrip, an annual tax of three mills on the dollar, in addition to all other taxes, on the assessed value of all taxable property in the State, is hereby levied, to be collected in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>manner, and at the same time, as may be provided by law for the levy and collection of the regular annual taxes of the State;\u201d that this provision of the said Act imposes upon the Comptroller General the duty of giving notice to the County Auditors of the required tax, in the same manner and at the same time with the other annual taxes levied by the State, to wit, on or before the fifteenth day of November in each year; and that the said tax must be levied and collected prior to the expiration of one year from the date of the said scrip, in order to enable the State Treasurer, as required by said Act, to retire one-fourth of the amount thereof; that upon the neglect or refusal of the Comptroller General to give said notice, any holder and owner of said scrip is entitled to demand the aid of this Court to enforce said duty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-4\">That the said neglect or refusal is a public wrong, in the sense only that it is a neglect and violation of duty by a public officer, of evil example to the community; but that, as a legal or pecuniary wrong, it affects only the rights of such as are owners and holders of the said scrip, and that they are entitled to seek redress for their private wrongs, growing out of the neglect and violation of duty by a public officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">II. And for reply to the second cause set, forth in said return, these relators say: That it is not required by law that these relators should have demanded from the respondent a performance of his duty as a public officer, to wit: the giving notice to the County Auditors of the said tax to redeem the said scrip, because, as a public officer, he is charged by law, and by his oath of office, with the performance of that duty, and no private individual is required to demand of a public officer the performance of a duty plainly enjoined by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">III. And for reply to the third cause set forth in said return, these relators say:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-9\">1. That in said third cause respondent alleges that \" the General Assembly was induced to enact the Act of March 2, 1872, by the representation of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company; that the conditions required by the Act of 15th September, 1868, entitled \u2018 An Act to authorize additional aid to the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, in South Carolina,\u2019\u201d had been complied with, and that this representation was not true. To this the relators reply that they are ignorant if any such representations were made, but they deny, as matter of law, that it is of any consequence whether such allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>tion be true or not, because, among other reasons, as matter of law, the said condition of the Act of September 15, 1868, had been, by a subsequent Act, anterior to the Act of March 2,1872, repealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">2. That, in said third cause, respondent alleges that \u201cthe General Assembly was induced to enact the Act of March 2, 1872, by the representation of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, that * * * the State of South Carolina had become liable to pay the bonds of the said Blue Ridge Railroad Company, authorized by said Act,\u201d and that this representation was not true. To this the relators reply that they are ignorant if any such representations were made; but, if such representations were made, they deny that such allegation is material to the issue here made, because the consideration for the issue of said Revenue Bond Scrip, fully set forth in the Act of March 2, 1872, together with the admitted liability of the State, is recited as follows: \u201c Whereas the State of South Carolina, &amp;c.; has endorsed a guarantee of the faith and credit of the State on four million of dollars of bonds, issued by the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, * * * which bonds are liable for the debts of the said railroad company; and whereas the present condition of the finances of the State, and of said company, is such as to make the further continuance of said bonds on the market inexpedient and unadvisable, and a serious injury and prejudice to the credit of the State ; and whereas the existence of the said four million of dollars of bonds so guaranteed create, a large liability on the part of the State, which the Treasurer may be required to meet at unforeseen and inopportune times; and whereas the liability of the State on account of such guarantee should be faithfully met and discharged; therefore, in order to secure the recovery and destruction of the bonds and coupons of the said company, issued under and in pursuance of the aforesaid Act, now pledged in the city of New York and elsewhere, and to relieve the State of all liabilities whatever, by reason of its endorsement and guarantee of said bonds,\u201d thus shewing that the consideration was the recovery and destruction of said bonds, and the relief of the State from the alleged and admitted liability therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">And the relators further say that this consideration was fully and completely received by the State in the return into the Treasury thereof of three million three hundred and ninety-four thousand of the said guaranteed bonds by the said Blue Ridge Railroad Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>pany, which said bonds have been cancelled and destroyed by the State authorities, in pursuance of the said Act of March 2, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">And this consideration the relators have fully stated in their petition, and the respondent has not and does not venture to deny it, which failure to deny is an admission of the truth thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\">And the relators further say that they do not deny, but admit, notice of the consideration on which said scrip was authorized and issued, and they have already shewn that the respondent, by his 'failure to deny their statement, that the consideration has been received by the State, is in law a full admission that the consideration had not failed, and he is bound thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-7\">And, further, that upon the issue of the bonds, for the recovery and destruction of which the said Revenue Bond Scrip was issued, a preliminary injunction against the endorsement of said bonds was sought and obtained, but upon full hearing before Hon. S. W. Melton, Judge of the Fifth Judicial Circuit, the said injunction was dissolved, and the additional security of a judicial decision was thus given to- the Act of the Legislature, and the highest sanction to the bonds, the delivery of which to the State makes the consideration of the present scrip.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-8\">The relators are not aware that the respondent is the chief fiscal officer of the State, and even if his office has assumed such extraordinary precedence, they are not aware of what duty of his office requires him to interpose his own construction of an Act of the Legislature between the recognized liability of the State and the payment of its creditors, thus driving those who trusted its pledges to the expense and delay of a costly and dilatory suit, and endangering the credit of the State itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-9\">IV. And for reply to the fourth cause, set forth in said return, these relators say:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-10\">That the said Act of March 2, 1872, is not unconstitutional nor void by reason of anything set forth or alleged in said fourth cause in said return contained, but that, on the contrary, the said scrip is issued under the express authority conferred by the Constitution of the State upon the General Assembly. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-11\">V. And for reply to the fifth cause set forth in said return, these relators say:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-12\">That the said Act of March 2, 1872, is not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, which ordains that \u201c no State shall emit bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>VI. And for reply to the sixth cause set forth in said return, these relators say:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">That the said Act of March 2, 1872, evinces no design to effect what is declared unconstitutional by the State or Federal authorities ; that the levy of the said tax of three mills was designed in good faith to protect the rights of those who should become, like these relators, the owners and holders of said scrip, and that whether said scrip be lawful or not, or whether said scrip be receivable for taxes or not, cannot affect the right of these relators, who are owners and holders thereof for good and valuable consideration, to claim its redemption in accordance with the said fourth Section of the Act of March 2, 1872; but that, on the contrary, the said fourth Section imposes upon this respondent the duty of levying the said tax of three mills, irrespective of the question of the validity, or legality, or constitutionality of the said scrip, in respect to its issue, its original purposes, its receivability for taxes, or its re-issue in payment of dues from the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\">VII. And for reply to the seventh cause set forth in said return, these relators say:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">That these relators do not seek to require or compel the performance by this respondent of any act inconsistent with either the Constitution of this State or of the United States, nor in conflict with his oath of office as Comptroller General, but that, on the contrary, they seek only to compel the performance of a duty which, by his said oath of office, he is required to perform.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-8\">VIII. And for reply to the eighth cause set forth in said return, these relators say:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-9\">That this respondent cannot, in law, be excused from the performance of his duty in this behalf, because, by his wrongful neglect and refusal to perform his duty, the annual taxes had been levied previorrs to the service of the rule herein ; that such an excuse, if allowed, would put the rights of these relators at the constant mercy of this respondent, since it could never be charged that he was neglecting his duty in these premises until he had suffered the time to pass by when the regular annual taxes of the State are levied; that if this Court shall award the relief herein sought, the respondent can, without delay or legal impediment, proceed to give the proper notice of said tax, and cause'the sarde to be duly collected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-10\">IX. And for reply to the ninth cause set forth in said return, these relators say:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>That it is not unlawful for the respondent to levy the said tax because of any thing set forth in said ninth cause in said return ; that said proceedings therein referred to, by which the said scrip has been declared null and void, do not have for their object to prevent the levy of the tax demanded by these relators, and that no decision can be rendered in said proceedings which will reach the subject-matter or object which the petition herein of these relators embraces.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">X. And for reply to the tenth 'cause set forth in said return, these relators say:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">That the right of these relators to demand the levy of the said tax is a right which depends upon the legal meaning and effect of the language used in the said fourth Section of the said Act of March 2d, 1872; that if it shall be adjudged that the said Section requires this respondent to levy the said tax, it will then become his legal duty to levy said tax without reference to the financial views of this respondent or \u00a1of any State officers, and without the exercise of any discretion on his or their part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">To the reply the respondent filed a rejoinder as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">The respondent, by way of rejoinder, to the reply of the relators, says that, by reason of anything in said reply stated, the said writ of <em>mandamus </em>should not be granted, because, he says :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-9\">1. That, as to the first ground taken in the return of this respondent, the allegations therein contained are sufficient in law to maintain the position of the respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-10\">2. That, as to the second ground taken in the return of this respondent, the allegations therein contained are sufficient in law to maintain the position of this respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-11\">3. As to so much of the reply of the relators as is in answer to this respondent\u2019s averment of the consideration for the issue, by the State, of the said Revenue Bond Scrip, this respondent rejoins that the consideration, as stated in the said reply, and in the recital made therein, is not truly stated; and that the consideration was the alleged fact that the State had become and was liable to pay the bonds that had been issued by the Blue Ridge Railroad Com. pany, when, in truth, no such fact existed, and no such liability had been incurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-12\">4. As to the fourth ground, this respondent avers the said Act to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>be repugnant to the Constitution of this State, and, therefore, unconstitutional, null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">5. As to the fifth ground, this respondent avers the said Act to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\">6. As to the sixth ground,' this respondent avers that the Act of March 2, 1872, does evince the design set forth in the return, and that all the provisions, thereof are unconstitutional, null and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-7\">7. As to the seventh clause of the reply, this respondent rejoins : That the act sought to be performed is inconsistent with the Constitution of this State, and with that of the United States; is in conflict with respondent\u2019s oath of office, and is not a duty which he can be required to perform.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-8\">8. This respondent denies that, by reason of any thing set forth in the eighth ground of the reply, he can be required to proceed to give notice of said tax, and ca\u00fcse the same to be collected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-9\">9. This respondent insists tha,t nothing set forth in the ninth ground of the reply is a sufficient answer to the cause shewn in the ninth ground of his return.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-10\">10. This respondent insists that nothing set forth in the relators\u2019 tenth ground of reply is a sufficient answer to the cause shown in the tenth ground of his return.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-11\">On which said several matters and things this respondent prays judgment of this honorable Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-12\"><em>Memminger, </em>with whom was <em>Pope &amp; Haskell, </em>for respondent:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-13\">I.This rule must be discharged, for the following reasons :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-14\">1. Because there is a subsisting judgment declaring these certificates, and the Act which authorized them, unconstitutional, null and void; and, until that judgment be reversed, no Court in the State can lawfully enforce their payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-15\">2. Because the relators have no present standing in Court to ask the issuing of a writ of <em>mandamus.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-16\">3. Because there is no demand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-17\">Demand is absolutely necessary, and a refusal or something equivalent, (Tapping, 84;) and at page 283 it is laid down that both demand and refusal must be shown by the affidavits in support of the <em>application. </em>\u2014 King vs. <em>Navigation Co., </em>-30 E. C. L., 81; <em>King </em>vs. <em>Leicester, </em>10 E. C. L., 466.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>4. Because, under the Constitution, but one annual collection of taxes can be had, and the arrangements for the present year were completed before the commencement of these proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\">5. Because there was no default in the Comptroller in not including this tax, as the injunction prevented any dealing with the scrip ; and it is now a question of sound discretion whether, under such circumstances, any levy should be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">In support of the first and second of the above reasons, the following authorities are cited:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-7\"><em>The King </em>vs. <em>Bishop of Chester, </em>1 Term R., 404. A <em>mandamus </em>is intended to give execution to a legal right where the legal remedy is inadequate. A legal right is the first essential foundation for the writ.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-8\">In <em>The King </em>vs. <em>Archbishop of Canterbury, 8 </em>East., 219, Lord Ellenborough, C. J., says: \u201cThere ought, in all cases, to be a specific legal right, as well as the want of a specific legal remedy, in order to found an application for a <em>mandamus.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-9\">In <em>The King </em>vs. <em>Commissioners of Excise, </em>2 Term R., 465, the Court say an application for <em>mandamus </em>is addressed to the discretion of the Court. It is a prerogative writ, and not a writ of right, therefore the Court ought not to grant it, unless they see that the official (against whom it is asked) has <em>done wrong.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-10\">Tapping, Mand., 15, 19. The object of the writ is to prevent a failure of justice. A strong political necessity for.it must exist.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-11\">The relators in this ease have nothing to do with the collection of the tax. Their scrip may never have any claim upon the tax. For, either it may all come into thfe treasury in payment of taxes, and it may never be paid out again, and no wrong could then be suffered by the holders, neither does it follow that this particular scrip would be the first to be retired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-12\">No default is committed by the State, or injury suffered by the holders, until a refusal to retire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-13\">All the Pennsylvania cases cited on the other side are cases of past due liabilities, which the holders were entitled to have paid from the moneys which the <em>mandamus </em>ordered to be collected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-14\">In those cases there was a specific legal right, while in this tax there is no specific right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-15\">The tax was intended to construct a sinking fund to give credit to the new currency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-16\">These considerations would compel the Court to discharge this particular rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>But as we desire to have the Court decide the case on grounds so broad as to secure the best interest of the State, and also to prevent future litigation, we submit the following more extended views:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-5\">We submit, then:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-6\">1. That these certificates are illegal, being issued in violation of the State and Federal Constitutions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-7\">2. That, being thus illegal, no obligation exists to pay them, and no Court can assist to enforce their payment, and a tax on the citizen, for the purpose of paying them, is illegal and cannot be collected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-8\">3. That the certificates are in the nature of contracts \u2014 that, as such, they must be sustained by a legal and sufficient consideration \u2014 that the failure of the consideration, or a false representation of such consideration, vitiates the contracts as between the original parties and all subsequent parties with notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-9\">1.Is the issue of these certificates forbidden by the Constitution of the United States ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-10\">For the argument on this point I refer to the opinion of Mr. J. Willard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-11\">The features impressed on these certificates, which distinctly bring them within the meaning of the Constitution, are :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-12\">1. The form which they take. They are to be of all denominations, and to be steel-plate engravings, which have been made of the size and form convenient for circulation \u2014 in fact, just like bank notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-13\">2. They are given currency by being receivable from any one for taxes or dues at the treasury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-14\">3. May pass to any holder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-15\">4. They are not extinguished by being delivered in at the treasury, but remain with the Treasurer as money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-16\">5. They may be re-issued, and probably will furnish the only means of payment at the treasury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-17\">They, therefore, clearly come within the description given by the decided cases of what is meant by bills of credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-18\">Moreover, they produce the evils against which-the Constitution intended to protect the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-19\">Being not redeemable in coin or in United States currency, they must necessarily constitute a debased currency, but with value sufficient to cause a circulation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>They will, therefore, inflict upon the country the evils of a depreciated currency similar to the Continental and State Bills during the 'revolutionary war \u2014 the assignats in Prance, and the late Confederate currency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-5\">Their volume is so large that it must disturb values, and thereby affect all the relations of the country, the whole amount being more than is required for the entire circulating medium of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-6\">The public creditors and all salaried officers will necessarily suffer greatly, as those certificates will absorb the entire treasury, and the Treasurer will have nothing else to pay with. The necessities of officers will compel them to receive payment in this scrip, and to submit to the loss arising from their depreciation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-7\">It is obvious that it -was to prevent such consequences that this clause of the Constitution was ordained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-8\">But this issue is also a violation of the State Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-9\">This position, according to arrangement of counsel, has been referred to Messrs. Pope <em>&amp; </em>Haskell for argument, and I refer to their elaborate and well considered arguments for the points and authorities in detail. I shall merely submit a condensed summary of the whole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-10\">I. The sovereignty of the State does not reside in either of the three departments among which its powers are distributed, but each of them acts in virtue of a delegation of those powers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-11\">This result follows from Article I, Section 41, which ordains that \u201c all powers not therein delegated are reserved to the people.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-12\">\u2018\u2018 Inherent \u201d power, therefore, can be claimed by none but by the people \u2014 all other claimants must show a delegation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-13\">The Legislature, just like the Executive, must show the delegation of proper powers before they can exercise them; and where the delegation is attended by a direction as to the mode of exercise, the same effect will follow as in other cases of delegated authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-14\">The Legislature generally expresses its will in the same form in which it makes laws, and that has led to the mistaken .conception that the power to make laws includes all functions that might be exercised in the same form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-15\">But it is not so. For, a Bill of Pains and Penalties, or what is more familiar to the British Parliament under the name of a Bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>of Attainder, could not be enacted by our Legislature, simply because it is a judicial and not \u00e1 legislative act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-5\">So the erection of public buildings, and the levy of taxes, are not legislative, although generally executed in that form now in this country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-6\">But in many countries these functions are performed by the Executive Department, and it was only after a long struggle that the taxing power was retained by the English Parliament.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-7\">Our State Constitution has not left this matter in doubt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-8\">By Article IX it has settled the whole department of finance, taking it completely out of the general power to make laws, and strictly prescribing the extent of this power and the mode of using it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-9\">The subject naturally divides into two primary classes: supply\u2014 expenditure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-10\">The supply of a government can come from' two sources only\u2014 taxes and loans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-11\">Its expenditures fall into three classes \u2014 ordinary expenses of sustaining the government, extraordinary expenses, and debts already incurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-12\">And, as nations are now constituted, these classes of financial matters must exist at the inception of any government or constitution, and must be dealt with by that constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-13\">How does our State Constitution dispose of them ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-14\">1. As to the means of supply, to wit: Taxes and loans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-15\">The subject of taxes is fixed by Art. IX, Sec. 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-16\">It is confined to property \u00e1nd a poll tax, and is required to be equal on all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-17\">2. It is required to be sufficient for ordinary expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-18\">3. It must be annual, and if one years\u2019 supply prove insufficient, it cannot be called for in the same year, but must be deferred to and included in the next year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-19\">Then, as to the other source of supply, to wit, loans:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-20\">1. Their object must be to \u201cdefray extraordinary expenditures.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-21\">2. The power to make them is limited to two-thirds of the Legislature by yeas and nays.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-22\">3. The form of contract is prescribed. It must be by bonds in certain amounts, with not over twenty years to run, registered and identified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-23\">4. A tax must be levied to pay the annual interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>5. Their final payment or redemption is left to fall into the class of extraordinary expenditures.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-5\">But, at the date of the Constitution there are, as already stated, debts of the State already existing; and these, too, when paid, would fall into the class of extraordinary expenditures.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-6\">But it may and probably would happen that whenever either of these two classes of debts become payable, the Legislature may not be able to do so, and, to meet that condition of things, Section 10 comes .in and permits a substitution of other bonds, scrip, &amp;c., for the other bonds or scrip which now call for redemption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-7\">This exhausts the whole subject, and if the question be asked, can the State incur a new debt ? the answer is that it can, if the Legislature comply with the above requisites.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-8\">1. As to the object, it must be to defray extraordinary expenditures.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-9\">2. It must be voted by two-thirds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-10\">3. It must be in the form of registered bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-11\">4. It must have a tax annexed to pay the annual interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-12\">Apply these requisites to the Revenue Bond Scrip, and not one will be found to have been complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-14\">It necessarily follows that the scrip is void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-15\">It cannot be authorized under the 10th Section, because it is not issued for the redemption of bonds or scrip already out and at maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-16\">This disposes of the whole subject under the State Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-17\">And the result is that the Revenue Bond Scrip is declared illegal both by the Constitution of the United States and of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-18\">2. The next proposition is that, being illegal, no obligation exists upon the State, or any of its citizens, to pay them, and no Court can assist to enforce that payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-19\">In fact, the scrip, being illegal, can furnish no consideration for any action, levy of taxes or judgment of a Court. \u2014 Story Const., \u00a7 159.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-20\">Every contract to do any act forbidden by law is void, and every act is illegal in itself which is expressly forbidden by State or common law, and the distinction between <em>malum in se </em>and <em>mala prohibita, </em>as to this point, no longer exists.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b210-21\">In Serg.

For Congress to have the power, it must be granted; for the States <em>not </em>to have the power, it must be inhibited. Hence the Constitution as it now stands: the power not granted to the one and inhibited to the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"205\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-5\">2. The next question is: What was the character of the thing called a bill of credit, which the framers of the Constitution wished to <em>crush; </em>to emit which they would not <em>grant </em>to Congress andyiro<em>hibited </em>to the States ? Its character was well understood by Chief Justice Marshall, a contemporary of the Convention and of the Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"206\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-6\">When the Courts came to act upon this clause of the Constitution of the United States, two things were necessary: 1. It was necessary to discover the particular thing struck at and to be' <em>crushed. </em>2. Having discovered the thing, it became necessary in apt words to define the thing prohibited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"207\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-7\">Some things were clear: The Constitution did not mean to include bills of exchange, bank bills of State banking corporations which had been long before, and were then, in circulation. All such were bills of credit, undoubtedly, in one <em>sense; </em>but they were not <em>the \u201c </em>bills of credit\u201d embraced within the meaning of the inhibitory words.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"208\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-8\">The history of what was meant had to be resorted to, and the thing itself thus traced and identified. This was first authoritatively done by Chief Justice Marshall in the leading case of <em>Craig </em>vs. <em>Missouri, </em>(4 Peters, 437,) and by Mr. Justice Story, in his dissenting opinion, in the ease of <em>Briscoe </em>vs. <em>the Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, </em>(11 Peters, 332 to 337,) and by Mr. Justice McLean, in the same case, delivering the opinion of the majority of the Court. In this connection, I refer to the case of the <em>State </em>vs. <em>Billis, </em>(2 McCord, 14;) to the history of bills of credit, by Dr. Cooper, in his appendix to the Statutes at Large of South Carolina, (9 voh, p. 766;) and to Judge Story\u2019s Commentaries on the Constitution, (2 voh, \u00a7 1358.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"209\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-9\">But, as we have said, the Court was obliged to <em>define </em>a bill of credit within the meaning of the Constitution. The first authoritative case was by the Supreme Court of the United States in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>case of <em>Craig </em>vs. <em>Missouri, </em>(already referred to.) In that case Chief Justice Marshall defined it to be as follows : \u201c Bills of credit signify a paper medium intended to circulate between individuals and between government and individuals, for the ordinary purposes of society.\u201d The majority of the Court concurred in this definition. Three Justices \u2014 McLean, Thompson and Johnson\u2014 delivered separate opinions, each giving his own views upon a great question ; each endeavoring to give a definition more complete, as will appear by the case; but none of which have ever been adopted as a rule.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"210\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-5\">The leading case of <em>Craig </em>vs. <em>Missouri </em>has never been overruled, although a portion of the definition of Chief Justice Marshall has been somewhat narrowed by subsequent decisions. The chief of these decisions may be found in .the eases of <em>Briscoe </em>vs. <em>The Bank of Kentucky, </em>(11 Peters,) already referred to ; <em>Barrington </em>vs. <em>The State Bank of Alabama, (13 </em>Howard, p. 11;) and in several cases arising in State Courts, generally known as the eases of the Bank of Illinois, the Bank of Arkansas, and the State Bank of South Carolina, already referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"211\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-6\">The points made in all these cases are made not to overrule the reasoning or conclusion reached in the leading ease of <em>Craig </em>vs. <em>Missouri, </em>but are intended at once to confirm the ruling in that case, and to show that the later cases do not come within the principle of the leading case. But the great argument of Judge Story, in his dissenting opinion in the case of <em>Briscoe </em>vs. <em>The Bank of Kentucky, </em>in which he says that Chief Justice Marshall, then dead, had agreed with him, seems to overwhelm even the distinction taken in the latter class of cases. But the later cases are law. Let us, therefore, take the case of the Bank of the Commonwealth of Kentucky as our guide; and what are there declared to be bills of credit within the meaning of the Constitution ? 1. They must be bills issued <em>by </em>the State. 2. They must be issued upon the <em>credit </em>of the State. 3. They must be <em>intended </em>to <em>circulate </em>as <em>money.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"212\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-7\">We are willing to rest this argument upon the definition of a bill of credit, recognized by a majority of the Court in the Kentucky case. By that case let us test the Revenue Bond Scrip, issued under the Act of 1872. The <em>name </em>is nothing. The Constitution is dealing with <em>things, </em>not <em>names, </em>as Chief Justice Marshall has well expressed it. 1. Is this bond scrip issued by the State ? I refer to several Sections of the Act of 1872. Is it issued on the <em>credit </em>of the State? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Let the Act of 1872 answer this question. Is it <em>intended </em>to circulate as money ? Again we refer to provisions of the Act of 1872. The <em>intention </em>must be drawn from the words and general provisions of the Act. To these we appeal. As to what is \u201c circulation,\u201d is also a question of construction; and the test is given by Chief Justice Marshall, which has never been departed from, viz: that which passed between \u201cgovernment and individuals, and between individuals ;\u201d and as to what is <em>\u201c money,\u201d </em>I do not know that it is possible to improve upon what has been said in the judgment of Mr. Justice Willard in the case <em>ex relatione </em>Gary. I consider that complete. <em>The form </em>of the bill, its <em>uses, </em>the mode of its being handled, the denominations of the bills, from one dollar upwards, are all there, and distinctly and ably set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"213\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-5\">We have, then, in this case, all the elements present \u2014 the issue, by the State, on the credit of the State, with the <em>intention </em>that it should <em>emulate, </em>and that such circulation should be as <em>money. </em>At this point, it may be useful that the Court should compare the Missouri bill, which is called a \u201ccertificate,\u201d by the Missouri Act, and is set out in Craig\u2019s case, with the bond scrip, which is also called a \u201ccertificate,\u201d by the Act of 1872, a copy of which is in the possession of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"214\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-6\">, 3. The only remaining question under this general division of the argument is: Are these bills absolutely void? To say that they are unconstitutional is simply to say that the bond scrip is void for all purposes. An Act may be <em>void </em>in part under the Constitution, and good in part; but when the thing named in the Act itself has <em>been </em>declared unconstitutional, 3, do not understand how such thing can be separated into parts. The unconstitutionality <em>taints </em>it for all purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"215\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-7\">Mr. Cooley, in his work on Constitutional Limitations, at page 180, says: \u201c When a Statute is adjudged unconstitutional, it is as if it had never been.\u201d When the bond scrip itself is declared to be unconstitutional, it is the same as if it had never been. The case of <em>Craig </em>vs. <em>Missouri </em>is full to the same point; the \u201c certificate\u201d in that case was adjudged unconstitutional, and the bills, together with the contract founded upon them, were utterly set aside as unlawful; and the contract itself was declared to be a void contract. Mr. Sedgwick, in his work on the construction of Statutes and the Constitution, is full to the same point. I refer, also, generally, to the New York cases, cited and commented upon by the counsel who preceded me, (Mr. Haskell.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"216\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>In the petition, and in the argument, we have the words \u201c State \u201d and the \u201c contract of the State,\u201d &amp;c., used and repeated as if the \u201cState\u201d and the \u201cLegislature\u201d were, in fact, the same thing; whereas the very point we make is that the \u201c Legislature \u201d is <em>not </em>the \u201cState;\u201d and that the \u201cState\u201d cannot be bound by an unconstitutional Act of the \u201c Legislature.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"217\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-5\">If the Act be unconstitutional, it is <em>no law; </em>and that which is no law cannot bind the State, nor can it support any contract. But strangely enough it has been seriously argued that the bond scrip may be unconstitutional, and yet that it may be good as a <em>contract, </em>and as such it should be received for taxes, because the State may direct in what the public dues may be paid. Direct <em>what </em>to be received? That which has no.existence? We have heard the case of <em>Woodruff </em>vs. <em>Trapnell, </em>(10 Howard, 308,) given as authority. It is true, in that case it was held that the bills of a certain corporation (bank bills) should be received for the taxes of the State, according to a previous Act of the Legislature; but it was first held that these bills were unconstitutional; that this being so, the Act was a <em>contract, </em>and that the subsequent Act repealing the provisions of the first Act was unconstitutional. A reference to the case will show that it is an authority in our favor on this point; and very much in our favor on another point hereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"218\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-6\">II. Our next proposition is that the Act of 1872 (called the Bond Scrip Act) is in violation of the Constitution of the State of South Carolina.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-7\">1. This aspect of the case has been very fully presented (by Mr. Haskell;) but as it is so important, we shall enter upon it again.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-8\">To understand how this constitutional argument applies, it will be necessary to discuss, as a preliminary, some of the principles of the State Constitution of 1868.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"221\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-9\">One of the chief of these is that the Legislature is a body possessed of limited powers, well marked out by the Constitution itself. It is not a British Parliament, nor is it a Legislature sitting under the Constitution of 1790.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"222\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-10\">We refer to Article I, Section 41, of the State Constitution. These are the words: \u201cThe-enumeration of rights in this Constitution shall not be construed to impair or deny others retained by the people, and all powers not herein delegated remain with the people.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"223\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-11\">Whatever may be the construction of the word \u201c delegated,\u201d as a general restriction upon legislative powers, we know that the Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>lature, under the Constitution of <em>1868, is </em>most particularly limited and circumscribed in its power to contract debt, levy taxes, or bind the State. Its power here runs within narrow limits. It can no more go beyond those powers as marked out to it than a Court can ,go beyond its jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"224\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-5\">Now, what are these powers ? How have they been limited ? beyond which limitations the Legislature may not go ? What powers of taxation ? What powers to contract debt ? What powers to issue evidences of debt? I refer generally to Article IX of the State Constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"225\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-6\">In discussing these questions, the Court will find these powers narrowly defined. They are first divided by the Constitution into two general classes: \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"226\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-7\">1. The power to provide for ordinary expenses: Art. IX of the State Constitution, Secs. 3 and 4.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"227\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-8\">2. The power to provide for extraordinary expenses : Art. IX of the same Constitution, Sec. 7.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"228\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-9\">These embrace everything that could be necessary as a mere grant of power. All expenditures must be either ordinary or extraordinary. But underlying these are two other classes of power necessary to carry out the first two :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"229\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-10\">1. The power to levy taxes for ordinary expenses and such deficits as may occur.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"230\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-11\">2. The power to borrow money to defray extraordinary expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"231\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-12\">These exhaust all of the powers, primary and secondary, under the 9th Article of the Constitution of the State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-14\">But how shall these powers be exercised ? The Constitution does not seem to have contemplated any great danger from taxation as such. The vote of the constituency was supposed to furnish a sufficient check upon the Legislature. Taxation is, therefore, limited in two respects only: 1. There thall be an estimate of the expenses, and the tax should be levied only to meet such expenses. 2. The tax shall be laid for a single object; that object shall be expressed in the Act, and the tax shall be applied to the object named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"233\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8V\">But when the Constitution is dealing with the power to borrow money, then it puts limitation upon limitation. Great danger was apprehended here, and with reason.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"234\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-17\">1.

This is pointed out in the 10th Section of the same Article, where two things are provided <em>for :</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"240\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-8\">1. The old debts of the State, due before the adoption of the Constitution of 1868. 2. The debts expressly authorized in that Constitution, then under consideration. For the first, scrip may be issued to redeem them; and for the second, scrip also, when the debts created and in the shape of bonds, according to the Constitution, shall become due. If the State finds itself, at the day, not in funds to pay the bonds, and if the holders of the due bonds will not take <em>new </em>bonds issued as for a <em>new </em>debt, to replace the due bonds, then scrip may issue <em>to </em>redeem such due bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"241\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-9\">In no other way can South Carolina now contract a debt, and no scrip can be issued except to redeem such a constitutionally <em>created </em>debt by bond. The 9th Article of the Constitution is intended to lead to this very result, viz: To make it difficult for the Legislature to involve the State in debt. Give us this ninth Article of the Constitution of South Carolina in its purity, and we could ask no more. It is absolutely perfect, if enforced, to prevent extravagance and fraud.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"242\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-10\">Now, was the bond scrip ever a <em>bond </em>created under the limitations of the 7th and 14th Sections of the 9th Article of the Constitution ? This will not be even pretended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"243\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-11\">Having shown how only a debt can be created, our next duty is to show that no such debt ever existed; and more than that, no debt of any kind ever existed ; and more than that, no liability ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>existed; and more than that, no <em>contingent </em>liability ever existed on the part of the State. We propose to show that there never was a debt due by the State, at any time, upon which to bottom this Revenue Bond Scrip, <em>authorized </em>(as it is said) by the Act of 7th March, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"244\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-5\">This involves some reference to the legislation touching the Blue Ridge Railroad:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"245\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-6\">1. We will commence with the Act of 1868. <em>(Vide </em>Act of that year, 15th September, page 25, Sections 1, 2 and 4.) That Act contained an express condition that the guaranty by the State of the bonds, and the bonds themselves, should be issued only in case the Congress of the United States or private capitalists should let the road have $3,000,000 for $3,000,000 worth of bonds, or a less sum at the same rate; in other words, every dollar of bonds was to secure and bring in a dollar of money. ( <em>Vide </em>the proviso in the Act.) This was a public Act, and this condition went out with the bonds. Trapnel\u2019s case is authority on this point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"246\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-7\">This Act, we say, created no debt by the State. There was not even a contingent liability until dollar for dollar was realized upon the bonds. Even then there would be no \u201c <em>debt \u201d </em>of the State; and, for the first time, the transaction would assume the shape of conditional liability. The Legislature did not regard the Act of 1868 as creating any debt, because they provided no tax to meet the interest, as they were compelled to do, if the Act created a debt. <em>(Vide </em>Section 7, Article IS, Constitution 1868.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"247\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-8\">The bonds were prepared, and the State endorsed them. They were useless. The State was a guarantor upon condition. The company could not get one dollar of money for one dollar of bonds. With this condition unperformed, the State could at any time have withdrawn its conditional accommodation guaranty. When, therefore, the Act of 1872 was proposed to the Legislature, the only place in which these bonds could lawfully and honestly have been was under lock and key, in the iron safe of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company. To hypothecate them, even, would be <em>a fraud </em>upon the State, and an unlawful use of her guaranty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"248\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-9\">But it is said that the State has repealed this important condition, found in the Act of 1868. When, where, and how ? We are re. ferred to the 6th Section of the Act of 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"249\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-10\">Now, does this 6th Section repeal the \u201c express proviso \u201d of the Act of 1868? We answer, no \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"250\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>1. Because the 6th Section of the Act of 1871 is in direct violation of the 20th Section of Article II of the Constitution of 1868, viz : \u201c Every Act or Resolution having the force of law shall relate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in the title.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"251\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-5\">'2. Because all of the provisions of the Act of 1871 are made to depend upon the consolidation of the Greenville and Columbia Railroad and the Blue Ridge Railroad into one road, with a new corporate name, which has not been done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"252\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">3. Because the consolidated road is required to endorse the bonds of the two old roads, respectively, which it is admitted has not been done. \u2014 ( <em>Vide </em>See. 7, Act of 1871.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"253\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\">4. Because the Act of 1871 was but a charter conferred or offered by one contracting party and not accepted by the other, which rendered the whole Act inoperative and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"254\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-8\">This last ground appears upon my notes of argument as a most important point, but by some means it escaped me while actually addressing the Court, and as it was most ably used by my friend (Mr. Memminger) in his concluding argument,-I shall add nothing further upon that point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"255\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-9\">The third ground above stated will fully appear by the words of the Section of the Act referred to, and need not be enlarged upon in these notes required by the Court. The line of argument can, I doubt not, be readily recalled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"256\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-10\">The second ground was elaborated in the ai\u2019gument before the Court very much, in reply to the views suggested by the counsel who opened the argument, (Mr. Chamberlain.) The words of the Act furnish the key to the reply. They can mean but one thing. The whole Act does but set out the terms of a contract. The consolidation was to be the consideration of the roads. With the nonperformance of that consideration the contract fell, and the whole Act became a nullity. If, therefore, the 6th Section of the Act of \u201971 had, in law, repealed the previous condition in the Act of \u201968, still the Act of '71 enacted a new condition, to wit: consolidation, -which condition precedent has never been complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"257\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-11\">The first ground turns upon the construction of the words of the Constitution as cited. The same words appear in the Constitutions of many of the States; and in the Constitution of the State of New York are found the same words, except that in that State they are confined to local or private bills. The words have received judicial interpretation. The two leading principles of these cases \u00e1re : 1. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>That the construction must be rigid and precise, to give them the value intended by the framers of the Constitution. 2. That words cannot be interpolated, but effect must be given to the clause as framed in the instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"258\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-5\">The construction contended for by us is fortified by the following authorities, all agreeing, except one authority from California, which I have not been able to examine: <em>The People </em>vs. <em>MoCann, </em>(N. Y.;) <em>The Town of Fishkill </em>vs. <em>The Fislilcill and Beehman Planh Road Company, </em>(a leading case in New York, decided in 1856;) <em>Smith </em>vs. <em>The Mayor of New Yorh, </em>(decided in 1868,) 34 Howard, P. R., 508; <em>Williams </em>vs. <em>The People, </em>24 N. Y., 405; <em>The Mayor of New York </em>vs. <em>Colgate, </em>2 Kernan, 146; <em>The Sun Mutual Insurance Company </em>vs. <em>The Mayor of New Yorh. </em>I refer also to 4 Hill, N. Y. R., 418, for its general reasoning. The Court may also be aided by the case of <em>Baldwin </em>vs. <em>The Mayor of New Yorh, </em>in 1864, by the Supreme Court of that State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"259\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-6\">In conclusion, we come to the most extraordinary argument of all, viz: That, under the Act of 1872, this Court may hold the bond scrip to be unconstitutional, and yet compel the Comptroller, by a <em>mandamus, </em>to levy the tax to redeem it. Under any law, to levy a tax to redeem that which does not exist would be an absurdity. But with one hand to strike the object out of the Act, and with the other to enforce that which has no meaning without the object, seems to be more absurd, if possible. The 4th Section of the IXth Article of the State Constitution, apart from general reasoning, sets that matter at rest. It directs that any Act laying a tax shall state the object of the tax, and that it shall contain no other object; that the tax levied shall be applied to that object, and to no other object. And yet it is gravely asked to strike the bond scrip (the only object) out of the Act of 1872, and still to levy the tax. The preamble to the Act (which is no part of the Act) we have shown to be false in fact and wholly unfounded in law. This Court cannot be deceived by false recitals, introduced to cover public robbery by the forms of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"260\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-7\">Other points of the argument will be discussed by counsel who are to follow me.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"261\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-8\">Mr. Haskell\u2019s argument:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"262\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-9\">We have agreed rather to divide the argument, so that I shall devote most of my attention to the Act of 1872, page 79, with reference to the Constitution of the State of South Carolina.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"263\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>1.

It is admitted that the said bonds had not yet become due; and it has not been contended that a guarantee of a bond not yet due can be other than a mere contingent liability \u2014 not yet a debt. It cannot therefore be called \u201cevidence of indebtedness.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"295\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">The statement of the facts is very simple, and yet startling. The Legislature has directed the Comptroller General to endorse, in the name of the State, $4,000,000 bonds of the B. R. R. R. Co. This having been done, the Legislature, or the Financial Board, lends to the B. R. R. R. Co. $220,000 in money and take a collateral security, $600,000 of said bonds. The B. R. R. R. Co. holds the balance of the bonds. None of these bonds are yet near due \u2014 the members of the Financial Board or their Agent hold a large part as security for the State loan, and'the State has a lien on the property of the company. The Legislature then, at this stage, proceeds to release the B. R. R. R. Co. from liability for $220,000 ; releases it from the lien held by the State, and pays to the B. R. R. R. Co. $1,800,000 in what these appellants are trying to make as good as money; to be let off from a liability, contingent and remote in any event, and notoriously fictitious under the view taken of it at the time this was Act passed. Those bonds could not be sold; they were worth nothing in the market; and had not been sold by the B. R. R. R. Co.; and if any besides the $600,000 held by the State Financial Board were deposited as collateral, the debt they were used to secure did not exceed $300,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"296\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">These bonds cannot be called a State debt. The certificates cannot be issued except to redeem a standing acknowledgment of indebtedness. None such is shown. And the Act is clearly contrary to the State Constitution, Art. IX, Sec. 10.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"297\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">2.

We have striven to make it apparent to the Court that no debt yet exists against the State on these bonds. The Legislature is not the State, and cannot by its simple assertion cram any debt it pleases on the State. If it designs contracting a debt in the name of the State, that must be done which the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>commands to be done before her faith shall stand pledged. If the State has become liable on the bonds, the Legislature must, under Section 7, Art. IX, raise money to meet this liability ; and that can only be done by compliance with the requirements of Sections 7 and 14 of Art. IX, which it is not pretended has been done in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"299\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\">If the Legislature can, under the Constitution of 1868, lend the name and credit of the State, Section 7, Art.

The terms of this Act, if the Legislature has the right to guarantee any bonds, are more in the spirit of the Constitution ; the leading point in the Act being that the bonds shall not be used until their par value be given in exchange for them.

We submit to the Court that where so many auxiliaries are compiled in one Act to promote one great general purpose set forth in the title, it would be monstrous to allow each, any or all of the said professedly-auxiliary provisions to be executed to a distinct end, while the general purpose, for which they were all enacted, has been entirely neglected, is still so, and has been actually prevented by the very people who procured the passage of the Act, and have availed themselves of its subordinate provisions. Can the Act' of 1868, p. 25, be considered as repealed ? Can the guaranteed bonds be issued except as provided by the Act of 1868 ? And if they cannot, as the Court below has decided, and as we feel strong assurance that this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>will sustain, the bonds are still, in law, in the hands of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, and the State is not liable. We repeat, that the Act of 1870 can only stand as an Act to promote the consolidation of the two railroad companies, and that the privileges, therein declared, cannot be enjoyed until the purpose for which they were promised has been accomplished. For, without such a tie to hold them together, each Section of the said Act would stand forth as an enactment in itself distinct from each of the others; and there would be ten subjects in one Act, or ten distinct Acts, and of them no one could be of force except the one expressed in the title, if such there be.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiS\">The relators, by their petition, seek a writ of <em>mandamus </em>to compel the Comptroller General of the State to levy, and to cause to be levied, the tax for the redemption of the treasury certificates (styled \u201c Revenue Bond Scrip \u201d) held by them, as provided by the fourth Section of the Act of March 2, 1872, (15 Stat., 79,) entitled \u201c An Act to relieve the State of South Carolina of all liability for its guaranty of the bonds of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, by providing for the securing and destruction of the same.\u201d The four first Sections are set out in the petition ; as the fifth has an important bearing on the points made by the return, it may be proper to insert it here. It is in the following words : \u201c That if any such Revenue Bond Scrip is received in the treasury for the payment of taxes, the Treasurer be, and he is hereby, authorized to pay out such Revenue Bond Scrip in satisfaction of any claims against the treasury, except for interest that may be due on the public debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Various causes are alleged in the return of the respondents, of which we propose to confine our consideration but to two. These apply substantially to the merits involved, and are regarded by the Court as objections which must preclude the issuing of the writ. Whether it is to be viewed as a prerogative writ, not demandable of right, or at the present day as an ordinary process in an action between, parties, it will be refused, if it is manifest that it must be \u201c vain and fruitless <em>\u201d </em>or \u201cuseless,\u201d (Tapping, 15.) Nor should it be granted \u201cif it will introduce confusion and disorder,\u201d or \u201c where it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>is manifestly improper,\u201d <em>(Ibid, </em>16.) The eases referred to sustain the propositions, which recommend themselves to adoption by the common sense which is intimated in their very expression. The judgments of Courts are intended to have effect by accomplishing the purposes which are proposed by the remedies through which they are attained. If they cannot have complete operation by not only enforcing the act which they command, but of making it productive of the benefit which they propose, they fail in the very capacity or ability which, to give value to judicial orders, must attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The object of the application is to cause a levy of the tax for the redemption of the treasury certificates (styled Revenue Bond Scrip) held by the petitioners, and if the suit would be unavailing to this end, or its execution introduce confusion or disorder, it should not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The respondent, among the causes enumerated in his return against the motion, submits: \u201cThat, under proceedings duly had in the Courts of this State, the said Act of March 2, 1872, has been declared null and void, and the said certificates mentioned in the petition have been declared illegal, and the various officers of the State, in the treasury department thereof, have been enjoined from receiving or issuing the same; that such proceedings are still pending, and it would have been, and is now, unlawful for this respondent to take the action prayed for in the petition.\u201d To which the relators reply : \u201c That the said proceedings therein referred to, by which the said scrip has been declared null and void, do not have for their object to prevent the levy of the tax demanded by these relators, and that no decision can be rendered in said proceedings which will reach the subject matter or object which the petition herein of these relators embraces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The object of the said proceedings was to enjoin the State and County Treasurers from receiving the said scrip for past due taxes, and for the taxes thereafter to be collected, and from paying out the same, and the Court so accordingly ordered. The judgment, which stands in full force, and, until reversed, should be accepted as the law by which the State and County officers connected with the levy and collection of the taxes must be governed, holds the emission of the scrip void for its repugnance both to the Constitution of the State and that of the United States. It is attempted to avoid the effect of the said judgment by insisting that the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>now made is for a levy of the tax for the redemption of the scrip, thus seeking entirely to ignore so much of the third Section of the Act as makes \u201c the scrip receivable in payment of taxes and all other dues to the State, except special tax levied to pay interest on the public debt,\u201d and the whole of the fifth Section, which authorizes \u201c the payment of the scrip so received for taxes in satisfaction of any claims against the treasury, except for interest that may be due on the public debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">To authorize the collection of the tax for the redemption of the particular portion held by these'relators would be at variance with the mode provided by the Act for the redemption of the Revenue Scrip to the amount of $1,800,000, or such amount as shall be proportioned to the amount of bonds delivered. That contemplated its reception into the treasury for taxes and other debts, and its payment for claims against the treasury, and the aid of its employment in carrying on the State finances for at least four years, for it was not until the end of each year from their date that a fourth part of the certificates was to be retired. It looked to an annual tax for its redemption, thus having regard to the whole amount to be issued, and to the retirement annually of the one-fourth. The retirement of one-fourth <em>per annum </em>might have been effected by the retention of that amount annually in the treasury, if so much should be received in one year. It proposed no preference among the scrip holders, nor was any advantage to any particular class intended. The relators allege in their petition \u201c that, on the surrender of the bonds, the State Treasurer did deliver to the President of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, in South Carolina, Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness (styled Revenue Bond Scrip) to the amount of one million seven hundred and ninety-six thousand eight hundred and twenty-three and fifty-three one-hundreths dollars.\u201d What particular privilege can these relators claim, to have their scrip retired even before the end of the year, and before any opportunity has been afforded to other holders on the same footing with them to come in and participate ? These views apply to the case, made by the relators as against this respondent, entirely unaffected by the judgment of the Court already referred to, declaring the scrip unconstitutional and therefore void. Viewed, however, in connection with that judgment, how can the Comptroller General, a sworn officer of the State, direct the levy of a tax for the redemption of an obligation declared by a Court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>That the Treasurer and not the Comptroller was the party to the cause can make no difference. The judgment acted upon the scrip, which was pronounced \u201c wholly unauthorized, illegal, and without value for any purpose whatever,\u201d and the Treasurers were enjoined \" from receiving it for taxes for any debt or obligation due the State, and from paying it to and for any liability of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">If the scrip wTas illegal, it can furnish do consideration for any action, levy of taxes or judgment of a Court. \u2014 Story on Const., Sec. \u2014. But suppose the Comptroller General had ordered the levy of the tax for the purpose prayed by these relators. While his act might have caused great hardship and suffering to the people by exacting another in addition'to the annual tax, and surely prejudiced the monetary condition of the State, as to these relators, r\u00a1 it would have been but a mere ceremony without avail of benefit to them, for the State and County Treasurers were all parties to the proceeding which declared the scrip illegal and void. In the face of that judgment could the Treasurer have ventured its redemption? Was it not forbidden, if not in express terms, by an implication too plain1 and clear for resistance or even doubt? Was it not to be made through the money which was to be raised by the levy ? The writ is, therefore, claimed, where, in the language of Mr. Tapping, \u201c it would be vain and -fruitless, and without any beneficial effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">But the respondent, not only insisting on the cause heretofore noticed, submits \u201cthat the said Act is null and void, in that it is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, which ordains that \u2018 no State shall emit bills of credit, or make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts.\u2019 \u201d A careful consideration, induced by the large pecuniary interests involved in the question, together with the fact that provisions both of the State and United States Constitutions have been brought into its discussion, has satisfied us that the Act, so far as it authorizes the emission of Eevenue Scrip, is in violation, of the clause of the Constitution of the United States already referred to. The argument which holds it valid as a subsisting obligation, and r\u00e9pels the character of a bill of credit, under which it is classed by the respondent, seems to rest upon the fact that it was not designed to circulate as money. The opinion of Mr. Justice Willard in the <em>State ex rel. Gary </em>vs. <em>Parker, </em>Treasurer, and <em>Dupre </em>vs. <em>County Treasurers, </em>which was brought to our notice in the case before us, and which will be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ported with it, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is so full and comprehensive on the point as to leave little space for addition or enlargement. It is not because the paper circulates from hand to hand in a community like money that it is to be held a bill of credit, nor does the fact of currency so constitute it. A State might well make the coupons attached to its bonds receivable for taxes without subjecting them to the disabilities of bills of credit as used in the Constitution, even although they might readily pass in payment of debts or for the purchase of commodities. The design to create a circulating medium would be wanting. If, however, the intention to create a currency is apparent from the whole scope of the Act, the emission is a bill of credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>within the terms of the Constitution. To the many indications in the Act to show the intended design, which have been pointed out in the opinion of Mr. Justice Willard, it might be added that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Revenue Bond Scrip could never have been intended or proposed as a State security for investment, because it bore no interest, and its value consisted in the fact of its ready capacity and facility in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>supplying all articles necessary for use or consumption. Its capacity for circulation and its easy convertibility, together with its adaptation to immediate and ready use, would cause a demand for it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>which a State bond, although bearing interest, could not command. It is contended that, as this was a provision to meet a debt of the State, the purpose was to furnish a fund for payment and not a circulating medium. But may not the two co exist ? May not the medium of payment be of such a kind and character as to create in itself a circulating currency 7 It is not the end which the assumption is to accomplish, but the mode and manner designed and the use contemplated. The State might issue certificates of indebtedness for the redemption of its bonded debt, but if it did so in the form and manner and design proposed by the Act of March 2, 1872, would they be less obnoxious to the objection urged against the Revenue Bond Scrip, because they were issued to pay or meet a debt? It is not the purpose of the issue which affects the instrument through which it is made, but the characteristics and incidents which attach to it as a provision and recommendation for a circulating medium.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The order dismissing the motion has been already filed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-6\"><em>Willard, </em>A.

That they are to be issued by a State in its sovereign character.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">2d. That they were to contain a pledge of its faith; and</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">3d. That they were intended to circulate as money.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">The first and second propositions are settled in the affirmative by the terms of Section 4, which provides, as we know, for a paper to be issued by the State Treasurer, importing to be an obligation on the part of the State to pay a certain sum of money to the bearer. It will, therefore, be necessary only to inquire whethor it was the intention of the Act that this paper should circulate as money.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">An inquiry of this nature calls into exercise one of the most important and responsible judicial powers incident to a constitutional government. It involves the examination of an Act of the Legislature, with the view of fixing the purpose and intent of the Legislature in the passage of such Act, not merely as a moans of effectuating such purpose and intent of the law-making power by means of the judicial authority, but for the purpose of testing the authority of the law-making power itself in the case, under the supreme law of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">The principles that should govern such an enquiry are well illustrated in the case of <em>Craig </em>vs. Missouri, already referred to, and the mode in which they are there applied to a case remakably similar to the one in hand, marks out very clearly the line of inquiry appropriate to be pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">To fix this meaning of the term \u201cmoney,\u201d it must be taken in the ordinary sense understood by the community in their mutual dealings. A strenuous attempt was made in the case of <em>Craig vs. Missouri, </em>and in <em>Briscoe vs. </em>Bank, to limit the sense of the term \u201c money \u201d as entering into the question of what constitutes a bill of credit to the legal or technical sense of the term, which embraces only the legal coinage of the country, and that which is its legal equivalent, or, in other words, is made legal tender; but that line of argument did not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-16\">The question, properly stated, is whether a particular obligation is what the community regards and deals with as money. The answer to it is that whatever is current in a form convenient to pass from hand to hand and that may bo used to pay debts or purchase commodities is, in this sense, money. It is not essential to such character that tender of payment in such substituted medium should have the force and effect of a legal tender, nor that it should have an actual capacity for paying debts and purchasing commodities equal to that of money possessing intrinsic or legal value. That which passes current as money may be depreciated without losing its character as money, and depreciation necessarily implies a diminished capacity for paying debts and purchasing commodities.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>On the other hand, it is not enough to characterize an obligation as money merely because certain individuals havo found it convenient to use it in place of <em>money </em>in their mutual transactions. There must be a dealing in the medium as money by tho community as such, although the extent to which such dealing by the community is carried is, perhaps, unimportant to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">There are certain characteristics that tend to adapt a paper expressing a promise to pay money or representing money value, to become current in the community as money. It must bo in a form convenient to pass from hand to hand. It must be based either on the credit of a government, a corporation, or an individual, or an association of individuals, or upon a fund pledged or sot apart for its redemption. It must either have undoubted credit, such as arises from its ready convertibility into money value, or it must tend to supply some want, natural or artificial, of the community in which it is intended for circulation. It must be placed upon the community in quantity or volume sufficient to create an adequate interest and motive to secure its'.currency; and, finally, it must have a certain denominational character adjusted to the wants of the community in respect to a circulating medium.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">An examination of the Act in question will disclose a clear intent to clothe the obligations in question with attributes fitting them for general circulation as money. These attributes will be considered in the order just stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">1st. Was it intended that the Revenue Rond Scrip should be issued in a form convenient to pass from hand to hand in ordinary transactions of the community ?</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Section 3 gives to the scrip the form most usual and convenient to serve as paper money, viz: That of the usual bank or treasury note. It is to be printed or engraved on steel in such form and of such denominations as the State Treasurer and tho President of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company shall determine. The object of referring this authority as to form and denomination to the Treasurer and the President of tho railroad company is obvious. The Treasurer is, by the Act, to receive and pay out this scrip from the treasury as money; and the President of the railroad company is to receive the scrip as tho representative of his company, and to realize from its employment, and they are most likely to know what qualities as to form and denomination would have tho tendency to give the greatest currency to'the scrip at the time of its issue. A certain discretion is left with them for such purpose. While the third Section determines what shall bo the substantial character of the scrip, as importing a pledge of the public faith and credit, the form of the instrument, as adapting it in external appearance to the common notion of money, is left with those most concerned with its currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">2nd. It is to be based by the terms of the Act on the credit of the State Government in its sovereign capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">3rd. The Act attempts to confer upon it not only the full credit capable of being conferred by the use of the full faith and credit of the State, but to create an artificial want in the community, tending to give it currency. In the first place, it is made receivable in payment of taxes and all other dues to the State, expect the special tax levied to pay interest on the public debt. (Sec. 3.) Again, it is provided that if any such scrip is received in the Treasury for the payment of taxes, the Treasurer is authorized to pay out the same in satisfaction of any claims against the treasury except interest that may be due on the public debt. (Sec. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">These provisions contain two distinct features. The first is a permissive feature affecting each individual in the community who is a tax-payer, and supplying to him a motive to become a purchaser of the scrip. A more energetic means of creating an interest and motive in the community to deal with the scrip, as money, could not be offered short of making the scrip compulsory payment of all debts as between individuals. The other feature involves the communication to the scrip of the capacity of performing all the functions of money in all dealings between State and individuals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>excepting only the case of the payment of interest on the public debt. This last feature can have no other significance than that of giving currency to the scrip as money.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">It will be observed from the language of the fourth Section, in which the faith and funds of the State are pledged, that such is notin terms that such scrip shall be redeemed by the payment to the bearer on presentation of the amount of money called for by it, but the language is, \u201cthat the faith and funds of the State are hereby pledged for the ultimate redemption of said Revenue Bond Scrip.55</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">It is only ultimate redemption, not payment on demand, that is covered by this pledge. What is meant by ultimate redemption is made clear by the succeeding clauses of that Section. It is provided that a certain tax shall be annually levied for the redemption of the scrip, and it is also provided, that the State Treasurer shall \u201cretire at the end of each year from their date one-fourth of the amount of the treasury scrip hereby authorized to be issued, until all of it shall be retired, and to apply to such purpose exclusively the taxes hereby required to bo levied.\u201d The effect of these provisions is that the holder of the scrip must not look to payment according to the tenor of his scrip, but must sock a market for its circulation undor the influence of the pledge of faith and funds for its ultimate redemption. In other words, an attempt is made to give currency to the issue, notwithstanding the absence of any intention or ability to redeem according to the tenor of the promise by obtaining a credit with the community for the amount of scrip putin circulation on the strength of certain special provisions and a general pledge of the faith and funds of tho Stato for its ultimate redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">4th. Tho quantity or volume of the contemplated issue is such as tended to create a strong motivo and interest in the community to keep the scrip in circulation as money. Tho amount, $1,800,000, as compared with the extent of the commercial transactions of the community on which thatamount was intended to be placed, affords the clearest indication of an intention so to affect tho interest of the community as to secure its circulation as money. It was to be placed at once in private hands as valid obligations on tho part of the State. The various provisions of the Act that looked to a distribution among the people preclude the idea that it was intended that the recipients of this large fund should hold it until redemption, or even that it should be kept together in the hands of a limited number qf holders. On the contrary, it was clearly intended for dispersion, and the magnitude of the interest in the hands of the first receivers of tho scrip was sufficiently large to warrant the assumption that it would become thus diffused throughout the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">5th. As it regards its adaptation in respect of denomination, we have already seen that authority was conferred on those most concerned with its circulation, to adapt the issue in that respect to tho wants of the community. Such a provision shows additional evidence of an intent that the scrip should circulate as money.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Considering the Act in its entire aspect, as well as its integral parts, it is clear that the Legislature intended that the scrip should circulate as money, and that for this reason the provisions of the Act authorizing the issue of scrip are in conflict with the prohibitions of the Constitution of tho United States, as to the emission of bills of credit by States.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">The Act being unconstitutional, it is void so far as it contemplates the issue of Revenue Bond Scrip. Itis unimportant, therefore, to inquire whether the scrip thatwas actually issued was conformable to and authorized by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-12\">The injunction heretofore issued must be continued until the final hearing and determination of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">But it is said that one part of an Act may bo declared unconstitutional, and the other parts constitutional. There can be no question as to this, nor to the consequence that follows, which Mr. Cooley, at page 77 of Ms work on limitations, thus announces: \u201c If, when tho unconstitutional portion is stricken out, that which remains is complete in itself, and capable of being executed wholly independent of that which was rejected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>it must be sustained.\u201d The relators seek to apply it here as sustaining the scrip, \u201c not indeed as a bill of credit, but as a valid obligation of the State, which must be redeemed in the manner fixed by the law, which sets forth the terms and obligations of the contract.\u201d The relators claim a writ of <em>mam damus </em>to require the levy of a tax to pay the Bevenue Bond Scrip which they hold. If it is void, and the respondent cannot, therefore, be required to direct it, for what purpose can he order the levy of the tax, the benefit of which is to inure to them, \u201cnot as holders of a bill of credit, but of a vested obligation of the State ?\u201d The Act provides for the collection of the tax to pay the Bevenue Bond Scrip, and if this is void can the respondent look behind it to the consideration on which it was founded, and provide for that in substitution of the void paper ? Is the ministerial officer to assume legislative functions ?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">It is said that \u201c the most startling of all the various propositions stated in the argument of this case is that which it is urged <em>must </em>be the result of the Act being unconstitutional. It is that, the Act being void, and the scrip thereby void, the State may retain the consideration received for it, and judicially repudiate its payment.\u201d The duties and powers of a Court are of a widely different character from those of the legislative department. The one gives construction to Statutes as they find them, without looking to the effect of their conclusion upon either the State or.individuals, through the application of principles by which they are bound to bo governed. The other is invested with the general power of enacting laws according to their own sense of justice and of policy, provided they are not within the inhibitions of the constitutions of the State and the United States. If they transcend either of these, a duty more delicate than any other which the Judiciary is called upon to perform, devolves upon it the necessity of declaring their action void. It is not within the province of the Court to inquire into the consideration which these relators may have paid for the scrip, to see how far the State may bo bound to compensate them for a loss incurred, as they say, in a contract into which they entered with it on the faith of the Act, which, as they contend, expressed the terms designated by the State itself. We are to decide the case before us. If the issue of the Bevenue Bond Scrip by the Treasurer involves the State in some obligation to the holders, which good faith requires it to meet, the duty rests with the Legislature, not the Courts, to measure its extent and declare the mode in which it shall be fulfilled. \u2022 . ,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
