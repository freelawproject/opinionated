Barber, plaintiffs, against Samuel McAliley, defendant, \u25a0 mentioned in the last preceding case of <em>McAliley </em>vs. <em>Barber.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-12\">By agreement of the parties the facts of that case were regarded as proved in this, and need not be here repeated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-13\">His Honor ruled that the lien of the judgment of Alexander Barber against Henry Macon had not been divested by the sale for partition, and was not affected by the fact that the plaintiffs might have obtained their money from the proceeds of that sale; and he instructed the jury to find a verdict for plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-14\">The defendant excepted to the ruling and instruction, and appealed on the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-15\">1. Because the lien of the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment on the lands of Macon was divested by the proceedings and sale in partition, and attached to the proceeds of said sale, which were under the control of the Court, and amply sufficient to satisfy said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-16\">2. Because the judgment, being a first lien in equity on the moneys in the Court made from the sales of the land under judicial pro- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>' cess, could not be a lien at law on the same land, and the sale thereunder was void.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-5\"><em>Brawley, </em>for appellant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-6\">The lien of a judgment upon land is divested by a judicial sale thereof, and attaches to the proceeds of the sale, which stand in lieu of the land itself, subject to the same legal priorities. Such a lien is not, strictly speaking, <em>jus in re </em>or <em>jus ad rein; </em>it does not give a right of property in the land itself, or a specific claim upon it, but only a general right to be satisfied out of the property of the debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-7\">The plaintiffs in this case can claim no more than that their judgment should be satisfied, and when they stood by and permitted the land to be sold,\u2019 their claim upon the land was gone, and attached to the fund, which is still in Court, and more than sufficient to satisfy their <em>debt. </em>\u2014 Keclcley vs. <em>Moore, </em>2 Strob. Eq., 21; <em>Burris </em>vs. <em>Gooeh, </em>5 Rich., 6; <em>Codwise </em>vs. <em>Gelston, </em>10 John., 508; Story Eq. Juris., \u00a7 553; <em>Garvin </em>vs. <em>Garvin, </em>1 S. C., 62.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-8\">If it be true that plaintiffs have a lien upon the fund in Court arising from the sale of the land, then it is manifestly unjust that they should also have a lien on the land itself, which was sold, with their acquiescence, by order of Court, and bought by an innocent purchaser for valuable consideration. But, admitting that the plaintiffs have a claim upon both, is it not a uniform principle, founded in natural justice, that if a creditor has a lien upon two funds or two parcels of land, he should be compelled to resort to that which can satisfy his claim without detriment to the rights of others, particularly when the relief required is specially pointed out to him, and is certain, prompt and efficient? \u2014 Story Eq., \u00a7 633 <em>et seq.; </em>Foub.

Eq., 19.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b59-9\">Dec. 16, 1872.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AVX\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b59-10\">Willard, A. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7h\">The action was trespass for the recovery of land purchased by the plaintiff under execution upon a judgment recovered against H. Macon, brought against a purchaser of the same land, under a partition between the distributees of H. Macon. The only question presented by the ease is, whether the sale under partition divested the lien of the judgment against the ancestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">The proposition that a title, made under a decree for partition among distributees, does not divest or impair the lien of a judgment against the ancestor of the distributees, must' be regarded as substantially settled by <em>Moore </em>vs. <em>Wright </em>(14 Rich. Eq., 132.) Title under such a decree can have no greater force and effect than that of the distributees out of which it was derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">The title of the distributees being subject to the lien of a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ment against th'eir ancestor, that derived through their partition must beso subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The judgment creditor of the ancestor was not a party to the partition, and therefore could not be bound by the decree. <em>Walton </em>vs. <em>Copeland </em>(7 Johns. Ch., 140,) holds that the judgment creditor would not be a proper party to the partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The second ground of appeal has no application to the case. The issue made by the pleadings, as appears by the brief, is simply as to the legal title to the land. If the defendant had an equity as affecting the plaintiff\u2019s legal right, that was the proper subject of an equitable defense, under the Code, but cannot be considered under a general issue denying the plaintiff\u2019s legal right to the land. In fact, the plaintiff\u2019s case, so far as it involves grounds of equity, was presented in the suit of <em>McAliley </em>vs. <em>Barber, ante, </em>p. 45, and was decided under that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">We are bound to regard the present case as one involving merely the legal rights of the parties as they would be presented in the common law action of trespass to try title. Viewing the case in this light, there was no error in the directions given to the jury, inasmuch as the plaintiff\u2019s verdict was a necessary consequence of an undisputed state of facts, leaving nothing for the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The appeal should be dismissed without prejudice to the defendant in this cause in any course he may be advised as to the fund in Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b60-9\"><em>Moses, </em>C. J., and <em>Wright, </em>A. J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
