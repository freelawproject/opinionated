John Brown, the son of D. W. Brown, drew up the release. Mr. Daniel Brown got his son to draw up this release in pursuance of the bargain which he made with his father. Mr. Daniel Brown proposed this compromise.\u2019\u2019 (The claimant proposed to give in evidence the declaration of D. W. Brown at the time and previous to the execution of the release. Erwin and wife objected to such declaration.) Subject to the objection, the following testimony was taken down : \u201c Witness says that Mr. Daniel W. Brown came to his (witness\u2019) house to see if he could make a compromise, and asked witness what he would take; witness told him he did not know about making a compromise with him, as witness did not know if he would get anything from any of the other parties or not; he (witness) had been told that the estate of Dixon Barnes was insolvent, and witness told Brown so. Mr. Brown told witness that he had come to make a compromise for himself, and that Barnes\u2019 estate should pay, and he (Brown) would see to it. Witness told Brown if that was the case he would make the compromise with him, as an individual, and no further. Wituessand Brown agreed to the sum of two thousand dollars. Witness understood, from the conversation of Mr. Brown, that he meant to say that the estate of Dixon Barnes should pay its part of the liability on the guardianship bond of S. B. Massey, without reference to the compromise with Brown, as an individual. Witness thinks he mentioned at the time the amount due by S. B. Massey, as guardian, to him, about the sum of ten thousand dollars; witness did not know the exact amount.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">On the 27th of September, 1871, the Referee filed his report upon the claim, in which he states his conclusion to be \u201c that the release of D. W. Brown by B. F. Massey operated to discharge also the estate of Barnes, his co-obligor, from liability on the bond, and that the claim cannot be allowed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">To this report the claimant excepted, on the ground that the release of Brown did not operate as a discharge of the co-surety, Barnes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\">The decree of His Honor is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-9\">Thomas, J. On the 27th day of December, 1871, a report was filed in this cause by the Referee on the claims of creditors of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>estate of Colonel Dixon Barnes, deceased, into which was incorporated a special report on the claim of B. F. Massey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\">This claim is for $10,578.98, which appears to have been the balance ascertained to be due him 1st June, 1859, by his guardian, Samuel B. Massey, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">The claim, as appears from the report, has the following for its origin: Col. Barnes became one of the sureties on the guardianship bond of Samuel B. Massey, to the Commissioner in Equity, dated June 19th, 1856. The other sureties were D. W. Brown and one James E. Cureton. The guardian, Massey, and the surety, Cureton, are both dead, and their estates insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">On the reference, the allowance of this claim was resisted by John B. Erwin and his wife, Mary B., who, in right of the latter, are the principal creditors of the estate, and the latter of whom is the only child of Col. Barnes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-7\">The ward, B. F. Massey, attained his majority on the 18th day of December, 1861. On the 23d day of August, 1869, he executed to Brown, the co-surety, a release, under seal, from all liability on the guardianship bond, which was full and unreserved, and contained no allusion to any other of the co-obligors on the bond. The consideration stated is $2,000 paid by Brown. This release was relied upon as operating also a release of the estate of Barnes from liability, and as a bar to the claim. The Referee, regarding it as having this effect, in his report, decided that the claim could not be allowed. To this report, B. F. Massey put in the following exception : \u201c Because the release of B. W. Brown as surety on said bond did not operate as a discharge of the liability of his co-surety, the said D. Barnes.\u201d This exception raises the only question for the consideration of the Court on the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-8\">The doctrine that the release of one of the obligors of a bond is a release of the others is too firmly established to be successfully questioned now. As early as the case of <em>Bower </em>vs. <em>Swadlin, </em>reported in 1 Atkins, 294, Lord Hardwicke speaks of it as settled principle. In that case he used this language: \u201c There is no doubt but a release to one obligor is a release in equity to both, as well as in law.\u201d The same principle was fully recognized in <em>Cheatham </em>vs. <em>Ward,, </em>1 B. and P., 630. This rule has been steadfastly adhered to by the Courts, both English and American, ever <em>since. </em>\u2014 Rowley vs. <em>Stoddard, </em>7 Johns., 207 ; <em>Averill </em>vs. <em>Lyman, </em>18 Pick.; <em>Carmeger </em>vs. <em>Morrison, </em>2 Met., 381, 407; <em>Smith </em>vs. <em>Tunno, </em>1 McC. Ch., 243. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The rule seems to apply to the obligors without regard to their status as principal and surety, and to require that the release shall be under seal. It appears to be distinct from those rules regulating the liability of sureties with reference to the conduct of principal obligor and obligee. Under the latter class the rights of sureties are placed on higher ground than those of mere principal obligors, and are more zealously protected by the Courts. The case of <em>Rees </em>vs. <em>Herrington, </em>2 Ves., Jr., 540, is a leading example of this class. There it was decided that the obligees taking notes from the debtor, extending the time of payment beyond that fixed in the bond, without the consent of the surety, discharged the latter from liability on the bond. The reason upon which Lord Elden based this decision was, that the contract had been varied and the risk of the surety increased. This is, however, to some extent, the reason why the release of one obligor is a release of the others, only in the latter instance the contract is absolutely extinguished.\u2014 <em>VilUn'gs </em>vs. <em>Gonseqne, </em>Pet. C. C., 301. I apprehend that the extension of time to the surety would not discharge the principal; and in this, as well as many other respects, the Courts have interfered for the protection of the rights of sureties, even when those rights have only been jeopardized by the conduct of the principal debtor and obligee. The surety, having paid the debt, has the right to call upon his co-sureties to refund to him their quota of the amount paid, or, even without paying it, to call upon them, where the principal is insolvent, to contribute towards raising a fund sufficient for its pay<em>ment. </em>\u2014 McKenna vs. <em>George, </em>2 Rich. Eq., 15. The release of one of his co-sureties would not only defeat this right, and thus increase his risk, but would so change the contract into which he had entered as to enable him to say, with truth, \u201c <em>In Kmc Fmdera Mon Veni.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">But it was urged in the argument by the counsel of Massey that the consent of Brown to his own release, being the consent of the executor of Barnes, prevented the release from operating to discharge the estate of the latter. It may be well doubted whether, even if Brown had by parol consented to the technical release, <em>i. e. </em>release under seal of one of the other sureties, he could not still have claimed his own discharge from liability on the bond. But his parol consent, as the executor of Barnes, to the release of a co-surety, presents a very different question, and one much less \u2022 involved in doubt. The authorities are clear to the point that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>could not, by his contract, create a charge upon the estate of Barnes unless the estate had been benefited by the contract.\u2014 <em>O\u2019Neall </em>vs. <em>Abney, </em>2 Bail., 317 ; <em>Welsh </em>vs. <em>Davis, </em>Supreme Court decision, MS. Here, if his consent to his own release can be construed into a contract that the estate of Barnes should not be thereby discharged, he has attempted to continue a charge upon the estate, from which, but for his contract, it would, by operation of law, have been released. This, we have seen, the law will not permit. Hone but the parties beneficially entitled to the estate could enter into a contract of the kind which would be binding upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">It is therefore ordered and decreed that the exception be over- \u25a0 ruled and the report confirmed. It is further ordered that B. F. Massey pay the costs arising upon his claim ; and that the remaining costs of the cause, not previously paid, be paid out of the land sales.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-6\">And it is further ordered that the balance of the proceeds of the real estate sales be apportioned and applied toward the satisfaction of the debts still unpaid, in the order of their priority, as established in the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-7\">The claimant appealed on the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-8\">1. Because the release of D. W. Brown as surety on the said bond did not operate as a discharge of the liability of his co-surety, the said D. Barnes, and the Circuit Judge erred in decreeing otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-9\">2. Because said release was an arrangement between co-sureties to bear their proportionate part of the debt, in which Brown acted for the estate of Barnes, he being the only legal representative of said estate, and, as such, had a right to consent that the estate of Barnes should remain bound for its proportionate part, and did so consent and stipulate with the appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-10\">3. Because the release was beneficial to the estate of Barnes by relieving said estate of one-half of a joint liability, and being made with the assent of the executor of Barnes, could not discharge said estate from the whole of said liability.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b98-11\"><em>Kershaw, </em>for appellant:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-12\">This case resolves itself into two points\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-13\">First.

The party has a right to say for himself that he will not consider that relation, but will take 6s, though the surety is liable to pay 10. He may say he will be passive as to the other 4s, or he will discharge the whole debt, and at his own risk, as to the remedy against the other surety; or he may reserve his remedy against the co-surety expressly. It depends upon the effect and terms of the bargain actually entered into. * * * * I have a strong opinion that,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-10\">under the circumstances, the other persons liable upon this note are not discharged because Baylis was contented to make a bargain, the effect of which leaves him to his chance as to his ultimate liability between him and his co-surety.\u201d \u2014 Per Ld.

The argument before us, insisting on a contrary doctrine, relies for its support on <em>Ex Parte Gifford, </em>6 Ves., 805, in which Lord Eldon held that the discharge of one surety did not release the other sureties, and although Mr. Justice <em>Story, </em>in note to page 572 of his first volume on Equity Jurisprudence, interposes to defend the distinguished Chancellor from the strictures to which his decision has been subjected, it must be admitted that his conclusion has not been accepted as the ruling authority on the <em>question. </em>\u2014 Nichol-<em>son </em>vs. <em>Revell, </em>6 Nev. &amp; Mann., 192, 200 ; <em>Evans </em>vs. <em>Brembridge, </em>35 Eng. L. &amp; E. R., 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Equity construes a release according to the intention of the parties, and will give it no operation beyond the design or the purpose it was intended to accomplish. The principle is so fully enforced by Chancellor Kent, in <em>Kirby </em>vs. <em>Taylor, </em>6 John. Ch., 242, that any further reference to authority in support of the rule is unnecessary. It is certainly in strict consistency with the doctrine of equity, which always seeks, if possible, to give effect to the intent which induced the Act, if it can be ascertained without a violation of the rules of law. We cannot, however, refrain, because they appear so pertinent to the case before us, from referring, in the language of the Chancellor, to some of the authorities on which he rested his opinion: Lord Hardwieke said, in the case of <em>Cole </em>vs. <em>Gibson, </em>1 Ves., 503, \u201c that it was common in equity to restrain a general release to what was under consideration at the time of giving it.\u201d And, again, in <em>Ramsden </em>vs. <em>Hitton, </em>2 Ves., 304, he observed, \u201c that if a release be given on a particular consideration recited, notwithstanding that the release concludes with general words, yet the law, in order to prevent such surprise, will construe it to relate to the particular matter recited, which was under the contemplation of the parties, and intended to be released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The declarations of D. W. Brown, at the time of the execution of the release, were not offered to explain, vary, or contradict the language of the instrument discharging him. It was not to add conditions or restrictions which would impose on the immediate parties to it, as between themselves, any other obligations than those which it plainly expressed, or in any way to contravene or disturb the contract between them, but they were offered to show that while Brown was not to be held chargeable by Massey for any further amount, as the consideration for the discharge of his lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>bility on the bond, the rights of Massey, as to the other surety, Barnes, were not to be prejudiced by reason of his release. They were to show something extrinsic to, and outside of, the discharge. Viewing the evidence in this light, we do notpreceive any objection to its competency. Giving effect to the release according to the intention of both the parties, and remembering that Brown was the executor of Barnes, we cannot hold it as discharging the estate of which he was the personal representative from liability on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">While we must reverse the judgment of the Court below on the effect of the discharge, another question arises, and should be determined before a final adjudication can be had, and that is, as to the liability of Brown, (conceding the principal and the other surety, Cureton, to be insolvent,) to contribute to the amount which the estate of Barnes may be required to pay for the default of the guardian. In other words, does the compromise of Brown, as between him and the estate he represented at the time, enure also to its benefit, and, if so, to what extent ? As all the parties are before us, it is possible we have authority to decide it; but Brown should be first heard, and we prefer first, therefore, to remit it to the judgment'of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The decree of the Judge below is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Circuit Court for the County of Lancaster, to be heard on the point indicated in this opinion, and such other questions as may further properly arise out of the pleadings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b103-7\"><em>Wright, </em>A.
