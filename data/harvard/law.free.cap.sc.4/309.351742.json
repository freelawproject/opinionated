From this order an appeal is taken to this Court to set it aside, that judgment may be entered for the whole amount due on the said note.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-18\">This Court has held in several cases that neither the Ordinance of the Convention of 1865, nor the Act of the General Assembly entitled \u201cAn Act to determine the value of contracts made in Confederate States notes or their equivalent,\u201d is applicable, or can be applied to any contract, unless it first be shown that such contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>was made with reference to such currency or its <em>equivalent. </em>\u2014 Neely vs. <em>McFadden, </em>2 S.
