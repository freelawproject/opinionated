S. Guignard, father of the plaintiffs, was the owner for life, with remainder to the plaintiffs in fee, of a farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>in Lexington County, west of the Congaree River, and bounded on the east by that river, called Still Hopes. On the 21st day of December, <em>1865, </em>the Legislature passed an Act, which is recited in the opinion of the Court, by which they granted to the defendants a charter for a ferry over the Congaree River, for a term of five years, with a right of way thereto through the said farm. The ferry was established by the defendants, and they used, during the said period of five years, part of said farm as a landing place and-way to their ferry. The father of the plaintiffs died on the 18th February, 1868, and on the 15th day of September, 1868, the Legislature passed another Act, whereby the defendants\u2019 charter was extended for the term of fourteen years. The defendants continued to use the landing place and way over the farm after the said term of five years had expired, and thereupon this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">The judgment of His Honor the Circuit Judge is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-6\">Carpenter, J. This cause was submitted on'the complaint and answer, and was argued by counsel for the plaintiffs and defendants, on an application for a permanent injunction. About the facts there is no dispute. The plaintiffs are the owners in fee of the farm \u201c Still Hopes,\u201d and the pine lands attached thereto, having acquired title thereto as the heirs-at-law of their father, the late James Sanders Guignard, Jr., and the said plaintiffs are now in possession of the said farm and lands, and have been since the death of their father. On the 21st day of December, A. D. 1865, the General Assembly passed an Act entitledAn Act to establish certain roads, bridges and ferries.\u201d By the 7th Section, Acts 1861-1866, p. 353, it was provided, \u201c that a ferry across the Congaree River, at the city of Columbia, is hereby established and vested in William Kinsler, Edward Kinsler and H. 0. Kinsler, their heirs and assigns, for the term of five years, with the same rates of toll allowed to James S. Guignard, at his ferry, and they shall be permitted to have the right of way through the land of the said James S. Guignard, on the western bank of the river.\u201d- Under this Act, the defendants ran their ferry and passed over the lands of the plaintiffs, and have continued to do so until the present time. By an Act of the General Assembly, approved September 15th, 1868, it was provided \u201c that the charter heretofore granted to William Kinsler, Edward^Kinsler and H. 0. Kinsler, to estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>lish a ferry over the Congaree River, near the city of Columbia, be, ana the same is hereby, extended for the term of fourteen years from the expiration of their said charter.\u201d On the 26th day of September, A. D. 1868, the General Assembly enacted that the road leading from the said ferry, (Kinslers\u2019,) on the western side of the Congaree River, to the State Road, be, and the same is hereby declared to be, a public highway. The facts above stated are all that have any bearing upon the case. Whatever may have been the rights of the defendants, under their charter of 1865, I am of the opinion that the Act of the 18th of September, 1868, conferred no authority upon them to use the lands of the plaintiffs for the purpose of their fefry after the expiration of their original charter, nor did the Act of the 26th day of September, 1868, for the reason that the Acts of the General Assembly, so far as they attempt to confer such rights upon the defendants, are in conflict with the Constitution of the State of South Carolina, and are therefore .null and void. By the Declaration of Rights, Article 8, private property shall not be taken or applied for public use, or for the use of corporations, or for private use, without the consent of the owner, or a just compensation therefor. This provision is clear, unequivocal, and mandatory. , The Legislature have no power to pass any law infringing upon this wise prohibition, and hence the attempt to give to the defendants the use of the plaintiffs\u2019 lands for fourteen years is simply void. The defendants have no right to use or occupy the lands in question, and a perpetual injunction must be granted. It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the defendants and their agents and servants, be enjoined and restrained from the further use and occupation of the lands of the plaintiffs described in the pleadings, or any part of said lands in connection with their ferry, or in any other manner or for any other purpose whatsoever. Let copies of this opinion be served upon the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">The defendants appealed on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the way over plaintiffs\u2019 land having been established by the Act of 1865, and being, therefore, an existing public way when the Constitution of 1868 was adopted, neither Section 23 of Art. I of that Constitution nor the Act of September, 1868, to declare the manner by \u25a0which rights of way shall be acquired, has any application to the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-6\"><em>Pope &amp; Haskell, </em>for appellants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>I.

By an Act of the General Assembly, approved December, 1865, two ferries were established across the Congaree River, one \u201c at the site of the old Columbia Ferry,\u201d and \u201c vested in James S. Guignard, his heirs and assigns, for the term of five years.\u201d After the rates of toll are fixed by this Act it says: \u201c And the said James Guignard shall be allowed the right of way to his ferry through the lands of the estate of John O. Kinsler, on the eastern bank of the river wdiere the road now passes : <em>Provided, </em>That the said James S. Guignard shall be required to keep and use a substantial rope for crossing his flats at the place where hispresent main rope is now located: <em>And provided, also, </em>That only one toll shall be exacted for crossing said ferry and recrossing within twenty-four hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Another ferry across the Congaree River was established by the same Act of the General Assembly and \u201cvested in William Kinsler, Edward Kinsler and Henry O. Kinsler, their heirs and assigns, for the term of five years, with the same rates of toll allowed to James S. Guignard at his ferry; and they shall be permitted to have the right of way to their ferry through the lands of the said James S. Guignard, on the western bank of the river: <em>Provided, however, </em>That the said William Kinsler, Edward Kinsler and Henry O. Kinsler shall not be permitted to, land their flats within less than one hundred feet of the main rope now used by the said James S. Guignard as at present located : <em>And provided, further, </em>That only ne toll shall be exacted for crossing said ferry and recrossing within twenty-four hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Here were two ferries, established by the same Act of the General Assembly, one vested in the appellants and the other in the respondents, each, by the Act of the General Assembly, having the right of way over the other\u2019s lands. Hence, it might be very properly inferred that there was a mutual understanding between the said parties that such should be the case. It is conceded by the respondents that the General Assembly, in 1865, had the right to take private property for public use. That' it had that right is fully recognized by the following cases: <em>Stark </em>vs. <em>McGowan, </em>1 N. &amp; McC., p. 387 ; <em>Gourdin </em>vs. <em>Davis, </em>1 Bail., 471. The right of way was established through the land of the respondents, as well as that of the appellants, and that right having been once established by the General Assembly, and acquired, must remain as essential to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>ferries as long as'the General Assembly shall continue them or either of them. If the doctrine contended for by respondents should prevail, then, at the expiration of the time for which the ferry was chartered, the right of way must be acquired and recognized every time the ferry shall be rechartered or the charter extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">By an Act of the General Assembly, approved September 18, 1868, the appellants\u2019 charter was extended for the term of fourteen years from the expiration of the first charter. The appellants having enjoyed the right of way from December, 1865, having acquired that right previous to the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, neither the Constitution of 1868 nor the Act of the General Assembly of September, 1868, entitled \u201can Act to declare the manner by which the lands, or the right of way over the lands, of persons or corporations may be taken for the construction and use of railways and other works of internal improvements,\u201d can be applied to this case, as Section 23 of Article I of the Constitution of 1868, and the Act of Assembly made in pursuance of said Section, .only apply to persons or corporations desiring the right of way where it has not already been obtained and such person or corporation not in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The injunction must be dissolved and the judgment of the Court below reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b346-6\">Moses, C.
