Barber, defendants, for injunction to restrain the defendants from prosecuting an action of trespass to try title brought by them against the plaintiff, and for other relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-15\">The facts of the case, as alleged by the complaint, and admitted by the answer, were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-16\">Henry Macon, Sr., confessed a judgment on January 24th, 1844, to Alexander Barber, for the sum of $344.16; on which there was a payment of $400, of date of October 31st, 1855. He died in the year 1855, possessed of a large personal estate, and of a tract of land situate in Chester County, containing 570 acres. Administration on his estate was granted in January, 1856, to his sons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Benjamin W. Macon and Henry Macon, Jr., who sold the personal estate at public sale in January, 1859, for the sum of $18,148.24.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-5\">Alexander Barber died in 1858, and letters of administration on his estate were granted to 0. Barber and Mrs. Sarah J. Barber in the same year, and by a private arrangement between the heirs of Alexander Barber, the judgment' was transferred to his son, F. H. Barber, immediately after the death of his father. The parties were near neighbors, but this judgment was never presented to the administrators of Macon for payment, though the administrators knew that said judgment was unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-6\">The real estate was sold in December, 1859, under a decree of the Court of Equity, for partition among the heirs-at-law of Macon, on a credit of one, two and three years, with interest \u2014 the purchase money being secured by mortgage and bond, with personal sureties, of whom plaintiff was one. No objection was made to this sale by any of the Barbers, and no notice given of the judgment aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-7\">The purchase money not being paid when due in 1866, a bill was filed to foreclose the mortgage, and under a decree in that case the land was sold in January, 1867, and bought by the plaintiff for the sum of $700, which was paid into the office of the Commissioner of the Court of Equity, and remains in the hands of the Clerk of the Court for Chester County undisp.osed of, and subject to its control. This sum is more than sufficient to satisfy the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-8\">The judgment was renewed by <em>sci. fa. </em>in 1868, and under anew <em>fi. fa. </em>issued thereon, the land was sold on December 7th, 1868, and bought by the defendants for the sum of twenty-five dollars, who at the next term of the Court commenced an action of trespass to try title against the plaintiff to recover the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-9\">It was alleged in the complaint that Osmond Barber, one of the defendants, was present at the sale for partition, and did not forbid the same, but this was denied by the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-10\">The plaintiff demanded judgment:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-11\">1. That it be ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the lien of the judgment of A. Barber <em>vs. </em>Henry Macon, Sr., on the lands of the latter, was divested by the judicial sale of the same as hereinbefore described.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-12\">2. That the defendants seek satisfaction of their execution from the administrators of Macon, and in case of failure of personal as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>sets, now in their hands, that they be compelled to apply for the proceeds of the sale of the real estate now in possession, and under the control of this Court, if their claim be adjudged tobe valid and subsisting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">3. That said defendants be enjoined from further proceedings at law against this plaintiff, and those holding under him, on account-of said real estate, and for such other and further protection and relief as to this Court may seem just and proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">The ease was heard upon the pleadings, and ETis Honor refused the motion for injunction and dismissed the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">The plaintiff appealed on the grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-8\">1. Because His Honor the presiding Judge erred in not holding that the defendants should seek payment of their execution out of the proceeds of the sales of the land in controversy, then and now in Court, and admitted to be more than sufficient to satisfy the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-9\">2. Because His Honor erred in not holding that the lien of the defendants'\u2019 execution was transferred from the land to the proceeds of the sale thereof, then under control of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-10\">3. Because His Honor erred in holding that the plaintiff, who had bought said land at a judicial sale for a valuable consideration, had no right to compel defendants to seek satisfaction out of the moneys arising from such sale, then in Court, upon which their execution was the first lien ; their refusal to seek such satisfaction exhibiting so manifest a disregard of the rights of the plaintiff that 'he was entitled to the protection of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-11\"><em>JBrawley, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-12\"><em>Hemphill, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b55-13\">Dec. 14, 1872.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AS\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b55-14\">Willard, A. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AB\">This was a complaint in the nature of a bill in equity to restrain the action at law brought by the defendants against the present plaintiff in which judgment has been given. (See next case).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">The complaint presents no equity that would warrant an interference with the legal rights of the defendant, as purchaser, under the judgment against H. Macon.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>The only fact alleged in support of an equity in the plaintiff to restrain the suit to enforce the legal title of the defendants is, that 0. Barber was present at the sale for partition and did not forbid the same. This fact was denied by the answer, and, if material, should have been proved. But it is wholly immaterial, for, standing by itself, it does not warrant the conclusion that the plaintiff seeks to draw from it. This question, as well as all the other questions properly arising on the complaint and answer, are conclusively ruled by <em>Moore </em>vs. <em>Wright, </em>(14 Rich. Eq., 132).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">That case holds, distinctly, that a purchaser under a partition among distributees has no equity to restrain a judgment creditor of the ancestor of the distributees from enforcing such judgment against any portion of the estate bound by such judgment, on the mere ground that it can be satisfied out of other assets, without prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s right, which would otherwise be defeated, and that an allegation that the party stood by and did nothing to prevent this sale did not give rise to such an equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The judgment creditor has a right to select as to what property of the judgment debtor shall be sold under his <em>execution. </em>\u2014 Long-<em>worth </em>vs. <em>Scriven, </em>(2 Hill, 298.) Unless, therefore, there is a general equity between the parties, or such an abuse of the right of selection as shall amount to a fraud on the rights of third persons, that legal right cannot be restrained on equitable grounds. Whatever equity the plaintiff might have been entitled to before the sale under the judgment, to require the application of the proceeds of the foreclosures to the satisfaction of the execution, he lost, as to the defendants, by his laches in not moving before title vested in him. A question was made below, whether the complaint was properly brought to restrain the action for the recovery of the land. The proper course of practice, where a defendant has rights, upon grounds that formerly authorized the filing of a bill to restrain an action at law, which he desires to oppose to a recovery in an action brought against him, is to interpose such rights by way of answer or counter-claim. He may, in this way, not only take advantage of them by way of defeating the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, but may seek and obtain affirmative relief appropriate to the case thus made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">If the Circuit Court should, instead of allowing a defendant to amend his answer, so as to bring forward matters proper for a bill in equity to restrain an action at law, allow the party to prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>cute a cross action in the nature of such a bill, we are not prepared to say that such subsequent proceeding would be without jurisdiction or liable to reversal on that ground. But as the present suit was dismissed as to the merits, that question does not come before us at present.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The judgment below should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b57-6\"><em>Moses, </em>C. J., and <em>Wright, </em>A. J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
