(5 </em>Stat., 107, \u00a7 9?)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-9\">The Section is in these words: \u201c That if any child should die in the life-time of the father or mother, leaving issue, any legacy given in the last will of such father or mother shall go to such issue, unless such deceased child was equally partitioned with the children by the father or mother when living.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-10\">The argument of Chancellor Dunkin, in <em>Pegues </em>vs. <em>Pegues, </em>11 Rich. Eq., 550, is conclusive. He says: \u201c The Act of Assembly of 1712, 2 Stat., 523, provided that intestate\u2019s estate should be distributed one-third to the widow, and the residue in equal proportion among the children, and such persons as legally represent such children, in case any of the said children be then dead, unless the child has been advanced. In the same manner, it is provided by the A. A. 1791, 5 Stat., 162, that if the intestate shall leave a widow and one or more children, the widow shall take one-third, and the remainder be divided between the children, (if more than one,) the issue of a decased child taking, among them, the share of their parent. A like beneficent spirit is manifested by the Act of 1789, in securing to the issue of the child of the testator the bounty which was intended for the parent. Any legacy given in the last will of a father or mother shall go to the issue of such child, if the child should die in the life-time of the parent. The Act is remedial. The object is to secure to the offspring what was given to the ancestor, but which gift could not take effect by reason of the death of the ancestor. All the legislative proceedings look to what is to be done on the death of the testator or intestate, and all mean what is ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>pressly declared by the Act of 1712, that in case any of the children be dead, the issue of such deceased child shall take among them the share of the estate to which the parent would have been entitled, if he had survived the testator.\u2019\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-5\">This reasoning of the learned Chancellor is sustained by the English Courts. The Statute of Wills, 1 Vic., 26, \u00a7 33, provides, \u201cThat where any person, being a child or other issue of the testator, to whom any real or personal estate shall be devised or bequeathed, for any estate or interest, not determinable at the death of such person, shall die in the life-time of the testator, leaving issue, and any such issue of such person shall be living at the time of the death of the testator, such devise or bequest shall not lapse, but shall take effect as if the death of such person had happened immediately after the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-6\">This Statute is evidently the same as our Act of 1789, but more fully expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-7\">It has been determined, under this Statute, that \u201ceven when the death of the donee happened before the date of the will, the surviving issue take, as heirs or distributees, notwithstanding the Act is \u2018shall'die,\u2019 which has been construed to mean \u2018shall die after the passage of this Act.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 2 Red. on Wills, 366.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-8\">In determining the meaning of the words of the Act, it is said by Sir James Wigram, V. C., \u201cI am bound, as well as I can, to fix that meaning, by considering the policy of the Act and the objects it was intended to accomplish. Now, the policy of the Act and the objects it was intended to accomplish are, for the present purpose, sufficiently manifest. It was intended to prevent a portion given by testator to a child going from the estate of such child, and his family from being left portionless, by reason of the death of the child under certain circumstances, a consequence of law which the common feelings of mankind declared to be a disappointment of the intention of the <em>father.\u201d </em>\u2014 Winter vs. <em>Winter, 5 </em>Hare, 306.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b87-9\">The verbal criticism of the Chancellor deciding the case of <em>Pegues </em>vs. <em>Pegues </em>is no answer to the force of this reasoning from the <em>reason </em>and <em>spirit </em>of the law. That case having been decided by a C)urt of three, O\u2019Neall, Chief Justice, dissenting, and concurring in an opinion with Dunkin, Ch., who delivered the Circuit decree, cannot preclude the more reasonable construction by this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Second. </em>Are respondents entitled, irrespective of the Statute? The gift is to \u201c <em>Eliza Jane Williams and her bodily issue.\u201d </em>It is said by Ch. Harper, in <em>Henry </em>vs. <em>Talbird, </em>Bail. Eq., 554, that \u201c when a testator gives to one and his issue, he intends a benefit to the issue some way.\u201d He either intends that they shall take in indefinite lineal succession, or that persons answering that description at a particular time shall take. In every case of a gift to one and his issue the question is, in which of these senses he intended to use them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-5\">In this case, he knew that Eliza Jane Williams was dead, but the bequest is to her and her \u201c <em>bodily issue.\u201d </em>It is evident that he intended the issue to take some benefit. If he intended them to take at his death, as <em>persons, </em>this is the construction contended for-If that they should take in \u201c <em>indefinite lineal succession,\u201d </em>they shall take, but, without the succession intended, the gift is absolute in the first takers. It is the same as a gift to the \u201c bodily issue,\u201d or issue of the body of Eliza Jane Williams.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-6\">This is no question of limitation.

To do this \u201cthe Court is permitted to look at all the circumstances under which the devisor makes his will, as the state of his property, of his family and the like.\u201d \u2014 2 Jarman, 472. It is well expressed by Ch. J. Marshall, in Finley, <em>et al., </em>vs. <em>King\u2019s Lessees, </em>3 Pet., 377 : \u201c The intent of the testator is the cardinal rule in the construction of wills, and if that intent can be clearly perceived, and is not contrary to some positive rule of law, it must prevail, although, in giving effect to it, some words should be rejected or so restrained in their application as to change their literal meaning in the particular instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The legacy to the daughter was impossible. The testator could not have- intended any benefit to her. We are not to account for the follies of men, and required to discover a motive for an act so entirely irreconcilable with common sense. We cannot, however, fail to recognize the fact that ho intended the one thousand dollars and the negro girl to be separated from \u201cthe balance of the proceeds of the sale of his estate, both personal and real, and whatever else he may be possessed of,\u201d which he includes in his residuary estate, and in which he contemplated that the legacy now in question should not fail and pass. To allow it to be so included would disappoint his intention by defeating his purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Technical words must be understood according to their legal import, unless a testator manifest a clear intention to the contrary. \u2014 2 Roper on Legacies, 1461; <em>Clark </em>vs. <em>Moseley, </em>1 Rich. Eq., 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>It is not to be denied that the words \u201c bodily issue/\u2019 as used in this clause of the will, are generally to be taken as words of limitation ; but so to hold them here would defeat the plain purpose of the testator, by permitting the subject of the gift to be enjoyed by the residuary legatees, which would be contrary to the expressed intent. It is said, in all the elementary works on the subject, that though the words \u201cheirs and issue\u201d are usually to be accepted, when connected with testamentary dispositions, as words of limitation, yet they may be received as denoting children, if from the context of the instrument such an intention can be discovered, more especially if thereby it will prevent a specific legacy from falling into the disposition of the residue of the estate. Perhaps the rule is no where better or more concisely stated than by Lord Eldon, in <em>Christopher </em>vs. <em>Naylor, </em>1 Meri., 320, in the following words: \u201cIf upon fair reasons deduced from the words of the will, all the contents, design and tenor of it, as manifested by its contexts, shew the word \u2018issue\u2019 to be meant in a more restrained sense, that sense may be given to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In regard to the word \u201cissue,\u201d as was said in relation to that of \u201cheirs,\u201d in <em>Bailey et. al. </em>vs. <em>Patterson, </em>3 Rich. Eq., 158, quoting from Jarman, \u201cit is always open to enquiry whether a testator used the word \u2018 heirs \u2019 according to its strict and proper acceptation, or in a more inaccurate sense, to denote children, next of kin, &amp;c.\u201d Although we are permitted to look for the meaning of the testator to the context of the whole will, still, before the legacy can vest in the party for whose supposed benefit it was intended, we must find words of sufficient import, according to the canons of interpretation, to justify an application of them to the particular individual they were intended to designate. If the deceased daughter was not the object of the testator\u2019s bounty, and though the words \u201cbodily issue\u201d were meant to refer to her children, still, to entitle them to the legacy, the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d must be changed to the copulative \u201c and.\u201d When it is apparent from the intention of testator that the word \u201c or \u201d is used instead of \u201c and,\u201d and <em>vice versa, </em>the Court interferes to change the word. \u2014 1 Jarman, 443 ; 2 Rop. on Leg., 1405, 1410 ; <em>Adams </em>vs. <em>Chaplin, </em>1 Hill Eq., 265 ; <em>Shand </em>vs. <em>Rogers, 7 </em>Rich.
