H. Gayle, and ship the same to him to Wright\u2019s Bluff, S.

The motion was denied, and defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\">Defendants then gave evidence tending to show that their promise was to accept Gayle\u2019s draft on them for the amount of the goods, payable at sixty days from the date of the purchase; and that no such draft had ever been presented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-9\">In reply, plaintiffs gave evidence tending to show that the draft which defendants agreed to accept was a draft payable at thirty days; that such a draft was received from Gayle, but not until three days after it had matured; that it was then presented to defendants, who refused to accept the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-10\">The presiding Judge charged the jury that if defendants were the original purchasers of the goods, they were liable; that the question was, to whom did plaintiffs sell the goods ?

Afterwards a bill was delivered to the defendant, (the boy\u2019s uncle,) who said it was quite right to deliver the bill to him, for he was answerable. It was decided, at <em>nisi prius, </em>and afterwards by the Court, <em>that it was properly left to .the jury to say whether the original credit was not given to the defendant only.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">In <em>Storr vs. Scott, </em>(6 Carr., Pay., 241,) where the defendant, as steward of certain races, selected at the shop of the plaintiff a gold cup, saying, \u201cyou must send the cup as usual, I suppose, to the clerk of the course,\u201d which had frequently been done by the plaintiff before. Lord Lyndhurst said to the jury: \u201c <em>The question is, upon</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-10\"><em>iohose credit the cup was furnished,\u201d </em>and left them to say whether the credit was to be given to the defendant or to the clerk of the course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-11\">The rule, as extracted from the English cases, is thus expressed in Leigh\u2019s N. P., 1025 : \u201c <em>R is a question for the jury, in such cases, whether credit was given </em>to the defendant before the debt was incurred, or to another, as the principal, <em>taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-12\">In the late case of <em>Mountstephen </em>vs. <em>Lakeman </em>(L. R. 7, Q. B., Ex. Ch., 196) the defendant being chairman of a local board of health, asked the plaintiff whether he would lay certain pipes. The plaintiff said, \u201c I have no objection to do the work, if you or the board will order the work, or become responsible for the payment.\u201d The defendant replied, \u201c Go on and do the work, and I will see you paid ;\u201d and accordingly the plaintiff did the work. The work was not authorized by the board, and they refused to pay for it. It was held that the defendant was liable for the price of the work, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>as there was evidence for the jury that the defendant contracted to be primarily liable.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">In 3 Parsons on Contracts, 20, it is said : \u201c From the very definition of a collateral promise, it follows that there must be some one who owes the debt directly. There must exist an original liability as the foundation for the collateral liability; and one of these liabilities must be entirely distinct from the other. If, therefore, the creditor trusted to one of the parties more than to the other, but did, in fact, trust to one together with the other, it is not within the statute ; and in ascertaining whether this original and distinct liability exists, and then a collateral one founded upon it, <em>the Court will look to the intention of the parties, as they may be inferred from all the circumstances of the case and of the parties. </em>At the same time, however, it must be remembered that the expressions used by the parties are the first and most direct evidence of their intention.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">In the notes to Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, case of <em>Berimyr </em>vs. <em>Darnell, </em>Vol. 1st, Part 1st, page 474, it is said : \u201c When it is doubtful whether the third person is liable on the credit given exclusively to the defendant, <em>the question should be left to the jury on all the evidence; (Elder </em>vs. <em>Warfield, </em>7 Harris, 391; <em>Scudder </em>vs. <em>Hale, </em>1 South, 249;) <em>and the fact that the goods were charged to a third person, for whose use they were bought, </em>or that a bill was rendered to him as the purchaser, although strong, <em>will not necessarily be conclusive evidence in favor of the defendant. </em>\u2014 Homans vs. <em>Lombard, 8 </em>Shepley, 508; <em>Walker </em>vs. <em>Richards, </em>41 1ST.

Even when the promise is not given until after the goods are ordered, it may still be so positive as to shew, in connection with the other evidence, that the delivery was solely upon the credit of the defendant, and thus make him liable, notwithstanding the <em>statute. </em>\u2014 -Darlington vs. <em>McCann, </em>2 E.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6E\">Under the authority of the ruling in <em>Taylor </em>vs. <em>Drake, </em>(4 Strob., 431,) it is clear that the Circuit Judge should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a non-suit. The contract on which the action was brought, as disclosed by both the pleadings and evidence, was a collateral contract to answer for the debt of another, and, as such, must be in writing, to be capable of enforcement under the statute of frauds. It appeared, by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, direct and uncontradicted, that the goods were sold to Gayle upon the promise of defendants to accept a draft drawn for the purpose of paying the purchase money'on such sale. As the case stood at the time the motion for a non-suit was made, and that aspect is unchanged, there was no evidence that could justify a jury in finding the contract of sale, as it regards the goods, as a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>between the plaintiffs, as sellers, and the defendants, as purchasers. On the contrary, the transaction, regarded as one of purchase and sale, was between the plaintiffs and Gayle. The promise of the defendants was both inducement and consideration to such contract of sale, and was, in substance, a contract to assure the performance of what Gayle had undertaken to do, namely, to pay for the goods purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The point ruled in <em>Taylor </em>vs. <em>Drake, </em>(4 Strob., 431,) was, that if the person to whom the goods were delivered is liable as purchaser, then a promise made by a third person to pay the amount of such purchase must be regarded as collateral, and, as such, must be in writing, in conformity with the Statute of Frauds, in order to be capable of being enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The promise of defendants here was to accept for the amount of such purchase. Such a promise was, in substance, a promise to pay for the goods sold to Gayle, and for which the latter was primarily liable. The only consideration for defendants\u2019 promise was the credit given to Gayle, and this shows that the contract to accept was intended as a means of securing payment for the goods sold and delivered to Gayle.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In <em>Taylor </em>vs. <em>Drake </em>the promise was to pay or endorse. Here the promise was to accept; and on the same ground on which, in that case, the contract was held to be collateral to an original contract of sale, the present promise must receive the same construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In <em>Taylor </em>vs. <em>Drake </em>a non-suit was entered by the appellate Court after a verdict for the plaintiff, thus showing that on a clear and uncontradicted state of evidence the Court will undertake to say, without the aid of the jury, whether the contract is to be regarded as original or collateral. As there was no question of credibility or of contradictory testimony to be settled, and no inference of fact to be drawn presumptively, there was nothing to put in exercise the peculiar functions of a jury. The decision of that ease leads to the conclusion that the present verdict must be set aside, and the case remanded for judgment, dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<judges id=\"b113-9\"><em>Moses, </em>C.
