There being no controversy as to the facts, it is not considered necessary to set forth the allegations contained in the petition and return. The following is a brief statement of the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-12\">By an Act of the General Assembly, approved 12th February, 1873, (15 Stat., 333,) the location of the County seat, County offices, and place for holding the Courts in Barnwell County, was referred to the qualified voters of said County. The first Section of the Act directs that the Governor, within ten days from its passage, issue his proclamation requiring the Commissioners of Elections for said County, on a day therein to be named, not exceeding thirty days from the date thereof, to open the polls at the various election precincts in said County, \u201c for the purpose of holding an election to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>determine the will of the people as to the location of the County seat of said County.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-5\">The second and third Sections are, in terms, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-6\">\u201c Sec. 2. That at such election the voting shall be by ballot, each qualified voter of the County being entitled to one vote, upon which shall be written or printed, or partly written and partly printed, the name of the locality at which he desires the County seat to be located: <em>Provided, </em>That in all respects the said election shall be held, conducted and determined as is now provided by law for the holding of elections for State and County officers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-7\">\u201cSec. 3. That, upon the canvassing of the votes given at such election, the Commissioners of Election shall certify to the Board of County Commissioners for said County the number of votes given for each locality, and the locality receiving the greater number of votes shall thenceforth be the County seat of said County, at which place the public offices shall be established, and the Courts thenceforth shall be held.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-8\">The remaining Sections provide for the construction of the necessary public buildings, and for a sale of the Court House building in Blackville, and the disposition of the proceeds thereof, in the event that the removal of the County seat should be \u201c determined upon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b494-9\">In pursuance of the provisions of this Act the Governor issued his proclamation; the Commissioners of Elections caused the polls to be opened on the appointed day, 22d March, 1873 ; the election was held, the votes counted, and certified statements of the result at the several precincts were made by the Managers, and delivered&gt; with the boxes and poll lists, in due time, to the Commissioners of Elections, who met at the County seat on the following Tuesday, the 25th March, and upon the certified returns of the Managers canvassed the votes given at said election, and aggregated the same. A protest, supported by affidavits, was presented before the Board of Canvassers, impugning the correctness and validity of the returns from certain precincts. The Commissioners of Elections, upon the canvassing of the votes by themselves, as County Canvassers, certified, in due form, to the Board of County Commissioners of said County the number of votes given at said election, as follows: For the locality, \u201c Barnwell,\u201d one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five votes; for the locality, \u201cBlackville,\u201d one thousand eight hundred and- sixty-six votes; and for the-locality, \u201cAllendale,\u201d two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>votes. The respondent was Chairman of the County Board of Canvassers. He failed to forward to the Governor and Secretary of State, after the final adjournment of that Board, the returns, poll lists, and all other papers appertaining to this election, conceiving, as appears from his return, that this duty was not imposed upon him by the terms of the Act under which the election was held ; and that the provisions of the fourth Section of the Act of 1872 (15 Stat., 171,1 were not applicable. Formal demand was made upon him to forward the papers, as required by the Act last referred to, but he refused to comply, and hence this application for the writ of <em>mandamus </em>to compel him to do what so was demanded of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\">The position taken on behalf of the relators is, that by the plain terms of the proviso to the second Section this election was to be, \u25a0in all respects, not only held and conducted, but also <em>determined </em>in the manner prescribed by the general election laws; that such determination, therefore, could be legally made only by the State Board of Canvassers; and, accordingly, that it was the clear legal duty of the respondent to forward to the Governor and Secretary of State the returns, poll lists and all other papers appertaining to the election, in order that the said Board might organize and proceed to canvass the votes, hear the protest, and finally determine the result of the election; that until this action and determination by the State Board, the Commissioners of Elections had no power or authority to certify to the Board of County Commissioners the number of votes given for each locality; and hence, that the certificate heretofore delivered to that Board was premature and nugatory \u2014 \u201ca pretended certificate,\u201d in the language of the petition. The relators represent that they, in common with other citizens and tax payers, are injured and aggrieved by the action of the Commissioners of Election, since their protest has been disregarded; and, by the refusal of the respondent to forward the papers, they have been prevented from establishing the grounds of said protest, and from obtaining from the State Board of Canvassers a final certificate of the result of the election, as required by law. They present, as a further grievance to themselves and others, as tax payers, that, by reason of the filing of the said \u201cpretended certificate,\u201d certain County'officers have removed, or are removing, their offices from Blackville, \u201c the lawful County seat,\u201d to Barnwell, \u201c the pretended County seat \u201d of Barnwell County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>The question, therefore, is upon the proper construction of the Act authorizing this election, and, particularly, of the second and third Sections thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-5\">If the terms of the second Section be considered independently of the subsequent provisions of the Act, the meaning is very clear. The nature of the election required some specification as to the form of the ballot by which the voter should signify his choice, but in all other respects the general law Was, by reference, incorporated in the Act, and was to govern, as well in determining as in holding and conducting the election. A sound interpretation of the word \u201c holding,\u201d in the clause \u201c as is now provided by law for the holding of elections,\u201d &amp;c., would give it a sense large enough to include all that is embraced in the terms \u201cconducted and determined;\u201d and this to effectuate the manifest intent indicated by the immediate context. And so, too, if the third Section be read without reference to the proviso in the second, there could be no question as to the true intent and meaning of its terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-6\">The Commissioners, of Elections, from whom the certificate is to emanate, are the same individuals who constitute the County Board of Canvassers, and the words \u201c upon the canvassing of the votes,\u201d would be taken as referring to the action of that Board, not only for the reason that, ordinarily, if not universally, an official certifies from his personal knowledge, but from the nature of the certificate required by this Act, which is to set forth the result of a canvassing proper, and not a determination, in the technical sense, of the result of the election.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b496-7\">To construe the words \u201c upon the canvassing of the votes \u201d as referring to the action of the State Board, when the certificate of the result of the canvass is to be made by the County Board of Canvassers, would, it seems to me, do violence to the common-sense meaning of the words as they stand with the context. But the Sections must be read together, and, if possible, the construction must be such as to give effect to both provisions. It is contended for the relators that the terms of the proviso are imperative, and that the election must be determined in all respects as is provided by the general law; and the State Board alone being invested with jurisdiction to determine, the words \u201c upon the canvassing of the votes,\u201d can be referred only to the final canvassing by the Board which holds the power to determine. But for the clause of the proviso requiring the election to be <em>determined, </em>in all respects, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the general law provides, it is conceded that the action of the State Board would not be invoked. It is, then, that the election may be determined according to law, that this application is made to compel the forwarding of the election papers. But it would, I apprehend, be difficult to find warrant in any approved canon of construction to justify the liberty which must needs be taken in dealing with the terms of the third Section in order to sustain this theory. The certificate upon which the Act is to operate and take effect is to issue \u201cupon the <em>canvassing </em>of the votes.\u201d Is a determination of the election, by the State Board, comprehended in the canvassing of the votes, so that, when the canvass is completed, the result of the election is determined ? Clearly not. The canvassing of the votes is a merely ministerial act, beginning at the close of the polls, when the Managers canvass the ballots, (A. A. 1868, Sp. Ses., p. 141, Secs. 20-1-2) continued by the County Board of Canvassers, when the returns of the Managers are canvassed, and completed, ordinarily, by the State Board of Canvassers, when the certified statements of the County Board are canvassed. But the determination of the result of an election, including the hearing and decision of a protest, is a judicial act. <em>(Vide State vs. Acting Board Aldermen of Charleston, </em>1 S. C., 30 ; Cooley Lim., 622.) The action of the State Board of Canvassers is as follows : Upon the certified copies of the statements sent up from the Board of County Canvassers, the State Board makes a statement of the <em>whole number </em>of votes given at the election for the various officers and for <em>each of them voted for. </em>They then certify these statements to be correct, and subscribe the same with their proper names. This is the end of the canvassing. Upon such statements the Board then proceed to determine what person has been, by the <em>greatest </em>number of votes, duly elected, and in this connection they decide any protest or contest that may arise. Finally, they make and subscribe, on the proper statement, a certificate of their determination, and deliver the same to the Secretary of State. (Gen. St., p. 29, Secs. 24, 25, 26.) Here, then, are the two proceedings\u2014 canvassing and determining \u2014 as distinctly defined as if they were conducted by separate Boards. Each terminates in a certificate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-6\">There is, first, the certificate upon the statement of aggregated votes received by each candidate ; and then there is the certificate of determination designating the person elected. If, now, the papers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>appertaining to this election must go to the State Board in order that a determination may be had, in all respects conformable to the general law, is it not remarkable that the certificate required by the third Section of the Act is to issue at a stage of the proceeding short of that determination, in the pursuit of which the papers are forwarded ? It is <em>upon the canvassing of votes </em>that the certificate is delivered to the County Commissioners. If this be done at once, as the language imports it should be, the Act forthwith establishes the County seat as the certificate indicates ; and yet, after this, the State Board (which may adjourn from day to day for ten days \u2014 G. S., 30, Sec. 27) might determine the election differently from the result shown by the statements of the canvass and the certificate issued in conformity thereto; or, upon considering the grounds of protest, the determination might be that the election itself was invalid. Are we at liberty to assume that the certificate must be deferred, though the canvassing has been completed, until the election is regularly determined ? This would certainly be doing violence to the text, for not only is it provided that the certificate shall be made \u201cupon the canvassing of the votes,\u201d but the document itself is precisely such as would be required to exhibit the result of a canvass, and is not such as would be proper to show the determination of the final result of the election. It is just such a certificate as the State Board makes upon the completion of their canvassing, viz: a certified statement of the number of votes, in the aggregate, received by each person voted for, and entirely different from that which certifies that a certain person, having received the greatest number of votes, was duly elected. If the Act had directed that, upon the determination of the election, the Commissioners of Elections should certify the result, there would be stronger ground to contend that a determination by the State Board was necessary ; though the objection to this construction would still remain, that the certificate is required to be \u2022given, not by that Board, but by the inferior Board. But there is, in my judgment, an insuperable obstacle in the way to the construction contended for in behalf of the relators, in this : <em>that while the papers must go to the State Board, only for the salce of a proper determination of the election, the certificate issues upon the canvassing merely, and sets forth only the proper results of a canvass. </em>If, indeed, it were perfectly clear, from a just construction of all parts of the statute, that the returns were to be canvassed by the State Board, the direction to certify \u201c upon the canvassing of the votes,\u201d read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>connection with the terms of the proviso requiring the election to be determined as provided by the general law, might, by a liberal interpretation, be taken to mean \u201c upon a determination of the election.\u201d Still it would seem extraordinary that the Legislature, with its mind fully upon the provisions of law as to the mode of determining the results of elections, should fail to direct the proper certificate of determination, which, in general elections, is of such essential importance; and, on the contrary, should direct a certificate which, upon its face, imports that the canvassing only had been completed, and that the election remained undetermined. But the question in the case is, whether the State Board have jurisdiction under this Act, and in exploring for the intention of the law makers, it is proper to consider the contradictions and inconsistencies which may grow out of the construction contended for. If the character of the certificate required by the Act is, as it seems to me to be, so remarkable, in view of the hypothesis that determination in due course by the State Board was intended, it is no less surprising that the Commissioners of Election, after having parted with the papers of the election, and thus, as in ordinary cases, fully discharged themselves from their official connection with the same, should be made, not, indeed, merely the medium through which the decision of the higher Board is communicated to the public, but the certifiers of the result. As long as the papers remain in their possession, the material is in hand which enables them to give the certified statement required by the Act. But it is urged here that the papers must have been sent up through the Chairman of the Board. In no instance, under the general law, do the papers thus forwarded ever find their way back to the County Board. There is no retrograde movement from the canvassing at the polls to the final certificate in the Secretary of State\u2019s office. Nor is there any case where a certificate comes <em>down, </em>in due course of law, to any official or Board. Certificates go along with and accredit returns and statements, in their progress <em>upwards, </em>to the ultimate determination. Nor does this Act provide any means whatever by which the Commissioners of Election may be officially informed of the result of the action of the State Board, which result, nevertheless, must, from the necessity of the case, be authenticated to them in some proper shape before they can be placed in a position to certify, as if of their own knowledge, the number of votes given for each locality. It is said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>State Board would send down their certificate, and that the Commissioners could, upon the faith of this, themselves certify. Is it likely that the Legislature would have failed to provide, in terms, that such certificate should be sent down, if so circuitous and unusual a mode of certifying the result of an election had really been contemplated ? Would this important matter have been left to mere inference ? Plere is a clause importing into this Act, as it is said, all the general provisions of the existing law in regard to elections. It is argued that this clause has a controlling influence over subsequent provisions, as it expresses the primary intent of the Legislature in this enactment; that the determination of this election in the regular mode was prominent in the mind of the ,law makers ; and that the utmost liberality should be used in the effort to conform all provisions looking to any other kind of determination to this express declaration of the legislative intent. Now, when the State Board determine the result of an election, they evidence their decision by a certificate endorsed upon the certified statement of the result of the canvass. This certificate they are expressly required to deliver to tho Secretary of State. They are not authorized to make any duplicate certificate for delivery to any other officer or person. It is the Secretary of State who gives certificates to the candidates elect. Can it be believed that the Legislature would have failed to give the proper direction to this final certificate of the State Board, and to jrrovide that it be sent either direct to the Board of County Commissioners, or to the Election Commissioners, if, for any reason, it was deemed proper that they should certify ? Is it not reasonable, at least, to suppose that, having their attention directed not only to the matter of determination, but, also, and most especially, <em>to the certificate upon which the Act itself was ultimately to operate, </em>they would have made some provision for authenticating, in proper form, the result to the Election Commissioners ? But why introduce the Commissioners into the Act at all in connection with the certificate ? Why not have let the certificate of the State Board take its usual course to the office of the Secretary of State, where the original Act is on file, and then have directed the Secretary to certify the result to the County Commissioners, as he would, in ordinary cases, certify to the successful candidate ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A91\">All this would have been obvious enough if it was contemplated that the election should be determined by the State Board. But, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>on the contrary hypothesis, that the Commissioners were to certify upon the canvassing of the votes by the County Board, we are relieved of the difficulties which attend the opposite view, and are not put to the necessity of importing into the Act important provisions, the absence of which, as they could not have been overlooked, is significant of the true intent of the Legislature. However unreasonable it might seem to have required the Commissioners of Election to certify the result of the canvassing by the State Board, still if the words of the Act admitted of no other sensible interpretation, it would be the duty of the Court to uphold and enforce it according to its terms. But when it is seen that so much essential matter is to be brought into this Act by implication, merely to support, in their most comprehensive sense, the words of the proviso, it is well to pause and inquire whether the words in question may not admit of a more limited signification, which will serve to harmonize the apparent conflict between the Sections, thus avoiding what can be justified only by the most urgent necessity \u2014 the interpolation into the text of the Act of other important provisions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-5\">The object of the Act was to ascertain the will of the people of the County in respect to the location of the County seat, and to establish the same at whatsoever place they should determine. The means provided for ascertaining the will of the people was the ordinary way. (A. A. 1872-73, 15 Stat., 411, 442.) An election by the qualified voters, and, with the necessary exception as to the form of the ballot, the provisions of the general law were to govern, touching the holding, conducting and determining of this election. This general intent is expressed in the proviso to the second Section. But special provision was still to be made in one important particular, viz: The condition upon which any certain locality was to become, <em>by virtue of the Act itself, </em>the County seat, and place for holding the Courts. The process of determination, under the general law, may, with propriety, be said to begin at the close of the polls, when the Managers canvass the ballots and cast up the results at various precincts. First in order are the certified returns of the Managers, then the canvassing of these returns by the County Board of Canvassers, by which the aggregate votes are ascertained, and the result certified. (G. S. 28, Section 18.) Then the canvassing by the State Board of Canvassers of the certified statements of the County Board, and these being incorporated into a statement, duly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>verified by the proper certificate, the canvass is completed. This final statement, like the final statement of the CouDty Board, shows the number of votes given for each candidate in the aggregate. Then comes the determination of the result of the election, which involves the hearing of any protest sent up with the other papers. There is determination at every stage of this process \u2014 at the precincts, at the County canvassing, and at the State canvassing, the last being final, and, in ordinary elections, indispensable. But the election now under consideration was for a special purpose \u2014 that of fixing the locality which, by force and virtue, <em>not of the election itself, but of the Act, </em>was to become the County seat. And if the Act indicates clearly that the election therein authorized should be determined in a manner which, though in general conformity with the-election laws, varied therefrom in any particular or \u201crespect,\u201d there can be no question that the words of the proviso, \u201cin all respects,\u201d must yield to the extent required to give effect to the special provision. The latter must be treated as an exception from the general provision, as much so as if the language of the proviso had been \u201c in all respects, <em>save as hereinafter provided.\u201d </em>(Potter\u2019s Dwarris, 117, 272-3.) '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-5\">A construction, however, is to be preferred which expunges no word from the text, and gives effect to every expression in the statute. I think the Act itself defines the manner in which this election was to be determined; and, if this be so, then the general words of the proviso must be construed as referring to the mode thus indicated ; for the terms of a statute are always to be understood as having regard to the subject-matter, as that is always in the eye of the framer of the law, and all his expressions are directed to that end. (Dwarris, 210.) Looking to the general law, we find that the canvassing is determined by aggregating the votes for each person voted for, and that the determination of the result of the election is made by ascertaining, upon the final statement of the canvass, the person who received the greatest number of votes. The Act iu question makes the first kind of determination the subject of the certificate upon which it is to go into effect. The result of the election is not to be certified, but merely the result of the canvass, and the Act fastens upon the locality which appears from the certificate to have received the greater number of votes, and, <em>proprio vigore, </em>makes it thenceforth the County seat. Is not, then, the election as completely determined, <em>for the purposes of the statute, </em>as it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>been if the canvassing, a merely ministerial act, had been completed by the State Board ? And then, when it is remembered that \u25a0the Commissioners of Election are to certify, and that, as County Canvassers, they have all the information needed to enable them to certify, why should the words, \u201cupon the canvassing of the votes,\u201d be construed to mean a canvassing by the State Board, thus bringing about the necessity of importing new provisions into the Act to uphold the construction ? The State Board canvass upon the statements of the County Canvassers, but these statements are, in all particulars, complete enough to satisfy the requisitions of the Act in respect to the certificate which the Commissioners are to make. It seems to me a reasonable construction to hold that the election was determined in the precise manner contemplated by the Act, and that the general words of the proviso are satisfied, if they are construed, as they must be, with reference to the subject-matter, since, in all respects, the election has been determined as is provided by law for the election of State and County officers, so far as the \u25a0 provisions of that law are applicable to an election, which, by the express terms of the Act, was to terminate in a certificate exhibiting the result which a canvass of the votes determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-5\">If the Commissioners of Election were authorized and required by the Act to certify, as they have done, upon the completion of the canvassing of the vote by the County Board of Canvassers, the Act took effect upon the filing of that certificate, and the Board of State Canvassers, having no official duty to perform in relation to this election, it was not incumbent on the respondent, as Chairman of the County Board, to forward the returns, poll lists, and other papers appertaining to the election, to the Governor and Secretary of State. Being clearly and firmly of opinion that the certificate was properly made and filed, and the Act operated, by its own terms, upon the delivery of said certificate to the Board of County Commissioners to establish Barnwell, the locality appearing from the certificate to have received the greater number of votes, as thenceforth the County seat of Barnwell County, my conclusion is that the m'otion for a <em>mandamus </em>must be denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-6\"><em>And it is, therefore, ordered, </em>That the rule against the respondent be, and hereby is, discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b503-7\">The relators appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-8\"><em>Bellinger, </em>for appellants:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The appellants, in common with others, deem themselves wronged and aggrieved by the results, as shown by the'returns of the Managers; and, also, on account of illegality practiced at certain precincts. To remedy this wrong a protest was entered, and the respondent requested to perform the duty sought to be enforced by the <em>mandamus </em>in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-5\">For every wrong the law provides a remedy, and the remedy in this case was clearly pointed out by the Act under which the election was held, (15 Stat., 333.) The second Section of this Act provides, <em>by way of proviso, </em>that the said election should <em>\u201c </em>be held, conducted and determined in all respects as is provided by law for the holding of elections for State and County officers.\u201d It is contended, by the Court below and by the counsel for the appellee, that \u201c determined,\u201d as used in this proviso, means the determination of the number of votes cast, as shown by the Managers\u2019 returns ; but we apprehend that words, when used by the law-maker, must be construed to have their most general meaning, unless such construction would do violence to the sense. An election is said to be determined when all the requisites of the law have been complied with, and the final certificate of the State Board of Canvassers has been given. This we conceive to be the determination meant in the Act. But the Court below holds that the certificate required by the Act (15 Stat., 333,) is merely a certificate of the result of the canvassing, and not a determination of the result of the election. This, then, would seem to leave the result of the election-still undetermined, and that determination being by the State Board, the appellee would be compelled, even in this view, to forward the papers as required of him, in order that there should be a final result. It is said that if the construction contended for by the appellants be allowed, the result would be that the Commissioners of Election would be required to certify a fact not within their personal knowledge, as they have to act upon the certificates of the State Board. There is no greater reason why they should not certify to this fact than why the Secretary of State should not certify to a fact not within his knowledge, and this he is expressly required to do by the 32d Section, General Statutes, p. 30.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-6\">The Commissioners of Election might well certify the results as certified to them by the State Board. But, says the appellee, no certificate of an election ever comes <em>down. </em>There never has been held such an election as this, and the necessity of a certificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>coming down is apparent. If it. were not necessary for the County Commissioners to be informed of the result, no certificate would go but simply to the Secretary of State. The certificate must needs go to them, and the officers of election, so to speak, are made the channel through which it goes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-5\">It is admitted that, if the second Section of the Act stood alone, the construction contended for by appellants would be correct; but the third, says appellee, changes the meaning of the first, and the Court below holds that the <em>proviso </em>of the second Section is the same as though it read \u201c <em>shall he held, eondiwted and determined, in all respects, &amp;c., save as is hereinafter </em>provided.\u201d But such a construction can only be resorted to in eases in which a literal construction would violate the sense. To say that the canvassing spoken of in the third Section meant the canvassing by the State Board, can in no Avay violate the sense; and, even granting, for argument\u2019s sake, that it meant a canvassing by the Commissioners of Elections, still the election would not be determined <em>\u201c </em>as is provided by law for the holding of elections for State and County officers,\u201d until passed upon by the State Board. I can see no violence to sense when we contend that the election must be determined as the Act itself provides. The Act is to determine the locality of the County seat <em>hy the will of the people. </em>If the returns of the Managers showed one result, and a certificate Avere given to County Commissioners, and then the State Board, upon protest or otherwise, determined that another result was proper, as evidenced by the will of the people, is it contended that the first result must still be held to- be the true one ? Suppose five hundred persons from an adjoining County voted at a precinct, polling a solid vote for one locality, and the returns of Managers showed that locality ahead by fifty votes, a protest is entered, and the State Board decide that the five hundred votes must be thrown out, AA\u2019ould it be contended that the A?ill of the people Avas expressed in the returns of Managers, and the first locality must be the County seat?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-6\">But, says appellee, the State Board has no authority to pass upon the question. Then our wrong, against which we protest, and Avhieh Ave prove bjr affidavits, must go unredressed, and Ave imposed upon. The respondent, however, contends that no protest is allowed us, because none is provided for in the Act. The proviso in the second clause is enough to cover the protest, and by the twenty-sixth Section, General Statutes, page 29, it is made the duty of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Board of Canvassers to hear and determine all protests, when the power to do so does not, by the Constitution, reside in some other body. Even upon general principles, a protest would be allowed if the election was illegal, and <em>a fortiori </em>when provided for. The respondent contends that he cannot be required to forward the papers, because he is <em>functus officio. </em>To hold that the Act is mandatory, which requires him to forward these papers in ten days, would be to allow him to defeat every election which did not please him, by simply retaining the papers beyond the ten days; whereas, if it is contended that this construction would enable him to keep the papers an indefinite time, we answer that we compel, by <em>mandamus, </em>the duty required of him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-5\">What is the duty which respondent is required to perform ? \u201c To transmit to the Governor and Secretary of State the returns, poll lists, and all papers appertaining to the election.\u201d This is the duty required of him by the proviso in question, and which we seek to enforce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-6\">To arrive at the true construction of an Act, we must consider the subject concerning which it is enacted, and the intention of the Legislature, reviewing all the words of the Act, and giving them their proper meaning. The subject of this Act was an election, and it was well that the general election laws should govern. The intention of the legislator can only be arrived at from the words which he uses. What are the words used here <em>? </em>That this election should be held, conducted and determined; and what do these words mean ? That the election shall be held, <em>conducted </em>and <em>ended, </em>or concluded, as by law other elections are held, conducted and concluded ; and all elections are concluded by the certificate of the State Board. The <em>proviso </em>means, if all its requisites are not complied with, the election will be invalid. It is this proviso that gives life to the Act and effect to the election. If it is violated the election will be illegal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-7\">The special provisions of the proviso control the general word \u201c canvassing,\u201d in the third Section, and make that canvassing mean the canvassing by the State Board. Otherwise, the certificate may be given by the Commissioners of Election, and afterwards, when the election is \u201c determined,\u201d the State Board may find that the majority of legal votes were given for another locality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-8\">A construction which will work injustice and open the door to fraud will never be given to an Act when another construction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>equally sensible, and which will obviate both difficulties, can be resorted to. The grossest fraud, such as stuffing ballot boxes, illegal conduct of Managers in making ignorant parties vote to please them, &amp;c., may be practiced without any redress, if the appellee\u2019s construction of the Act be correct. But no such practices can be carried on under our construction. This seems to me the most sensible construction of the Act, and the most sensible will always be resorted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-5\">Whether the result of a canvassing by the State Board will avail the appellants any advantage or not, makes no difference; if it was their right, it was incompetent for the appellee, by his conduct, to deny them that right. The appellants are entitled to be placed in a position in which they may contest the validity of the election, as the Acts of Assembly provide that they may so contest, and the election in question must be subject to the general law of elections, under the proviso.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-6\">It would be a double wrong and hardship to preclude them from establishing, if they can, the illegality of the election \u2014 a right from which they are prevented by the non-performance, by the appellee, of a duty enjoined by <em>law. </em>\u2014 State vs. <em>Acting Board, &amp;c., </em>1 Rich., N.

By an Act of the General Assembly, approved February 12, 1873, entitled \u201c An Act to refer to the qualified voters of Barnwell County the location of the County seat of said County, County offices, and the place for holding the Courts of said County,\u201d an election was held on the 22d day of March, 1873, that the \u201c qualified \u201d voters of the said County might determine, by ballot, the location of the County seat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of said County, County offices, and the place for holding the Courts of said County.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">By the second Section of the last mentioned Act this election was to be in all respects \u201c held, conducted and determined as is now provided by law for the holding of elections for State and County officers.\u201d It is admitted that this election was held and conducted as is now provided by law for the holding of elections for State and County officers, but that it was not determined as such elections are determined, for the reason that the Chairman of the Board of County Canvassers did not, and refused to, send to the Governor and Secretary of State the returns of the said election, together with a protest presented by the relators, and all other papers appertaining to the said election; and in consequence of such refusal on the part of the said Chairman of the Board of County Canvassers, the relators complain \u201c that by reason of the said refusal and neglect of the said Chairman of the Board of County Canvassers, your petitioners are wronged, aggrieved and deprived of their legal rights, in that the said protest has been disregarded and a pretended certificate of the final results of the said election has been made by the said Board of County Canvassers to the Board of County Commissioners of said County, whereby your petitioners are prevented from contesting the validity of said election, from establishing the allegations made in said protest, and from obtaining from the Board of State Canvassers a final certificate of the result of said election as required by the law of said State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Under our form of government the right of appeal cannot be denied, and hence tribunals have been established, so that all who desire may be heard, by complying with certain prescribed and established rules; and as the people are the sovereign power of the State, and the right of franchise a very sacred right, it is as equally important that the right to present a protest in an election case, and be heard upon the same, should be equably preserved, and the General Assembly, in its wisdom, established a tribunal for that purpose, known as the \u201c Board of State Canvassers,\u201d which has power, \u201c and it is made their duty, to decide all cases under protest or contest that may arise, when the power to do so does not, by the Constitution, reside in some other body.\u201d (Section 26, p. 32, Revised Statutes.) Now, as there is no other body that is, by the Constitution, vested with the power of protests and contests in elections of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>this kind', it is made the imper\u00e1tive and especial duty, by the Section of the Act above quoted, of the \u201cBoard of State Canvassers\u201d to decide all such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">By Section 16 of the Act, (General Statutes, p. 31,) it is made the duty of the Board of County Canvassers to count the votes of the County, and \u201c make such Statements thereof as the nature of the election shall require, within ten days of the time of their first meeting as a Board of County Canvassers, and shall transmit to the Board of State Canvassers any protest and all papers relating to the electionand by the seventeenth Section of the same Act they are required to make duplicate statements, and such statements they are required to \u201c file in the office of the Clerk of the County ; and if there be no such duly qualified, according to law, then in the office of the Secretary of State.\u201d According to the Act of the General Assembly, approved February 12th, 1873, entitled \u201cAn Act to refer t\u00f3 the qualified voters of Barnwell County the location of the County seat of said County, County offices, and the place for holding the Courts of said County,\u201d there is an extra duty imposed upon the Commissioners of Election, (who are the Canvassers,) but no real variance or material change. That duty is, that after the canvassing of the votes given at the election, held by virtue of the said Act, they are required to certify to the Board of County Commissioners for Barnwell County \u201cthe number of votes given for each locality \u201d for the County seat. The certificate of the Commissioners of Election cannot be regarded as \u201c nugatory,\u201d inasmuch as that certificate is a mere statement of the number of votes given for each locality, and must correspond with the statement to be filed as provided by the seventeenth Section of the general Act; and it cannot be regarded as \u201c premature,\u201d as there is no special time fixed when such certificate should issue, save \u201c upon the canvassing of the votes given at such election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The action of the Board of State Canvassers cannot change the statement of the votes which may be filed in the office of Clerk of the County, or as may be in the office of the Secretary of State. But after hearing the protest in this case, they might determine that the County seat should be located at a different place from that which the statement of the County Canvassers or certificate of the Commissioners of Election would leave it, as, in many cases, those who get a majority of the votes for certain offices do not get the offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>By Section 24 of the general Act it is made the duty of the Board of State Canvassers, upon the certified copy of the statement made by the Board of County Canvassers, to make a statement of the whole number of votes given at each election for the various officers, and for each of them voted for; therefore, it appears that the Board of State Canvassers is simply to scrutinize the statements made by the Board of County Canvassers, and to see that such statements are correct, as stated, as separate statements are required to be made. Such statements they are to certify as being correct as it came from the County Canvassers, \u201cand subscribe the same with their proper names.\u201d According to the twenty-sixth Section of the same Act they \u201cthen proceed to determine and declare what persons, by the <em>greatest number of votes, </em>have been duly elected to such office, or either of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Thus, it is seen, they simply make a statement as received from the Board of County Examiners or Canvassers, and subscribe the same as being correct, as that, according to the number of votes cast, such and such persons have been elected to certain offices. Then they proceed and hear any protest or contest that may have been sent, and determine which of the parties voted for is entitled to the office, and declare the same, and subscribe, \u201con the proper statement, a certificate of their determination, and shall deliver the same to the Secretary of State.\u201d \u2014 Section 25, p. 32, Revised Statutes. This certificate is the final one, which not only should contain the number of votes given for each person voted for, but should state which of such persons is entitled to the office, as determined by the Board of State Canvassers.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">It then becomes the duty of the Secretary of State, \u201c without delay, to transmit a copy, under the seal of his office, of the certified determination of the Board of State Canvassers to each person thereby declared to be elected, and a like copy to the Governor.\u201d Section 30, p. 33, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">This being a special election, and for the location of the County seat of Barnwell County, and the said County being a corporation, the representatives of which are the County Commissioners, it would become the duty of the Secretary of State to transmit a copy, under the seal of his office, of the certified determination of the Board of State Canvassers to the County Commissioners of Barnwell County. Thus full force and effect is given to both statutes, and to each part of the same touching this case, enabling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>all sections to stand and operate in reason and right and secure to all who feel \u201c wronged and aggrieved \u201d the right to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">As to the other question relative to the jurisdiction of this Court to review, upon appeal, an order from a Circuit Judge discharging a. rule to show cause in <em>mandamus. </em>The Code of Procedure is divided into two parts: \u201cThe first relates to Courts of justice and their jurisdiction, and the second relates to civil actions in the Courts of this State.\u201d \u2014 \u00a7 8, p. 424, 14 Stat. at Large.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The jurisdiction of this Court, so far as reviewing upon appeal is concerned, is conferred by Part I of the Code of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">By an Act of the General Assembly, approved August 20, 1868, the writ of error was introduced in this State and applied to cases in <em>mandamits </em>and prohibition. By Section 463 of the Code of Procedure, the writ of error in all cases is abolished. That Section is as follows: \u201cNo writ of error shall be hereafter issued in any case whatever. Whenever a right, now existing, to have a review of a judgment rendered, or order or decree made, before the first day of January, 1871, such review can only be made upon an appeal taken in the manner provided by this Act; but all appeals or writs of error heretofore taken from such judgments, orders or decrees which are still pending in the appellate court, and not dismissed, shall be valid and effectual. But this Section shall not extend the right of review7 to any case or question to which it does not now extend, nor the time for appealing.\u201d The 475th Section of the Code of Procedure has no reference to the manner of reviewing a judgment or order, but only relates to the mode of procedure in cases of <em>mandamus </em>and prohibition, and is intended to retain the mode of procedure established by 9 Ann, C. 20, 2 Statutes at Large, p. 568. This statute is of force in this State, with certain modifications, established by the Code of Procedure. \u2014 Revised Statutes, p. 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The order in this case has heretofore been given.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b515-10\">Willard, A.
