Reg. 21,806 (Apr. 20, 2015) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. pts. 200, 230, 232, 239, 240, 249, <em>&amp; </em>260). The SEC also provided that anyone buying a certain subset of the securities will be considered a \u201cqualified purchaser.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21,809, 21,-858. In doing so, the SEC preempted all state registration and qualification requirements for the subset based on the Securities Act provision that exempts from state registration and qualification requirements securities offered or sold to \u201cqualified purchasers.\u201d <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(b)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-18\">The petitioners, William F. Gavin and Monica J. Lindeen (collectively, petitioners), are the chief securities regulators for Massachusetts and Montana, respectively. They argue that, because the SEC declined to adopt a qualified-purchaser definition limited to investors with sufficient wealth, revenue or financial sophistication to protect their interests without state protection, Regulation A-Plus fails both parts of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statutory construction standards enunciated in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). They also argue that it should be vacated as arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain adequately how it protects investors. For the following reasons, we deny the consolidated petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-19\">I. STATUTORY &amp; REGULATORY BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b674-20\">Securities regulation has existed, in one form or another, since the mid-1800s.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>fore the Great Depression, securities were regulated almost exclusively by the states and, beginning with Kansas in 1911, many states imposed comprehensive securities regulation regimes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Known as \u201cblue-sky\u201d laws,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> state systems often required not only pre-sale registration of securities but also pre-sale \u201cqualification\u201d or \u201cmerit\u201d review of security sales. Generally, state substantive review prohibited securities sales the state deemed unfair, unjust or inequitable. <em>See, e.g., </em>Act of Mar. 6, 1933, ch. 47, \u00a7 4,1933 Mont. Laws 72, 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">After the 1929 stock market crash, the Congress began regulating securities at the federal level. Rather than following the state substantive-review model, the Congress chose instead to mandate pre-sale disclosure of material information to investors. It did so by enacting, first, the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77a-77aa, which regulates the sale of securities in the primary market and, second, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78a-78pp, which created the Commission and established rules governing the resale or exchange of securities in the secondary market. Both the Securities Act and the Exchange Act have evolved considerably since they were first enacted. This case arises against the backdrop of amendments to the Securities Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Under section 5 of the Securities Act, a company must file a registration statement and a prospectus with the SEC before it offers its securities for sale. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77c-77h. Because the section 5 registration process is often prohibitively expensive for small companies, the Congress enacted section 3(b) of the Securities Act, which allows the Commission, through rulemaking, to exempt from federal-registration requirements certain small-dollar offerings, so long as the Commission finds that federal registration is not required to protect both investors and the public interest. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 77e(b)(1). In 1936, the SEC exercised its section 3(b) authority to promulgate \u201cRegulation A.\u201d <em>See </em>SEC Release No. 33-632 (Jan. 21,1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">Originally, Regulation A allowed a company to file a less expensive \u201coffering statement,\u201d rather than the pricey section 5 registration statement, before offering securities for sale. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 230.252-.253. To further protect investors, Regulation A forbade any securities sale until SEC staff \u201cqualified\u201d the issuing company\u2019s offering statement; moreover, Regulation A obligated the issuing company to deliver an offering circular to investors before consummating any sale. After the sale, investors had the protection of federal antifraud statutes, <em>see, e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q; <em>id. </em>\u00a7 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, as well as the Securities Act\u2019s civil liability provisions for false or misleading statements, <em>see, e.g., </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77c(b)(2)(D); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 771(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">Although section 3(b) exempted Regulation A offerings from federal-registration requirements, the offerings generally remained subject to state registration and merit-review restrictions, which increased compliance costs for the issuing company. This was especially true for a company desiring to issue securities in multiple states with varying substantive criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>A. National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA), Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416</p>\n<p id=\"A24\">Aware of the problems caused by concurrent state and federal regulation, the Congress enacted the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA), Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416. Designed to alleviate the \u201credundant, costly, and ineffective\u201d dual federal/state regulatory system, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-864, at 39, <em>reprinted in </em>1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3920, 3920, the NSMIA designated the federal government to oversee nation-wide securities offerings while allowing the states to retain control over small, regional or intrastate offerings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The NSMIA did so by amending section 18 of the Securities Act to preempt, on a widespread basis, state registration and qualification regimes for some offerings while leaving intact the states\u2019 authority to investigate fraud and to assess fees. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(c)(1), (c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The NSMIA achieved this goal by creating a list of \u201ccovered\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>preempted) securities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 77r(a)(1)(A). Covered securities include, <em>inter alia, </em>securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System and those issued by a registered investment company. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 77r(b)(1)-(2). The NSMIA also intended the SEC to play a role in determining its preemptive scope. Specifically, it included in its list of covered seeu-rities any security sold \u201cto qualified purchasers, as defined by the Commission by rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 77r(b)(3). It also granted the Commission authority to \u201cdefine the term \u2018qualified purchaser\u2019 differently with respect to different categories of securities, consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the view <em>of </em>both the House<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Senate<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> committees that advanced the NSMIA, \u201cqualified purchasers\u201d would not need state regulatory protection in light of their financial worth and sophistication.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In 2001, the SEC proposed a rule that would have defined \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d universally <em>(ie., </em>for <em>any </em>securities purchase) to mean \u201caccredited investor\u201d as defined by SEC Rule 501(a) of Regulation D. <em>See </em>Defining the Term \u201cQualified Purchaser\u201d Under the Securities Act of 1933, 66 Fed. Reg. 66,839 (Dec. 27, 2001). SEC Rule 501(a), in turn, provides a list of persons and entities deemed \u201caccredited investors,\u201d all of which possess greater-than-average levels of financial wherewithal. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.501(a). They include, for instance, business entities, banks, trusts and nonprofit organizations with total assets that exceed $5 million, as well as any natural person with a net worth exceeding $1 million. <em>See id. </em>The SEC never finalized the rule using the Rule 501(a) definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>B. Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS act), Pub. L. No. 112-106, 126 Stat. 306</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Following the most recent economic recession, in 2012 the Congress passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), Pub. L. No. 112-106, 126 Stat. 306 (2012). The JOBS Act was intended to spur job creation and economic growth by increasing small-business access to capital markets. By enacting Title IV of the JOBS Act (Title IV), the Congress meant to resuscitate the SEC\u2019s historically underutilized Regulation A. It did so in three ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">First, Title IV added section 3(b)(2) to the Securities Act, which directed the SEC to revamp Regulation A. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77c(b)(2). Specifically, section 3(b)(2) required the SEC to promulgate a rule adding a new class of securities to section 3\u2019s list of those exempt from federal-registration requirements. <em>See id. </em>It also sketched out the rough parameters for this new class. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 77c(b)(2)(A)-(G). For instance, it mandated that the aggregate offering amount of section 3(b)(2) securities was not to exceed $50 million and the sale of the securities was not to be restricted, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 77c(b)(2)(A), (C); it also provided the SEC with authority to create other requirements the Commission deemed necessary to advance the public interest and to protect investors. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 77c(b)(2)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Second, Title IV provided that some of the securities issued under the SEC\u2019s forthcoming section 3(b)(2) rule were to be exempt from state registration and qualification requirements. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(b)(4)(D). Title IV did so by expanding the section 18 \u201ccovered securities\u201d list to include securities issued pursuant to section 3(b)(2) so long as the securities were offered or sold either (1) on a national securities exchange or (2) \u201cto a qualified purchaser, as defined by the Commission pursuant to [section 18(b)(3) ] with respect to that purchase or sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An earlier iteration of Title IV would have also preempted state requirements for any section 3(b)(2) security offered or sold through a broker or dealer, <em>see </em>H.R. Rep. No. 112-206, 2 (2011), but, after some con-gressmembers expressed concern about the wide preemptive effect this provision would have,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it was removed before the bill became law.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Third, Title IV ordered the Comptroller General to conduct, within three months of the JOBS Act\u2019s enactment, a study to determine the effect of state blue-sky laws on Regulation A offerings. The Comptroller General complied and, in July 2012, reported that the limited use of Regulation A was caused, in part, by the cost of complying with state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">C. Section 3(b)(2) Rule</p>\n<p id=\"Afd\">On January 23, 2014, the SEC complied with the section 3(b)(2) mandate and proposed a rule designed to overhaul Regulation A. <em>See </em>Proposed Rule Amendments for Small and Additional Issues Exemptions Under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act, 79 Fed. Reg. 3,926 (Jan. 23, 2014). The SEC rule proposed the creation of two Regulation A offering \u201ctiers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3,927. Tier-1 was to apply to offerings up to $5 million and, for the most part, to employ the same federal controls Regulation A had used since its original promulgation in 1936.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Tier-2, in contrast, would apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>offerings up to $50 million and include additional investor safeguards. Some of the proposed safeguards were directed at Tier-2 issuers \u2014 for instance, the SEC proposed requiring issuers to provide audited financial disclosures with offering circulars and to file, on a continuing basis, annual and semiannual financial reports with the SEC. Other proposed safeguards were directed at Tier-2 purchasers \u2014 specifically, the SEC proposed capping Tier-2 purchases at 10 per cent of the investor\u2019s annual income or net worth, whichever is greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The proposed rule acknowledged the Comptroller General\u2019s conclusion that the cost of state blue-sky law compliance may have contributed to Regulation A\u2019s disuse. Many commenters also expressed concern about the cost of state law compliance and some proposed ways to alleviate the burden. For example, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), appearing as amicus here, proposed a coordinated state review process to harmonize different state substantive requirements. Most commenters, however, \u201cstrongly supported some form of state securities law preemption\u201d and the SEC received a variety of suggestions regarding potential \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d definitions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 3,969. As a result, the SEC announced that it intended to promulgate a qualified-purchaser definition to \u201cprotect offerees and investors in Regulation A securities, while streamlining compliance and reducing transaction costs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">On March 25, 2015, the SEC released Regulation A-Plus. After reviewing extensive public commentary on various qualified-purchaser definitions, the SEC defined the term as <em>\u201cany person </em>to whom securities are offered or sold pursuant to a Tier[-]2 offering of this Regulation A.\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. at 21,899 (emphasis added) (codified at 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.256). As a result, Regulation A-Plus preempted all state registration and qualification requirements for Tier-2 securities either (1) purchased by an \u201caccredited investor\u201d or (2) purchased by anyone else so long as the non-accredited investor refrained from purchasing securities valued at more than 10 per cent of his net worth or annual income.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 21,895-96, 21,899.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">As required by section 2(b), <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(b), Regulation A-Plus analyzed whether its qualified-purchaser definition protects investors and \u201cpromote[s] efficiency, competition, and capital formation.\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. at 21,864. It did so in light of the JOBS Act goal of \u201cexpanding] the capital raising options available to smaller and emerging companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21,865. After acknowledging that eliminating state-level review might reduce investor protection, <em>see id. </em>at 27,886-87, the SEC explained that \u201c[sjeveral factors could mitigate\u201d the risk, including the \u201csubstantial protections\u201d built into Tier-2 <em>offerings </em>\u2014 ie., the 10 per cent purchase cap and the <em>more </em>rigorous financial disclosure requirements for issuers, <em>id. </em>at 21,-887.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">On May 22, 2015, the petitioners filed timely petitions for review of the SEC\u2019s qualified-purchaser definition. Our jurisdiction arises under section 9 of the Securities Act, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77i, and section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>702 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The petitioners argue that the term qualified purchaser cannot mean <em>\u201cany </em>person\u201d to whom Tier-2 securities are offered or sold but instead must limit the universe of purchasers to those with enough financial wealth or sophistication to invest without state-law safeguards. Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 1, 3 (emphasis added). They insist that the SEC\u2019s rule fails both at <em>Chevron </em>Step 1 and at Step 2. They also argue that Regulation A-Plus must be vacated as arbitrary and capricious. We address their arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">A. <em>Chevron </em>Step One</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">In the petitioners\u2019 view, the SEC\u2019s qualified-purchaser definition, which does not restrict Tier-2 sales to wealthy and/or sophisticated investors, contravenes the plain meaning of the Securities Act. To succeed, they must demonstrate that the Securities Act \u201cunambiguously foreclosed\u201d the SEC\u2019s qualified-purchaser definition. <em>Vill. of Barrington, Ill. v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>636 F.3d 650, 659 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quotation marks omitted). They have not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">To discern the Congress\u2019s intent, we generally examine the statutory text, structure, purpose and its legislative history. <em>See Bell Atl. Tel. Co. v. FCC, </em>131 F.3d 1044, 1047 (D.C. Cir. 1997). That said, \u201c[t]he starting point for our interpretation of a statute is always its language,\u201d <em>Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, </em>490 U.S. 730, 739, 109 S.Ct. 2166, 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989), and, here, the language of section 18 confirms that the Congress has <em>not </em>\u201cdirectly spoken to the precise question at issue\u201d\u2014namely, the meaning of qualified purchaser in relation to state preemption. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. Instead, the Congress explicitly authorized the Commission to define the term, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(b)(3) (\u201cqualified purchased ]\u201d is to be \u201cdefined by the Commission by rule\u201d), and to adopt different definitions for different types of securities, <em>see id. </em>The explicit grant of definitional authority manifests that the Congress intended the SEC to enjoy broad discretion to decide who may purchase which securities without the encumbrance of state registration and qualification requirements. Exercising this grant, the SEC concluded that all purchasers of Tier-2 securities are qualified so long as non-accredited purchasers limit their purchase to 10 per cent of their annual income or net worth. Nothing in the text of the Securities Act \u201cunambiguously foreclose^\u201d the SEC from adopting this definition. <em>Vill. of Barrington, Ill., </em>636 F.3d at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">The petitioners nonetheless insist that the SEC\u2019s definition fails at <em>Chevron </em>step 1 because: (1) the commonly understood definition of \u201cqualified,\u201d which modifies \u201cpurchaser,\u201d means that the Commission must in some way reduce the universe of \u201cpurchasers\u201d from \u201cany purchaser\u201d; (2) the SEC\u2019s definition is not \u201cconsistent with the public interest and the protection of investors,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(b)(3); (3) Regulation A-Plus renders the word \u201cqualified\u201d superfluous and otherwise conflicts with the structure of the Securities Act; (4) federal securities law has always linked the term \u201cqualified\u201d with a purchaser\u2019s wealth or sophistication; .and (5) the NSMIA\u2019s legislative history demonstrates that the Congress wanted the SEC to limit a \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d to one with a certain level of wealth or sophistication. None of the petitioners\u2019 arguments is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">The petitioners\u2019 common-use argument is straightforward: in their view, the dictionary definition of \u201cqualified\u201d manifests that \u201cqualified purchasers\u201d cannot mean \u201call\u201d Tier-2 purchasers. But when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the \u201cCongress explicitly authorize^]\u201d an agency to \u201cdefine [a] term,'\u201d it \u201cnecessarily suggests that Congress did <em>not </em>intend the word to be applied in its plain meaning sense.\u201d <em>Women Involved in Farm, Econ. v. USDA, </em>876 F.2d 994, 1000 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And when the Congress enacted the NSMIA and the JOBS Act, it not only gave the Commission authority to determine which purchasers are qualified but it also permitted the Commission to define the term differently for different types of securities offerings. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(b)(3). The petitioners identify no statutory provision that bars the SEC from concluding that <em>all </em>Tier-2 purchasers are \u201cqualified\u201d in view of the other investor protections built into Tier-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Next, the petitioners argue that, because the Securities Act requires that any definition of qualified purchaser must advance \u201cthe public interest and the protection of investors,\u201d <em>id. </em>the SEC had to promulgate a definition tied to investor wealth or experience. But the Congress explicitly granted the SEC discretion to determine how best to protect the public and investors, <em>see id. </em>and the SEC, in exercising its discretion, concluded that Tier-2 investors are sufficiently protected by Tier-2\u2019s purchase cap and reporting requirements. <em>See </em>80 Fed. Reg. at 21,877. Although the petitioners lament that Tier-2 purchasers \u201cmay now lose up to 10 percent of their net worth in Regulation A[-Plus] offerings,\u201d Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 41,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> their challenge to the SEC\u2019s definition does not amount to an unambiguous statutory mandate that the SEC protect investors as the petitioners might prefer.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The petitioners also argue that the SEC definition conflicts with the Securities Act\u2019s structure because it (1) renders the term \u201cqualified\u201d superfluous, (2) nullifies the requirement that the definition serve the public interest and investor protection and (3) amounts to unlawful agency preemption of state law, which is a power possessed by the Congress alone. But the SEC did not nullify the term \u201cqualified\u201d; rather, it concluded that all Tier-2 purchasers are qualified. <em>See </em>80 Fed. Reg. at 21,899. And the SEC\u2019s definition does not ignore its obligation to promulgate a definition consistent with the best interests of the public and investors; rather, as discussed, <em>see supra </em>\u00a7 I.C, the SEC explained why it thought its definition achieved this goal. Finally, it was the <em>Congress, </em>not the SEC, that decided to preempt state registration and qualification requirements when a security is \u201coffered or sold to a qualified purchaser,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77r(b)(4)(D)(ii); by instructing the Commission to determine the circumstances under which a \u201cpurchaser\u201d is \u201cqualified,\u201d the Congress plainly intended the SEC to delineate the scope of state-law preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Undeterred, the petitioners argue that federal securities law has always construed the term \u201cqualified investor\u201d or \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d to mean a limited group with the ability to protect their interests. \"While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>it is true that some securities provisions associate the term \u201cqualified\u201d with a purchaser\u2019s ability to undertake financial risk,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the petitioners\u2019 argument proves only that when the Congress wishes to define \u201cqualified\u201d by reference to wealth or sophistication, it knows how to do so. Here, the Congress\u2019s decision to leave the definition to the SEC\u2019s discretion demonstrates that the Congress wanted to give the SEC wide latitude. At a minimum, the petitioners\u2019 argument falls short of establishing unambiguous congressional intent that a \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d meet a certain level of wealth or sophistication.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Finally, the petitioners argue that the NSMIA\u2019s legislative history makes plain that the Congress intended \u201cqualified purchaser\u201d to apply only to wealthy or sophisticated investors. As noted, both the Senate<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and House<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> committees that advanced the NSMIA believed that qualified purchasers could fend for themselves without state-law protection. But \u201ceven the most formidable argument concerning the statute\u2019s purposes [cannot] overcome the clarity [found] in the statute\u2019s' text,\u201d <em>Kloeckner v. Solis, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 596, 607 n. 4, 184 L.Ed.2d 433 (2012), and \u201conly rarely have we relied on legislative history to constrict the otherwise broad application of a statute indicated by its text,\u201d <em>Consumer Elecs. Ass\u2019n v. FCC, </em>347 F.3d 291, 298 (D.C. Cir. 2003); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201c[W]hile such history can be used to clarify congressional intent even when a statute is superficially unambiguous, the bar is high.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). To accept the petitioners\u2019 legislative-history argument would be to . \u201cabandon altogether the text of the statute as a guide in the interpretative process.\u201d <em>Shannon v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 573, 583, 114 S.Ct. 2419, 129 L.Ed.2d 459 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Because Regulation A-Plus does not conflict with the Congress\u2019s unambiguous intent, it does not falter at <em>Chevron </em>Step 1 and, accordingly, we proceed to <em>Chevron </em>step 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">B. <em>Chevron </em>Step Two</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">The petitioners also argue that the SEC\u2019s qualified-purchaser definition is unreasonable and therefore fails at <em>Chevron </em>Step 2. Typically, at <em>Chevron </em>Step 2, we defer to the Commission so long as its definition is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. But \u201c[because Congress has authorized the Commission ... to prescribe legislative rules, we owe the Commission\u2019s judgment more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>mere deference or weight.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Hagan, </em>521 U.S. 642, 673, 117 S.Ct. 2199, 138 L.Ed.2d 724 (1997) (quotation marks omitted). Indeed, where, as here, \u201cthere is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,\u201d we give the regulation \u201ccontrolling weight unless [it is] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <em>see also United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 227, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001) (\u201cWhen Congress has explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill, ... any ensuing regulation is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The petitioners insist that the SEC\u2019s qualified-purchaser definition \u201cis actually \u2018manifestly contrary to the statute\u2019 \u201d because it imposes no restrictions based on investor wealth, income or sophistication. Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 57 (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778). Their <em>Chevron </em>Step 2 arguments mirror their <em>Chevron </em>Step 1 arguments and, for all of the reasons set out in our <em>Chevron </em>Step 1 discussion, we believe the SEC acted reasonably and within its broad definitional authority when it decided that all Tier-2 investors are considered \u201cqualified purchasers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The petitioners advance three additional <em>Chevron </em>Step 2 arguments but none has merit. First, they insist that we must apply a presumption against preemption, according the SEC no deference because, in then-view, the Congress\u2019s preemptive purpose was not \u201cclear and manifest.\u201d <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996) (quotation marks omitted). We have, however, \u201crejected the argument that wherever a federal agency\u2019s exercise of authority will preempt state power, <em>Chevron </em>deference is inappropriate.\u201d <em>Albany Eng\u2019g Corp. v. FERC, </em>548 F.3d 1071, 1074 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted). In any event, the Congress\u2019s decision to exempt \u201cqualified purchasers\u201d from state requirements <em>was </em>\u201cclear and manifest,\u201d <em>Medtronic, Inc., </em>518 U.S. at 485, 116 S.Ct. 2240, as was its decision to authorize the SEC, in its discretion, to determine the scope of state preemption by defining when a \u201cpurchaser\u201d is \u201cqualified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The petitioners\u2019 second argument is that the SEC failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its definition. Although an agency enjoys <em>Chevron </em>Step 2 deference \u201conly if [it] has offered a reasoned explanation for why it chose that interpretation,\u201d <em>Vill. of Barrington, Ill., </em>636 F.3d at 660, the SEC did in fact explain how its \u201cfinal rules for Regulation A will provide for a meaningful addition to the existing capital formation options of smaller companies while maintaining important investor protections.\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. at 21,813. The Commission explained that its definition protects investors because Tier-2 offerings require that offerors provide audited financial statements to purchasers and to the SEC on a recurring basis; it also explained that non-accredited Tier-2 purchasers are not permitted to risk more than 10 per cent of their annual income or net worth. <em>Id. </em>at 21,858, 21,861. The SEC further explained how its definition helps to revitalize Regulation A, which was the Congress\u2019s primary purpose in enacting the JOBS Act. <em>Id. </em>at 21,858-59. For these reasons, we find that the SEC has \u201ccogently explained] why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner\u201d and its \u201cexplanation [is] ... sufficient to enable us to conclude that [its action] was the product of reasoned decisionmaking.\u201d <em>U.S. Telecomm. Ass\u2019n v. FCC, </em>227 F.3d 450, 460 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The petitioners\u2019 third argument is that the SEC failed to explain why its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>qualified-purchaser definition changed from the qualified-purchaser definition it proposed (but never finalized) in 2001. We disagree. It bears noting at the outset that \u201c[a]n initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone,\u201d <em>Anna Jacques Hosp. v. Burwell, </em>797 F.3d 1155, 1170 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 863, 104 S.Ct. 2778). Moreover, \u201ca proposed regulation does not represent an agency\u2019s considered interpretation of its statute and ... an agency is entitled to consider alternative interpretations before settling on the view it considers most sound,\u201d <em>CFTC v. Schor, </em>478 U.S. 833, 845, 106 S.Ct. 3245, 92 L.Ed.2d 675 (1986). Moreover, the Commission explained that its 2001 proposed definition \u201ccontemplated that state securities review and qualification requirements would be preempted\u201d for <em>all </em>securities although its \u201crules to implement Title IV of the JOBS Act provide for preemption in the more limited circumstances in which the requirements of [sjection 3(b)(2) and the rules adopted thereunder are satisfied.\u201d 80 Fed. Reg. at 21,859. Given the \u201cnew and different context\u201d outlined in Title IV, <em>id. </em>at 21,860, the SEC explained that, notwithstanding it may have been appropriate \u201cto focus on attributes of the purchaser when crafting a \u2018qualified purchaser\u2019 definition that would have applied in a broad set of possible transactions,\u201d its Tier-2 qualified-purchaser definition \u201cserves a different purpose because it applies only in Regulation A offerings,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 21,559-60, which, as already discussed, include additional investor safeguards. <em>See supra </em>\u00a7 I.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Because the Commission\u2019s qualified-purchaser definition is not \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute,\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, it does not fail <em>Chevron </em>Step 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">C. APA Review</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Finally, the petitioners challenge Regulation A-Plus as arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). A \u201crule is arbitrary and capricious\u201d if an \u201cagency fail[s] to consider ... a factor the agency must consider under its organic statute,\u201d <em>Pub. Citizen v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin., </em>374 F.3d 1209, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 2004); section 2(b) of the Securities Act requires that, if the Commission \u201cconsider[s] or determine[s] whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest,\u201d it must also \u201cconsider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(b). This inquiry contemplates that the Commission will \u201cdetermine as best it can the economic implications of the rule.\u201d <em>Chamber of Commerce v. SEC, </em>412 F.3d 133, 143 (D.C. Cir. 2005). In the petitioners\u2019 view, the Commission failed to discharge this duty when it \u201coffered only a single paragraph to explain why existing state law and the new rule might lessen the adverse effects of \u2018blue sky\u2019 preemption.\u201d Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">We disagree. By providing a reasoned analysis of how its qualified-purchaser definition strikes the \u201cappropriate balance between mitigating cost and time demands on issuers and <em>providing investor protections,\u201d </em>80 Fed. Reg. at 21,888 (emphasis added), the Commission has complied with its statutory obligation. It considered the benefits of blue-sky review, concluding that it \u201cmay aid in detecting fraud and facilitating issuer compliance\u201d by providing another level of investor protection. <em>Id. </em>at 21,886-87. It also considered the costs imposed on issuers by blue-sky review, relying on the Comptroller General\u2019s conclusion that state registration and qualification requirements stymied Regulation A\u2019s use in recent years. <em>See id. </em>at 21,868. After discussing the Tier-2 protections afforded to investors in the absence of state law <em>review </em>\u2014 e.g., federal and state anti-fraud enforcement authority, enhanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>and continuing issuer disclosure requirements and the 10 per cent purchase cap\u2014 the SEC concluded that the Tier-2 requirements \u201creduce[d] the need for, and the expected benefits of, state review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21,887. Given the JOBS Act mandate to revitalize Regulation A, the SEC concluded that the potential decrease in investor protection was balanced by the reduced costs for Tier-2 issuers and purchasers. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-15\">In the petitioners\u2019 view, the rule should nonetheless be vacated because the SEC failed to show that Tier-2\u2019s safeguards \u201cwill <em>actually </em>mitigate the identified costs of preemption.\u201d Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 67 (emphasis added). For its part, amicus NASAA faults the SEC for relying on \u201clittle to no evidence\u201d regarding the costs of state-law compliance and state-law preemption. NA-SAA Br. 26-27.' But, as noted, Regulation A was rarely used, which means that the Commission did not have the data necessary to quantify precisely the risks of preemption for investors and the costs of state-law compliance for issuers. We do not require the Commission \u201cto measure the immeasurable\u201d and we do not require it to \u201cconduct a rigorous, quantitative economic analysis unless the statute explicitly directs it to do so.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v.
