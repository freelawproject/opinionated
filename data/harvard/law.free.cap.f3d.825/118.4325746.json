As relevant here, McGowan asserted claims for violation of his First Amendment rights under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and for false imprisonment and negligence under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680. The district court dismissed McGowan\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim on the ground that there is no private right of action for violation of a federal prisoner\u2019s First Amendment rights. It dismissed McGowan\u2019s false imprisonment claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and dismissed his negligence claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We affirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the dismissal of McGowan\u2019s negligence claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and we affirm the dismissal of his remaining claims on alternative grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">On June 4, 2007, following his conviction in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon on multiple counts of arson, attempted arson, and conspiracy to commit arson, McGowan was sentenced principally to eighty-four months\u2019 incarceration. On December 11, 2012, he was transferred to Brooklyn House Residential Reentry Center (\u201cRRC\u201d) to serve the remainder of his sentence. McGowan alleges that, at Brooklyn House RRC, he received daily work passes, which allowed him to maintain full-time employment as a receptionist, and enjoyed privileges such as weekend home visits, unrestricted use of the internet, a shopping pass, and the opportunity to apply to attend social events.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On April 1, 2013, McGowan published an article on the Huffington Post website under his own byline. <em>See </em>Daniel McGowan, <em>Court Documents Prove I was Sent to a Communications Management Unit (CMU) for my Political Speech, </em>Huffing-ton Post (Apr. 1, 2013, 8:36 AM), http:// www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-mcgowan/ communication-management-units_b_ 2944580.html. In the article, McGowan asserted that, while serving his federal sentence, he had been placed in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit in retaliation for publishing political opinion pieces. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">McGowan alleges that, shortly after his article appeared online, defendant Tracy Rivers, the Residential Reentry Manager at the New York Residential Reentry Management Office of the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d), determined that he should be issued an incident report and remanded to a federal detention center. The incident report stated that McGowan had violated \u201cBOP Program Statement no. 1480.05 dated September 21, 2000; 540.62 page 5, section (d),\u201d which provided that \u201can inmate currently confined in an institution may not be employed or act as a reporter or publish under a byline\u201d (the \u201cByline Regulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">However, unbeknownst to Rivers, by the time these events occurred, the Byline Regulation had been rescinded. Specifically, in August 2007, a district court in Colorado held that the Byline Regulation was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. <em>See Jordan v. Pugh, </em>504 F.Supp.2d 1109, 1124 (D. Colo. 2007). On November 27, 2007, the BOP issued mandatory guidance to its staff instructing them not to enforce it. On April 23, 2010, the BOP published an interim rule rescinding the Byline Regulation, and finalized that rule on May 3, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">McGowan alleges that on April 4, 2013, he was taken from Brooklyn House RRC to the Metropolitan Detention Center and placed in the Special Housing Unit (\u201cSHU\u201d). After McGowan\u2019s lawyers contacted the BOP, Kerry P. Kemble, Assistant Administrator of the Residential Reentry Management Branch of the BOP, informed Rivers that the Byline Regulation had been rescinded. Kemble and Rivers agreed to expunge the incident report and return McGowan to Brooklyn House RRC. McGowan returned to Brooklyn House RRC on April 5, 2013, having spent approximately twenty-two hours in the SHU.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">McGowan commenced this action on August 20, 2014, and filed his Amended Complaint on November 12, 2014. As relevant here, he asserted claims for: (1) violation of his First Amendment rights against Tracy Rivers under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971); (2) false im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>prisonment against the United States under the FTCA; and (3) negligence against the United States under the FTCA. McGowan also brought state law claims against Core Services Group, Inc. d/b/a Community First Services, Inc., the private operator of Brooklyn House RRC; those claims are not at issue in this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">On March 23, 2015, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss McGowan\u2019s Amended Complaint. First, it declined to recognize a <em>Bivens </em>remedy for violations of federal prisoners\u2019 First Amendment rights. <em>McGowan v. United States, </em>94 F.Supp.3d 382, 387-90 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). Second, it held that McGowan failed to state a claim for false imprisonment because, as an inmate serving a lawful sentence, his confinement was \u201cuncategori-cally privileged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. Third, it held that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to hear McGowan\u2019s FTCA negligence claim because there was no \u201cprivate analogue\u201d to the BOP\u2019s allegedly negligent failure to follow its own regulation. <em>Id. </em>at 392-94. Having dismissed all of McGowan\u2019s federal claims, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims. <em>Id. </em>at 394. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">I. <em>Bivens </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In <em>Bivens, </em>the Supreme Court recognized \u201can implied private action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 66, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001) (citing <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971)). We have established a two-step process for determining whether a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is available for an alleged constitutional injury. \u201cFirst, the court must determine whether the underlying claims extend <em>Bivens </em>into a \u2018new context.\u2019 \u201d <em>Turkmen v. Hasty, </em>789 F.3d 218, 234 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Arar v. Ashcroft, </em>585 F.3d 559, 572 (2d Cir. 2009)). If the plaintiffs claims arise in a new context, the court then asks \u201c(a) \u2018whether there is an alternative remedial scheme available to the plaintiff,\u2019 and, even if there is not, (b) \u201cwhether special factors counsel hesitation in creating a <em>Bivens </em>remedy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Arar, </em>585 F.3d at 572).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">McGowan argues that his claim does not require us to extend <em>Bivens </em>to a new context, and, even if it did, that there is no adequate \u201calternative remedial scheme\u201d and no \u201cspecial factor[] counseling] hesitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, he argues, the district court erred in refusing to recognize a <em>Bivens </em>remedy. We need not decide this difficult issue, however, because we conclude that McGowan\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim fails for the independent reason that defendant Rivers is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">Although we generally decline to consider arguments that were not passed on by the district court, this principle is prudential, not jurisdictional. <em>See Fabrikant v. French, </em>691 F.3d 193, 212 (2d Cir. 2012). We retain discretion to consider such arguments based on factors such as \u201cthe interests of judicial economy\u201d and \u201cwhether the unaddressed issues present pure questions of law.\u201d <em>Bacolitsas v. 86th &amp; 3rd Owner, LLC, </em>702 F.3d 673, 681 (2d Cir. 2012). Both of these factors are present here. The issue of qualified immunity was presented in the district court, has been fully briefed on appeal, and turns on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the purely legal question of whether McGowan alleged a violation of a clearly established right. <em>See Fabrikant, </em>691 F.3d at 212 (\u201cThe matter of whether a right was clearly established at the pertinent time is a question of law.\u201d (quoting <em>Dean v. Blumenthal, </em>577 F.3d 60, 67 n.6 (2d Cir. 2009))). It is therefore appropriate for us to consider the defense of qualified immunity on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u201cThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages \u2018unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the challenged conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wood v. Moss, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2056, 2066-67, 188 L.Ed.2d 1039 (2014) (quoting <em>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, </em>563 U.S. 731, 735, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011)). For a right to be \u201cclearly established,\u201d the \u201ccontours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). In making this determination, we consider Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent as it existed at the time of the challenged conduct. <em>See Garcia v. Does, </em>779 F.3d 84, 92 (2d Cir. 2014). Nonetheless, the \u201c \u2018absence of a decision by this Court or the Supreme Court directly addressing the right at issue will not preclude a finding that the law was clearly established\u2019 so long as preexisting law \u2018clearly foreshadow[s] a particular ruling on the issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tellier v. Fields, </em>280 F.3d 69, 84 (2d Cir. 2000)). A court may \u201cgrant qualified immunity on the ground that a purported right was not \u2018clearly established\u2019 by prior case law, without resolving the often more difficult question whether the purported right exists at all.\u201d <em>Reichle v. Howards, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2088, 2093, 182 L.Ed.2d 985 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">We conclude that, at the time the alleged violation occurred, our case law did not clearly establish that McGowan had a First Amendment right to publish his article. The Supreme Court has held that \u201cwhen a prison regulation impinges on inmates\u2019 constitutional rights, the regulation is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987). This test is \u201cparticularly deferential to the informed discretion of corrections officials\u201d where \u201caccommodation of an asserted right will have a significant \u2018ripple effect\u2019 on fellow inmates or on prison staff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 107 S.Ct. 2254. For example, the Supreme Court has upheld \u201cproscriptions of media interviews with individual inmates, prohibitions on the activities of a prisoners\u2019 labor union, and restrictions on inmate-to-inmate written correspondence.\u201d <em>Shaw v. Murphy, </em>532 U.S. 223, 229, 121 S.Ct. 1475, 149 L.Ed.2d 420 (2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-12\">We have not identified any binding authority in existence at the relevant time that either \u201cdirectly address[ed]\u201d the reasonableness of the challenged conduct or \u201cclearly foreshadowfed]\u201d a ruling in McGowan\u2019s favor, <em>Garcia, </em>779 F.3d at 92, nor has McGowan cited any such case. McGowan relies instead on cases establishing the right of a prisoner to be free from retaliation for filing a lawsuit or grievance. <em>See Espinal v. Goord, </em>558 F.3d 119, 128-29 (2d Cir. 2009); <em>Davis v. Goord, </em>320 F.3d 346, 352-53 (2d Cir. 2003); <em>Gayle v. Gonyea, </em>313 F.3d 677, 683 (2d Cir. 2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>But a prisoner\u2019s publishing a bylined article may implicate different penological interests from those implicated by his filing a lawsuit or grievance. For example, in litigating the constitutionality of the Byline Regulation in the District of Colorado, the government took the position that allowing inmates to publish bylined articles could create security problems by permitting such inmates to become \u201cbig wheels\u201d in the prison community, or could incite violence, or could intimidate prison staff members. <em>See Jordan, </em>504 F.Supp.2d at 1120-23. Whether or not we would agree with that analysis is beside the point. We conclude only that, in light of the different interests at stake, our case law establishing a prisoner\u2019s right to file a lawsuit or grievance does not clearly establish a prisoner\u2019s right to publish an article under a byline. Indeed, the only authority that McGowan has identified that involved expression similar to that at issue in this ease is a district court opinion, which, of course, is not binding. <em>See Shaheen v. Filion, </em>No. 9:04-CV-625 (FJS/DRH), 2006 WL 2792739, at *3 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Thus, in light of the absence of authority clearly establishing the claimed right, we are constrained to hold that Rivers is entitled to qualified immunity from McGowan\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim. In so holding, we do not reach the question of whether Rivers violated McGowan\u2019s First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">II. FTCA Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u201cThe United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued ..., and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\u201d <em>Liranzo v. United States, </em>690 F.3d 78, 84 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980)). Subject to certain exceptions, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680, the FTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United States against claims for property damage or personal injury \u201ccaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1346(b)(1); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 2674. Accordingly, \u201cfor liability to arise under the FTCA, a plaintiffs cause of action must be \u2018comparable\u2019 to a \u2018cause of action against a private citizen\u2019 recognized in the jurisdiction where the tort occurred.\u201d <em>Chen v. United States, </em>854 F.2d 622, 626 (2d Cir. 1988) (quoting <em>C.P. Chem. v. United States, </em>810 F.2d 34, 37 (2d Cir. 1987)). This \u201cprivate analogue\u201d requirement asks \u201cwhether a private person would be responsible for similar negligence under the laws of the State where the acts occurred.\u201d <em>Dorking Genetics v. United States, </em>76 F.3d 1261, 1266 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting <em>Rayonier Inc. v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 315, 319, 77 S.Ct. 374, 1 L.Ed.2d 354 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">\u201cWhen reviewing the dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>accepting all material facts alleged in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Liranzo, </em>690 F.3d at 84. \u201cThe plaintiff bears the burden of proving subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Aurecchione v. Schoolman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>Transp. Sys., Inc., </em>426 F.3d 635, 638 (2d Cir. 2005). The United States\u2019 waiver of immunity under the FTCA \u201cis to be strictly construed in favor of the government.\u201d <em>Long Island Radio Co. v. NLRB, </em>841 F.2d 474, 477 (2d Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">McGowan asserts claims under the FTCA for false imprisonment and negligence. Under New York law, the elements of the tort of false imprisonment are: \u201c(1) the defendant intended to conf\u00edne [the plaintiff], (2) the plaintiff was conscious of the confinement, (3) the plaintiff did not consent to the confinement and (4) the confinement was not otherwise privileged.\u201d <em>Broughton v. State, </em>37 N.Y.2d 451, 373 N.Y.S.2d 87, 335 N.E.2d 310, 314 (1975). The district court held that McGowan failed to state a claim for false imprisonment on the ground that the government\u2019s confinement of an inmate pursuant to a lawful judgment is \u201cuncategorically privileged.\u201d <em>McGowan v. United States, </em>94 F.Supp.3d 382, 390 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). It also noted that the government argued that McGowan\u2019s false imprisonment claim lacked a private analogue, but declined to rely on that ground. <em>See id. </em>at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On appeal, McGowan argues that the district court erred in concluding that his confinement was \u201cuncategorically privileged\u201d because New York law recognizes a tort of \u201cwrongful confinement\u201d of an inmate within solitary confinement or keep-lock. <em>See Ramirez v. State, </em>171 Misc.2d 677, 655 N.Y.S.2d 791, 794 (N.Y. Ct. Cl. 1997). Some New York courts have described the tort of wrongful confinement as a \u201cspecies of false imprisonment.\u201d <em>Gittens v. State, </em>132 Misc.2d 399, 504 N.Y.S.2d 969, 974 (N.Y. Ct. Cl. 1986). To recover for wrongful confinement, a prisoner must demonstrate that \u201che had been subjected to punitive segregation for no legitimate reason and without the rudimentary protections of due process.\u201d <em>Willey v. Kirkpatrick, </em>801 F.3d 51, 71 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Gittens, </em>504 N.Y.S.2d at 972). McGowan argues that he adequately stated a claim for wrongful confinement under New York law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">The parties dispute whether McGowan forfeited his wrongful confinement argument by failing to raise it in the district court. Whether or not this argument has been forfeited, however, it fails for the independent reason that the tort of wrongful confinement lacks a private analogue. McGowan asserts, without citation, that the tort of wrongful confinement could run against municipalities and their employees. Even assuming that he is correct, the Supreme Court has made clear that the relevant inquiry is the liability of a \u201cprivate person\u201d under State law, not that of a \u201cstate or municipal entity.\u201d <em>United States v. Olson, </em>546 U.S. 43, 45-46, 126 S.Ct. 510, 163 L.Ed.2d 306 (2005). Accordingly, the liability of municipalities or municipal actors performing governmental functions cannot serve as a private analogue.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">McGowan further posits that private contractors operating local, state, or federal detention facilities could provide the requisite private analogue. He cites no authority for the proposition that private contractors can be held liable for wrongful confinement under New York law. Even assuming that they can, when private prison contractors perform governmental functions pursuant to contracts with governmental entities, they are not similarly situated to any private actor. The private analogue inquiry asks whether \u201c[p]rivate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>individuals ... may create a relationship with third parties that is similar to the relationship between\u201d a governmental actor and a citizen, not whether a government contractor could create such a relationship. <em>Olson, </em>546 U.S. at 47, 126 S.Ct. 510; <em>cf. Liranzo, </em>690 F.3d at 94-95 (focusing on state-law liability of a person acting \u201centirely in his or her private capacity\u201d). Private persons cannot establish facilities to detain other persons \u2014 only the government can, either on its own or through a governmental contractor. In short, there is no circumstance in state tort law that is analogous to the situation here. Accordingly, there is no private analogue to McGowan\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">McGowan\u2019s FTCA negligence claim also fails. McGowan alleges that the BOP negligently failed to follow its own disciplinary regulations. We addressed a similar claim in <em>Chen v. United States, </em>in which the plaintiff, a federal contractor, alleged that the General Services Administration negligently misapplied federal procurement regulations, causing him to lose a lucrative contract. <em>See </em>854 F.2d at 624-25. We held that the plaintiffs claim was not actionable under the FTCA. First, we held that \u201cviolation of the government\u2019s duties under federal procurement regulations \u2018is action of the type that private persons could not engage in and hence could not be liable for under local law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626 (quoting <em>Jayvee Brand v. United States, </em>721 F.2d 385, 390 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). Second, we held that, even if the plaintiffs proposed private analogue \u2014 \u201cwrongful sanctions by private associations against individual members\u201d \u2014 were analogous to the government\u2019s alleged conduct, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that New York law \u201crecognizes a cause of action <em>in tort\u201d </em>for such conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 626-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">McGowan\u2019s claim, like Chen\u2019s, is grounded solely on the government\u2019s failure to follow applicable regulations. <em>See id. </em>He contends that the relevant private analogue is a private party\u2019s failure to follow its own internal regulations. Even if that situation were analogous to the one presented here, however, McGowan has failed to establish that New York law recognizes a freestanding duty to abide by private regulations. The cases on which he relies establish only that failure to do so constitutes <em>evidence </em>of negligence, not negligence in itself. <em>See Cruz v. Madison Detective Bureau, Inc., </em>137 A.D.2d 86, 91, 528 N.Y.S.2d 372 (1st Dep\u2019t 1988) (holding that security company\u2019s failure to follow procedures was evidence of negligence); <em>Haber v. Cross County Hosp., </em>37 N.Y.2d 888, 889, 378 N.Y.S.2d 369, 340 N.E.2d 734 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1975) (\u201c[T]he hospital\u2019s failure to abide by its own rule is some evidence of negligence.\u201d); <em>see also Florence v. Goldberg, </em>44 N.Y.2d 189, 404 N.Y.S.2d 583, 375 N.E.2d 763, 767 (1978) (suggesting that police department\u2019s adoption of rules and regulations relating to provision of crossing guards was evidence that it assumed a duty to supervise school cross<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ings); <em>Danbois v. N.Y. Cent. R. Co., </em>12 N.Y.2d 234, 238 N.Y.S.2d 921, 189 N.E.2d 468, 471 (1963) (\u201cViolation of [company rules] ... is not negligence in itself but under certain circumstances may be regarded by the trier of fact as some evidence of negligence.\u201d). Accordingly, McGowan has not \u201cshow[n] a violation of a duty for which the applicable state law would provide recovery.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>854 F.2d at 627 (quoting <em>Myers &amp; Myers, Inc. v. U.S.P.S., </em>527 F.2d 1252, 1261 (2d Cir. 1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"Ay2L\">Finally, to the extent that McGowan asserts a theory of negligence <em>per se, </em>it is well established in New York law that \u201cviolation of a rule of an administrative agency is merely some evidence of negligence but does not establish negligence as a matter of law because a regulation lacks the force and effect of a statute.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>854 F.2d at 627 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ALJ\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court correctly dismissed McGowan\u2019s negligence claim on the ground that it lacks a private analogue.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">ConClusion</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">For the reasons stated herein, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-9\">. Defendants Grace Terry, Massiel Suriel, and Unknown United States Marshals were not named in the Amended Complaint and also are not parties to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. McGowan also cites a case relating to a prisoner's free exercise rights. <em>See Holland v. Goord, </em>758 F.3d 215, 225-26 (2d Cir. 2014). That case was decided over a year after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>conduct at issue in this case, and therefore is not relevant to the state of clearly established law at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-6\">. McGowan does not, on appeal, challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion as it applies to ordinary claims of false imprisonment, as distinct from prisoners\u2019 claims of wrongful confinement. Accordingly, he has abandoned such challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\">. The FTCA does not waive sovereign immunity for claims of false imprisonment, excepting those false imprisonment claims arising from the \"acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers of the United States Government,\u201d which are defined as \"any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h). The government does not challenge Rivers' status as an \"investigative or law enforcement officer[],\u201d and we have previously recognized that BOP employees so qualify based on their authority to make arrests under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3050. <em>See Hernandez v. Lattimore, </em>612 F.2d 61, 64 n.7 (2d Cir. 1979). Nonetheless, the record is silent on this issue, so we assume without deciding that Rivers is an \u201cinvestigative or law enforcement officer[]\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
