Stat. \u00a7 394.917(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>federal habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court dismissed Kakuk\u2019s petition as untimely because he was required to file his federal petition within one year of his initial commitment becoming final, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Alternatively, the district court found that even if timely, Kakuk\u2019s petition lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">We subsequently granted a certificate of appealability on the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-10\">In light of the requirement imposed by Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.918 that a court examine the \u201cmental condition\u201d of a person committed under the Jimmy Ryce Act at least once every year, was Mr. Kakuk\u2019s habeas petition properly dismissed as untimely?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination that a petition for federal habeas corpus relief was time-barred under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). <em>Moore v. Crosby, </em>321 F.3d 1377, 1379 (11th Cir.2003). We have noted that <em>pro se </em>pleadings should be liberally construed. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">Florida law provides that the mental condition of a person committed under the Jimmy Ryce Act \u201cshall\u201d be examined at least every year so that the court may conduct a review of the person\u2019s status. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 394.918(1). The court then \u201cshall\u201d hold a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the person\u2019s condition has changed so that he will not engage in acts of sexual violence if released. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 394.918(3). If the court finds probable cause, the court \u201cshall\u201d hold a trial on the issue, at which the state has the burden of proving that it is not safe for the defendant to be released. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 394.918(3)-(4). If the court does not find probable cause, it issues an order which may be appealed. <em>See Fuery v. State, </em>968 So.2d 77 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 4th Dist.2007) (reviewing, on direct appeal, a trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>order that there was not probable cause to release a prisoner from his civil commitment under the Jimmy Ryce Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Now with the benefit of counsel, Kakuk urges that, construing his petition liberally, his federal habeas petition was actually challenging the procedural adequacy of his most recent probable cause determination, not the constitutionality of his initial confinement. Contending that this most recent probable cause determination constitutes a new order which is final and ap-pealable for the purposes of AEDPA, Ka-kuk argues that his current petition would be timely. However, giving the petition the liberal reading to which it is entitled, we conclude that he did not intend to challenge any specific probable cause determination, but rather intended to challenge his confinement under the Jimmy Ryce Act more generally. <em>See Tannenbaum, </em>148 F.3d at 1263. Although his petition does make mention of the the probable cause review process, that discussion is limited to pointing to certain provisions in the Jimmy Ryce Act as evidence that the Act itself violates his rights, rather than claiming that a particular determination was constitutionally deficient. As further evidence that his challenge is to his initial confinement, not to the procedural adequacies of a particular probable cause determination, the relief Kakuk seeks is release from civil confinement, not a probable cause hearing with proper due process protections. Because it is clear that Kakuk sought to challenge his initial confinement under the act, which was initially affirmed in 2005, his petition is untimely. However, this does not preclude any future challenge to future annual probable cause determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Under these circumstances, the district court properly found that Kakuk\u2019s commitment determination became final on February 26, 2006 \u2014 90 days after the Supreme Court of Florida denied Kakuk\u2019s direct appeal \u2014 rendering his federal habe-as petition challenging his original confinement filed on July 5, 2010, untimely. The district court also properly found that, to the extent Kakuk sought to challenge the general adequacy of the annual review provisions, as opposed to any specific determination, the petition was also untimely under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-11\">. Under Florida\u2019s Jimmy Ryce Act, upon petition from the state attorney, a judge is entitled to find probable cause that a person is a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d and order that the person remain in custody, even beyond the expiration of his criminal prison sentence. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.915(1). Within 30 days of a probable cause determination, the defendant is entitled to a jury trial to determine if he is a \u201csexually violent predator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 394.916. If the jury finds that the defendant is a \"sexually violent predator,\u201d then the defendant is committed to the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services upon the expiration of his prison sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 394.917(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b926-17\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) establishes a one-year statute of limitations period for petitions filed under \u00a7 2254.
