Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). As to the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), the judgment is affirmed because it is a state agency that is immune from damages actions pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Lewis v. Univ. of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, </em>665 F.3d 625, 630 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-24\">As to Dr. Elena Estefan, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded. First, it is unclear from the face of the complaint whether Horne exhausted prison administrative remedies. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007) (holding that exhaustion is an affirmative defense that prisoners cannot be required to plead or prove exhaustion); <em>Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007) (allowing dismissal for failure to exhaust when it is plain from the face of the complaint). Second, Horne\u2019s allegation that Dr. Estefan discovered a detached retina, did not treat it, and did not tell him about it, leading to a one-year delay in treatment, is sufficient to state a claim of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-25\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
