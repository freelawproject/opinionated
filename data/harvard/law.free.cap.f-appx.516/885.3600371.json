On appeal, Howard argues that his counsel during the revocation proceedings was ineffective and that his sentence is unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">A. Petition for Revocation of Supervised Release</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">In 2002, Defendant Howard pled guilty to unlawful possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and was sentenced to 170 months in prison, followed by 5 years of supervised release. Later, Howard\u2019s sentence was reduced to 120 months, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). On November 10, 2011, Howard completed his prison term and began supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">On February 13, 2012, Defendant Howard\u2019s probation officer petitioned the district court for a warrant to arrest Howard and to revoke his supervised release. The petition charged that Howard had violated the terms of his supervised release by, on February 6, 2012, committing the offenses of aggravated assault, battery, cruelty to children, and criminal trespass-damage to property. According to the probation officer\u2019s revocation report, these offenses occurred when Defendant Howard physically attacked his wife at their shared residence while their two sons were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">The district court issued an arrest warrant, which was executed by the U.S. Marshals on February 14, 2012. The revocation report stated that, because Howard had committed a Grade A violation and his criminal history category at the time of his original offense was VI, his recommended imprisonment range was 51 to 63 months, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. Howard did not object to these calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">B. Revocation Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">At the outset of the revocation hearing, the government asked to place on the record a plea offer Defendant Howard had rejected. The prosecutor stated that if Howard admitted to the battery and cruelty to children offenses, the federal prosecutor agreed to not make a sentencing recommendation at the revocation hearing and the assistant district attorney handling Howard\u2019s parallel state case agreed to let the state sentence run concurrent to the federal sentence. The prosecutor advised the court that Howard\u2019s \u201ccase at the state level remains viable.\u201d Although the prosecutor did not know the penalties for the state offenses, he assumed they would be substantially higher than the five-year sentence Howard faced in federal court. Defense counsel responded, \u201cjust for the record, on the state case, the aggravated assault carries up to 20 years. The three misdemeanors ... each carry[ ] up to 12 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">The district court heard testimony from the victim, Gavrila Howard, and the two police officers who responded at her residence on February 6, 2012. According to their testimony, Defendant Howard hit his wife in the face and head, scratched her neck with an eyebrow shaper (a plastic implement with a small razor at the end), slammed her head into the wall, creating a hole in the drywall, and threw her to the floor, where he stomped and kicked her. Two children were in the home, and their twelve-year-old son saw his father hit his mother\u2019s head on the wall and stomp on her head. As a result of the attack, Mrs. Howard had bruises on her neck and arm, knots on her head and a cut on her throat and was treated at the emergency room. Mrs. Howard also reported that on a previous occasion, Defendant Howard punched her and broke several of her ribs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>The government also submitted the eyewitness statements given to the police and police photographs of Mrs. Howard\u2019s injuries and damage to the wall and a bedroom door of her residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">During the hearing, however, defense counsel elicited testimony about inconsistencies in Mrs. Howard\u2019s version of events. For example, although the two officers testified that, on February 6, Mrs. Howard said her husband had brandished a knife at her, Mrs. Howard testified at the hearing that she did not say anything about a knife. Furthermore, Mrs. Howard admitted visiting her husband\u2019s probation officer the morning after the attack and denying that it had happened. Mrs. Howard explained that she did this because her husband called her repeatedly after the incident begging her to help him, but that she later realized she needed to tell the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">In addition, during cross-examination, defense counsel asked Mrs. Howard whether she had appeared at her husband\u2019s state bond hearing and denied the attack. In response, Mrs. Howard stated that she did not remember saying that. As a result, defense counsel made a factual proffer that Defendant Howard\u2019s attorney at the state bond hearing could testify that Mrs. Howard advised the state court that Defendant Howard did not attack her. Defense counsel explained that, while she did not want to call the state attorney because she was concerned about waiving attorney-client privilege, Defendant Howard disagreed with her and had \u201cissues with the fact that [she] didn\u2019t call [his state] lawyer.\u201d The district court responded that he understood the \u201ccircumstances relating to [Mrs. Howard\u2019s] credibility in this case quite well.\u201d The district court indicated that, at best, the state attorney\u2019s testimony (i.e., that Mrs. Howard had previously said her husband did not attack her) would be cumulative of Mrs. Howard\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">After the close of the evidence, defense counsel argued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-9\">Basically what this all boils down to ... is if the Court believes Miss Howard and the various variations of what she claims has happened to her, one of the things that we see is that she escalates it and then she says it didn\u2019t happen and then she says it did and then she says it didn\u2019t, all the while Mr. Howard maintains it did not happen. I would ... suggest to the Court that that\u2019s not enough evidence standing on its own to find Mr. Howard guilty of violating his supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">After defense counsel\u2019s argument, Defendant Howard asked to speak and told the district court that his defense counsel \u201cwon\u2019t tell you what I want her to tell you.\u201d Defense counsel explained that Defendant Howard wanted to tell the court about defense counsel\u2019s deficiencies in representing Howard.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">After Defendant Howard was advised of the risks of testifying and placed under oath, Defendant Howard stated that, despite his request, defense counsel had not subpoenaed witnesses, including the attorney at Defendant Howard\u2019s state bond hearing. The district court then asked Defendant Howard whether he had any witnesses who were present \u201cwhen this incident allegedly happened,\u201d and Defendant Howard indicated he wanted to call his daughter, who picked him up after he left the family residence. Defendant Howard admitted, however, that his wife and two sons were the only other people in the home at the time and his daughter did not see what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">Defense counsel explained that, although Howard\u2019s daughter was waiting in the hallway, defense counsel had made \u201ca tactical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>decision\u201d not to call the two witnesses Howard requested, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-4\">There is ample evidence that Miss Howard made varying statements to people and told people that Mr. Howard had not hit her, and I felt that that evidence was cumulative and, quite frankly, not going to be helpful to [Defendant Howard\u2019s] case given Miss Howard\u2019s position in all of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-5\">In addition to that, Your Honor, as I expressed earlier when I made the proffer as to Miss Howard being at the bond hearing, again, that evidence went to Miss Howard has made statements that this did not happen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">The district court responded, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve been in my Court long enough to know that I don\u2019t like cumulative evidence.\u201d The district court then explained to Defendant Howard what was meant by cumulative evidence, that it was excludable under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, and that defense counsel had decided not to call his daughter because defense counsel thought it was going to be cumulative. Defendant Howard indicated that he understood. The district court further stated that it would accept defense counsel\u2019s factual proffer \u2014 that the attorney at the state bond hearing would say that Mrs. Howard denied any attack to the state court \u2014 \u201cas evidence in this case,\u201d but that \u201cthe best witness in terms of statements that are inconsistent is your wife over there who has said over and over again, yeah, that\u2019s what she told [the probation officer].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The district court found that the testimony of the two officers and Mrs. Howard was credible and that Defendant Howard committed the four alleged offenses. With respect to Mrs. Howard\u2019s credibility, the district court found that she did on more than one occasion contradict herself about what happened, but that this did not \u201cdestroy[ ] her overall credibility\u201d at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">C. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">At a separate sentencing hearing, Defendant Howard requested a 51-month sentence, at the low end of the recommended range of 51 to 63 months. The government requested (1) a 60-month sentence, the statutory maximum, and (2) that the sentence run consecutive to any state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Defendant Howard objected to a consecutive sentence, arguing that the district court did not have the authority to impose a consecutive sentence when Defendant Howard had not yet been indicted in state court and might receive a sentence for \u201cdifferent behavior and not behavior contemplated as part of this revocation.\u201d The district court stated that, although there was no state criminal case number yet, \u201cthere ought to be some way to fashion the judgment in this case so that it\u2019s very clear that this sentence will run consecutive to\u201d any state sentence based on the same conduct. The government responded, \u2018Your Honor, the only ease that the government is talking about is the one that occurred on February 6, 2012, which is the one the Court heard the testimony about. We are not talking about anything else that Mr. Howard may have done or may do in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">The district court then imposed a 60-month sentence, to run consecutive to any state sentence that arises \u201cbased on the conduct on that day.... if that turns out to be a case that\u2019s indicted and tried.\u201d The district court also stated that the sentence imposed complied with the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and adequately addressed the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">At the conclusion of the hearing, defense counsel requested that the district court appoint new counsel to represent Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>dant Howard on appeal because Defendant Howard wanted to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim against her. The district court granted the request, and Howard timely appealed his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Although ordinarily we do not review ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal, we address Defendant Howard\u2019s claim because it was raised in the revocation proceedings, and the district court was able to sufficiently develop the record. <em>See United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (stating that we will consider an ineffective assistance claim if the record is sufficiently developed in the district court). Whether a criminal defendant\u2019s counsel was ineffective is a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To establish deficient performance, the defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. To do this, the defendant must overcome \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065. Which witnesses, if any, to call \u201cis the epitome of a strategic decision, and it is one that we will seldom, if ever, second guess.\u201d <em>Waters v. Thomas, </em>46 F.3d 1506, 1512 (11th Cir.1995) (en banc). To establish prejudice, the defendant must show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">Here, Defendant Howard did not show that his defense counsel\u2019s representation during the revocation proceedings was deficient or that he suffered any prejudice as a result of defense counsel\u2019s decision not to call two witnesses \u2014 the daughter and the attorney at the state bond hearing \u2014 that Howard wanted. Defense counsel explained that she did not call these two witnesses as a matter of strategy because she believed (correctly) that the district court would view these witnesses\u2019 testimony as cumulative of other evidence of Mrs. Howard\u2019s changing version of events. In fact, Mrs. Howard admitted she had changed her story.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">With respect to Howard\u2019s lawyer at the state bond hearing, defense counsel additionally was concerned about attorney-client privilege. Therefore, instead of calling this witness, defense counsel made a factual proffer of what the state lawyer would have testified, which the district court accepted. Indeed, in ruling on the revocation petition, the district court found that on several occasions Mrs. Howard had denied that her husband attacked her. Under these circumstances, Defendant Howard has not shown that his counsel\u2019s strategic decision not to call these witnesses was objectively unreasonable or that, had these two witnesses testified, the outcome of his revocation proceeding would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">B. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">Howard contends that the district court\u2019s decision to run his 60-month federal sentence consecutive to any as yet unim-posed state sentence rendered his sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), upon finding that the defendant violated a condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>tion of supervised release, a district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering the specific factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court must consider the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, one of which, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, provides recommended, non-binding ranges of imprisonment. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">\u201cWe review the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir. 2008). Our reasonableness review applies the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing for reasonableness, we first consider whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The party challenging the sentence has the burden to show it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The parties do not dispute that, with a Grade A violation and a criminal history category of VI, Howard\u2019s recommended guidelines range under advisory Chapter 7 was 51 to 63 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.4(a)(2) (providing for increased ranges \u201c[wjhere the defendant was on probation or supervised release as a result of a sentence for a Class A felony\u201d). Howard\u2019s statutory maximum prison term upon revocation was five years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">The Supreme Court recently concluded, consistent with this Circuit\u2019s longstanding precedent, that the district court \u201chas authority to order that the federal sentence be consecutive to an anticipated state sentence that has not yet been imposed.\u201d <em>Setser v. United States, </em>566 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 1466, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012); <em>see also United States v. Andrews, </em>330 F.3d 1305, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1507-10 (11th Cir.1993). Moreover, in <em>Set-ser, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that such a consecutive sentence was reasonable. <em>See Setser, </em>132 S.Ct. at 1472.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">Howard attempts to distinguish <em>Setser </em>and our precedent, arguing that, unlike the defendants in those cases, Howard had not yet been indicted for any state offenses. This argument, however, ignores that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>courts in <em>Setser </em>and our precedent did not know whether the indicted defendant would plea or be found guilty or what sentence would be imposed, and if so, what its actual duration would be. Knowing whether the state would indict Howard still would not tell the district court what the outcome as to guilt would be or what the sentence would be. Thus, Howard\u2019s case is not materially different from <em>Setser </em>and our precedent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">In any event, despite not having this information, courts routinely weigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to produce reasonable sentences set to run consecutive to possible state sentences. <em>See, e.g., id.; Andrews, </em>330 F.3d at 1306-07 (concluding that district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a federal sentence consecutive to a future state sentence). Importantly, the record reflects that the district court was aware of the maximum state penalties Howard potentially faced should the state proceed with prosecution for his underlying criminal conduct, and the district court nevertheless expressed its clear intent to make Howard\u2019s federal sentence run consecutive to any state sentence he might receive for the same conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Under the circumstances of this particular case, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion when it imposed a 60-month sentence to be served consecutive to any as yet unimposed state sentence for the same underlying criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-5\">. Specifically, in a revocation proceeding, the relevant factors the district court must consider are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence, protect the public and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the Sentencing Guidelines range and pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (4) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities; and (5) the need to provide restitution. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (cross-referencing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b914-11\">. We note that Howard does not argue that his 60-month sentence \u2014 apart from its consecutive nature \u2014 is unreasonably long. Moreover, it is unclear from Howard\u2019s appeal brief whether his challenge to the reasonableness of his consecutive federal sentence is procedural or substantive. To the extent Howard argues the district court lacked authority to impose the federal sentence consecutive to a future state sentence, he appears to be raising a procedural error. In any event, Howard has not shown that his consecutive federal sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b915-9\">. There is still no indication that a state prosecution has occurred, much less any state sentence, based on the conduct alleged in Howard\u2019s revocation petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
