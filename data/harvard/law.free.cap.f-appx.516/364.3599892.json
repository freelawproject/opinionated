The district court denied IFP, certifying, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Fed. R.App. P. 24(a), that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Rivers is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Rivers contends that the district court abused its discretion denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based on his criminal history when the criminal history in the PSR was overstated and incorrect. He further faults the district court for failing to consider his post-sentencing rehabilitation efforts. Additionally, he asserts that the court\u2019s refusal to reduce his sentence creates a sentencing disparity with similarly situated defendants, and he argues that he should have received an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">To the extent that Rivers seeks to challenge the PSR\u2019s findings regarding his criminal history score, he may not now do so. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Moreover, the district court was not required to consider his post-sentencing conduct. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673 &amp; n. 10; \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. l(B)(iii)). Rivers\u2019s unwarranted-disparity argument is without merit because it amounts to a request that the court make a sentencing reduction mandatory when requested pursuant to the crack cocaine amendments. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010). He has not demonstrated that the district court based its denial of a sentencing reduction on any error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence and thus fails to demonstrate an abuse of discretion on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir. 2011). Further, the district court provided reasons for denying Rivers\u2019s motion that reflect its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297-98 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). Moreover, because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resen-tencings, Rivers was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>645 F.3d 709, 712 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">Rivers has not shown that the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion presents a nonfriv-olous issue for appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
