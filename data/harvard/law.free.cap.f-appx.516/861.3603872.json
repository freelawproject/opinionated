Dysart\u2019s allegations stem from Bank-Trust\u2019s foreclosure on her home after she defaulted on her mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">The operative facts are as follows<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>: in August 2002, Dysart purchased a home in Vestavia Hills, Alabama, with a mortgage from defendant BankTrust. In April 2004, Dysart filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief, but continued to pay her mortgage outside the bankruptcy schedule. Later that year, after her Chapter 7 proceedings were discharged, Dysart filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. Chapter 13 relief was conditioned on \u201cDysart ... refinancing] her home in order to completely pay all [her] debts.\u201d Her BankTrust mortgage was included among the debts she would pay off. Dysart failed to refinance, however, and, eventually, Bank-Trust was authorized to foreclose its mortgage against Dysart\u2019s home. In October 2007, BankTrust held a foreclosure sale on the residence, which it advertised in the Alabama Messenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-15\">Proceeding pro <em>se, </em>Dysart sued Bank-Trust and various named individuals employed by or affiliated with BankTrust (the Defendants) alleging: (1) a substantive violation of the RICO Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c); (2) conspiracy to violate the RICO Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1962(d); (3) \u201cfraud on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>court\u201d; (4) \u201cextrinsic fraud\u201d; (5) breach of contract; (6) trespass; and (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress. The district court dismissed Dysart\u2019s RICO allegations without prejudice for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Then, exercising its discretion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3), the district court dismissed Dysart\u2019s remaining claims because they were \u201cstate law causes of action\u201d over which the court lacked original jurisdiction. <em>Id.; see also United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). This <em>pro se </em>appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">\u201cWe read liberally briefs filed <em>pro se.\u201d Lorisme v. I.N.S., </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444 n. 3 (11th Cir.1997). Liberally construed, Dy-sart raises two issues on appeal: (1) whether the district court erred when it dismissed her RICO claims<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; and (2) whether the district court erred in dismissing her complaint without first granting her leave to amend.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn the case of a <em>pro se </em>action, moreover, [we] construe the complaint more liberally than [we] would formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d <em>Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459, 1463 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), it is illegal \u201cfor any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c). \u201cThus, in order to establish a federal civil RICO violation under \u00a7 1962(c), the plaintiff! ] must satisfy four elements of proof: (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., </em>465 F.3d 1277, 1282 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). Moreover, civil RICO claimants must show: \u201c(1) [an] injury to \u2018business or property,\u2019 and (2) that such injury was \u2018by reason of the substantive RICO violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Dysart\u2019s argument that she pleaded sufficient facts to avoid dismissal of her RICO claims is not born out by our review of her complaint. First, Dysart failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>plead facts sufficient to prove the existence of an enterprise. An enterprise requires proof of \u201can <em>ongoing </em>organization, formal or informal, and ... evidence that the various associates function as a <em>continuing </em>unit.\u201d <em>Mohawk Indus., </em>465 F.3d at 1284 (quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Here, however, Dysart alleged only that the Defendants \u201coperated together for the common purpose of ... divest[ing] Dy-sart of her home and equity therein.\u201d Even accepting as true that the Defendants acted in concert to divest Dysart of her home, this was a discrete goal accomplished in 2007 and therefore not the work of \u201can ongoing organization ... functioning] as a continuing unit.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Second, Dysart failed to plead a pattern of racketeering activity. To allege a pattern of racketeering activity, \u201c[a] plaintiff[ ] must charge that ... the defendants committed two or more predicate acts within a ten-year time span.\u201d <em>Jackson v. BellSouth Telecomm., </em>372 F.3d 1250, 1264 (11th Cir.2004). Dysart alleged in her complaint that the Defendants committed the predicate acts of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, wire fraud under \u00a7 1343, bank fraud under \u00a7 1344, and obstruction of court orders under \u00a7 1509. The district court determined, however, that Dysart failed to plead the mail fraud, wire fraud, or bank fraud predicates with sufficient specificity. Dysart has not meaningfully challenged this determination in her brief to this Court. Therefore, Dy-sart has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that she failed to establish two RICO predicates. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Also, on a related point, Dysart has failed to sufficiently allege a pattern of racketeering activity because her complaint did not \u201cshow that the racketeering predicates are related, <em>and </em>that they amount to or pose a threat of <em>continued </em>criminal activity.\u201d <em>H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 2900, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989) (emphasis added); <em>see also Jones v. Childers, </em>18 F.3d 899, 912 (11th Cir.1994) (same). \u201c\u2018Continuity\u2019 is both a closed- and open-ended concept, referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct, or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>372 F.3d at 1265 (quotation marks and alterations omitted). Here, Dysart failed to establish open-ended continuity because the scheme she alleged \u2014 to divest her of her home \u2014 cannot be repeated. <em>See id. </em>Likewise, she failed to establish close-ended continuity because \u201cthe alleged racketeering activity was related to the settlement of a <em>single </em>[foreclosure], and, notably, was not designed to perpetrate racketeering with respect to a <em>series </em>of [foreclosures].\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Finally, Dysart did not plead facts sufficient to establish \u00a7 1964(c)\u2019s requirement that she suffered an injury to business or property caused by the RICO violation. <em>See Mohawk Indus., </em>465 F.3d at 1283. Dysart alleged that she suffered \u201cmental anguish, emotional distress, stress, physical discomfort and associated illnesses,\u201d as well as the loss of her home. However, personal injuries of the type Dy-sart alleged are not a basis for a civil RICO action. <em>See id. </em>at 1286-87. Moreover, Dysart concedes that BankTrust was entitled to foreclose on her home; thus, the alleged RICO violations did not cause this injury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">In sum, Dysart failed to plead facts sufficient to prove that the Defendants operated as an enterprise, that they engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity, or that she suffered an injury to business or property caused by the alleged RICO violations. Thus, the district court properly dismissed her substantive RICO claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number><em>Mohawk Indus., </em>465 F.3d at 1282-83. And since Dysart\u2019s RICO conspiracy claim contained no new allegations sufficient to establish \u201cDefendants^] agreement with other entities or persons to engage in the ongoing criminal conduct of an enterprise,\u201d the district court properly dismissed that claim as well. <em>See Am. Dental Ass\u2019n, </em>605 F.3d at 1296 &amp; n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Dysart further argues that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint without first granting her leave to amend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny Dysart\u2019s request to amend her complaint for an abuse of discretion. <em>Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., </em>367 F.3d 1255, 1262 (11th Cir.2004). Ordinarily, \u201c[i]f the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief,\u201d <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962), leave to amend \u201cshould be freely given,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). We have recognized, however, that \u201ca district court may properly deny leave to amend the complaint under Rule 15(a) when such amendment would be futile.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>367 F.3d at 1262-63. \u201c[D]enial of leave to amend is justified by futility when the complaint as amended is still subject to dismissal.\u201d <em>Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, </em>169 F.3d 1310, 1320 (11th Cir.1999) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Here, Dysart\u2019s RICO claims would still be subject to dismissal even if she were allowed to amend her complaint because, as explained, she complained of only one cognizable injury \u2014 the loss of her home to one victim \u2014 herself\u2014and thus could not establish the pattern of racketeering activity required to sustain a RICO claim. <em>Jackson, </em>372 F.3d at 1265. Likewise, Dy-sart\u2019s state law claims, even if amended, would still be based on state law, and therefore beyond the district court\u2019s original jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). Thus, the district court did not err in denying Dysart\u2019s request to amend her complaint because an amendment would have been futile. <em>Burger King Corp., </em>169 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dysart\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-10\">. The Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, Doc. 63, provides a complete version of the facts underlying this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-9\">. Dysart's brief suggests that she also intends to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of her state law claims on jurisdictional grounds. She failed to brief this issue, however, and therefore it is abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b887-10\">. Dysart also argues that the district court erred when it assessed costs to her upon dismissal of her complaint because her lawsuit was not \"unreasonable, frivolous, merit-less, or vexatious.\u201d Each of the Defendants has conceded that they did not pursue recovery of costs, and that the time limit for claiming costs has passed. Therefore this issue is moot. <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 95, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 1950, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. Dysart did not file a separate motion requesting leave to amend her complaint. However, in her motion opposing the Defendants\u2019 various motions to dismiss, she \u201cbeg[ged] th[e] Court for Leave to Amend and/or Correct her Complaint\u201d in the event that the \"Defendants' Motion[s] to Dismiss [were] granted.\u201d We are satisfied that this was a request for leave to amend under the liberal pleading standard afforded <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs. <em>Powell, </em>914 F.2d at 1463.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b889-12\">. We have indicated that where federal claims are dismissed prior to trial, it would likely be an abuse of discretion to also dismiss pendant state law claims \u201d[i]f the statute of limitations had run on [the plaintiff's] state claims while the action in federal court was pending.\u201d <em>L.A. Draper &amp; Son v. Wheelabrator-Frye, Inc., </em>735 F.2d 414, 428 (11th Cir.1984). Even if it is the case that Dysart\u2019s state law claims are barred by statutes of limitations, she has not briefed this issue and therefore it is abandoned as well. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
