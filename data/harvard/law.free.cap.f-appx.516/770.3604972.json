On appeal, Lundy asserts that he is eligible for a sentence reduction because the district court based his sentence on a framework that Amendment 750 retroactively changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-21\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). In liberally construing pro se pleadings, we hold pro se litigants to a less stringent standard. <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-22\">We have held that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only provides a district court with the discretion to reduce a sentence that was based on a sentencing range that has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. Section 3582(c)(2) does not provide a basis for a de novo resen-tencing. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). If a defendant is a career offender, his base offense level is generally determined under the career-offender guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and not the drug-quantity guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. As such, a retroactive amendment to the drug quantity table at \u00a7 2D1.1 does not have the effect of lowering the career-offender-based guideline range within the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the district courts are not authorized to reduce a sentence on that basis. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-23\">The district court properly denied Lun-dy\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) request because he was sentenced as a career offender. Amendment 750 did not lower his applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
