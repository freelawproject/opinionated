We review the BIA\u2019s rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>440 F.3d 678, 680 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Chow v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 34, 39 (5th Cir.1993). There is no abuse of discretion if the BIA\u2019s decision is \u201cnot capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so aberrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Cabral v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 886, 890 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-21\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case. We note, however, that the Momins sought to continue their removal proceedings so that Momin, an arriving alien, could seek adjustment of status from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and Mrs. Momin, if Momin\u2019s application was successful, could seek derivative adjustment of status from the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-22\">There was no abuse of discretion in the decision to deny the Momins\u2019 motion for continuance under the standards set forth in <em>Matter of Hashmi, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 785, 790 (2009). In <em>Hashmi, </em>the BIA outlined certain factors that an IJ should consider when ruling on a motion to continue removal proceedings so the respondent can seek adjustment of status based upon a pending visa petition; however, it noted that \u201cthe focus of the inquiry is the likelihood that the adjustment application will be granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is undisputed that, in its review, the BIA focused on Momin\u2019s eligibility for status adjustment by noting Momin\u2019s concession that he might be ineligible for adjustment of status without a concomitant waiver of inadmissibility. Moreover, the record before the immigration court established that Momin\u2019s prior request for adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility had been denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>by USCIS. Given the prior denial and Momin\u2019s concession, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Momins\u2019 removal proceedings should not be continued until Momin\u2019s renewed adjustment application before the USCIS was adjudicated or in dismissing their appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, because the Momins\u2019 request for a transfer of venue was based only upon their conclusory speculation that Momin\u2019s adjustment application would be approved by the USCIS, they have not demonstrated an abuse of discretion with respect to the denial of that motion. <em>See Chow, </em>12 F.3d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Finally, for the reasons noted above, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Momins\u2019 motion to reconsider. <em>Zhao, </em>404 F.3d at 303-04. Moreover, they have not demonstrated that the BIA abused its discretion in denying their motion to reconsider because it rejected their request that their removal proceedings be administratively closed. The factors to consider when determining whether to administratively close removal proceedings include whether it is likely that the respondent will succeed on any petition, application, or other action he or she is pursuing outside of removal proceedings. <em>See Matter of Avetisyan, </em>25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 688 (BIA 2012). The Momins did not make that showing. Accordingly, the Momins\u2019 petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
