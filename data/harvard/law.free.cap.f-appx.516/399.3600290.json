His offense level was increased for a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation that was deemed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The district court granted a downward variance and sentenced Suazo to 36 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-21\">Suazo contends that his prior Texas burglary was not a crime of violence because Texas law too broadly defines the \u201cowner\u201d of a habitation as a person with merely \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d than the criminal actor. We review only for plain error because the issue is raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 205 (5th Cir.2009). Suazo must, at minimum, show a forfeited error that was \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute.\u201d <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-26\">We recently rejected an indistinguishable argument in <em>United States v. Joslin, </em>487 Fed.Appx. 139, 142-43 (5th Cir.2012), when we held that, notwithstanding the \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d theory, a Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation constitutes the \u201cviolent felony\u201d of generic burglary under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). The definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA is the same as the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Najera-Mendoza, </em>683 F.3d 627, 631 n. 3 (5th Cir.2012). Accordingly, <em>Joslin, </em>though unpublished, is on point and sufficient to show that there was no obvious or plain error. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
