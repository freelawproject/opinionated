After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-22\">On August 4, 2000, Mr. Bartley pled guilty to possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>\u00a7 841(a)(1). The pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) indicated that Mr. Bartley\u2019s total offense level was 25 based upon the quantity of cocaine base (23.5 grams) as well as adjustments for accepting responsibility and assisting authorities by providing timely and complete information. Mr. Bartley, however, qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which subjected him to an enhanced offense level of 31 and a sentencing guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced Mr. Bartley to 211 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">On August 23, 2012, Mr. Bartley filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2374 (2010). The district court denied Mr. Bartley\u2019s motion because he was sentenced \u201cas a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and as such, his applicable sentencing guideline range is not affected by Amendment 750.\u201d D.E. 72 at 1. <em>See also </em>D.E. 74 (holding that Fair Sentencing Act did not apply to Mr. Bart-ley\u2019s case). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u2018we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3528(c)(2), a district court may reduce the terms of a defendant\u2019s imprisonment if the sentence was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. If, however, \u201ca retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In this case, Mr. Bartley was not eligible for a reduced sentence because he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. His sentencing guidelines remained unchanged because \u00a7 4B1.1 was not affected by Amendment 750. <em>See id. </em>at 1327 (holding that defendants sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1 are not entitled to sentence reductions based on an amendment to the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses in \u00a7 2D1.1). Mr. Bartley is also not entitled to relief under the Fair Sentencing Act for two reasons. First, the Fair Sentencing Act is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission and, therefore, cannot be the basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Second, Mr. Bartley was sentenced before the effective date of the act, which is not retroactively applicable to him. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWe agree with every other circuit to address the issue that there is \u2018no evidence that Congress intended [the FSA] to apply to defendants who had been sentenced prior to the August 3, 2010 date of the Act\u2019s enactment.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). <em>See also United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542, 2013 WL 978695, at *5 (11th Cir. Mar. 14, 2013) (same). Therefore, the district court correctly denied Mr. Bartley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
