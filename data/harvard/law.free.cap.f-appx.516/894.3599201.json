Song presents four arguments on appeal. First, Song argues that DHS erred in issuing the FARO against him because his conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv) did not involve alien smuggling and was therefore not an aggravated felony as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N). Next, Song argues that it was improper for DHS to commence expedited removal proceedings against him because he had a pending adjustment of status application. Third, Song argues that DHS violated his due process rights by not complying with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 238.1(c)(1), which requires DHS to provide an alien with a copy of the government\u2019s evidence against him if the alien requested it, and which allows the alien ten days following the service of the evidence to file a final response. Lastly, Song challenges his continued detention, asserting that he was detained in excess of the allowed removal period in retaliation for seeking withholding of removal. After reviewing the record and parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">Our jurisdiction to review orders of removal is limited by the INA, which provides that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) ].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). We retain jurisdiction, however, over \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). The question of whether a petitioner\u2019s conviction constitutes an \u201caggravated felony\u201d within the meaning of the INA is a question of law that falls within our jurisdiction. <em>See Balogun v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1360 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">Song first argues that DHS erred in issuing the FARO against him because his conviction was not an aggravated felony as it did not involve alien smuggling. We review de novo whether a prior conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony. <em>Accardo v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>634 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir.2011). The INA provides that \u201c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The INA specifically defines an \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACP\">an offense described in paragraph (1)(A) or (2) of [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a) ] ... (relating to alien smuggling), except in the case of a first offense for which the alien has affirmatively shown that the alien committed the offense for the purpose of assisting, abetting, or aiding only the alien\u2019s spouse, child, or parent (and no other individual) to violate a provision of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N). The INA also defines an \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include \u201can attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in this paragraph.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(U).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">Song was convicted pursuant to a guilty plea in federal court for conspiracy to en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>courage and induce aliens to reside in the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1824(a)(l)(A)(iv)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) and (b)(2). The indictment reflected that Song and four other conspirators produced false Georgia driver\u2019s licenses and issued them to people who did not qualify for them under Georgia law in order to encourage and induce the aliens to reside in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Song argues that his conviction is not an aggravated felony because it did not relate to \u201calien smuggling.\u201d We disagree. The inclusion of the \u201crelating to alien smuggling\u201d parenthetical within INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(N) acts to encompass all of the offenses described in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A) and (2); it is not designed to limit the offenses deemed aggravating felonies under this section. <em>See Patel v. Ashcroft, </em>294 F.3d 465, 470-71 (3d Cir.2002) (finding that \u201crelating to alien smuggling\u201d was \u201cnothing more than a shorthand description of all of the offenses listed in INA \u00a7 274(a)(1)(A)\u201d), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds, </em>REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, div. B, \u00a7 106, 119 Stat. 231; <em>United States v. Galindo-Gallegos, </em>244 F.3d 728, 733-34 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding that the \u201caggravated felony provision has to include transporting aliens who are already in the United States\u201d); <em>United States v. Salas-Mendoza, </em>237 F.3d 1246, 1247-48 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that crime of transporting aliens is an aggravated felony); <em>United States v. Monjaras-Castaneda, </em>190 F.3d 326, 330-31 (5th Cir.1999) (finding that \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018relating to alien smuggling<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does describe the offenses in \u00a7 1324(a). All involve the transportation, movement, and hiding of aliens into and within the United States\u201d). It is clear that alien smuggling is not limited solely to actually bringing, or attempting to bring, an alien into the United States. DHS did not err when it concluded that Song\u2019s conviction for conspiring to encourage and induce aliens to reside in the United States constituted an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Additionally, the limited exception to when a conviction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A) is an aggravated felony is inapplicable to Song because his criminal indictment contains no indication that Song\u2019s conviction involved assisting, abetting, or aiding his spouse, child, or parent. Accordingly, we deny the petition as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">To the extent that Song challenges DHS\u2019s decision to commence expedited removal proceedings against him, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g). Nevertheless, to the extent that Song raises a legal question regarding whether DHS had the authority to commence expedited removal proceedings against him, we have jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">DHS did not err in commencing expedited removal proceedings while Song\u2019s adjustment of status application was pending. There is nothing in the statute or regulation to suggest that DHS cannot commence expedited removal proceedings while an alien has a pending application for relief. Song cites to <em>Fonseca-Sanchez v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 439, 444 (7th Cir.2007), which noted that DHS \u201cha[s] the authority\u201d to stay proceedings or decline to issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>a FARO because of a pending application. That case, however, does not bind us. More importantly, however, <em>FonsecaSan-chez </em>in no way mandates that DHS stay proceedings or decline to issue a FARO because of a pending application; the case merely states that, in its discretion, DHS may stay removal proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 444. As such, we deny Song\u2019s petition as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Song next argues that DHS violated his due process rights by not complying with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 238.1(c)(1), which requires DHS to provide an alien with a copy of the government\u2019s evidence against him if the alien requested it, and which allows the alien ten days following the service of the evidence to file a final response. We have jurisdiction over Song\u2019s due process claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We review constitutional challenges de novo. <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Aliens are entitled to due process of law in deportation hearings, which is satisfied only by a full and fair hearing. <em>Ibrahim v. U.S. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987). To establish due process violations in removal proceedings, an alien must show that he was deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused him substantial prejudice. <em>Lonyem, </em>352 F.3d at 1341-42. \u201cTo show substantial prejudice, an alien must demonstrate that, in the absence of the alleged violations, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1143 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">The notice of intent is required to advise the alien that he has a right to inspect the evidence in support thereof and to rebut the charges against him. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 238.1(b)(2)(i). The alien has ten calendar days from the service of the notice of intent to file a response. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 238.1(c)(1). In the alien\u2019s response, he can rebut the allegations supporting the charge and/or request the opportunity to review the government\u2019s evidence. <em>Id. </em>If the alien requests to review the evidence, DHS must provide the alien with a copy of the evidence in the record. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 238.1(c)(2)(h). The alien then has ten calendar days after the service of the evidence to provide a final response to the notice of intent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">Here, because DHS provided Song with a copy of the evidence less than ten days prior to the issuance of the FARO, Song was prevented from filing a final response to the notice of intent before the issuance of the FARO as permitted by the regulations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 238.1(c)(2)(h). However, Song has failed to establish that DHS\u2019s non-compliance with the regulations violated his due process rights because he cannot show substantial prejudice. <em>See Lonyem, </em>352 F.3d at 1341-42. The record reflects that even without a copy of the evidence, Song was still able to file an initial response to the notice of intent, where he argued that his 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv) conviction was not an aggravated felony. Moreover, Song cannot show that the outcome of his proceedings would have been different \u2014 his conviction still stands as an aggravated felony. Song fails to explain how having more time to respond would have changed his status as an aggravated felon. <em>See Lapaix, </em>605 F.3d at 1143. Accordingly, we deny Song\u2019s petition as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Lastly, Song challenges his continued detention, asserting that he was detained in excess of the allowed removal period in retaliation for seeking withholding of removal. The government argues that Song\u2019s petition for review is not the proper method for Song to challenge his detention. According to the government, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>the proper method for challenging detention is to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The INA provides that the filing of a petition for review in the court of appeals, rather than a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition, is \u201cthe sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5). Furthermore, the INA states that no court shall have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 to review questions of law or fact that arise \u201cfrom any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(9). Nevertheless, so long as an alien does not challenge a final order of removal, district courts retain jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 to review habeas petitions, including challenges to an alien\u2019s detention. <em>Madu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>470 F.3d 1362, 1366-68 (11th Cir.2006). However, if the alien challenges both his removal order and his continued detention, we have jurisdiction to review the alien\u2019s challenge to his continued detention. <em>See id. </em>at 1366-67. Accordingly, because Song is challenging both his removal order and his continued detention, we can review Song\u2019s challenge to his continued detention. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Following a final order of removal, \u201cthe Attorney General shall remove the alien from the United States within a period of 90 days.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(A). This 90-day period is known as the \u201cremoval period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Generally, an alien is held in custody during the removal period. <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 682, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 2494, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001). An alien who is removable for an aggravated felony conviction is subject to further detention beyond the removal period. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Song\u2019s challenge to his continued detention is premature. Song is removable based on his aggravated felony conviction, thus he can be detained for at least six months. <em>See Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 701, 121 S.Ct. at 2505 (concluding that six months was a presumptively reasonable period of time to allow the government to remove an alien). The six-month period includes the 90-day removal period and the 90 days thereafter. <em>Akinwale v. Ashcroft, </em>287 F.3d 1050, 1052 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). The six-month period is tolled, however, if the alien acts to prevent his removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1052 n. 4. For an alien to state a claim under <em>Zadvydas, </em>he \u201cnot only must show post-removal order detention in excess of six months but also must provide evidence of a good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">In the current matter, at the time Song filed his petition for review and his appellate brief he had not been detained in excess of six months following the FARO\u2019s issuance. Accordingly, we deny Song\u2019s petition for review as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b921-6\">.
