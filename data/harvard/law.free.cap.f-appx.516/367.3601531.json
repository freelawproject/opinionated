He appeals the district court\u2019s judgment that granted his motion filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Gray contends that the district court erred by failing to afford him the opportunity to review and challenge a probation officer\u2019s report that the district court relied upon in making its decision to reduce Gray\u2019s sentence to 150 months of imprisonment, a sentence above the new guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-22\">\u201cA defendant must have notice of the contents of [a Presentence Report] addendum and notice that the court is consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ing it such that he will have the opportunity to respond to or contest it.\u201d <em>United States v. Mueller, </em>168 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1999). The district court erred when it failed to provide Gray with an opportunity to review and respond to the probation officer\u2019s report. <em>See Mueller, </em>168 F.3d at 189. The record on appeal does not include the report. Accordingly, we conclude that on this record, we cannot determine whether any error was harmless. Thus, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand to permit the district court to provide Gray with an opportunity to review and comment on the report. We express no opinion on the disposition of Gray\u2019s motion on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
