Morris pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and had prior Florida convictions for felony battery, aggravated battery, and selling cocaine. Based upon his prior convictions, the district court concluded that Morris was subject to the statutory-minimum penalty of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) and imposed an equivalent sentence on February 19, 2009. Morris did not appeal. He thereafter filed the instant motion to vacate on April 12, 2010, claiming that his felony-battery conviction no longer qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA pursuant to <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), and thus, he was no longer subject to the ACCA\u2019s enhanced penalty. The district court, however, dismissed Morris\u2019s motion to vacate as untimely after concluding that <em>Johnson </em>has not been retroactively applied to cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The district court subsequently issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and certified two issues: (1) whether <em>Johnson </em>applies retroactively on collateral review so that Morris timely filed his motion to vacate; (2) and whether an erroneous ACCA sentence violates due process. On appeal, Morris answers these questions in the affirmative, and the government concedes Johnson\u2019s retroactivity, and that an erroneous ACCA sentence violates due process. Nonetheless, the government argues that we need not address the constitutional issue because Morris was properly sentenced under the ACCA inasmuch as his felony-battery conviction qualifies as a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law related to a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to vacate. <em>Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). The scope of our review is limited by the issues specified in the COA. <em>Id. </em>at 1290-91. A prisoner who is in custody under a federal sentence may move the district court to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence if he claims the right to his release upon the ground that his sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or federal law, the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose his sentence, his sentence exceeded the maximum authorized by law, or his sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">A federal prisoner must file a motion to vacate within one year of the latest of: (1) the date upon which the underlying judgment of conviction became final; (2) the date upon which the impediment to making a motion created by the government in violation of the constitution or federal law is removed, so long as the prisoner was prevented from making a motion by the government; (3) the date upon which \u201cthe right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review;\u201d or (4) the date upon which the facts supporting the claim \u201ccould have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2255(f). A court other than the Supreme Court may determine retroactivity under \u00a7 2255(f)(3), and, in deciding retroactivity, we apply the Teague<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rubric. <em>Figuereo-Sanchez v. United States, </em>678 F.3d 1203, 1207 (11th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>S.Ct. 1455, 185 L.Ed.2d 384 (2013). Under that rubric, we first decide whether the Supreme Court announced a new rule in the decision in question. <em>Id. </em>If so, then we must \u201cdetermine whether that new rule satisfies an exception to the general prohibition against the retroactive application of new rules on collateral review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1208. <em>Teague </em>established two such exceptions: (1) \u201cnew rules that place certain kinds of primary conduct beyond the reach of criminal law;\u201d and (2) \u201cdecisions that announce \u2018watershed rules of criminal procedure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 311-12, 109 S.Ct. at 1076).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">A defendant convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm is ordinarily subject to a maximum term of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). Under the ACCA, however, that same defendant is subject to a term of 15 years\u2019 to life imprisonment if he has 3 previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, that were committed on occasions different from one another. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1). Thus, a defendant who is erroneously sentenced under the ACCA is necessarily sentenced in excess of the statutory maximum. <em>See Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1319 n. 20 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">In Florida, a person commits a battery if he actually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against that person\u2019s will, or intentionally causes bodily harm to another person. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(l)(a). This offense is punishable by up to five years\u2019 imprisonment if the offender has a prior battery conviction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(d); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">The Supreme Court decided <em>Johnson </em>on March 2, 2010, and defined the term \u201cphysical force\u201d in the ACCA\u2019s elements clause as meaning <em>\u201cviolent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 140, 130 S.Ct. at 1271. A Florida battery offense, however, only requires the slightest intentional physical contact, and a defendant could commit the offense through, for example, a non-consensual tap on the shoulder. <em>See id. </em>at 137-38, 130 S.Ct. at 1269-70 (citation omitted). Accordingly, <em>Johnson </em>held that a Florida battery offense under \u00a7 784.03 does not categorically meet the elements clause\u2019s physical force requirement, and, therefore, did not categorically constitute a violent felony under the elements clause. <em>See id. </em>at 134-45,130 S.Ct. at 1268-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">We accept the government\u2019s concessions that <em>Johnson </em>retroactively applies on collateral review so that Morris timely filed his motion to vacate, and that an erroneous ACCA sentence violates due process. The district court did not decide whether Morris\u2019s felony-battery conviction constitutes a violent felony, and we deem it appropriate that the district court decide that issue in the first instance. Accordingly, after reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand this case for a determination as to whether Morris was properly sentenced under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b907-9\">. <em>Teague v.
