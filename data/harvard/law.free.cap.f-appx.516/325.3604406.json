We agree that Ortiz-Cuevas\u2019s pri- or New Jersey conviction for assault with a deadly weapon was not an aggravated felony for purposes of subsection (b)(2) because his sentence was less than one year in prison. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368-69 (5th Cir.2009). His conduct in this case violated \u00a7 1326(b)(1), which carries a statutory maximum prison term of 10 years. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(1); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 368-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-23\">Ortiz-Cuevas contends that the district court\u2019s error in assessing the statutory sentencing range was a factor in the court\u2019s sentencing decision that requires resentencing. However, plain error review applies, and Ortiz-Cuevas cannot meet his burden of proving that the error affected his substantial rights, as he was sentenced well under the 10-year statutory maximum and nothing suggests \u00a7 1326(b)(2) was a factor. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 368-69. Nevertheless, as in <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>we \u201creform the judgment to reflect the correct statutory subsection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-24\">AFFIRMED, with the judgment REFORMED to reflect conviction and sentencing under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
