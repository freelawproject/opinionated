On petition for review, Mendez argues that the BIA abused its discretion when it found that Mendez failed to demonstrate that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d prevented him from attending his master calendar hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The Supreme Court has held that federal courts generally have jurisdiction to review orders denying motions to reopen. <em>See Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 250-54, 130 S.Ct. 827, 839-40, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). The BIA\u2019s discretion is quite broad, and review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The administrative factual findings are considered \u201cconclusive unless a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1340 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). In the context of a motion to reopen, whether an alien received sufficient notice of his removal hearing is a finding of fact. <em>See Contreras-Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>462 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (granting petition for review and remanding for the BIA to consider in the first instance whether petitioner received a sufficient notice of hearing before being removed <em>in </em>absentia).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Any alien who does not attend a proceeding after written notice has been provided is subject to removal <em>in absentia </em>if the government establishes by \u201cclear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence\u201d that it gave written notice and that the alien was removable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). An <em>in absentia </em>order can be issued if notice had been provided to the alien or to the alien\u2019s counsel of record. <em>Id.; see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(2)(A). Receipt of notice by counsel is sufficient to deny a motion to reopen based on a lack of notice. <em>See Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">An alien may seek rescission of an <em>in absentia </em>removal order by filing a motion to reopen at any time if the alien demonstrates that (i) exceptional circumstances justified his failure to appear, or (ii) he did not receive notice of the hearing and his failure to appear was through no fault of his own. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (ii). \u201cExceptional circumstances\u201d are defined by statute as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-10\">exceptional circumstances (such as battery or extreme cruelty to the alien or any child or parent of the alien, serious illness of the alien, or serious illness or death of the spouse, child, or parent of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-12\">Throughout the course of proceedings, Mendez never contested the fact that his counsel received notice of the March 31 hearing. The fact that counsel was present at the March 31 hearing suggests that counsel did receive notice of it. Nothing in the record compels a conclusion that Mendez\u2019s counsel did not receive notice of the hearing. <em>See Lonyem, </em>352 F.3d at 1340. Therefore, as a result, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Mendez\u2019s motion to reopen based on an alleged lack of notice. <em>See Anin, </em>188 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">The BIA also did not abuse its discretion in finding that Mendez failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>demonstrate that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d prevented him from appearing at the March 31 hearing. Mendez presented evidence that his wife was in the hospital on March 24 and 25, and affidavit testimony that he and his wife were unable to access their mail from March 24 until sometime after March 31. However, he did not present any evidence explaining why the March 24 accident prevented him from learning about his March 31 hearing, of which he could have had notice through his counsel in January or February. Mendez also failed to present any evidence that suggested that, had he known about the hearing, exceptional circumstances would have prevented his attendance. Because Mendez failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to have his <em>in absentia </em>order reopened under either statutory justification, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Mendez\u2019s motion to reopen, and we deny Mendez\u2019s petition for review. <em>See Ali, </em>443 F.3d at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
