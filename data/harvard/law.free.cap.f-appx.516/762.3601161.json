A jury found in favor of Deputy Webb. Mr. Jones now appeals, arguing that the district court erred in allowing expert medical testimony, not granting him a new trial due to the prejudice he suffered from such evidence, and giving the jury an adapted and modified <em>Allen </em>charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also contends that he is entitled to a new trial due to the cumulative effect of the district court\u2019s errors. After review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-15\">To provide context for the issues raised on appeal, we briefly summarize the evidence at trial. As set forth below, Mr. Jones and Deputy Webb presented diametrically opposed versions of their encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-16\">On the evening of January 16, 2007, Mr. Jones parked his truck on the side of County Road 38, a short distance from his home. At around 8 or 9 p.m., Deputy Webb pulled up next to Mr. Jones and rolled down his window, but Mr. Jones did not appear to acknowledge him. Deputy Webb then backed up his car, activated his blue lights, and positioned himself right behind Mr. Jones\u2019 truck. Deputy Webb inquired if Mr. Jones was ok, and took his license. Because Deputy Webb smelled alcohol on Mr. Jones, he instructed Mr. Jones \u2014 who had drunk some wine (a couple of sips according to Mr. Jones and two glasses according to Deputy Webb) \u2014 to get out of the car for a field sobriety test. During the field sobriety test, Mr. Jones\u2019 wife and son pulled up in their own vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-17\">According to Mr. Jones, his wife tried to explain that he was looking for the body of his dead dog, but Deputy Webb became angry and cursed at her. When Mr. Jones told him not to speak to his wife that way, Deputy Webb grabbed Mr. Jones\u2019 left hand and pulled Mr. Jones to the ground face first so that his right hand was pinned underneath him. Deputy Webb told Mr. Jones to give him his right hand so that he could handcuff him. Mr. Jones replied that he could not because that hand was pinned underneath his body. Deputy Webb then struck Mr. Jones on his back, sides, neck, and head with the flashlight he was holding. As Mr. Jones struggled to protect himself, Deputy Webb rolled him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>onto his back and used the flashlight to choke him. Eventually Mr. Jones lost consciousness because Deputy Webb cut off his air supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">According to Deputy Webb, Mrs. Jones told him that if her husband was going to jail, he needed his medicine. Deputy Webb responded that no one was going to jail at that time, and twice asked Mrs. Jones and her son to get back in their ear. They, however, did not comply. Mr. Jones said to Deputy Webb, \u2018You S.O.B., you don\u2019t tell my son what to do.\u201d When Mrs. Jones tried to explain the situation concerning the family\u2019s dog, Mr. Jones exclaimed, \u201cMy fing dog has died, you fing S.O.B.,\u201d and took a swing at Deputy Webb with his clenched fist. Deputy Webb avoided the punch, and grabbed and handcuffed Mr. Jones\u2019 left arm. Because Mr. Jones continued to struggle, Deputy Webb took him to the ground in an attempt to handcuff the other arm. After fighting for a while, Deputy Webb grew tired and let Mr. Jones stand up. Mr. Jones took a swing at Deputy Webb with his cuffed hand, grazing Deputy Webb\u2019s face. Deputy Webb then rushed at Mr. Jones and the two men fell down an embankment into a ditch, with Mr. Jones ending on top of Deputy Webb, who was face down on the ground. Deputy Webb eventually pulled Mr. Jones off. Deputy Webb maneuvered his way on top of Mr. Jones\u2019 chest, but Mr. Jones bit Deputy Webb\u2019s arm and began spitting. Deputy Webb then punched Mr. Jones in the face, and the two men continued to struggle. Mr. Jones pushed Deputy Webb off. Deputy Webb found his flashlight, and struck Mr. Jones in the leg as Mr. Jones was trying to kick him.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">We review the district court\u2019s admission of expert testimony under Rule 702 for abuse of discretion. <em>See United Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Whirlpool Corp., </em>704 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2013). The same standard of review applies to the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Jones\u2019 motion for a new trial and the <em>Allen </em>charge. <em>See Lambert v. Fulton County, </em>253 F.3d 588, 595 (11th Cir.2001) (new trial); <em>United States v. Woodard, </em>531 F.3d 1352, 1364 (11th Cir.2008) <em>(Allen </em>charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Mr. Jones first contends that Deputy Webb\u2019s medical expert, Dr. Mark Cho-quette, gave an opinion that went beyond his report when he falsely testified that the \u201cCT scan reports in [Mr.] Jones\u2019 emergency room records could be interpreted to mean ... that [Mr.] Jones did not have any head injuries, not even a bump on the head.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 17 (citing Dr. Choquette\u2019s testimony, D.E. 89 at 157-59). In the cited pages of the transcript, Dr. Choquette testified on direct examination that the CT scans, according to the radiologist\u2019s impressions, revealed \u201cno evidence of nasal bone fracture\u201d (meaning \u201cno injury\u201d to the bones in the nose), a \u201cnormal impression\u201d with respect to the tissues in the head, and \u201cno obvious injury\u201d to the skull or the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">We disagree with Mr. Jones\u2019 characterization of Dr. Choquette\u2019s testimony, and find no abuse of discretion by the district court. In his expert report, Dr. Choquette stated that he had reviewed some of Mr. Jones\u2019 medical records, and the emergency room records showed that Mr. Jones did not have a skull fracture, nasal fracture, facial fracture, orbital fracture, or jaw fracture. <em>See </em>D.E. 52 at 1-2. Thus, assuming he was testifying at trial as an expert in reading from the emergency room records \u2014 including the radiologist\u2019s impressions of the CT scans \u2014 Dr. Choquette\u2019s testimony did not go beyond the expert report and did not surprise Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Jones. Indeed, at a hearing on Dr. Cho-quette\u2019s testimony, Mr. Jones\u2019 counsel conceded that \u201cthere is no fact issue about the injuries that Mr. Jones did not have[.]\u201d D.E. 89 at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"AKQz\">Contrary to what Mr. Jones argues in his brief, Dr. Choquette did not testify in the cited pages that Mr. Jones did not have any knots or bumps on his head. Indeed, on cross-examination Dr. Cho-quette admitted that some of the medical records (including some prepared by a nurse) showed someone \u201cwho had experienced numerous blows of some kind by something,\u201d described an injury to Mr. Jones\u2019 left eye, and noted bruising to the face and arms. <em>See </em>D.E. 89 at 169, 172-78, 178. Dr. Choquette also conceded that Mr. Jones was \u201cstruck around the head and face with something.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 182. We therefore reject Mr. Jones\u2019 contention that Deputy Webb and his counsel perpetrated a fraud on the court by knowingly presenting false testimony on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"ACq6\">Dr. Choquette did say that one of the CT scans did not show any knots on Mr. Jones\u2019 head, but that was on cross-examination in response to a question asked by Mr. Jones\u2019 counsel, and even then he acknowledged that normally CT scans are not ordered to look for bumps or knots on the head. <em>See id. </em>at 183-84. Given that his own counsel asked the question, Mr. Jones cannot complain about Dr. Choquette\u2019s answer or the use of that answer by Deputy Webb\u2019s counsel during closing argument. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1216 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cBecause Sarras\u2019 question elicited the very testimony about which he now complains, he is entitled to no relief.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Auz\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"AVFk\">Mr. Jones next asserts that the district court erred under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), and its progeny by allowing Dr. Choquette to testify that, if Mr. Jones\u2019 description of the assault was accurate, he would have expected to see lacerations to the scalp, skull fractures, torn blood vessels, and brain tissue damage, as well as some damage to the trachea and larynx. <em>See </em>D.E. 89 at 163-65. As Mr. Jones sees it, Dr. Choquette did not sufficiently describe the methodology he used to reach his opinion, thus rendering the opinion unreliable. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"AqO\">Again, we disagree with Mr. Jones. Dr. Choquette was an experienced emergency room physician who had treated hundreds of patients with blunt force trauma to the head caused by objects of one kind or another, and he was using that experience, combined with Mr. Jones\u2019 medical records, to render his opinion. <em>See, e.g., </em>D.E. 89 at 120-21. And that opinion was nothing more than an opinion as to what types of injuries would normally result from certain types of blows to, and force exerted on, the face, head, and neck. The district court concluded that the opinion was reliable because emergency room doctors have to \u201cmake evaluations as to whether or not there are internal injuries, whether or not it\u2019s child abuse ..., so they have to evaluate how things occurred from time to time.\u201d D.E. 89 at 135-36. That ruling was not an abuse of discretion. Our eases have made clear that experience can be a proper basis for expert testimony, <em>see United States v. Garcia, </em>447 F.3d 1327, 1336-37 (11th Cir.2006), and here we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>elude that the district court did not abdicate its role as gatekeeper under <em>Daubert </em>in concluding that reliability had been sufficiently established, and in allowing Dr. Choquette to testify as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Mr. Jones argues that the district court erred by giving the jury a modified <em>Allen </em>charge adapted from the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In our view, Mr. Jones has not shown reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The jury began its deliberations around noon on Friday, January 20, 2012, went home for the weekend, and resumed its deliberations on the morning of Monday, January 23, 2012. Sometime after 3 p.m. on January 23, the foreperson sent a note to the district court indicating that the jury was \u201cat a deadlock.\u201d The district court gave the jury an adapted and modified <em>Allen </em>charge over Mr. Jones\u2019 objection after considering the positions of the parties, the expenditure of the court\u2019s time, and the expense of .having to try the case again. <em>See </em>D.E. 90 at 1-5. The jury finished its deliberations on January 23 without reaching a verdict, and renewed its deliberations on January 24. After two hours of deliberations on January 24, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Deputy Webb. <em>See </em>D.E. 86 at 1-3; D.E. 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">As indicated in footnote 3, the district court added some language to the standard Eleventh Circuit modified <em>Allen </em>charge. This additional language concerned Mr. Jones\u2019 burden of proof: \u201cYou must also remember that if the evidence in this case fails to convince you ... that the plaintiff has proven each element of his case, then the defendant is entitled to a unanimous verdict in his favor. If the plaintiff has proven each element of his case, then the plaintiff is entitled to a unanimous verdict in his favor.\u201d D.E. 90 at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">Mr. Jones argues that the district court should have explained that his burden was to prove his case only by a preponderance of the evidence. But that contention ignores the fact that the district court told the jury to consider its last charge \u201cin conjunction with all of the other instructions [it] ha[d] previously given you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Because the previous jury instructions clearly explained that Mr. Jones had to prove the elements of his case only by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>see </em>D.E. 85 at 89-90, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to repeat that standard again.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">Finally, to the extent Mr. Jones is arguing that the adapted and modified <em>Allen </em>charge was unduly coercive, that contention is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See Brooks v. Bay State Abrasive Prods., Inc., </em>516 F.2d 1003, 1004 (5th Cir.1975) (modified <em>Allen </em>charge not coercive even though jury \u2014 which had only been deliberating for about three hours \u2014 was given charge at around 11 p.m. and returned its verdict at 11:09 p.m.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The judgment in favor of Deputy Webb is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-11\">. <em>See generally Allen v. United States, </em>164 U.S. 492, 501, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896); Eleventh Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions, Civil, Basic Instruction No. 9 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AYr\">. Mr. Jones' counsel did not review the CT scans until after the trial. <em>See </em>Appellant's Brief at 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">. The instruction omitted paragraphs 4 and 5 of the pattern civil instruction, and added a new paragraph after paragraph 6 telling the jurors that none of them were \u201cexpected to give up an honest belief that he or she may have as to the weight or effect of the evidence,\u201d but that it was their duty, \"after full deliberation and consideration of the evidence ... to agree upon a verdict if you can do so.\" D.E. 90 at 4. The instruction also added some language concerning Mr. Jones' burden of proof. We discuss that language in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b790-13\">. Because we conclude that the district court did not err in its handling of the trial, we reject Mr. Jones' argument that he was entitled to a new trial due to the cumulative prejudicial effect of the alleged errors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
