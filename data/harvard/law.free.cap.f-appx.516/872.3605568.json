Brown argues that he was prosecuted in retaliation for a civil rights complaint he filed against a correctional officer in a different federal prison and for filing grievances against officials at the Federal Correctional Institution in Talladega. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">On denial of a motion to dismiss for selective prosecution, we review findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir.2011). We \u201cgive particular deference to credibility determinations of [the district court because it] had the opportunity to see [the] live testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Lebowitz, </em>676 F.3d 1000, 1009 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-17\">\u201c[T]o establish selective prosecution, a defendant must show that [his] prosecution was predicated on a constitutionally impermissible motive, such as on the basis of race or religion, or in retaliation for [his] exercise of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Ndiaye, </em>434 F.3d 1270, 1288 (11th Cir.2006). The defendant \u201cbear[s] a \u2018demanding burden when seeking to establish that [he] [is] being selectively prosecuted in an unconstitutional manner.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 800, 807 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cIn order to dispel the presumption that a prosecutor has not violated equal protection, a criminal defendant must present clear evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. 456, 465, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 1486, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996)). \u201cThe requirements for a selective-prosecution claim draw on \u2018ordinary equal protection standards,\u2019 \u201d under which the defendant must prove \u201cthat the federal prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>policy \u2018had a discriminatory effect and that it was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. at 465, 116 S.Ct. at 1487 (quoting <em>Wayte v. United States, </em>470 U.S. 598, 608, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 1531, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985)). In addition, the First Amendment forbids prison officials from retaliating against a prisoner who has complained about actions of a correctional officer. <em>See O\u2019Bryant v. Finch, </em>637 F.3d 1207, 1212 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">The district court did not err by denying Brown\u2019s motion to dismiss for selective prosecution. Although Brown was prosecuted for assaulting officers using human waste when other inmates had not been prosecuted for similar misconduct, Brown failed to establish that he was prosecuted in retaliation for his protected activity. Warden John Rathman testified that he referred Brown\u2019s case for prosecution because he found it \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d for inmates to \u201cthrow[ ] feces on [a prison officer\u2019s] face.\u201d Although Brown introduced testimony from a fellow inmate, Jeremy Pinson, that he was told by Lieutenant James Preston and Assistant Warden Becky Clay that Brown\u2019s prosecution was retaliatory, the district court was entitled to discredit Pinson\u2019s testimony and to credit Lieutenant Preston\u2019s and Assistant Warden Clay\u2019s testimony that they never talked to Pinson about Brown. <em>See Lebowitz, </em>676 F.3d at 1009. Pinson had prior convictions for crimes of dishonesty, such as embezzlement, making a false statement to a United States Marshall, and for threatening to kill a juror and a secret service agent. Pinson also had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and having auditory and visual hallucinations. Brown also complained that his prosecution was in retaliation for grievances that he filed against prison officials in Talladega, but the district court was entitled to reach a contrary conclusion based on the testimonies of Special Agent Preston Leingang and Lieutenant Gregory Smith about Brown\u2019s interrogation. Agent Leingang testified that he investigated Brown without any knowledge of his grievances against prison officials, and Lieutenant Smith testified that neither he nor Agent Leingang threatened Brown or told him that he faced additional prison time if he continued to file grievances. The district court was entitled to find that Brown failed to \u201cpresent clear evidence\u201d to rebut the presumption that his prosecution was not predicated on an impermissible motive. <em>Smith, </em>231 F.3d at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We AFFIRM Brown\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
