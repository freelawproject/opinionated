SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">Eight respiratory therapists of Indian national origin appeal a summary judgment dismissing their employment-discrimination and retaliation claims against former employer Lone Star Health Management Associates, L.P., doing business as Dallas Regional Medical Center (\u201cDRMC\u201d), and DRMC\u2019s parent, Health Management Associates, Inc. (\u201cHMA\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">In 2008, DRMC hired Christiaan Evans to head its respiratory department. In mid-2009, Evans and DRMC human resources director Alayne Sewick developed a proposal, to restructure the department, that was reviewed and approved by HMA human resources director Linda Herriage. As part of the restructuring, which was announced to department members in November 2009, all respiratory therapists were required to re-interview for their jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">Evans and Sewick devised ten interview questions that Evans asked each therapist. The first nine were scored on a scale of 1 to 5 and were designed to test one of the following characteristics: overall attitude (four questions), abilities (three), knowledge (one), and skills (one). An \u201cextra credit\u201d question, worth three points and intended to assess knowledge, skills, and abilities, asked, \u201cWhat do you bring as an employee to DRMC?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">Evans took notes while conducting the interviews. Sewick and Evans subsequently awarded each employee a composite scored based on Evans\u2019s notes, Evans\u2019s recollections of the interviews, and some extrinsic evidence, including performance appraisals. The maximum score was 48, and DRMC terminated all fifteen therapists \u2014 including seven of eight plaintiffs \u2014 who scored below 24. Plaintiff Ku-rian Joseph scored above 24 but was also terminated; he had received a corrective counseling in the previous year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In total, sixteen of DRMC\u2019s thirty-two respiratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>therapists were fired: Twelve were Asian, one was black, and three were white. Of the sixteen remaining, seven were Asian, two were black, and seven were white. Between January and June 2010, DRMC hired ten new therapists, seven of whom were white.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Before his termination in December 2009, A. Assariathu anonymously called the DRMC compliance hotline and accused Evans of racial discrimination against Indian employees, including in the restructuring process. Herriage assigned Sewick to investigate the complaint despite Sewick\u2019s integral role in the restructuring.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the course of her investigation, Sewick interviewed several respiratory therapists, including plaintiffs A. Assariathu, Thomas Thomas, and Ra-dhadevi Pillai (\u201cR. Pillai\u201d). Sewick also asked Evans, who was unaware of the complaint against him, to provide data on his hiring practices since taking over the department.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After completing her investigation, Sewick determined that the restructuring was not discriminatory and that Evans had not otherwise engaged in discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">After being fired, the plaintiffs commenced Equal Employment Opportunity Commission proceedings against DRMC, then sued DRMC and HMA, asserting discrimination under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (\u201cTCHRA\u201d), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. The district court granted summary judgment to DRMC and HMA on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201cusing the same standard as that employed by the district court under Rule 56.\u201d <em>Kerstetter v. Pac. Scientific Co., </em>210 F.3d 431, 435 (5th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-11\"><em>Newman v. Guedry, </em>703 F.3d 757, 761 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">Under the TCHRA, \u201c[a]n employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race ... the employer ... discharges an individual or discriminates in any other manner against an individual.\u201d Tex. Labor Code Ann. \u00a7 21.051. Discrimination under Title VII occurs if an employer terminates or fails to promote an employee \u201cbecause of\u2019 a protected characteristic, including race. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). \u201cMoreover, an employer\u2019s action will be found unlawful if the employee can demonstrate that her race was \u2018a motivating factor\u2019 for her firing, even if the employer was also motivated by other lawful factors.\u201d <em>Vaughn v. Woodforest Bank, </em>665 F.3d 632, 636 (5th Cir.2011). Section 1981(a) guarantees that \u201c[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States ... shall have the same right ... to make and enforce contracts\u201d regardless of race.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">The same evidentiary framework governs discrimination claims brought under the TCHRA, Title VII, and \u00a7 1981. <em>Shackelford v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, LLP, </em>190 F.3d 398, 404 n. 2 (5th Cir.1999). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>apply the burden-shifting approach of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and its progeny. <em>Vaughn, </em>665 F.3d at 636. A plaintiff must first demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>case, after which the burden of production shifts to the defendant to proffer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its decision. The presumption of discrimination drops out if the defendant presents a nondiscriminatory reason. <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). The plaintiff, who always carries the ultimate burden, \u201cmust then offer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact either (1) that the defendant\u2019s reason is not true, but is instead a pretext for discrimination (pretext alternative); or (2) that the defendant\u2019s reason, while true, is only one of the reasons for its conduct, and another \u2018motivating factor\u2019 is the plaintiff\u2019s protected characteristic (mixed-motive[s] alternative).\u201d <em>Rachid v. Jack In The Box, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 305, 312 (5th Cir.2004) (internal marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Because DRMC and HMA do not contest that plaintiffs have presented a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination, our analysis begins with DRMC and HMA\u2019s articulated nondiscriminatory reason for the terminations: departmental restructuring, citing the seven low scores in the interviews with Evans, and, in the case of Joseph, prior corrective counseling. Plaintiffs do not dispute that poor job performance is a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for termination. <em>See Little v. Republic Ref. Co., </em>924 F.2d 93, 96 (5th Cir.1991). Therefore, DRMC and HMA have met their burden of production with regard to Joseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">Plaintiffs do contend that, despite producing the low interview scores of the seven other plaintiffs, DRMC and HMA have not articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, because the justification for the scores is not \u201cclear and reasonably specific.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Alvarado, </em>492 F.3d at 617, we held that the employer did not meet its burden where the raw interview scores it produced for Alvarado were accompanied by \u201cneither an explanation nor evidence of how or why the interviewers arrived at those scores.\u201d <em>Alvarado </em>is in-apposite, however, because \u201cthis is simply not a case where the defendant relies on nothing more than a unexplained interview score that might be consistent with discriminatory intent.\u201d <em>Joseph v. City of Dall, </em>277 Fed.Appx. 436, 441 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Although conceding that Evans\u2019s interview notes were lost, DRMC and HMA have extensively explained the scores through deposition testimony and the production of documents, including the interview questions and the characteristic each question was intended to assess. Whether those explanations are <em>true </em>is another matter, discussed <em>infra, </em>but DRMC and HMA have satisfied their burden of production.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">The burden therefore shifts back to plaintiffs, who must show that the articu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>lated nondiscriminatory reason for their termination was either (1) pretextual or (2) true, but only one of the reasons for DRMC and HMA\u2019s conduct, and another \u201cmotivating factor\u201d was race. <em>Rachid, </em>376 F.3d at 312. Plaintiffs allege both pretext and mixed motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Pretext can be established by showing disparate treatment or that the \u201c[legitimate] explanation is false or \u2018unworthy of credence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vaughn, </em>665 F.3d at 637. Disparate treatment is established by proving that the employer treated similarly situated employees differently for \u201cnearly identical conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Evans yelled at Indian respiratory therapists when he was dissatisfied by their performance yet never treated Caucasian employees rudely. Plaintiffs make no showing, however, that the newly-hired Caucasian therapists engaged in the same or similar conduct as did plaintiffs. <em>See Little, </em>924 F.2d at 96-97.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Most of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments focus on the alleged falsity of DRMC and HMA\u2019s nondiscriminatory explanations, which are \u201cunworthy of credence if ... not the real reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Laxton v. Gap Inc., </em>333 <em>F.3d 572, </em>578 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cEvidence demonstrating the falsity of the defendant\u2019s explanation, taken together with the <em>prima facie </em>case, is likely to support an inference of discrimination even without further evidence of defendant\u2019s true motive.\u201d <em>Sandstad v. CB Richard Ellis, Inc., </em>309 F.3d 893, 897 (5th Cir.2002). But, \u201c[m]erely casting doubt on the employer\u2019s articulated reason does not suffice to meet the plaintiffs burden of demonstrating discriminatory intent.\u201d <em>Bienkowski v. Am. Airlines, </em>851 F.2d 1503, 1508 n. 6 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Plaintiffs contend that DRMC and HMA\u2019s proffer of departmental restructuring as the nondiscriminatory reason is false, because (1) 2009 performance appraisals were not conducted for terminated employees; (2) the department restructuring was never implemented; (3) DRMC and HMA gave inconsistent reasons for plaintiffs\u2019 termination; and (4) DRMC and HMA committed multiple violations of their own policies and procedures in (a) investigating A. Assariathu\u2019s discrimination complaint and (b) losing Evans\u2019s interview notes. Though embedded within a racial discrimination claim, most of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments constitute nothing more than a criticism of DRMC and HMA\u2019s subjective business decision to terminate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\u201c[W]e do not view the discrimination laws as vehicles for judicial second-guessing of business decisions.\u201d <em>Walton v. Bis-co Indus., Inc., </em>119 F.3d 368, 372 (5th Cir.1997). That DRMC and HMA\u2019s choices were arguably wrong or poorly executed does not change our analysis \u201cso long as those decisions are not the result of discrimination.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Watkins, </em>619 F.3d 463, 468 n. 5 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam). Moreover, DRMC and HMA\u2019s alleged \u201cdisregard of its own hiring system does not of itself conclusively establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>that improper discrimination occurred or that a nondiscriminatory explanation for an action is pretextual.\u201d <em>EEOC v. Tex. Instruments Inc., </em>100 F.3d 1173, 1182 (5th Cir.1996) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">With respect to plaintiffs\u2019 argument that DRMC personnel\u2019s allegedly inconsistent reasons for their termination raise a fact issue under <em>Burrell v. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Grp., Inc., </em>482 F.3d 408 (5th Cir.2007), the plaintiffs \u201cask[ ] too much of <em>Burrell,\u201d </em>because DRMC\u2019s \u201crationale has essentially remained the same.\u201d <em>Nunley v. City of Waco, </em>440 Fed.Appx. 275, 277-78 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam). To make out a discrimination claim, plaintiffs \u201cmust establish some nexus between the employment actions taken\u201d and their race. <em>Tex. Instruments, </em>100 F.3d at 1182 (internal quotation omitted). Because plaintiffs\u2019 falsity arguments rest only on a \u201cbald assertion\u201d that such a nexus exists, they cannot survive summary judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">\n<em>2.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Under the mixed-motive theory, a plaintiff can defeat summary judgment by offering \u201csufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact ... that the defendant\u2019s reason, while true, is only one of the reasons for its conduct, and another \u2018motivating factor\u2019 is the plaintiffs protected characteristic.\u201d <em>Rachid, </em>376 F.3d at 312. Plaintiffs point to statements made by Evans as evidence that discriminatory animus was a motivating factor in DRMC\u2019s decision to terminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">According to four of the plaintiffs, Evans expressed a desire to put a \u201cnew face\u201d on the department; no plaintiff, however, has presented evidence \u2014 beyond a subjective belief<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 that Evans meant a \u201cnon-Indian\u201d or \u201cwhite\u201d face. Indeed, when asked, Evans clarified his statement as referring to his desire to hire \u201cmore respiratory, that\u2019s all.\u201d Joseph has claimed that, on two occasions, Evans vowed to \u201cget rid of these people,\u201d meaning Joseph and another technician in one incident and plaintiffs Shiny Abraham and D. Pillai in the other. On one of those occasions, Evans allegedly referred to the objects of his ire as \u201clazy, lousy people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">But there is no evidence \u2014 again, beyond some plaintiffs\u2019 subjective belief \u2014 that Evans meant \u201cIndian people\u201d rather than \u201cemployees with whom he was dissatisfied.\u201d Plaintiffs further allege that Evans was generally rude to Indian employees. As noted above in our discussion of disparate treatment, there is no summary judgment evidence that Evans differently treated Asian and Caucasian employees <em>who engaged in similar conduct. See Vaughn, </em>665 F.3d at 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">One of the Caucasian respiratory therapists, Rick Daniel, did make unambiguously discriminatory comments against Indians on numerous occasions to multiple plaintiffs. The record shows that although Daniel was intimately involved in the planned departmental restructuring, he had no role in the antecedent termination decisions. When asked whether he \u201crecall[ed] discussing with Chris Evans regarding the terminations of the employees in the department during the restructuring,\u201d Daniel stated that \u201cthe only thing I really remember is when [Evans] first mentioned [the departmental restructuring] to me and we started talking about the list [of employees scheduled to be terminated], there was one person on the list [Abraham] I tried to talk him out of, but I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>wasn\u2019t successful.\u201d Thus, based on Daniel\u2019s testimony, we agree with the district court that plaintiffs have provided no evidence that he had any influence on the decision to terminate plaintiffs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In addition to discrimination, Title VII prohibits retaliation \u2014 an employer may not \u201cdiscriminate against any of his employees ... because [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge ... in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Plaintiffs contend that DRMC and HMA retaliated against them by terminating their employment after A. Assariathu had complained about Evans\u2019s allegedly discriminatory practices and other plaintiffs participated in Sewick\u2019s subsequent investigation. \u201c[T]he familiar <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework applies in Title VTI retaliation cases.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cA plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation by showing (i) he engaged in a protected activity, (ii) an adverse employment action occurred, and (iii) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Yellow Transp., Inc., </em>670 F.3d 644, 657 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 138 S.Ct. 136, 184 L.Ed.2d 29 (2012). We agree with the district court that the retaliation claims of Abraham, D. Pillai, Joseph, and Susan Mathew fail at step one, because they concede that they did not engage in a protected activity. Because those plaintiffs do not challenge that portion of the district court\u2019s ruling, we consider their retaliation claims abandoned.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">We next consider the plaintiffs who participated in the complaint and subsequent investigation: A. Assariathu, Reena Assariathu, R. Pillai, and Thomas. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that those plaintiffs have made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, DRMC and HMA have offered a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for their termination, as discussed in part III.A above. The burden then shifts back to plaintiffs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-14\">To defeat a motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must demonstrate \u201ca conflict in substantial evidence on [the] ultimate issue\u201d of \u201cbut for\u201d causation. Evidence is \u201csubstantial\u201d if it is of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-15\"><em>Hernandez, </em>670 F.3d at 658.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because plaintiffs offer no proof that the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>retaliatory motive was a necessary cause of their termination, their retaliation claims fail. <em>See Nunley, </em>440 Fed.Appx. at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
