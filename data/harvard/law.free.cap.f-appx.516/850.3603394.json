On appeal, he argues that the district court misapplied Rule 35(b) by failing to consider factors other than his substantial assistance in reducing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Based on the substantial assistance Morgan provided, the government moved for a sentence reduction under 35(b) and recommended that the court reduce Morgan\u2019s original sentence of 120 months imprisonment to 102 months. Morgan argued that his assistance warranted a greater reduction and that the court should consider non-assistance factors in deciding whether to order a greater reduction. The court found that Morgan had provided substantial assistance and granted the government\u2019s motion, but it declined to consider non-assistance factors. The court reduced Morgan\u2019s sentence to 84 months imprisonment. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of law to sentencing. <em>United States v. Manella, </em>86 F.3d 201, 203 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Upon the government\u2019s motion, a district court may reduce a sentence \u201cif the defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1) (2012). In <em>Manella </em>we held that \u201cthe only factor that may militate <em>in favor of </em>a Rule 35(b) reduction is the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance.\u201d 86 F.2d at 204. Morgan acknowledges that <em>Manella </em>is binding case law but contends that it should be reconsidered in light of the intervening amendments to Rule 35(b) and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Pepper v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">Under the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow a prior panel decision unless it has been overruled by this Court en banc or \u201chas been substantially undermined or overruled by either a change in statutory law or Supreme Court jurisprudence or if it is in conflict -with existing Supreme Court precedent.\u201d <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1284 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see also United States v. Marte, </em>356 F.3d 1336, 1344 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe are authorized to depart from a prior panel decision based upon an intervening Supreme Court decision only if that decision actually overruled or conflicted with it.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Morgan relies on two sets of revisions that have been made to Rule 35 since <em>Manella. </em>In 2002 the language of Rule 35 was amended for \u201cstylistic\u201d purposes. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 Advisory Committee\u2019s Note, 2002 Amendments. The language of Rule 35(b) was changed from permitting the court to lower a sentence \u201cto reflect\u201d substantial assistance to permitting the court to reduce a sentence \u201cif\u2019 the defendant provided substantial assistance. <em>See United States v. Tadio, </em>663 F.3d 1042, 1049 (9th Cir.2011). In 2007 Rule 35(b) was amended to conform to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 Advisory Committee\u2019s Note, 2007 Amendments. Subdivision 35(b)(1)(B), which required that a sentence reduction under Rule 35(b) was in accordance with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s guidelines, was deleted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">In <em>Tadio, </em>the case on which Morgan relies, the Ninth Circuit held that \u201c[t]he most natural reading of the current language [of Rule 35(b) ] is ... that non-assistance factors may be considered symmetrically to allow a reduction that is either more or less than the reduction that the assistance, considered alone, would warrant.\u201d <em>Tadio, </em>663 F.3d at 1050. The court also concluded that the 2007 amendments \u201canticipated that district courts would enjoy greater latitude to tailor sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>tence reductions in light of other statutory-concerns than substantial assistance considered alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1051 (quotation marks omitted). Notably, the court was deciding for the first time whether non-assistance factors could justify a greater sentence reduction under Rule 35(b), not whether Rule 35(b)\u2019s amendments undermined an earlier decision limiting the use of non-assistance factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1051-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Even if we were persuaded by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning, we are still bound by our prior precedent rule to follow <em>Marietta. </em>The 2002 amendments, which were merely stylistic, and the 2007 amendments, which were written to conform Rule 35(b) to <em>Booker, </em>have not substantially undermined or overruled <em>Marietta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\"><em>Pepper, </em>decided by the Supreme Court after <em>Marietta, </em>also does not overrule <em>Marietta. Pepper </em>held that factors such as a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation can be considered \u201cwhen a defendant\u2019s sentence has been set aside on appeal and his case remanded for resentencing.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 1241. <em>Pepper </em>did not address what factors could be considered when granting a sentence reduction under a Rule 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">In light of our decision in <em>Marietta, </em>the district court did not err by declining to consider non-assistance factors in deciding Morgan\u2019s sentence reduction under Rule 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
