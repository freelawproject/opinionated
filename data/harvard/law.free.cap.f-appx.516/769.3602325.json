In November 2008, Smith moved the District Court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines relating to crack cocaine, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 The court denied his motion because the Guidelines sentence range, pursuant to which he had been sentenced, was not changed by the application of Amendment 706. That is, because he had previously been convicted of at least two controlled substance offenses, he had been sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(B), as a career offender, rather than \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-23\">In January 2012, Smith filed a second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for the reduction of his sentence based on Amendment 750 to the Guidelines, what Smith labeled the \u201cpermanent amendment\u201d to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. The court denied his motion, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-24\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling on the ground that Amendment 750 does not apply in this case. As noted above, Smith\u2019s sentence was imposed pursuant to the career offender guideline, \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(B), not \u00a7 2D1.1. Accordingly, Amendment 750\u2019s lowering of the \u00a7 2D1.1 base offense level \u201cwould not lower the sentencing range upon which [Smith\u2019s] sentence was based.\u201d <em>United States v.
