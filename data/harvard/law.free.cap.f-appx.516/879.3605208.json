Hudson argues that the district court improperly engaged in the plea negotiations, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1), because the court responded to Hudson\u2019s expressed concern for his family\u2019s safety. Hudson also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because his attorney conceded that a general arrest warrant authorized police officers to enter a mobile home and arrest Hudson. After review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">\u201cWhere, as here, the defendant fails to object to an asserted Rule 11 violation before the district court, we review the alleged violation for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Davila, </em>664 F.3d 1355, 1358 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 831, 184 L.Ed.2d 646 (2013). We have stated that \u201c[j]udicial participation [in plea negotiations] is plain error, and the defendant need not show actual prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d 1132, 1135 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam). We do not recognize harmless error in the context of judicial participation. <em>Davila, </em>664 F.3d at 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">Rule 11(c) provides that the government and the defendant \u201cmay discuss and reach a plea agreement\u201d, but \u201c[t]he court must not participate in these discussions.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rule 11(c)(1) states a \u201cbright line rule\u201d that \u201cprohibit[s] the participation of the judge in plea negotiations under any circumstances ... [and] admits of no exceptions.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>89 F.3d 778, 783 (11th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSimply put, district courts should not offer any comments -touching upon this subject.\u201d <em>Tobin, </em>676 F.3d at 1307 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-16\">\u201cRule ll\u2019s prohibition on court participation in plea negotiations is designed to totally eliminate judicial pressure from the plea bargaining process.\u201d <em>United States v. Casallas, </em>59 F.3d 1173, 1178 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Three rationales underlie this \u201cstrict prohibition on judicial participation: (1) judicial involvement in plea negotiations inevitably carries with it the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>high and unacceptable risk of coercing a defendant to accept the proposed agreement and plead guilty; (2) the prohibition protects the integrity of the judicial process; and (3) the ban preserves the judge\u2019s impartiality after the negotiations are completed.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>89 F.3d at 782-83 (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, even a court\u2019s well-intentioned concern that the defendant be thoroughly apprised of the situation will not excuse judicial participation. <em>Tobin, </em>676 F.3d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">We have held that there was no Rule 11 violation where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-6\">(1) the district court\u2019s statements were made during a change-of-plea colloquy; (2) the court responded to the defendant\u2019s hesitance with invitations to break off the colloquy and go to trial, which the defendant did not accept; (3) the statements did not \u201ctouch on the sentence\u201d; (4) the statements were not otherwise coercive, but correctly identified the \u201cobvious risk\u201d of pleading guilty to the substantive offense and proceeding to trial on the conspiracy charge; and (5) the statements reminded the defendant of his right to choose between the two courses, but explicitly left the decision to the defendant and his attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-8\"><em>Johnson, </em>89 F.3d at 783-84. Under those circumstances, we stated that the district court was merely going to \u201csome lengths to satisfy\u201d the other requirements of Rule 11. <em>Id. </em>at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Here, the district court did not violate Rule 11 when it responded to Hudson\u2019s expressed concerns regarding the safety of his family members. No discussions concerning the terms of the plea or the sentence that would be imposed \u2014 other than the advice that Rule 11(c) requires the court to give a defendant \u2014 occurred during the colloquy by the court. While the court did state that cooperation works to everyone\u2019s advantage, it also stated that cooperation resulted in a credit in scoring, and that the government would not make empty promises because it wanted future defendants to cooperate. None of these statements rise to the level of discussing the penal consequences of a plea. <em>See Casallas, </em>59 F.3d at 1176-78 (holding that the district court operated to coerce the plea in violation of Rule 11 when the court contrasted the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence faced by pleading guilty to a conspiracy count with the 15-year mandatory minimum sentence faced by going to trial, and suggested that the defendant \u201ctalk to his lawyer ... and see if [a trial] is really what he wants to do\u201d). The court spoke only of pleas in general and in no way specifically linked its comments to Hudson\u2019s situation. <em>See Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d at 1133, 1134-35 (holding that the district court violated Rule 11 when it stated that if the defendants went to trial, they would receive a fair trial and a \u201cfair sentence, fairly high\u201d if convicted). It is clear that the district court here did not participate in the plea negotiation itself because it did not make the types of comments that we have held violate Rule 11(c)(1) and did not respond to Hudson\u2019s question in a coercive manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">\u201c[EJxcept in the rare instance when the record is sufficiently developed, we will not address claims for ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in most cases, the record is inadequate to raise an ineffective-assistance claim on direct appeal because the trial evidence was devoted to guilt-or-innocence issues, as opposed to the reasoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>behind counsel\u2019s actions. 538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). It observed that the record \u201cmay contain no evidence of alleged errors of omission, much less the reasons underlying them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505, 123 S.Ct. at 1694. As such, \u201can ineffective assistance of counsel claim is properly raised in a collateral attack on the conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255,\u201d as opposed to direct appeal. <em>Merrill, </em>513 F.3d at 1308 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Hudson raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim for the first time on direct appeal. As such, the district court did not develop a factual record or otherwise rule on those allegations. We therefore conclude the record is not sufficiently developed and we decline to address the merits of that claim at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-11\">. Many of the cited cases in this opinion address former Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e)(1), which provided that a court \"shall not participate in any discussions between the parties concerning any such plea agreement.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1) (2002). The change in language between the former Rule 11(e)(1) and the current Rule 11(c)(1) is \u201cstylistic and does not alter the substantive law.\u201d <em>United States v. Tobin, </em>676 F.3d 1264, 1303 n. 23 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied - U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 658, 184 L.Ed.2d 458 (2012). Accordingly, case law addressing former Rule 11(e)(1) applies to the current version of the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
