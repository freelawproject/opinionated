We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-23\">Tovar contends that the district court committed clear error when it enhanced his offense level by four levels for firearms trafficking. <em>See </em>United States Sentenoing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2007). He contends further that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it fails to recognize that he met many of the objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-24\">Under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), a four-level enhancement applies if the defendant \u201ctransported, transferred, or otherwise disposed of two or more firearms to another individual, or received two or more firearms with the intent to transport, transfer, or otherwise dispose of firearms to another individual,\u201d knowing or having \u201creason to believe that such conduct would result in the transport, transfer, or disposal of a firearm\u201d to someone \u201cwhose possession or receipt of the firearm would be unlawful\u201d or to someone \u201cwho intended to use or dispose of the firearm unlawfully.\u201d United States Sentenoing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 13(A) (2007). Whether \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) applies is a factual issue. <em>United States v. Juarez, </em>626 F.3d 246, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>251-52 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2010). We need not determine the standard of review concerning this issue, given that Tovar \u201ccannot demonstrate any error at all\u201d with regard to the enhancement. <em>United States v. Teuschler, </em>689 F.3d 397, 400 (5th Cir.<em>2012); see also United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We may affirm on any basis found in the record. <em>United States v. Ho, </em>311 F.3d 589, 602 n. 12 (5th Cir.2002). There is \u201cconsiderable evidence from which the district court could infer that [Tovar] knew or had reason to believe that [his] conduct would result in the transport, transfer, or disposal of [ ] firearm[s] to an individual\u201d \u2014 Aaron Landry \u2014 \u201cwho intended to use or dispose of the \u00f1rearm[s] unlawfully.\u201d <em>Juarez, </em>626 F.3d at 252; <em>see also United States v. Shipley, </em>963 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir.1992). Instead of himself purchasing firearms <em>for </em>use as barter, Landry directed Tovar and another person to acquire them, \u201cindicating that he did not wish to be associated with the transactions.\u201d <em>Juarez, </em>626 F.3d at 252. And as Tovar stipulated, Landry then used the two rifles as barter or payment for drugs obtained from a Mexican drug supplier.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">It is unlawful for an unlicensed person in Louisiana, which one could reasonably infer Landry to be, to trade (whether or not for drugs) a firearm to an unlicensed person who did not reside in Louisiana, as one could reasonably infer of Landry\u2019s crystal methamphetamine dealer in Mexico. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(5); <em>see also Juarez, </em>626 F.3d at 252; <em>of. United States v. Rodriguez, </em>132 F.3d 208, 210-12 (5th Cir.1997). Additionally, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has held that\u201d trading a firearm for drugs \u201cshows a sufficient nexus between firearms and drug trafficking to warrant conviction\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) for possessing a firearm in relation to a crime of drug trafficking. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 423 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 236, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)). Consequently, we do not disturb the district court\u2019s calculation of Tovar\u2019s total offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We also reject Tovar\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. The district court gave extensive reasons for its chosen sentence, emphasizing Tovar\u2019s significant criminal history. Those reasons comport with the sentencing factors established by Congress. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because it is within the properly calculated guidelines range, Tovar\u2019s sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The record offers no convincing reason for us to forgo applying that presumption and to substitute another sentence for the one chosen by the district court. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
