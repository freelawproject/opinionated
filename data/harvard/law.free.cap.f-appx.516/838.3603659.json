The district court concluded that Mobley was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because Mobley\u2019s 151-month sentence was based on his status as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if the defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (providing that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">A sentence reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). As such, when a crack cocaine defendant\u2019s offense level was determined by the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), the defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on amendments to the crack cocaine offense levels in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) because those amendments did not lower the sentencing range upon which the defendant\u2019s sentence was based. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327 (involving Amendment 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">The district court did not err in denying Mobley\u2019s request for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. At his sentencing, Mobley was designated a career offender, and his offense level and resulting sentencing range were based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, not on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Amendment 750 did not affect the offense levels in \u00a7 4B1.1 and therefore did not lower Mobley\u2019s sentencing range. Under our binding precedent in <em>Moore, </em>the district court did not have authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Mobley\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">Although Mobley argues that <em>Moore </em>was abrogated by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>(2011), this Court recently rejected that argument in <em>United States v. Lawson. See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012) (concluding that, even after <em>Freeman, Moore </em>remains binding precedent in our Circuit).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Mobley contends that <em>Lawson </em>\u201cshould not control [his] appeal\u201d because, unlike the defendant in <em>Lawson, </em>Mobley received a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure for substantial assistance and was ultimately sentenced below his career offender guidelines range. This factual distinction is not a basis to ignore <em>Lawson\u2019s </em>conclusion that <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule <em>Moore. </em>Moreover, it is not <em>Lawson, </em>but <em>Moore </em>that controls Mobley\u2019s appeal. In <em>Moore, </em>one of the defendants, like Mobley, received a substantial assistance downward departure. 541 F.3d at 1330. Yet, we concluded in <em>Moore </em>that the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on his career offender sentencing range and that he was therefore ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. <em>Id. </em>We remain bound by <em>Moore, </em>and, under <em>Moore, </em>Mobley was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">For these reasons, the district court correctly concluded it did not have authority to reduce Mobley\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-11\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
