The district court granted Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment to dismiss White\u2019s claims grounded in alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000(e)-5, and the Americans With Disabilities Act, alleging sex discrimination, disability discrimination, and retaliation. The court did so after determining that White had failed to present any summary judgment evidence of employment discrimination or retaliation (other than his subjective beliefs) sufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact that the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons put forth by Appellee for firing White were pretextual or that it had retaliated against White for anything at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-21\">We have reviewed the record on appeal and the applicable facts and law as presented by the parties in their appellate briefs and by the magistrate judge to whom this case was transferred with the consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 836, and we are satisfied that her Final Judgment of August 28, 2012, dismissing White\u2019s action, should be affirmed for essentially the reasons patiently explained in the magistrate judge\u2019s 15 page Memorandum Opinion and Order on Motion for Summary Judgment, also dated August 28, 2012. In essence, she correctly determined that White was fired on the basis of a unanimous decision of a five-administrator committee (two male and three female) because of his repeated refusal to comply with instructions and guidelines for billing Medicaid, despite his having been trained in the proper methodology, cautioned following numerous failures to comply, placed on probation for such billing errors, and billed Medicaid for the time he spent on travel or on time other than directly in the service of mental health clients of Appellee, in disregard of express instructions not to do so. Neither do White\u2019s own healthcare providers or any other evidence support a claim of a disability recognized under the ADA; nor is there record evidence of any protected act or omission by White in retaliation for which Appellee might have terminated his employment or taken any adverse action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In contrast, Appellee adduced substantial summary judgment evidence in support of the conclusion that its firing of White was grounded in legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons that were in no way related to his sex, his age, or any disability, actual or perceived. White\u2019s vague references to \u201cevidence\u201d that he would present on trial fall well short of the standard required by this and other courts to establish the presence of the genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The judgment of the district court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
