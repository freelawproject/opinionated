Castro Perez argues that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his homosexuality. He contends that he suffered past persecution at the hands of his brother, who was concerned that Castro Perez\u2019s sexual orientation would damage his political career. He asserts that he will be persecuted by his brother if he is removed to Guatemala, and he argues that it is a logical fallacy to conclude, as did the BIA, that the government\u2019s willingness to prosecute his brother for attempting to murder a town mayor suggests the government\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>willingness to take action against his brother for beating him on account of his sexual orientation.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">We review the decision of the BIA, as well as the decision of the immigration judge to the extent that his decision influenced the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593-94 (5th Cir.2007). We will uphold the BIA\u2019s factual findings if the findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Silwany-Rodriguez v. INS, </em>975 F.2d 1157, 1160 (5th Cir.1992). Under the substantial evidence standard, we will not reverse the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion but compels it. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">To demonstrate entitlement to withholding of removal, the alien must show that it is more likely than not that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the country of origin on account of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Zamora-Morel v. INS, </em>905 F.2d 833, 837 (5th Cir.1990). An alien who suffered persecution in the past is entitled to a rebutta-ble presumption that he will be persecuted in the future. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1). To prevail on a claim of past persecution, an alien must establish that he suffered persecution at- the hands of \u201cthe government or forces that a government is unable or unwilling to control.\u201d <em>Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 113 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u201c[Pjerseeution is an <em>extreme </em>concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d <em>Arif v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 677, 680 (5th Cir.2007). The evidence adduced in the immigration court shows that Castro Perez was physically attacked and verbally abused on several occasions due to his brother\u2019s displeasure with Castro Perez\u2019s sexual orientation, but there is no indication that Castro Perez was injured or that he required medical attention; nor is there evidence that Castro Perez requested government intervention and was refused assistance. The mistreatment experienced by Castro Perez at the hands of his brother, though reprehensible, falls short of the required extreme conduct needed to establish persecution. <em>See id,.; see also Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 583 (5th Cir.1996) (upholding the BIA\u2019s finding of no past persecution where alien was twice arrested, detained, and beaten but he was not detained overnight and did not characterize the beatings as severe). The record does not compel a conclusion that Castro Perez was persecuted in the past, nor does the record compel a conclusion that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of his homosexuality if he is removed to Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">' PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
