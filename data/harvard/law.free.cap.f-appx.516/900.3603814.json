Rogozinski argues that counsel had a conflict of interest and that his conviction was predicated on perjured testimony. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">The district court did not err in concluding that Rogozinski failed to prove that \u201can actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Caderno v. United States, </em>256 F.3d 1213, 1218 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980)). Rogozinski criticized counsel before trial, but the district court determined at a pre-trial hearing that Ro-gozinski\u2019s dissatisfaction stemmed from counsel\u2019s refusal to file pretrial motions that Rogozinski had prepared. Later, Ro-gozinski filed a civil complaint against his counsel, but the district court dismissed that complaint as frivolous. We affirmed the dismissal of that complaint. <em>Rogozinski v. Spaulding, </em>330 Fed.Appx. 170 (11th Cir.2009). Rogozinski argues that his pretrial motions should have been filed by counsel, but Rogozinski fails to identify what motions should have been filed or to explain how they would have affected his case. Rogozinski also alleges that counsel should have objected to certain questions and arguments made by the prosecutor and to the admission of a duplicate of a check, but counsel did not act inconsistent with Rogozinski\u2019s interests by failing to raise arguments that we rejected as merit-less on direct appeal, <em>United States v. Rogozinski, </em>339 Fed.Appx. 963, 968-69 (11th Cir.2009). <em>See Freeman v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>536 F.3d 1225, 1233 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cA lawyer cannot be deficient for failing to raise a meritless claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">The district court correctly concluded that Rogozinski\u2019s argument about perjured testimony was procedurally barred. Rogo-zinski defaulted his claim that he was \u201cindicted and/or convicted on perjured testimony\u201d by failing to raise the argument on direct appeal. <em>See Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998); <em>Mills v. United States, </em>36 F.3d 1052, 1055 (11th Cir.1994). And Rogozinski failed to provide cause to excuse his default, <em>see Reece v. United States, </em>119 F.3d 1462, 1465 (11th Cir.1997), or to establish that he was actually innocent, <em>see Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S.Ct. 851, 867, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">We AFFIRM the denial of Rogozinski\u2019s motion to vacate his conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
