Appellant first argues that the Commission\u2019s interpretation of this ICA should be subject to a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. It is binding law in this circuit that a federal court reviews a state utility commission\u2019s interpretation of an ICA under an arbitrary and capricious standard. <em>Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n of Tex., </em>208 F.3d 475, 482 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Budget Prepay, Inc. v. AT&amp;T Corp., </em>605 F.3d 273, 276 (5th Cir.2010). We decline Appellant\u2019s request for us to overrule that precedent, which at any rate we cannot do. <em>Lowrey v. Tex. A &amp; M Univ. Sys., </em>117 F.3d 242, 247 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201c[0]ne panel of this court cannot overrule the decision of another panel; such panel decisions may be overruled only by a subsequent decision of the Supreme Court or by the Fifth Circuit sitting <em>en banc.\u201d). </em>As to the district court\u2019s finding that the Commission\u2019s ruling was not arbitrary and capricious, we agree with the court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
