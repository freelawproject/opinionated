The BIA denied the motion as without merit and on the alternative basis that the motion did not meet the statutory requirements set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Karichu has failed to brief, and has thus abandoned, the issue of whether the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen on the ground that it did not meet the statutory requirements for motions to reopen. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Because the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen on the ground that it did not meet the statutory requirements set forth in \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) presents an independent, unchallenged basis for affirming the BIA\u2019s decision, we deny Karichu\u2019s petition for review on that basis without addressing Karichu\u2019s remaining arguments. -See <em>Walker v. Thompson, </em>214 F.3d 615, 624-25 (5th Cir.2000), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 67, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-18\">. Karichu did address this issue in his reply brief. We do not ordinarily consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief, though we have discretion to do so. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 360 (5th Cir.2010). We find no occasion to exercise our discretion to consider them here because the arguments in his reply brief are unavailing. <em>See Waggoner v. Gonzales, </em>488 F.3d 632, 639 (5th Cir.2007)(addressing procedural requirements for a motion to reopen and holding that because Waggoner did not submit an application with her motion to reopen, the \"BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Waggoner\u201d the relief she sought).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
