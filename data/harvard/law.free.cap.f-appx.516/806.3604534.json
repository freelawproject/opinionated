Moncrieffe alleged violations of his rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and resulting emotional distress. The magistrate judge concluded that Moncrieffe\u2019s constitutional claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 489, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2373, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because he failed to show that his conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>for violating his probation was reversed or expunged before bringing the instant action. The district court subsequently dismissed Moncrieffe\u2019s complaint, and adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation. On appeal, Moncrieffe presented no arguments and merely restated the five claims found in his complaint. Upon review of the record and consideration of Moncrieffe\u2019s brief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), viewing the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1159-60 (11th Cir.2003). Section 1915(e) provides that an <em>in forma pauperis </em>action or appeal shall be dismissed at any time if the court determines that it fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Under <em>Heck, </em>if a judgment in favor of the plaintiff on his \u00a7 1983 complaint for money damages \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\u201d the district court must dismiss the complaint unless \u201cthe plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d 512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. \u201c[E]ven when the plaintiff does not seek such damages, his suit may be barred if, for example, he must negate an element of the offense of which he has been convicted in order to prevail-\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>350 F.3d at 1160 (internal quotation marks omitted). If success on the complaint would not necessarily invalidate the conviction or sentence, however, then the \u00a7 1983 action should be allowed to proceed, absent some other bar to suit. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Finally, reputation alone, apart from some other tangible interest, is not a \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d interest by itself sufficient to invoke the procedural protection of the Due Process Clause. <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 701-02, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1160-61, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976) (noting that the weight of decisions \u201cestablishes no constitutional doctrine converting every defamation by a public official into a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment\u201d) (internal citation omitted). \u201cDefamation, by itself, is a tort actionable under the laws of most States, but not a constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 233, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 1794, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991). Specifically, defamation occurring without the termination or significant alteration of some other legal right or status will not suffice to constitute a deprivation sufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Von Stein v. Brescher, </em>904 F.2d 572, 582 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Here, the district court did not err by dismissing Moncrieffe\u2019s complaint as barred by <em>Heck. </em>Viewing all of the allegations in Moncrieffe\u2019s complaint as true, a judgment in his favor, whether it is an award for damages or an order for his release, would necessarily imply that his conviction for violating his probation is invalid. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. While Moncrieffe rightfully asserts that his escape conviction was vacated and discharged, his conviction for violating probation is still valid. As noted by the magistrate, until Moncrieffe files a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 to attack his probation violation conviction, his claims under \u00a7 1983 are barred. Additionally, we note that Moncrieffe\u2019s defamation claims are not actionable in the instant case because they do not qualify as constitutional deprivations under the law of this Circuit. <em>See Von Stein, </em>904 F.2d at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">After careful review of Moncrieffe\u2019s complaint, and upon consideration of his brief, we conclude that he has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>state a claim for which relief may be granted. For the above reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mon-crieffe\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
