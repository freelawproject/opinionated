He reasserts his claim that the Government breached the plea agreement when it failed to drop the firearm charge, and he argues that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>court erred in holding that this claim was not cognizable under \u00a7 2241 and could not be raised under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Because Morrow\u2019s claim that the Government breached the plea agreement concerns facts that arose at or prior to sentencing, the district court did not err in determining that it was more properly construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990). Morrow may not use \u00a7 2241 as a vehicle to challenge his conviction unless he shows that \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Because Morrow failed to make this showing, the district court did not err in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Amin\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
