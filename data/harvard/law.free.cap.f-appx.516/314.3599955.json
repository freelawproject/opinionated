The BIA denied their motion to reopen and to reconsider on the grounds that the Da Silvas could not file a second motion for reconsideration and failed to show any basis for reopening the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Before this court, the Da Silvas argue that they never received the hearing notice, despite their due diligence, and that they should be permitted to pursue any available forms of relief from removal. They also assert that their first motion for reconsideration was improperly denied as untimely. We review the denial of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider under a \u201chighly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">As held by the BIA, an alien may not file more than one motion for reconsideration and may not seek reconsideration of the denial of a prior motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). Moreover, the Da Silvas did not present any new facts or evidence supporting their motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). The BIA therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying their motion to reopen and to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Accordingly, their petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
