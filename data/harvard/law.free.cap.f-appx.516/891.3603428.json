We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">The Government contended that Black applied for and knowingly collected social security benefits on his son\u2019s behalf during a time when Black\u2019s son did not live with him, and instead of using the money for his son\u2019s benefit, he converted it to his own use. Black\u2019s ex-wife testified that Black applied for and collected social security benefits for their son without telling her. The son testified that he lived with his mother during the period that Black collected benefits for him, that Black never told him about the benefits, and that he was not in contact with Black at that time. A Social Security Administration representative who processed Black\u2019s applications for the benefits also testified, and the Government introduced a record of the benefits checks sent to Black via U.S. mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">Black argues that this evidence was insufficient because (1) Black\u2019s former wife had a motive to lie and (2) the Government failed to provide documentary evidence of how Black allegedly spent the benefits that he collected on behalf of his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>We review a defendant\u2019s challenge to sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo. </em>We will not overturn a jury\u2019s verdict unless no trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 856 (11th Cir.2011). The question is not whether reasonable minds must have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether they could have done so. <em>United States v. Bacon, </em>598 F.3d 772, 775 (11th Cir.2010). Weighing witnesses\u2019 credibility is within the jury\u2019s province, and the jury may believe or disbelieve any part or all of a witness\u2019s testimony. <em>United States v. Prince, </em>883 F.2d 953, 959 n. 3 (11th Cir.1989). We draw all reasonable inferences \u201cand resolve all questions of credibility\u201d in the verdict\u2019s favor. <em>Hill, </em>643 F.3d at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Representative payee fraud requires proof that the defendant (1) applied to receive payment for the benefit of another; (2) received such a payment; and (3) willfully and knowingly converted that payment or any part of it to use other than for the use and benefit of the beneficiary. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(5). Mail fraud consists of the following elements: (1) intentional participation in a scheme to defraud someone of money or property; and (2) use of the mail in furtherance of that scheme. <em>Hill, </em>643 F.3d at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Black\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidenee argument rests primarily on the credibility of his former wife\u2019s testimony. The argument fails because, as noted above, credibility is within the province of the jury, and we resolve all questions of credibility in favor of the verdict. <em>Hill, </em>643 F.3d at 856; <em>Prince, </em>883 F.2d at 959 n. 3. Even if Black\u2019s ex-wife had a motive to lie, the jury was entitled to believe her testimony. Moreover, the Government did not need to prove specifically how Black spent the benefits checks in order to sustain a conviction for representative payee fraud, only that Black knowingly and willfully converted the payments (or any part of them) to a use other than his son\u2019s support and care. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(5). In sum, we affirm the \u00a7 408(a)(5) convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Black argues that the court erred in overruling his <em>Batson </em>objection to the Government\u2019s exercise of five peremptory strikes against white venirepersons. In <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court held that the use of peremptory strikes due to a prospective juror\u2019s race denies such person his or her constitutional right to equal protection of the laws. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 837 (11th Cir.2011). A trial court uses a three-part inquiry to determine if race motivated a party\u2019s strikes. <em>Id. </em>First, the court must determine if the party challenging the strikes has made out a <em>prima facie </em>case by showing facts sufficient to support an inference of discriminatory motive. <em>Id. </em>Second, if the party made a <em>prima facie </em>showing, the striking party must then offer a race-neutral explanation. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the party challenging the strikes has the ultimate burden of persuasion. <em>Id. </em>Third, the court evaluates the purported reason\u2019s persuasiveness to determine if, considering all relevant circumstances, the objecting party has met its burden. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">When Black objected to the Government\u2019s strike of the five whites, the Government responded that it struck them not because of their race, but whether they were childless, and, if not, whether their children were grown. The court determined that Black had not made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination, but, in any event, it accepted the Government\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for its strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">In reviewing the resolution of a <em>Batson </em>challenge, we give great deference to the trial court\u2019s finding as to the existence of a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>United States v. Allens-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number><em>Brown, </em>243 F.3d 1293, 1296 (11th Cir.2001). Its determination as to why a veni-reperson is excused is a finding of fact which we review for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">In determining whether the evidence before the trial court created an inference of discrimination, we consider (1) whether members of the relevant racial group served unchallenged on the jury; (2) whether the striking party struck all of the relevant racial group from the venire \u2014 or at least, as many as the striker had strikes; and (3) whether there was a substantial disparity between the percentage of jurors of one race struck and the percentage of their representation on the jury. <em>United States v. Ochoa-Vasquez, </em>428 F.3d 1015, 1044-45 (11th Cir.2005). The only evidence Black points to as establishing a <em>prima </em>facie case is the Government\u2019s use of five of its peremptory strikes to excuse white venirepersons. Obviously, that evidence alone did not give rise to an inference that the strikes were racially discriminatory. Black\u2019s claim of <em>Batson </em>error therefore fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-9\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b916-10\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b916-17\">. <em>Batson v.
