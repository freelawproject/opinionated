The advisory sentencing range was 77 to 96 months. Calixto-Calderon moved for a downward departure or variance based in part on his efforts at rehabilitation. The government gave notice that it intended to seek an upward departure or variance based on Calixto-Calderon\u2019s criminal history. The district court, noting that it would \u201ctake into account the good even if the presentence investigation report doesn\u2019t,\u201d sentenced Calixto-Calderon to 90 months in prison. Calixto-Calderon appeals, arguing that the district court gave insufficient reasons for the sentence, and that the court did not consider the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-22\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We determine whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. We then consider \u201csubstantive reasonableness ... under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We presume that a sentence calculated within the guidelines range, such as Calixto-Calderon\u2019s, is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-23\">Calixto-Calderon argues that the district court inadequately explained the sentence; we review this argument for plain error because he did not ask the district court for a better explanation. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). To establish plain error, Calixto-Calderon must show a clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). We then have discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>To show that the district court\u2019s allegedly inadequate explanation affected his substantial rights, Ca-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>lixto-Calderon must make at least some showing \u201cthat an explanation would have changed his sentence.\u201d <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The record shows that the district court acknowledged Calixto-Calderon\u2019s arguments, overruled each objection, and stated that it would \u201ctake into account the good\u201d \u2014 referring to Calixto-Calderon\u2019s efforts at rehabilitation \u2014 \u201ceven if the pre-sentence investigation report doesn\u2019t.\u201d To the extent that the district court\u2019s explanation was inadequate, Calixto-Calderon does not show that it affected his substantial rights because he has not established that additional explanation would have resulted in a lower sentence. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 364-65. To the extent that Calixto-Calderon asserts that the district court did not \u201caddress\u201d his arguments about the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, his \u201cdisagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010) <em>(per curiam). </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
