Bender (\u201cTrustee\u201d). The Trustee filed this action against Thomas, seeking the proceeds of a post-petition real estate sale that arose from a pre-petition option contract. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-21\">Thomas is a real estate investor who was involved in \u201cflipping\u201d distressed properties for profit. In September 2009, Thomas entered into an option contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>that gave him the right to purchase real property from Craig Mobley (\u201cMobley\u201d) for $112,450. The principal balance of Mobley\u2019s mortgage with Wells Fargo Bank was $220,000. The mortgage was facing foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">Thomas and Mobley also signed a Short Sale Master Agreement in which they agreed that Thomas would use reasonable efforts to negotiate a short sale with Wells Fargo. The parties agreed that \u201c[i]n the event that [Thomas] is successful in obtaining a Short Sale, then [Thomas] intends to sell the property and profit from the difference between the Short Sale payoff amount and the amount of the sale to a third party.\u201d And, \u201c[i]f [Thomas] is unsuccessful for any reason in obtaining a Short Sale and/or selling the Property for a profit, then the Property will likely go to foreclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">After recording the option contract, Thomas collected and gave Mobley\u2019s financial information to Paul Elya and Ed Garcia, third-party negotiators responsible for negotiating a short sale price with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo ultimately agreed to release Mobley\u2019s mortgage for $130,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">On 20 February 2010 \u2014 after Thomas filed for bankruptcy \u2014 Thomas entered into a contract (\u201csales contract\u201d) to sell Mob-ley\u2019s property to Greg May and Amelia Rosseter (\u201cMay\u201d) for $179,000. On 16 March 2010, Thomas exercised his option and bought Mobley\u2019s property for $180,000. Then, on 12 April 2010, Thomas sold the property to May, who was represented by a realtor. Thomas received $30,839.13 in cash at the closing (\u201csales proceeds\u201d). Thomas later paid Elya and Garcia over $22,000 for their services.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">The Trustee filed an action against Thomas, seeking the proceeds of Thomas\u2019s post-petition real estate sale. The bankruptcy court granted the Trustee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that the sales proceeds constituted property of Thomas\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s entry of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and we \u201cview all evidence and make all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment.\u201d <em>Gray v. Manklow (In re Optical Techs., Inc.), </em>246 F.3d 1332, 1334-35 (11th Cir.2001). The party opposing summary judgment must set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Eberhardt v. Waters, </em>901 F.2d 1578, 1580 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code defines property <em>of </em>the estate as \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1). \u201cSection 541 is construed broadly, so as to effectuate Congressional intent that a wide range of property be included in the estate.\u201d <em>Olympia &amp; York Fla. Equity Corp. v. Bank of New York (In re Holywell Corp.), </em>913 F.2d 873, 881 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-12\">\u201c[Wjhether a debtor\u2019s interest constitutes property of the estate is a federal question,\u201d but we look to state law to decide whether the debtor had a legal or equitable interest in the property when he filed for bankruptcy. <em>Bracewell v. Kelley (In re Bracewell), </em>454 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). Under Florida law, Thomas\u2019s pre-petition option contract\u2014 which was supported by valid consideration and duly recorded \u2014 gave Thomas a valid legal interest in Mobley\u2019s property. <em>See Barry v. Ippolito (In re Savel), </em>29 B.R. 858, 860 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1983). As a result, the option contract constituted property of the estate under section 541(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>The bankruptcy estate\u2019s property also encompasses the \u201c[proceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits of or from property of the estate, except such as are earnings from services performed by an individual debtor after the commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 514(a)(6). We agree with the bankruptcy court that the sales proceeds constituted proceeds of the option contract and, thus, were also property of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">Thomas argues that, because the sales proceeds resulted directly from the <em>post-petition </em>sales contract, they cannot be considered proceeds of the <em>pre-petition </em>option contract. But both the sales contract and the option contract were necessary components of Thomas\u2019s overall scheme to \u201cflip\u201d the Mobley property. As evidenced by the Short Sale Master Agreement, both parties contemplated that Thomas would execute the option contract only if he first was able to obtain a short sale and to sell the property to a buyer for a profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Relying in part on our decision in <em>Brace-well, </em>Thomas argues that the connection between the sales proceeds and the option contract was too attenuated for the sales proceeds to be considered proceeds of the option contract. But this case is different from <em>Bracewell, </em>where we affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that a disaster payment for pre-petition crop losses\u2014 authorized by post-petition legislation\u2014 was no part of the bankruptcy estate. <em>See Bracewell v. Kelley (In re Bracewell), </em>454 F.3d 1234 (11th Cir.2006). Unlike the debtor in <em>Bracewell, </em>Thomas had more than a mere \u201chope, a wish and a prayer\u201d that he might profit from the Mobley option contract. The option contract gave Thomas a valid legal interest in Mobley\u2019s property, and Thomas was in a position to affect the outcome of the complete deal. Although only a small portion of Thomas\u2019s various option contracts yielded a profit, that was the nature of Thomas\u2019s business model; and that circumstance does not render the sales proceeds too remote to be considered proceeds of the option contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">We also reject Thomas\u2019s argument that the sale proceeds were earned only as a result of his post-petition services and, thus, are excluded from the estate\u2019s property under section 541(a)(6). Section 541(a)(6) \u201cexcepts from proceeds of the estate only those earnings generated by services <em>personally </em>performed by the individual debtor.\u201d <em>FitzSimmons v. Walsh (In re FitzSimmons), </em>725 F.2d 1208, 1211 (9th Cir.1984) (emphasis added) (concluding that, \u201c[t]o the extent that the law practice\u2019s earnings are attributable not to [the debtor\u2019s] personal services but to the business\u2019 invested capital, accounts receivable, good will, employment contracts with the firm\u2019s staff, client relationships, fee agreements, or the like, the earnings of the law practice accrue to the estate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Thomas, Thomas has failed to identify what post-petition services he performed <em>personally </em>on this deal. Thomas\u2019s main role in the deal was to work with Mobley to obtain the option contract and to collect Mobley\u2019s financial information, all of which Thomas completed pre-petition. Thomas asserts that he was also responsible for raising capital to fund the deal, but nothing evidences that he in this case did so post-petition. Thomas assigned the task of negotiating the short sale with Wells Fargo to Elya and Garcia. Thomas also relied on a licensed realtor to list the property for sale and to locate a buyer for the property. Because the post-petition portions of the \u201cflipping\u201d scheme were performed by third parties \u2014 and not by Thomas himself \u2014 the sales proceeds are not exempted under section 541(a)(6). De minimis acts are insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Thomas argues that&amp;emdash;even to the extent the sales proceeds are deemed property of the estate-only the amount that he actually received ($30,839.13 minus the $22,000 paid to Elya and Garcia) should be turned over to the Trustee. We see no error in the bankruptcy court\u2019s declaring that the full $30,839.13 amount was part of the bankruptcy estate.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The sales proceeds constituted property of the estate at the moment of the sale. That Thomas later used a portion of these funds to pay Elya and Garcia does not change this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">No genuine issue of material fact exists; for the reasons set out in its order, the bankruptcy court properly granted the Trustee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b998-8\"> We note that the bankruptcy court did not address this argument directly because Thomas raised it for the first time in his appeal to the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
