Silva Gomez now appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of a 16-level enhancement for a prior crime of violence pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Silva Gomez contends that his prior conviction for burglary of a habitation under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) does not constitute a crime of violence for purposes of the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. As Silva Gomez concedes, he did not raise this argument in the district court, so our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Silva Gomez claims that his prior burglary offense does not constitute the generic offense of burglary for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2 because he was charged with entry into a habitation owned by a person with a greater right to possession. He argues that this \u201cgreater right to possession\u201d theory is unique to Texas and makes the offense broader than generic burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We recently rejected a materially indistinguishable argument. <em>See United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 411-13 (5th Cir.2013). In light of <em>Morales-Mota, </em>the district court did not commit any error, plain or otherwise, in imposing the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
