On appeal, he argues that the district court intended to sentence him based on the guideline range, not the applicable statutory mandatory minimum. As a result, Martin claims that he is entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. Ill\u2014 220, 124 Stat. 2372 (\u201cFSA\u201d), lowered his guideline range. Alternatively, he argues that the FSA applies to him retroactively, and the applicable mandatory minimum, under the FSA, is now five years instead of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1074-75 (11th Cir.2010). If the issue below involved a legal interpretation, we review <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">A district court may modify a term of imprisonment if a defendant was sentenced \u201cto a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). If that sentence was based on something other than offense level calculations, however, a guideline amendment would not impact his sentence, and he would be ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1076. Specifically, if the defendant\u2019s conduct triggered a statutory mandatory minimum, the district court based his sentence on that minimum, not his guideline range. This is true even if the government moved based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) for a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340. This is because \u201c[a]ny downward departure would ... be from the mandatory minimum rather than from the base offense level.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>The FSA, which took effect on August 3, 2010, \u201cincreased the drug amounts triggering mandatory m\u00ednimums for crack trafficking offenses from 5 grams to 28 grams in respect to the 5-year minimum and from 50 grams to 280 grams in respect to the 10-year minimum.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2329, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012); <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. It also \u201cinstructed the Commission to \u2018make such conforming amendments to the Federal sentencing guidelines as the Commission determines necessary to achieve consistency with other guideline provisions and applicable law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2329 (quoting FSA \u00a7 8(2), 124 Stat. at 2374). In response, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 750 to the guidelines, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e), to comply with the FSA\u2019s instructions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 750 (Nov. 2011). In Amendment 759, the Commission made Amendment 750 retroactively applicable. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 759 (Nov. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">In <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203 (11th Cir.2012), we considered a defendant\u2019s argument that Amendment 759 abrogated <em>Mills </em>and gave the court authority to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 1204. Because his guideline range was based on a statutory mandatory minimum which exceeded the otherwise applicable guideline range and because Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline range, he was not entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 1204-05, 1206-07. We explained further that Amendment 759 does not permit a district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence based on an amendment that did not lower his guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">The Supreme Court has explained that where a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement includes a recommended sentence or guideline range, the district court\u2019s sentencing decision \u201cis likely to be based on the guidelines.\u201d <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2695, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011). If it is, the defendant may seek a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>In <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>we held that <em>Freeman </em>was not on point with cases \u201cwhere the defendants were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but then assigned a total offense level and guideline range under a different guideline section.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 provides that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is inappropriate if an amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADP\">is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-16\">(i.e., <em>the guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category </em>determined pursuant to lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-17\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-18\">Regarding Martin\u2019s waiver argument, many of his contentions appear to be foreclosed by our precedent. First, our opinions in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Mills </em>indicate that his guideline range was based on the mandatory minimum even though the court imposed a sentence below that minimum pursuant to the government\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) motion. Second, <em>Freeman </em>did not clearly overrule <em>Williams </em>or <em>Mills, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>and Martin waived any such argument by failing to raise it in his initial brief. <em>Freeman </em>involved a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement and an original sentencing proceeding, while <em>Williams </em>and <em>Mills </em>involved \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions. Third, Martin\u2019s citation to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 does not help him, either, because the provision he cites makes clear that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is inappropriate if, as in his case, an amendment does not lower his guideline range because it was based on another provision, such as a mandatory minimum. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">Further, we have rejected waiver arguments like Martin\u2019s in the \u00a7 5K1.1 context. <em>Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1340-42. We have stated that the \u201coperative provision in determining the [ ] applicable sentencing range is the statutory mandatory minimum, ... not the crack cocaine Guideline.\u201d <em>Mills, </em>613 F.3d at 1077. This rule applies even in a situation where the government moved only pursuant to \u00a7 3553(e). Accordingly, we reject Martin\u2019s waiver argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Martin\u2019s alternative argument, concerning the FSA\u2019s reduction of his mandatory minimum, is resolved by our decision in <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535 (11th Cir.2013). In <em>Hippolyte, </em>we held that the FSA is inapplicable to defendants who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>Id. </em>at 542; <em>see also United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012) (same). Because Martin was sentenced in 2008, before the FSA\u2019s effective date, the FSA did not alter his mandatory minimum sentence. Accordingly, the district court properly denied his request for a sentencing reduction, and we affirm its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
