Gatliff for a modification of child support and visitation pursuant to that court\u2019s local rules, which control such matters when parents reside more than one hundred fifty miles apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Sheryl K. Gatliff (appellant) and Robert F. Gatliff (appellee) were divorced on October 6, 1986. The divorce order provided that appellant was the residential and custodial parent of the parties\u2019 two minor children, and she has remained so since the divorce. An order of child support was entered for the benefit of the children, and was modified pursuant to motion on January 23, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">After moving to Texas in September 1992, appellee filed a motion in the Court of Common Pleas of Hancock County requesting a modification of visitation and child support pursuant to the court\u2019s local rules regarding \u201clong-distance parenting.\u201d On January 6, 1993, the court entered its order granting the motion and adopting the referee\u2019s report, which had been issued following a hearing on November 24, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The relevant local rules of the Hancock County Common Pleas Court provide, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">\u201cRULE 2.23 CHILD SUPPORT DURING VISITATION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">\u201cUnless otherwise stated in a judgment entry granting child support, such support shall continue on a weekly basis during the first week (seven consecutive days) of Court ordered or agreed upon visitation. After the expiration of the first week of Court ordered or agreed upon visitation, child support shall not be due and payable to the residential parent during any subsequent full week that such Court ordered or agreed upon visitation continues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">\u201cRULE 2.33 LONG DISTANCE VISITATION SCHEDULE</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">\u201cThe Long Distance Parenting Plan and Companionship Schedule of the Court is found in Appendix K.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">Appendix K sets forth a detailed visitation schedule, to be applied \u201cfor parents who live more than 150 miles apart.\u201d The plan is comprehensive, and provides for various options.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In this case, the referee recommended application of the visitation plan, modified to comply with the requests and needs of the parties and their children. Following the local rule, the referee recommended a summer visitation of nine consecutive weeks, and other periods of visitation as set forth in Appendix K. He further recommended that the parties divide the costs of transporting the children from one residence to the other, purportedly on a pro rata basis according to the child support guidelines of the Revised Code, coming up with a seventy/thirty percent allocation which he thought \u201cequitable,\u201d based (inexplicably) on the parties\u2019 incomes <em>before </em>allocation of child support payments. The requisite Child Support Computation Worksheet was not included in the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The referee also recommended, pursuant to Loc.R. 2.23, that appellee\u2019s child support payments be suspended for eight weeks each summer when the children were visiting with him. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objections to the referee\u2019s report and issued an order adopting the report, in toto. Although appellant has no complaint with the \u201cAppendix K\u201d visitation order, she has appealed the court\u2019s order suspending support payments during summer visitation and ordering her to pay thirty percent of the children\u2019s transportation costs to and from Texas. She asserts three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">First and Second Assignments of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u201cLocal Rule 2.23 of the Hancock County Common Pleas Court\u2019s Rules of Court is an abuse of discretion and contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in the application of Local Rule 2.23 of the Hancock County Common Pleas Court\u2019s Rules of Court to the facts of this case in ordering an abatement of child support during the extended times of visitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Appellant complains that the trial court erred in following its own Loe.R. 2.23, in that the rule contravenes Ohio law regarding child support. In <em>Marker v. Grimm </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 139, 601 N.E.2d 496, the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed R.C. 3113.215, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">\u201cR.C. 3113.215(B)(1) requires that a calculation of the amount of an obligor\u2019s child support obligation must be made \u2018in accordance with\u2019 the basic child support schedule set forth in R.C. 3113.215(D), the applicable worksheet in R.C. 3113.-215(E) or (F), and other requirements of the law. * * * R.C. 3113.215(B)(1) further provides that the amount calculated using the schedule and worksheet (through line 18 of the worksheet) is \u2018rebuttably presumed\u2019 to be the correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>amount of child support due and that that amount must be ordered to be paid <em>unless </em>both of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u201c \u2018(a) The court, after considering the factors and criteria set forth in division (B)(3) of this section, determines that the amount calculated pursuant to the basic child support schedule and pursuant to the applicable worksheet, through line 18, would be unjust or inappropriate and would not be in the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u201c \u2018(b) The court enters in the journal the amount of child support calculated pursuant to the basic child support schedule and pursuant to the applicable worksheet, through line 18, its determination that that amount would be unjust or inappropriate and would not be in the best interest of the child, and <em>findings of fact supporting that determination.\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u201cThus, the acceptable procedure for ordering an amount of child support which deviates from the amount \u2018rebuttably presumed\u2019 to be the correct amount due is for the court to <em>fully </em>comply with the requirements of R.C. 3113.215(B)(1)(a) and (b). The importance of strict compliance with these deviation procedures becomes all the more apparent upon a reading of R.C. 3113.215(B)(2)(c) and, specifically, R.C. 3113.215(B)(2)(c)(i) and (ii), which repeat, verbatim, the requirements of R.C. 3113.215(B)(1)(a) and (b).\u201d (Emphasis added in part.) <em>Id., </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 141, 601 N.E.2d at 497-498.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The court continued its discussion by pointedly noting that the \u201coverriding concern of the law,\u201d as evident from the statutory scheme, is the best interest of the child. Thus, indicated the court, the statute must be followed by the courts <em>to the letter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Obviously, then, a specific requirement of the statute, as noted in the Supreme Court\u2019s comment, <em>supra, </em>is that any deviation from the child support guidelines <em>must </em>be found to be <em>in the best interest of the children, </em>despite any obligor\u2019s claim of \u201cunfairness.\u201d The court must support its determination <em>in each case </em>with proper findings of fact specifically justifying the deviation from the statute. As succinctly stated by the Supreme Court, since the statute was aimed at \u201cprotecting] Ohio\u2019s children from insufficient and inequitable child support,\u201d the terms of R.C. 3113.215 are mandatory and \u201cmust be followed literally and technically in all material respects. Further, any court-ordered deviation from the applicable worksheet and the basic child support schedule must be entered by the court in its journal and must include findings of fact to support such determination.\u201d <em>Id., </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 143, 601 N.E.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">We find that Loc.R. 2.23 of the Hancock County Common Pleas Court, as written, violates the purpose and intent of R.C. 3113.215. The rationale behind the rule, as expressed in the court\u2019s judgment entry, is arbitrary and unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>able when the order is applied without individualized consideration of the facts of each case. The judges\u2019 rationalization that it is generally \u201cunfair\u201d for <em>any </em>obligor to continue paying child support during the nine weeks\u2019 vacation period is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><em>All </em>visitation schedules provide for a given number of days throughout the year when an obligor has physical custody of the children. In this case, the court\u2019s \u201clong distance\u201d visitation schedule explicitly provides \u201cthe non-residential parent approximately 72-82 days each year to exercise parenting rights [visitation].\u201d In consideration of the distance between the parties\u2019 residences, most of that time is concentrated during the children\u2019s summer vacation. The \u201ctypical\u201d visitation schedule, however, provides a total of approximately eighty-five to one hundred thirty days of visitation per year for a non-custodial parent, as follows: Various holidays throughout the year (approximately eighteen to twenty days); alternating weekends throughout the year (approximately forty to forty-two days); one to four weeks\u2019 vacation in the summer (approximately seven to twenty-eight days); and, in many cases, one week-night and day each week when not otherwise provided for in the visitation schedule (approximately thirty to forty days).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Although, on occasion, requests for a temporary reduction in support payments may be granted in consideration of food and entertainment expenses during \u201cextended\u201d visitation periods, such reductions must be supported by the specific facts of each case which indicate that a reduction is in the best interest of the children. We are aware of no provision under Ohio law for suspension of child support payments during these visitation periods, whether they are weekly, biweekly, monthly, or for an extended period during summer vacation. See R.C. 3109.05 (providing that an obligor must continue to pay court-ordered support \u201cduring seasonal vacation periods\u201d). As appellant argues, an obligee following a typical visitation schedule is relieved of the same array of parental responsibilities on a regular basis throughout the year as is an obligee/parent following the Hancock County \u201clong distance\u201d visitation schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">In denying obligors\u2019 requests for abatement or suspension of child support during visitations, courts have generally reasoned that, since an obligee\u2019s financial obligations for the children do not suddenly \u201cabate\u201d during times the children are with their obligor parent, a reduction in support is not in the children\u2019s best interest. An obligee who is maintaining a permanent home for her children on a minimal income, as appellee is in this case, must continue to provide such necessities as clothing, and to maintain the custodial residence, which requires such expenditures as mortgage payments, real estate tax payments, insurance payments, repair expenses, etc., even during the children\u2019s two-month visit with their father. Thus, while the court\u2019s \u201clocal rule\u201d was explicitly promulgated in light of R.C. 3113.215(B)(3)(d), which allows the court to consider \u201cextended times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>of visitation or <em>extraordinary </em>costs associated with visitation\u201d (emphasis added) when deviating from guideline support, this provision of the Revised Code does not relieve the court from its mandate to make the statutorily required findings of fact supporting such deviation.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Furthermore, the court\u2019s primary consideration, we reiterate, must be the best interest of the children. <em>Marker, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 141, 601 N.E.2d at 497; R.C. 3113.215(B)(1)(a) and (b). Although there may be circumstances wherein it would be \u201cunjust\u201d to require the full guideline support during visitation periods when the overall visitation days occur consecutively rather than dispersed throughout the calendar year, unfairness is not the ultimate statutory test for deviation from the statutory support guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Therefore, we conclude that, in light of the mandatory nature of R.C. 3113.215, although a common pleas court may institute local \u201cguidelines\u201d as an aid to determination of visitation and child support in difficult cases, it may not promulgate a rule which eliminates close scrutiny of each individual case and fact situation, as required by the law. The \u201clocal rule\u201d challenged herein contains <em>mandatory </em>language, indicating that it is to be applied to <em>every case </em>wherein the parties live one hundred fifty miles apart, regardless of the varying facts and circumstances of each case. The court, in its journal entry, stated that the common pleas court has predetermined that the rule is \u201cfair\u201d in every such case. The decision to utilize the local rule regardless of the differences in each case is an arbitrary decision which fails to consider cases on an individual basis as required by the law of Ohio. As stated <em>supra, </em>each case must be appraised on its own merits, with proper consideration of and setting forth of facts and conclusions which justify, under the specific requirements of the sections and subsections of the statute, a deviation from the purpose, intent, and technical provisions of the statutory scheme. While the court may have intended Loc.R. 2.23 to be a mere \u201cguideline,\u201d as contended by the concurrence herein, it is not framed as such, and was certainly not applied as such in this case. Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in the splitting of transportation costs to be paid by the appellant and appellee in light of the disparity between household incomes of the appellant and the appellee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Following a review of the record herein, we find that the trial court erred in its allocation of transportation expenses for visitation. Although R.C. 3109.-051(F)(2) does authorize a court to deviate from its \u201cstandard visitation guidelines,\u201d a deviation is permitted only pursuant to a consideration of \u201call\u201d fifteen of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the given factors, which include a consideration of what is in the best interest of the children. R.C. 3109.051(D)(15).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">We find no evidence in the record that the court considered the best interest of the children in its allocation of the transportation expenses in this case. We further find the court\u2019s allocation unreasonable, and therefore conclude that the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The referee in this case determined that appellee \u201chas seventy percent (70%) of the total income of the parties, [and thus] it would be equitable for [appellee] to pay seventy percent (70%) of the transportation costs and for [appellant] to pay thirty percent (30%) of these costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">It was established at the hearing that appellee\u2019s yearly income is $61,000, and appellant\u2019s is approximately $13,000. A comparison of the parties\u2019 incomes at this point, before any consideration of child support, establishes that appellee has 17.6% of the parties\u2019 total income, and appellant has 82.4%. A calculation of child support under the statutory guidelines establishes that the total needed to support the parties\u2019 two children on a total income of $74,000 per year is $13,176. A determination of individual child support obligations based upon allotment by the appropriate percentages of the parties\u2019 incomes results in an obligation on appellee\u2019s part of $10,857 per year, and a support obligation of $2,319 for appellant. These amounts are to be used for the support of the parties\u2019 minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">It appears that, in prorating the parties\u2019 \u201cshare\u201d of the transportation expenses, the court subtracted appellee\u2019s $10,857 child support obligation from his total income, for a result of $50,143, and added the same to appellant\u2019s income for a total income of $23,857, and then proceeded to compare those \u201cincomes.\u201d However, the court apparently failed to consider that $13,176 of appellant\u2019s new \u201cincome\u201d is court-ordered child support, and is an amount to be used solely for the support of the children. Thus, the parties\u2019 true incomes, after consideration of both their child support obligations, are $50,143 and $10,681. Comparison of these figures is analogous, of course, to comparison of the parties\u2019 incomes before consideration of child support under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">By allocating the transportation expenses <em>after </em>inclusion of appellee\u2019s child support payments in appellant\u2019s income, the court, in effect, is ordering part of the children\u2019s transportation expenses to be paid by the children themselves; out of their court-ordered child support. We find this result to be unreasonable. See, <em>e.g., Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482-483, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1142 (unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable error on the part of the trial court constitutes abuse of that court\u2019s discretion). Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Having found error prejudicial to the appellant herein, in the particulars assigned and argued, we reverse the judgment of the trial court, and remand the cause to that court for proper calculation of the child support order and further proceedings in accordance with the foregoing opinion and consistent with the statutory and common law of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-6\">Bryant, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b428-7\">Shaw, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-10\">. The calculations under the statutory guidelines, given the numbers provided by appellant, indicate that the parties\u2019 incomes are disparate: after appellee\u2019s payment of the guideline amount of support, appellant\u2019s household income would be approximately forty-eight percent of appellee\u2019s. However, with suspension of appellant\u2019s guideline support payments for eight weeks out of the year, appellee\u2019s household income would be further reduced by approximately $1,600, resulting in even more disparity in the incomes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b428-8\">Thomas F. Bryant, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"An7\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">I do not share the intuition and supposition of the majority, but concur in the reversal and remand of this action for further proceedings consistent with R.C. 3113.215. I also do not believe it is appropriate for this court to take the apparent position of advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">I agree with the holding of <em>Marker v. Grimm </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 139, 601 N.E.2d 496, that the worksheet provided in R.C. 3113.215(E) or (F) must be utilized when calculating the amount of child support owed by an obligor. Based on the law as set forth in R.C. 3113.215(B)(1) and <em>Marker, </em>I would hold simply that this cause should be reversed and remanded in order for the court to calculate appellee\u2019s child support obligation according to the worksheet set forth in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">I further note that R.C. 3113.215(B)(3)(d) provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">\u201c(3) The court * * * may deviate from the amount of support that otherwise would result from the use of the schedule and the applicable worksheet, through line 18, in cases in which the application of the schedule and the applicable worksheet, through line 18, would be unjust or inappropriate and would not be in the best interest of the child. In determining whether that amount would be unjust or inappropriate and would not be in the best interest of the child, the court may consider any of the following factors and criteria:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">\u00ab * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">\u201c(d) Extended times of visitation or extraordinary costs associated with visitation, provided that this division does not authorize and shall not be construed as authorizing any deviation from the schedule and the applicable worksheet, through line 18, or any escrowing, impoundment, or withholding of child support because of a denial of or interference with a right of companionship or visitation granted by court order[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>It cannot be determined from the record whether the trial judge considered this provision of the statute. While the majority of this court recognizes this section of the statute, it eliminates judicial discretion and substitutes its own personal philosophy. It is clear that the judge must follow the worksheet to line eighteen before considering the above-quoted portion of R.C. 3113.215. This provision does, however, authorize the judge to deviate from the guidelines in some circumstances involving extended visitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">I also find the majority\u2019s discussion concerning <em>\u201c[a]ll </em>visitation schedules\u201d and \u201cthe \u2018typical\u2019 visitation schedule\u201d to be unsupported by the record and irrelevant-to the issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Loc.R. 2.23 of the Hancock County Common Pleas Court is simply a guideline. I can think of no circumstances under which a rule of court could of itself be an \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d Furthermore, without something to indicate how the rule was applied in this case, I would not hold that the rule violates \u201cthe purpose and intent of R.C. 3113.215.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
