PITTMAN, JUSTICE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this interlocutory appeal, Appellant the Town of Shady Shores (the Town) appeals the trial court's denial of its no-evidence and traditional motions for summary judgment on the claims brought against it by Appellee Sarah Swanson, the Town's former city secretary. In six issues, the Town challenges the trial court's jurisdiction and the trial court's determination of Swanson's objections to the Town's no-evidence summary judgment motion. After careful review, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At a special meeting of the Town of Shady Shores City Council (the Council) on February 24, 2014, the Town provided Swanson with an employee performance evaluation. The Council then gave her ten minutes to respond to the evaluation. It further allowed her to respond in writing and to address the Council regarding the evaluation at a special council meeting three days later on February 27, 2014. Both Swanson and her attorney appeared at the February 27th council meeting. At that meeting, the Council voted to terminate Swanson's employment for lack of confidence in her performance as city secretary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2022.077\">\n    Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 22.077\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (West 2008). Swanson then sued the Town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In her original petition, Swanson alleged that the Town fired her because she reported and refused to engage in destroying a tape recording of a meeting of the Town's investment committee, a subcommittee of the Council. She alleged that after she refused, members of the investment committee destroyed the recording; that she told the Council, the mayor, and the Town's attorney that the recording's destruction violated state law; and that this reporting led to her firing. Swanson asserted a statutory wrongful discharge claim under the Texas Whistleblower Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20554.0035\">\n    Tex. Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 554.0035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2012), and a common law claim for wrongful discharge under\n   <em>\n    Sabine Pilot Service, Inc. v. Hauck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9983596\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/687/733/#p735\">\n    687 S.W.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735 (Tex. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response, the Town filed a plea to the jurisdiction asserting governmental immunity for both claims. Swanson then amended her petition to add a claim for violation of her free speech rights under the Texas Constitution and claims for declaratory relief based on the Town's alleged violations of the Texas Open Meetings Act (TOMA) and of her rights under the \"due course\" provision of article 1, section 19 of the Texas Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Const. art. I, \u00a7 19 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20551.002\">\n    Tex. Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 551.002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2017). Importantly, Swanson did not allege separate and distinct claims for violations of TOMA or the Texas Constitution, rather she alleges that the Town committed violations of these provisions in support of her standalone claim for a declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In support of these claims, Swanson alleged that on February 12, 2014, the Council wrongfully deliberated in executive session about whether to terminate her employment, that the decision to do so was also made during executive session that day, and that no agenda had been posted before the meeting apprising the public of the purpose of the executive session. Swanson also alleged that for the February 27, 2014 special council meeting at which the Council terminated her employment, the Town did not post an agenda before the meeting sufficiently apprising the public that action might be taken to remove her from her job. Swanson further asserted that the Town violated article I, section 19 of the Texas Constitution because she was not afforded the opportunity to confront her accusers or otherwise address the Council before the deliberation in which the decision was made to terminate her employment and because no procedure was adopted or employed for her to protest or appeal the Council's decision. Additionally, Swanson added allegations that the Town fired her in retaliation for reporting not only the destruction of the meeting tape, but also for reporting that the mayor, Cindy Spencer, had taken recordings of town meetings home with her and had at one point intended to call Swanson into a meeting under false pretenses to ask for Swanson's resignation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before the trial court ruled on the Town's plea to the jurisdiction-rather than amend its plea or file another such plea on the claims in Swanson's amended petition-the Town filed a motion for traditional summary judgment and a separate motion for no-evidence summary judgment that challenged the trial court's jurisdiction of Swanson's additional claims. In its no-evidence motion, the Town asserted that it was entitled to governmental immunity on Swanson's declaratory judgment claims because she had no evidence that she was entitled to declaratory relief. In its traditional motion, the Town asserted that it was entitled to summary judgment on Swanson's declaratory judgment claims\n   because the claims did not fall within the scope of permissible declaratory judgment actions against governmental entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In her summary judgment response, Swanson argued that the Town was not entitled to a no-evidence summary judgment because it bore the burden of proof on establishing governmental immunity. She also challenged the Town's traditional grounds, arguing that genuine issues of material fact precluded summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court granted the Town's plea to the jurisdiction as to Swanson's original claims and dismissed Swanson's Whistleblower Act and\n   <em>\n    Sabine Pilot\n   </em>\n   claims. The trial court denied the Town's summary judgment motions. The Town then filed this interlocutory appeal challenging the denial of its motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Swanson Did Not Raise Distinct TOMA Claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its first issue, the Town contends that the trial court had no jurisdiction over Swanson's TOMA claims. However, the record before us is clear that in the trial court, the Town raised traditional summary judgment grounds asserting its entitlement to judgment on the merits of\n   Swanson's claims, rather than on jurisdictional, government immunity grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cullum v.

App.-San Antonio 2011, pet. denied) (noting appellate courts generally do not have jurisdiction to hear the denial of a motion for summary judgment). Further, while Swanson asserted grounds for declaratory relief based on TOMA violations, she did not assert a separate, standalone claim under TOMA. Without a distinct TOMA claim being alleged by Swanson against the Town, we must overrule the Town's first issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valley Baptist Med. Ctr. v.

However, to the extent the Town's arguments apply to its challenges to Swanson's claim for declaratory relief based on the Town's alleged TOMA violations, we consider them below under our analysis of the Town's third issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Swanson's Declaratory Judgment Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its third issue, the Town makes several arguments for why the trial court should have dismissed Swanson's declaratory judgment claims. First, the Town contends that Swanson does not qualify for relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA). More specifically, the Town contends that: (a) Swanson is not a person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other writings constituting a contract; (b) Swanson is not a person whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise, and she produced no evidence that she fits in that category in response to its no-evidence and traditional summary judgment motions; and (c) Swanson does not seek a determination on any question of construction or validity of an instrument, statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise. Second, the Town argues that to the extent Swanson seeks a declaration of rights under a statute, the UDJA does not waive the Town's governmental immunity for such a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the Town's second issue, it asserts that Swanson presented no viable claim for relief under the \"due course\" provision in article I, section 19 of the Texas Constitution. It argues that: (a) Swanson has no evidence that she was denied any right to confront her accusers and address the Council before the February 12, 2014 meeting; (b) she had no constitutional right to appeal the Council's termination decision; and (c) she was provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard. However, Swanson raised these constitutional violations only as a basis for relief under the UDJA. As with the Town's alleged TOMA violations, Swanson simply did not allege separate, standalone constitutional claims against the Town in her lawsuit. We therefore overrule the Town's second issue but consider the Town's arguments challenging the viability of her constitutional claims as part of its third issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein, we conclude that the Town has immunity for some but not all of the declaratory relief requested by Swanson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Trial Court Did Not Err by Denying the Town's No-Evidence Summary Judgment Motion on Swanson's UDJA claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Town argues that, because Swanson provided no evidence in response to its no-evidence summary judgment motion, the trial court erred by denying it a no-evidence summary judgment as to\n   Swanson's declaratory judgment claims. This argument, however, severely mistakes Swanson's burden in the trial court. Before Swanson had any burden to produce jurisdictional evidence, the Town first had to produce evidence negating jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9256802\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/133/217/#p226\">\n    133 S.W.3d at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that for pleas to the jurisdiction challenging the existence of jurisdictional facts, requiring the state to meet the summary judgment standard of proof protects plaintiffs \"from having to 'put on their case simply to establish jurisdiction' \" and that a plaintiff must come forward with evidence to raise a fact question regarding the jurisdictional issue only \"after the state asserts and supports with evidence that the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction\" (citation omitted));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mission Consol.

The Town Did Not Negate Viability of Swanson's TOMA-Based UDJA Claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   If the Town's jurisdictional evidence negated the existence of jurisdictional facts for Swanson's UDJA claims that are based on alleged TOMA violations, then the trial court has no jurisdiction over those claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heckman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314284\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/369/137/#p150\">\n    369 S.W.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Town's arguments under its first issue are relevant to whether it negated the existence of viable UDJA claims based on TOMA violations, and we therefore consider those arguments here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Town contends that: (1) Swanson produced no evidence that the Council violated TOMA by improperly deliberating and making decisions about her employment on or before February 12, 2014; (2) the February 27, 2014 meeting complied with TOMA; and (3) the validity of the February 27, 2014 meeting renders Swanson's complaints about prior meetings irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Town's contentions regarding the February 12, 2014 meeting did not shift the burden to Swanson to produce jurisdictional evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As part of her request for declaratory relief, Swanson alleged that the Council deliberated and decided to terminate her employment on or before February 12, 2014, at a meeting that violated TOMA. The Town argues that Swanson has no evidence that the Council violated TOMA on or before that meeting. The Town's argument under this part of its issue is based entirely on what it characterizes as an inadequate response from Swanson to its no-evidence summary judgment motion. We have already held that Swanson had no burden to produce evidence on the issue until the Town met its burden as to jurisdictional evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Therefore, reviewing the evidence submitted by the Town, we hold the Town did not conclusively negate jurisdiction. The Town's jurisdictional evidence included: (1) the transcript from Swanson's October 14, 2014 deposition; (2) Swanson's responses to the Town's interrogatories; (3) affidavits of the Town mayor and of Town aldermen; (4) the notices and minutes from the Council meetings of February 18, 24, and 27,\n   2014; (5) Swanson's performance review provided to her at the February 24 meeting; (6) the transcript from Swanson's August 24, 2015 deposition; and (7) a letter from Swanson's attorney to the Town's attorney responding to Swanson's performance review. This evidence did not establish as a matter of law that the Town did not deliberate about and decide to terminate Swanson's employment on or before February 12, 2014. Swanson's depositions, interrogatory responses, and her attorney's letter did not concede that no such meetings took place. Moreover, the minutes and notices from the February 18, 24, and 27 meetings did not mention the existence or absence of earlier meetings addressing Swanson's employment, and neither did the aldermen's affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nor has the Town shown that Swanson cannot show jurisdiction even if given the opportunity to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rusk State Hosp. v. Black\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093859\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/392/88/#p95\">\n    392 S.W.3d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95-96 (Tex. 2012) (requiring a governmental entity that raises jurisdiction for the first time on appeal to show that (1) the record conclusively negates jurisdiction; (2) the plaintiff had a full and fair opportunity in the trial court to develop the record to show jurisdiction yet failed to do so; or (3) if the plaintiff did not have such an opportunity, she cannot show jurisdiction even if the case is remanded to the trial court and she is given such an opportunity). And because the Town did not raise a jurisdictional challenge to the viability of Swanson's TOMA-based claims in its traditional summary judgment motion, and because (as Swanson pointed out in the trial court) it could not shift its burden to Swanson by way of a no-evidence summary judgment motion, we cannot say that Swanson had a full and fair opportunity in the trial court to develop the record to demonstrate the court's jurisdiction on these claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7093859\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/392/88/#p95\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court therefore correctly declined to dismiss Swanson's UDJA claims based on the February 12, 2014 meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Town's February 27, 2014 meeting did not moot Swanson's TOMA complaints.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Town further argues that the trial court had no jurisdiction over Swanson's claims because there is no justiciable controversy. The Town contends that Swanson's TOMA complaints about any meeting before its February 27, 2014 special council meeting are irrelevant because it was at that meeting that the Council deliberated and decided to terminate Swanson's employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Farmers Branch v.

However, Swanson alleged that that meeting did not comply with TOMA, and we hold below that the jurisdictional evidence submitted by the Town did not negate the validity of Swanson's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Further, whether the February 27, 2014 council meeting complied with TOMA is irrelevant to some of the relief Swanson sought because she sought more than reinstatement in her suit. For example, based on the Town's alleged violations of TOMA, she requested that the trial court require the Town to \"make available to the public the certified agenda or tape of any part of a meeting that was required to be open under\" TOMA and \"[a] permanent injunction requiring contemporaneous recording of all deliberations of the ... council and subcommittees, with approval of the minutes of such meetings by the governing body during a regularly-scheduled meeting for which an agenda item has been timely posted.\" Even if the February 27th meeting cured any previous violation of TOMA the Town committed in deliberating and deciding about Swanson's employment, it did not render all her claims moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8367828\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/235/462/#p469\">\n    235 S.W.3d at 469-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" 'Our citizens are entitled to more than a result.

Swanson's pleadings do not allege facts addressing whether her speech was made in the course of her job duties. The record, on the other hand, addresses the question with respect to the alleged violations related to Town records and whether the reporting was citizen speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heckman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7314284\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/369/137/#p150\">\n    369 S.W.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (compelling the granting of a jurisdictional challenge if the governmental entity presents undisputed evidence that negates jurisdiction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the record before us shows that the speech was within Swanson's job duties. When asked at her deposition if she thought she was doing her job to tell the Town attorney and Council that the mayor had violated the law by asking for meeting tapes to bring home, Swanson testified, \"I think I was doing my job, yes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcetti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/#p421\">\n    547 U.S. at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275534\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/410/#p421\">\n    126 S.Ct. at 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (pointing out that the plaintiff conceded that his speech was made pursuant to his employment duties and that the court therefore need not \"articulate a comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee's duties in cases where there is room for serious debate\"). Swanson thus conceded that her job duties included reporting perceived violations of laws related to town records by members of the governing body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Swanson's pleadings and the evidence show that her reports for each of the alleged incidents were made up the chain of command at the Town, not outside of it. Swanson alleged that she reported issues to individual councilmembers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Council as a whole, the mayor, and the Town attorney. The Town's aldermen and mayor, as members of the Town's governing body, were up the chain of command.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2022.031\">\n    Tex. Loc. Gov't Code Ann. \u00a7 22.031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that the governing body of a Type-A municipality is made up of the mayor and aldermen). The record does not clearly establish the Town attorney's position within the chain of command for Town employees. However, Swanson testified in her deposition that she told the Town attorney because she believed that he was someone who \"should enforce any violations\" and that he \"was the appropriate person for [her] to report a violation of the law\" to, and she hoped he would \"make sure they were following the law.\" She also testified that the Town attorney was a person \"who would give [her] direction as to the work [she was] responsible for doing.\" She thus made her reports to him as someone who was up the chain of reporting responsibilities at the Town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , while Swanson further testified that she also told an investigator with the district attorney's office, she could not remember ever telling anyone that she had\n   done so. The Town therefore could not have been retaliating against her for making that report when it terminated her employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caleb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381516\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/518/537/#p545\">\n    518 S.W.3d at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In summary, for the reports regarding Town records, Swanson's pleadings did not allege speech outside the chain of command or outside her job duties, and the Town's evidence established that her speech was within the chain of command and concerned matters within her job duties. Because Swanson therefore did not allege a viable First Amendment claim based on this employee speech, the trial court had no jurisdiction over her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Swanson's Speech About the Mayor's Planned Meeting Was Not Entitled to First Amendment Protection.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Regarding Swanson's claim that the mayor intended to call her into a meeting under false pretenses, Swanson's petition also fails to allege a viable First Amendment claim. Swanson pled that she reported to the Town attorney and to the Council that the mayor had intended to call her into a meeting under false pretenses in order to ask her to resign. (Although Swanson's petition does not elaborate on this allegation, in her deposition she explained that she learned about the mayor's intention by reading the mayor's email while searching for a different email at the mayor's request.) For this speech to be protected, it had to relate to a matter of public concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caleb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12381516\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/518/537/#p545\">\n    518 S.W.3d at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Assuming that by enacting local government code section 22.077, the legislature indicated that the termination of employment of a city secretary is a matter of public concern, it has given no such indication for the kind of circumstance alleged by Swanson. Swanson's pleadings did not allege any basis to consider the mayor's unacted-upon plan to meet with Swanson to ask for her resignation-even if she did not intend to tell Swanson the true reason for the meeting ahead of time-to be matter of public concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Because the pleadings and evidence negated any violation of Swanson's free speech rights, the trial court had no jurisdiction over any claim seeking reinstatement or other equitable relief based on such speech. Accordingly, we sustain the Town's fourth issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. The Trial Court Could Not Grant the Town's No-Evidence Summary Judgment Motion on Immunity Grounds.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In the Town's fifth and sixth issues, it argues that it properly identified the grounds for its no-evidence motion for summary judgment and that governmental immunity is properly raised in a no-evidence motion for summary judgment. These issues address Swanson's trial court objections to the Town's no-evidence summary judgment motion. As discussed herein because we hold that a governmental entity may not raise immunity in a no-evidence summary judgment motion, we overrule both issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Having overruled the Town's first, second, fifth, and sixth claims we affirm the trial court's order denying summary judgment for the Town on Swanson's UDJA claims seeking a declaration that the Town's termination of her employment was void under TOMA; injunctive relief relating to making agendas and meeting recordings for past and future Town meetings available to the public; and attorney's fees for those claims based on TOMA violations. Having sustained the Town's third issue in part and the Town's fourth issue, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Swanson's UDJA claims for back pay; her UDJA claims based on violations of her rights under\n   article I, section 9 of the Texas Constitution, seeking both reinstatement and declaratory relief; and her free speech claim.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    We disagree in part with the recent holding of the Austin court of appeals that TOMA does not waive immunity for declaratory relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of New Braunfels v.
