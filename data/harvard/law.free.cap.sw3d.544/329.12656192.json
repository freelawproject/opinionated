Luckinbill argues that the trial court erred in refusing to tender his proposed self-defense instruction to the jury. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum of law has been provided to the parties. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
