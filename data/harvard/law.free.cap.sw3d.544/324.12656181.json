Defendants contend that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment against them on the promissory note because genuine issues of material fact existed. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
