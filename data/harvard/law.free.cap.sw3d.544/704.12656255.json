Frierson, II, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs initiated this health care liability action against two defendant medical providers, a dermatology practice and a certified physician's assistant employed by the practice. The defendants filed separate motions to dismiss, with each respectively asserting that the plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed for failure to substantially comply with Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 29-26-121(a)(2)(E), which provides that a pre-suit medical authorization must be compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\"). Following a hearing, the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims without prejudice upon finding that the medical authorization forwarded by the plaintiffs was incomplete and failed to substantially comply with HIPAA's release requirements. The plaintiffs have appealed solely the dismissal of the health care liability claim against the dermatology practice. Discerning no reversible error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Factual and Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiffs, Tommy Lynn Lawson and Katrina Lawson, filed a complaint against the defendants, Knoxville Dermatology Group (\"KDG\") and Katie Hageman, Certified Physician's Assistant, (collectively, \"Defendants\"), on August 23, 2016. The complaint involved the events that transpired on April 29, 2015, when Mr. Lawson sought treatment with KDG for a Methicillin-resistant Staphlococcus aureus (\"MRSA\") infection on his left ear. The Lawsons alleged that during the visit, Mr. Lawson was injured by the negligence of KDG and Ms. Hageman, specifically their alleged failure to properly secure the examination table, which purportedly flipped over as Mr. Lawson was attempting to lift himself onto it, resulting in alleged injury when he \"f[e]ll straight down onto the stool with his left leg underneath him.\" Ms. Lawson joined in the complaint as a plaintiff, seeking recovery for loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 3, 2016, KDG and Ms. Hageman filed separate motions to dismiss for failure to comply with provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 29-26-121. They asserted that the Lawsons' HIPAA authorization form did not list which individual(s)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   or organization(s) were authorized to make disclosures of the specified medical records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.508\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Defendants further alleged that the Lawsons' action was untimely. Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 29-26-116(a) (2012) provides a one-year statute of limitations applicable to health care liability actions, which, with proper pre-suit notice, may be extended by 120 days pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 29-26-121(c) (Supp. 2016). Defendants asserted that because the Lawsons had failed to provide sufficient pre-suit notice, they were precluded from relying on the 120-day extension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following a hearing, the trial court granted the motions to dismiss in an order entered on December 16, 2016, dismissing all claims without prejudice. The Lawsons timely appealed, limiting the issue raised on appeal to the dismissal of the health care liability claim against KDG. The Lawsons have not appealed the dismissal of Ms. Hageman as a defendant or the dismissal of Ms. Lawson's claims for loss of consortium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II. Issue Presented\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Lawsons present one issue on appeal, which we have restated slightly as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Whether the trial court erred by finding that the medical authorization included in the Lawsons' pre-suit notice to KDG did not substantially satisfy the requirements of Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 29-26-121(a)(2)(E).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   III. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Our Supreme Court has elucidated the following regarding the standard of review applicable to a motion to dismiss a health care liability action based upon the plaintiff's noncompliance with Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 29-26-121 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The proper way for a defendant to challenge a complaint's compliance with Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-121 and Tennessee Code Annotated section 29-26-122 is to file a Tennessee Rule of Procedure 12.02 motion to dismiss. In the motion, the defendant should state how the plaintiff has failed to comply with the statutory requirements by referencing specific omissions in the complaint and/or by submitting affidavits or other proof. Once the defendant makes a properly supported motion under this rule, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show either that it complied with the statutes or that it had extraordinary cause for failing to do so. Based on the complaint and any other relevant evidence submitted by the parties, the trial court must determine whether the plaintiff has complied with the statutes. If the trial court determines that the plaintiff has not complied with the statutes, then the trial court may consider whether the plaintiff has demonstrated extraordinary cause for its noncompliance. If the defendant prevails and the complaint is dismissed, the plaintiff is entitled to an appeal of right under Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 3 using the standards of review in Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 13. If the plaintiff prevails, the defendant may pursue an interlocutory appeal under either Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 9 or 10 using the same standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Because the trial court's denial of the Defendants' motion involves a question of law, our review is de novo with no presumption of correctness.\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

The question of whether [the plaintiff] has demonstrated extraordinary cause that would excuse compliance with the statutes is a mixed question of law and fact, and our review of that determination is de novo with a presumption of correctness applying only to the trial court's findings of fact and not to the legal effect of those findings.\n   <em>\n    Starr v.

We review the trial court's decision to excuse compliance under an abuse of discretion standard. \"A court abuses its discretion when it applies an incorrect legal standard or its decision is illogical or unreasonable, is based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or utilizes reasoning that results in an injustice to the complaining party.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

The authorization only allows a potential defendant to obtain the prospective plaintiff's medical records from any other healthcare provider also given notice and identified as a potential defendant in the presuit notice. This authorization requirement is consistent with section 29-26-121(d)(1), which specifies that all parties to a healthcare suit \"shall be entitled to obtain complete copies of the claimant's medical records from any other provider receiving notice\" and that the claimant complies with this requirement by providing a HIPAA-compliant medical authorization with pre-suit notice.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.508\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 29-26-121(d)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Bray v.

The Lawsons were required to include a HIPAA-compliant medical authorization with their pre-suit notice to the original two Defendants. Moreover, because KDG's possession of the medical record from the date of the alleged injury did not operate as an authorization for KDG to disclose the record, we further determine the Lawsons' argument that KDG needed no such authorization to be unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, the Lawsons rely in part on our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   , noting that the Court affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff's action in\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   when the plaintiff omitted from her medical authorization \"at least three of the six compliance requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257954\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/418/547/#p555\">\n    418 S.W.3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 556. The Lawsons argue that their situation is distinguishable because they omitted only one element. However, substantial compliance, as it is used in the context of pre-suit notice, does not refer solely to the number of satisfied elements, but rather to a degree of compliance that provides the defendant with the ability to access and use the medical records for the purpose of mounting a defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257954\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/418/547/#p555\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257954\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/418/547/#p555\">\n    at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because HIPAA itself prohibits medical providers from using or disclosing a plaintiff's medical records without a fully compliant authorization form, it is a threshold requirement of the statute that the plaintiff's medical authorization must be sufficient to enable defendants to obtain and review a plaintiff's relevant medical records.\"). The relevant inquiry, therefore, is whether the Lawsons failed to meet this threshold requirement, rather than how many core elements of the authorization were omitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Lawsons argue that the instant action is comparable to the factual situation in\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802065\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/487/114/#p120\">\n    487 S.W.3d at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , wherein this Court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the plaintiff's health care liability claim upon the determination that the plaintiffs' presuit medical authorization substantially complied with HIPAA regulations despite the omission of one core element, the expiration date or event relating to the individual or the purpose of the use or disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C.F.R. \u00a7 164.508(c)(1)(v). The\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   Court distinguished the facts at issue in its determination of substantial compliance from those in\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   as follows in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   We read the\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   holding in light of the particular shortcomings in the\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   HIPAA form, which, as discussed above, were more substantive and substantial than the omitted date on the HIPAA form in the instant case. The relatively minor omission on Appellant's HIPAA form, coupled with the lack of evidence that Appellees were prejudiced or otherwise denied access to medical records as a result of the missing date, leads us to conclude that the trial court applied the\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   holding too harshly in this case. While we concede that it is not good practice to omit any of the C.F.R. criteria from a HIPAA form, we conclude that the relatively minor shortcoming in the HIPAA form here is not fatal to the Appellant's cause of action. The Appellant substantially complied with \u00a7 29-26-121(a)(2)(E) because she\n   provided Appellees sufficient notice to obtain the relevant medical records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802065\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/487/114/#p120\">\n    487 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   122 (citing\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202921930\">\n    2014 WL 2921930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 ) (additional internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In contrast to the omitted date at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   , the case at bar presents a situation in which the name or other specific identification of the person(s) or class of persons authorized to make the requested use or disclosure is missing from the Lawsons' pre-suit medical authorization. As KDG notes on appeal, health care providers presented with a medical authorization missing the identification of those authorized to release information would have no way of knowing that they were the providers for which the authorization was intended or that they were allowed to release medical records. Here, the authorization form provided by the Lawsons to KDG does not specify KDG as a provider allowed to release Mr. Lawson's medical records. Although the omission in this case includes only one of the omitted items at issue in\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   , we determine that it is a necessary element to Defendants' legal authorization to use the pertinent medical records to mount a defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202921930\">\n    2014 WL 2921930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Lawsons also rely on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hughes v. Henry County Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   , No. W2014-01973-COA-R3-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203562733\">\n    2015 WL 3562733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Ct. App. June 9, 2015). In\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , the pre-suit authorization provided to the defendant medical facility did not allow the facility to obtain and utilize records from the other defendant, a physician employed by the facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. This Court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the health care liability action in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   upon determining that the defendant physician had only treated the decedent at the defendant facility and possessed no medical records separate from the facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (concluding that the goal of providing the defendant with the means necessary to evaluate the substantive merits of the plaintiff's claim was satisfied because the defendant facility \"was authorized to use all of the patient's relevant medical records\"). The Lawsons draw a parallel between\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   and this case because of the employer-employee relationship between Defendants. However, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , the defendant medical practice in this action, KDG, was not provided with authorization to utilize Mr. Lawson's medical records because the space on the authorization form for those entitled to disclose the records was left entirely blank. We therefore find the Lawsons' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   to be unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Third, the Lawsons assert that the document attached to their pre-suit notice, titled, \"LIST OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS,\" can supplement the HIPAA authorization to satisfy the requirement provided in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.508\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(ii). However, the Code of Federal Regulations, with certain exceptions not applicable here, specifically prohibits compound authorizations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20164.508\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 164.508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) (\"An authorization for use or disclosure of protected health information may not be combined with any other document to create a compound authorization....\"). This Court has previously \"rejected the Plaintiffs' contention that the authorization forms were sufficient when considered alongside the pre-suit notice letters that accompanied the forms.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.A.C. v.

Mar. 9, 2017). Therefore, the Lawsons could not combine their attached list of health care providers with the medical authorization in order to achieve substantial compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, the Lawsons concede that although Mr. Lawson allegedly suffered the injury at issue while attempting to position himself on the examination table rather than while receiving medical care, this action is governed by the Health Care Liability Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-26-101\">\n    Tenn.

The Lawsons assert, however, that because the medical record generated by KDG on the day of treatment at issue does not address the incident involving the examination table, the medical record could be of no assistance to KDG in mounting a defense and therefore does not prejudice KDG. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A one-page medical record concerning Mr. Lawson's April 29, 2015 visit to KDG is in the record on appeal as an exhibit attached to the Lawsons' response to Defendants' motion to dismiss. It is undisputed that this one-page record does not reference the incident involving the examination table. However, we have no way of knowing, nor did the trial court, how the medical record before us, which includes a description of Mr. Lawson's presenting his condition requiring dermatology treatment subsequent to suffering his purported injury allegedly caused by the table malfunction, would be evaluated by an expert witness or consultant. Moreover, because the medical authorization provided by the Lawsons failed to designate who would be authorized to make use of the medical record, KDG was foreclosed by HIPAA regulations from consulting with anyone to determine whether the record could aid in mounting a defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7257954\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/418/547/#p555\">\n    418 S.W.3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 555 ;\n   <em>\n    Roberts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202921930\">\n    2014 WL 2921930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Upon thorough review, we conclude that KDG was prejudiced by the inadequacy of the Lawsons' pre-suit medical authorization because KDG would not be allowed to use Mr. Lawson's medical records to mount a defense.
