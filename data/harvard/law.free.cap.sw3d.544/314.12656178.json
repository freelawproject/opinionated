R. Crim. P. 29.15 (2012). We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal, and we conclude the motion court's denial of the motion to reopen post-conviction proceedings was not clearly erroneous. An extended opinion would have no precedential value. We have, however, provided a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision to the parties, for their use only. We affirm the judgment pursuant to Missouri Rule of Civil Procedure 84.16(b) (2017).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
