Her body was discovered that same day in a public alley, with her pants and underwear pulled down around her legs and shirt pulled up to her bra line. She suffered from two gunshot wounds. One wound was observed on the left side of the back of her head, while the other wound was in virtually the same spot on the right side. The medical examiner was unable to determine which shot was fired first, but did opine that neither shot alone would have caused immediate death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Although Appellant was originally; a suspect, Armstrong's murder remained unsolved for more than twenty years. Yet, in 2004, the Louisville Metro Police Department (\"LMPD\") Cold Case Unit reopened Armstrong's case. Through the use of DNA profiling, Detectives sought to eliminate suspects. LMPD officers were able to obtain Appellant's DNA from a cigar he discarded during a traffic stop. Appellant's DNA profile matched the DNA profile found in Armstrong's panties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 27, 2007, a Jefferson County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging Appellant with rape in the first degree and murder. During the trial, DNA evidence and evidence of Appellant's other murder convictions were introduced to the jury. On July 28, 2014, Appellant was found guilty of both charges. Appellant refused to participate during the sentencing stage of his trial. The jury ultimately found the existence of aggravating circumstances and recommended a sentence of death for Armstrong's murder plus twenty years for her rape. The trial court sentenced Appellant in conformity with the jury's recommendation. Appellant now appeals his conviction and sentence as a matter of right pursuant to \u00a7 110(2)(b) of the Kentucky Constitution and Kentucky Revised Statute (\"KRS\") 532.075.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, Appellant has raised thirty-three claims of error. In reviewing these claims, the Court is statutorily required to \"consider the punishment as well as any errors enumerated by way of appeal.\" KRS 532.075(2). Moreover, since we are dealing with the imposition of death, this appeal is \"subject to [a] more expansive and searching review than ordinary criminal cases.\"\n   <em>\n    St. Clair v.

Prior to trial, the Commonwealth filed notice that it intended to introduce evidence of Appellant's two 1987 murder convictions. These convictions revealed that Appellant pled guilty to murdering Deborah Miles and Yolanda Sweeney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commonwealth suggested that the Miles and Sweeney murders were similar enough to Armstrong's murder to demonstrate that Appellant was her killer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Miles was discovered dead in her bedroom a mere week after Armstrong's murder. She was naked and had been shot in the left, back side of the head. Appellant claimed that he had known Miles for several months and that she sold drugs on his behalf. Appellant also claimed the two had a sexual relationship. Appellant stated that he shot Miles while at her apartment because she failed to repay him for drugs. Appellant claimed that he did not sexually assault her before or after her murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In regards to Sweeney, she was found dead behind a backyard shed approximately four weeks after Armstrong's murder. Sweeney suffered from a fatal gunshot wound to the left side of the back of her head. Her pants were missing and her panties were pulled down around her legs. Appellant stated that he met Sweeney shortly before her death at a nightclub. She agreed to engage in sexual activity with him for $25.00. Appellant claims the two walked to a secluded outside area at which point Appellant provided Sweeney with the money. Appellant admitted to shooting Sweeney after she tried to run away with his money before conducting the agreed upon sexual acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Commonwealth argued that the facts of these two convictions were similar enough to prove Appellant's identity as Armstrong's murderer. Extensive pleadings were filed from both parties and the trial court conducted several hearings on the matter. Ultimately, the trial court was persuaded by the Commonwealth's arguments and allowed the two prior convictions to be introduced to the jury for the purpose of establishing Appellant's identity through his modus operandi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before evaluating the trial court's admission of Appellant's two murder convictions, we note that reversal is not required\n   unless the trial court abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8308232\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/90/#p95\">\n    223 S.W.3d 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (Ky. 2007). Thusly, reversal is unwarranted absent a finding that the trial court's decision \"was arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, or unsupported by sound legal principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. English\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11677344\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/993/941/#p945\">\n    993 S.W.2d 941\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 945 (Ky. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   KRE 404(b) prohibits the introduction of \"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" used \"to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" This evidentiary rule seeks to prevent the admission of evidence of a defendant's previous bad actions which \"show a propensity or predisposition to again commit the same or a similar act.\"\n   <em>\n    Southworth v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927058\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/435/32/#p48\">\n    435 S.W.3d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (Ky. 2014). However, such evidence may be admissible to prove \"motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" KRE 404(b)(1). While \"modus operandi\" is not specifically mentioned within the list of exceptions, this Court has long held that evidence of prior bad acts which are extraordinarily similar to the crimes charged may be admitted to demonstrate a modus operandi for the purposes of proving,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , identity.\n   <em>\n    Billings v.

Therefore, we must compare the facts of Appellant's prior murders to the murder of Armstrong, keeping in mind that \"clever attorneys on each side can invariably muster long lists of facts and inferences supporting both similarities and differences between the prior bad acts and the present allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Our review is even more difficult considering that our jurisprudence on this issue has evolved mostly through the lens of sexual abuse cases. These cases hold that a specific act of sexual deviance may be unique enough to demonstrate that the assailant's crimes are \"signature\" in nature.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dickerson v.

The witness claimed that Bowling came into his service station, attempted to rob the store, and shot at him countless times.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11910324\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/942/293/#p301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11910324\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/942/293/#p301\">\n    at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court held that the facts were sufficient to pass muster under the modus operandi exception since in both kidnappings he used the same gun and pair of handcuffs in order to steal a similar type of truck.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887842\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/455/869/#p880\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887842\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/455/869/#p880\">\n    at 887\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   What we garner from our case law is that a perpetrator's modus operandi can be established by any number of similarities between the previous criminal acts and the crimes charged, e.g., the type of victims, proximity of the time and location of the crimes, the weapon or ammunition used, the method employed to effectuate the crime, etc. However, we must analyze similarities with caution, as the likeness of the crimes may merely constitute a common characteristic or element of the offense. The Court made this clarification in\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   , wherein we underscored that \"the fundamental principle that conduct that serves to satisfy the statutory elements of an offense will not suffice to meet the modus operandi exception.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8308232\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/223/90/#p95\">\n    223 S.W.3d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For that reason, \"it is not the commonality of the crimes but the commonality of the facts constituting the crimes that demonstrates a modus operandi.\"\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8905383\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/174/451/#p469\">\n    174 S.W.3d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With these cases in mind, we begin with the factual commonalities of the Miles and Sweeney murders with that of Armstrong's. The most noticeable similarity is that all three victims were African-American women in their early twenties, ranging from twenty-one years to twenty-three years old. Another substantial likeness concerns the date and location of all three murders. Appellant murdered Sweeney and Miles within approximately four weeks of murdering Armstrong. The Sweeney and Miles murders also occurred within blocks from Appellant's residence and the location of where Armstrong's body was found. We also place considerable weight on the resemblances between the victims' manners of death. For example, the mode of execution which Miles and Sweeney both suffered was similar to Armstrong's fatal wounds. Specifically, all three victims were shot in the head in the area behind the left ear. Also, and of high importance, the bullets used to kill all three victims were .38 caliber bullets. Moreover, all three victims were each discovered in various stages of undress, which\n   <em>\n    suggested\n   </em>\n   they were victims of a sexual assault. The three victims' vaginal areas were likewise all exposed upon the discovery of their bodies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Turning to the factual differences of the crimes, Miles was killed inside her apartment, while Armstrong and Sweeney were killed outside. In addition, Appellant maintained different levels of association with the three victims. Appellant claims to have known Miles for a few months prior to her death, while both Sweeney and Armstrong appear to have been new acquaintances. The crimes also occurred at different times of the day. Armstrong was murdered in mid to late morning, while Miles and Sweeney were killed at night. Another difference is that the gun that killed Armstrong was not used to kill Miles or Sweeney, even though it was the same caliber weapon. Moreover, unlike the other two victims, Armstrong was shot twice, as the first shot did not cause immediate death. Appellant also points out that there was no forensic evidence that Appellant had sexual contact with either Miles or Sweeney, nor was he convicted of sexually assaulting either victim. We should note that Sweeney's body was too badly decomposed for a rape kit to be performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Less persuasive differences are also present. Appellant emphasizes that the victims were discovered in different states of undress. Armstrong was fully dressed with her underwear pulled down around her legs, while Sweeney was found without pants, also with her underwear pulled down around her legs. Miles, however, was discovered completely nude. The Court is hesitant to place great weight on the differences in the victims' states of undress because it likely demonstrates convenience or opportuneness rather than a planned action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anastasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9984092\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/754/860/\">\n    754 S.W.2d at 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (allowing modus operandi evidence of prior acts of sexual abuse where all victims, except one, were clothed only in underwear).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While the above-mentioned differences are inversely proportional to the degree of similarity needed to meet the modus operandi threshold, our jurisprudence does not require that the circumstances be indistinguishable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8905383\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/174/451/#p469\">\n    174 S.W.3d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rearick v.

Newcomb held one victim by the hair, but used minimal force with the other victim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086610\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/63/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    English\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11677344\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/993/941/#p945\">\n    993 S.W.2d at 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (English utilized the covering of a blanket to hide the commission of sexual acts with some of his victims, but not with others).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is apparent to this Court that the similarities that satisfied the modus operandi threshold in\n   <em>\n    Newcomb\n   </em>\n   are no more significant, nor are the differences any less substantial, than those of the facts presently before us.\n   <em>\n    Newcomb\n   </em>\n   illustrates that despite factual differences, the crimes' similarities, even if minimal, may be distinctive enough to evidence the perpetrator's identity. We believe those distinguishing similarities exist in the case before us. Indeed, Appellant engaged in a pattern of attacking African-American women in their early twenties within a close proximity during early June through early July of\n   1983. The most persuasive facts being that these three women were of the same age, race, and suffered a gunshot wound from a .38 caliber bullet to the mid-back, left side of the head while their vaginas were uncovered from the removal of clothing. In our view, the commonality of the facts between the Miles and Sweeney murders and the Armstrong murder presents a substantial degree of similarity. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the crimes' similarities were sufficient enough to demonstrate Appellant's identity through his modus operandi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Having determined that the Miles and Sweeney murders qualified as modus operandi evidence, we must still ensure that such evidence was more probative than prejudicial. KRE 403 ;\n   <em>\n    Lanham v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8920330\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/171/14/#p31\">\n    171 S.W.3d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 (Ky. 2005). The trial court ruled that although the evidence was \"extremely prejudicial,\" the prejudice was outweighed by its high probative worth. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In conducting a KRE 403 balancing test with respect to modus operandi evidence, \"a variety of matters must be considered, including the strength of the evidence as to the commission of the other crime, the similarities between the crimes, the interval of time that has elapsed between the crimes, the need for the evidence, the efficacy of alternative proof, and the degree to which the evidence probably will rouse the jury to overmastering hostility.\"\n   <em>\n    Newcomb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086610\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/63/\">\n    410 S.W.3d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting McCormick on Evidence, Ch. 17 \u00a7 190).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, we begin our analysis by acknowledging that the strength of the Commonwealth's modus operandi evidence is unquestionably strong. The following observation is of great importance to this Court. Unlike other cases in which we have found the existence of modus operandi, the comparative offenses in the case before us were not merely alleged, rather Appellant pled guilty to murdering both Miles and Sweeney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newcomb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7086610\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/410/63/\">\n    410 S.W.3d at 70-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Newcomb was indicted for the rapes, but had not yet been convicted);\n   <em>\n    English\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11677344\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/993/941/#p945\">\n    993 S.W.2d at 942-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (other prior acts of sexual abuse were only alleged by the witnesses). In addition, and as we have already discussed, the similarities of the murders are substantial. The close proximity in time and location between each murder further heightens the evidence's probativeness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In regards to the need for evidence and the efficacy of alternative proof, we find these considerations also weigh in favor of admission. The Commonwealth's only method of proving Appellant's identity as the perpetrator was through the use of DNA evidence. While the DNA evidence certainly proved that Appellant had ejaculated on Armstrong, he argued that he had consensual sex with her perhaps days before her death. Since Appellant provided the jury with a plausible explanation for the presence of his semen, evidence of his modus operandi was highly probative in proving his identity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11910324\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/942/293/#p301\">\n    942 S.W.2d at 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (evidence of other crimes passed KRE 403 balancing test wherein the evidence rebutted a claimed defense and identification of the defendant as the assailant was at issue).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In concluding our analysis on this issue, we acknowledge that Appellant undoubtedly suffered prejudice from the introduction of his two prior murder convictions. However, we believe the trial court actively managed the jury's understanding of the evidence so as to prevent them from developing \"overmastering hostility.\" In an effort to dissuade prejudice, the trial court admonished the jury about the proper use of the 404(b) evidence after the parties' opening statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The trial court explicitly explained to the jury that the evidence was only to be considered as evidence of modus operandi and identity. Furthermore, the trial court instructed the jury that the Commonwealth still had to prove each element of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt and that Appellant's prior murder convictions could not be used to establish action in conformity therewith. The trial court provided the jury with a similar instruction just prior to the guilt-phase deliberations. In light of the trial court's actions, in conjunction with the high probative worth of the evidence, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing evidence of Appellant's prior murder convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jury Instructions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Appellant's next assignment of error is that the trial court's failure to define the terms \"modus operandi\" and \"identity evidence\" violated his due process rights. Appellant concedes that this issue is unpreserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Appellant contends that \"modus operandi\" and \"identity evidence\" are both terms that a juror is unlikely to understand. Consequently, it cannot be assumed that the jury followed the trial court's admonitions to only consider the prior murder convictions for the purposes of demonstrating Appellant's identity through his modus operandi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lawson v.

However,\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   , a domestic violence case, is distinguishable from the case before us.

In February of 2006, LMPD Sergeant Aaron Crowell was tasked with covertly obtaining Appellant's DNA. Accordingly, Sergeant Crowell and Detective Hibbs began surveilling Appellant's residence. While watching Appellant's residence, the two officers observed Appellant enter a vehicle as a passenger. The vehicle subsequently left the residence at an unlawful high rate of speed. The officers then stopped the vehicle due to the speeding violation. During the stop, Sergeant Crowell removed Appellant from the vehicle and performed a pat down to check for weaponry. Appellant placed his lit cigar onto the back of the vehicle. After checking\n   the subjects' driver's licenses and running warrant checks, officers permitted the driver and Appellant to leave. No citation was issued.

KRS 26A.015 requires, in pertinent part, that Judge Shake recuse himself if he has (1) \"personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding\"; (2) \"served as a lawyer or rendered a legal opinion in the matter in controversy\"; or (3) \"has knowledge of any other circumstances in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This Court does not believe any grounds for mandatory recusal existed. In regards to the first basis for disqualification, we disagree with Appellant's argument that his 1981 conviction had some type of evidentiary value to the existence of his modus operandi. Not only was his 1981 conviction not introduced during the guilt phase, but Appellant fails to explain how Judge Shake's purported knowledge of that case renders the murders of Sweeney and Miles more similar to the murder of Armstrong. In regards to the second statutory ground for recusal, we find Appellant's argument unpersuasive. While it is true that Judge Shake previously served as Appellant's attorney, he did so in an\n   unrelated case over thirty-three years prior. That particular conviction plainly does not constitute the same \"matter in controversy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bussell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997705\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/882/111/\">\n    882 S.W.2d at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lastly, we find difficulty in reasonably questioning Judge Shake's impartiality. Judge Shake was candid about his recollections and explained that he had no memory of Appellant's cases or having any conversations concerning those cases. We will not assume bias based solely on the fact that Judge Shake represented Appellant more than thirty-three years prior to his trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9997705\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/882/111/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (holding that judge's prior representation of defendant in a murder case did not render him biased). For these reasons, we find no error in Judge Shake's refusal to disqualify himself from presiding over Appellant's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Chain of Custody\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Appellant also requests that we grant him a new trial on the grounds that the trial court improperly admitted unreliable evidence. The evidence Appellant complains of is Armstrong's rape kit, underwear cuttings, and his cigar and buccal swab. Appellant contends that the Commonwealth failed to provide a sufficient foundation for the aforementioned articles due to numerous breaks in the respective items' chains of custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The admission of physical evidence requires \"a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\" KRE 901(a). Said differently, a proper foundation demonstrates that the proffered evidence is the same evidence initially recovered and has not been materially changed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beason v.

Confusion abounds due to several cuttings being taken at two different times and the Commonwealth's inability to specify which path a particular cutting took. To simplify our analysis, we can place the cuttings into two groups originating from LMPD Detective Charles Griffin's collection of the panties from Armstrong's autopsy on June 4, 1983. Nine days later, he delivered the panties to a Kentucky State Police (\"KSP\") laboratory analyst Morris Durbin, who took cuttings from the areas testing positive for seminal fluids. This is the first group of cuttings. The cuttings were then stored in a KSP freezer where they remained until July of 2006. At that time, some of the cuttings were sent to a different KSP lab. The laboratory technician personally returned the cuttings to LMPD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   on April 25, 2007, after which they were stored in the LMPD property room. A sufficient chain of custody is patently clear for this first group of cuttings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The second group of cuttings occurred in 2004, when LMPD was investigating another suspect in Armstrong's murder. At that time, the remnants of the intact panties were transported to the KSP laboratory. This is where the second group of cuttings occurred. These cuttings were returned to LMPD and stored in the property room that same year. The chain of custody for the second group of cuttings has one missing link. After Durbin made the initial selection of cuttings in 1983, there is no direct testimony demonstrating how the remnants of the intact panties made it back to the LMPD property room before being stored until 2004. Nevertheless, discovery indicates that the KSP lab released the panties to LMPD Officer \"J. Trusty\" on August 10, 1983, the same day they were returned to the LMPD property room. This minimal gap in the chain of custody for the second group of panty cuttings does not render it unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9036917\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/153/772/#p779\">\n    153 S.W.3d at 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\"All possibility of tampering does not have to be negated. It is sufficient ... that the actions taken to preserve the integrity of the evidence are reasonable under the circumstances.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Since there is only one of two paths the panty cuttings could have taken, and both paths demonstrated intact chains of custody, we believe the Commonwealth provided a sufficient foundation demonstrating the reliability of the DNA evidence. It is inconsequential for the purposes of admission which path a particular cutting took. Regardless of whether a particular sample was part of the 1983 or 2004 cuttings, there is little doubt that the \"proffered evidence was the same evidence actually involved in the event in question and that it remain[ed] materially unchanged.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , 153S.W.3d at 779. Thusly, the Commonwealth adequately authenticated the evidence. The fact that the Commonwealth was unable to differentiate whether the cuttings were from the first or second batch of cuttings goes to the weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Rape Kit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Dr. McCloud collected Armstrong's rape kit, after which it was transferred to Detective Griffin during her autopsy. It is unclear if it was Detective Griffin or another officer who placed the kit in the LMPD property room. Nine days later, Detective Griffin transported the kit to a KSP laboratory. The Commonwealth could not pinpoint who transported the kit back to the LMPD property room where it remained until June of 2004. At that time, the kit was once again transported to the KSP laboratory by an evidence technician where it exchanged hands with several identified analysts and technicians and returned to the LMPD property room. A similar exchange took place in 2007, where the kit was transported to a KSP laboratory by an identified evidence technician and was later returned to the LMPD property room. There was no testimony regarding who handled the kit, if anyone, while at the KSP laboratory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although there are several breaks in the rape kit's custodial chain, we do not believe these disruptions render the evidence unreliable. The deficiencies in custody are apparently due to careless record keeping in the form of failure to specify who transported the item, rather than actions that would have altered or possibly contaminated the contents of the rape kit. In\n   <em>\n    Rabovsky v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11703166\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/973/6/#p8\">\n    973 S.W.2d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (Ky. 1998), the Court stated that \"it is unnecessary to establish a perfect chain of custody or to eliminate all possibility of\n   tampering or misidentification, so long as there is persuasive evidence that 'the reasonable probability is that the evidence has not been altered in any material respect.\" ' (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As such, the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence, as there was minimal chance that the contents of the rape kit were altered. Once again, we underscore that breaks in the chain of custody go to the weight of the evidence, rather than its admissibility.\n   <em>\n    McKinney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9459480\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/60/499/#p511\">\n    60 S.W.3d at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Appellant also claims that evidence of the rape kit's chain of custody was insufficient due to Detective Griffin and Dr. McCloud, who were both deceased at the time of trial, being unable to testify. Yet, we find that Medical Examiner Dr. Tracey Corey's and LMPD Detective Joel Maupin's testimonies adequately perfected the missing links in the evidence's chain of custody. Dr. Corey testified that Dr. McCloud collected the rape kit during Armstrong's autopsy. Dr. Corey was not present during the autopsy, but confirmed the collection based on the autopsy report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirk v.

Likewise, Detective Maupin testified that he witnessed Detective Griffin order the rape kit and take custody of the collected kit during the autopsy. Detective Maupin was also able to identify the rape kit as the one collected by virtue of Detective Griffin's signature and date on the rape kit packaging. Thusly, we find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Buccal Swab and Cigar\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As mentioned, Appellant also submits that the Commonwealth failed to establish the chain of custody for his cigar butt and buccal swab. We will not plunge into a lengthy discussion concerning the custodial history of these items. Instead, we can surmise that Appellant's most persuasive argument is predicated on unidentified individuals who accepted and released the evidence from the LMPD property room. As our analysis has already stated, minor custodial breaches do not automatically render the evidence unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9036917\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/153/772/#p779\">\n    153 S.W.3d at 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

You had to hear a day's worth of evidence to know what everybody already knew. It was Larry White's DNA on Ms. Armstrong's\n   vagina, her anus, her panties and the back of her pants.\" Appellant immediately objected, claiming that the Commonwealth was mischaracterizing the evidence. The trial court overruled Appellant's objection, stating that the jury can reconcile the statements with the evidence presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Appellant is correct that his DNA was not specifically found on Armstrong's vagina, anus, or pants. While semen was found in those areas, analysts were unable to obtain a DNA profile. Nevertheless, Appellant's DNA matched the DNA profile found on Armstrong's panties with certainty-one in 160 trillion people. From this evidence, the Commonwealth was entitled to draw reasonable inferences and explain why those inferences support a finding of guilt.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9006353\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/165/129/#p131\">\n    165 S.W.3d at 131-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Since evidence indicated that Appellant had sexual intercourse with Armstrong prior to her death, in addition to his DNA being found in her panties, the Commonwealth was permitted to make the reasonable inference that such DNA was present in the semen found on Armstrong's vagina, anus, and pants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tamme v.

Appellant believes the Commonwealth's statements had the effect of offering the prestige of the Commonwealth Attorney's Office to support the witness' credibility. Appellant's brief provides a lengthy quote from the Commonwealth which it argues amounted to improper bolstering. After reviewing the Commonwealth's closing argument, we find no need to provide the quote, as there is no merit in Appellant's contention. The Commonwealth merely summarized Mr. Ellington's testimony in a way that was persuasive to their position.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

Mr. Ellington is the father of one of Armstrong's children. The defense advanced a theory that Mr. Ellington was Armstrong's killer. In response, the Commonwealth provided the jury with the following closing argument statements: \"[Ellington], being accused, having a Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, [ ] came and sat right here. [Ellington] chose to testify. He took an oath from the judge and he answered the questions. Are those the actions of a killer?\" Appellant argues that this statement amounted to an improper comment on Appellant's failure to testify.

Such a comment does not constitute a comment on Appellant's failure to testify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowling,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797958\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/873/175/#p178\">\n    873 S.W.2d at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that prosecutor's closing argument statement that \"We can't tell you what it is because only the man who pulled the trigger knows\" did not amount to a comment on defendant's refusal\n   to testify).

The complained of statement was clearly made to challenge the defense's theory that Appellant's DNA was present in Armstrong's underwear because the two had consensual sex preceding her death. The Commonwealth's remarks that there was no evidence that such an encounter took place was well within the bounds of closing arguments.

We agree and condemn the Commonwealth's use of such unnecessary and disparaging comments. However, this Court does not believe the remark was severe enough to render the trial fundamentally unfair. While the Commonwealth's remark was obviously deliberate and undoubtedly produced some prejudice, the remark was isolated, being used only once during the closing argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mayo v.

Moreover, the evidence against Appellant, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   was relatively strong. When viewed in the context of the entire trial, the Commonwealth's brief and minor remark did not undermine the essential fairness of Appellant's trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

We find no need to relay the complained of statements. Instead, we resolve Appellant's contentions, by finding that the Commonwealth properly commented on the proof presented to the jury, including the fact that he had murdered two other women. We do not believe the Commonwealth's references to the Miles and Sweeney murders exceeded the bounds of permissible closing statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Appellant's final claim of prosecutorial misconduct concerns the Commonwealth's statement to the jury that they \"never heard one word or witnessed one action of any remorse from the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Again, this comment was made during the sentencing stage. This argument, while unacceptable during the guilt stage, is germane to sentencing. The United States Supreme Court weighed in on this issue when reviewing this Court's decision.\n   <em>\n    White v. Woodall\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706994,12579839\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1697/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1704,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706994,12579839\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1697/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The nation's highest court ruled that the trial court was not required to give an instruction of no inference of guilt by the defendant's\n   refusal to testify during the penalty stage. The Supreme Court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that \"no case law [ ] precludes the jury from considering the defendant's lack of expression of remorse ... in sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunt v.

There was no error here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Victim Impact Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Appellant next contends that he was denied a fair trial due to the elicitation of what he believes was victim impact evidence during the guilt phase of trial. This argument is unpreserved and without merit. During redirect examination of one of Armstrong's children, the Commonwealth inquired into the status of Armstrong's other children. The witness merely said that one of his siblings was killed and the other had committed suicide. The witness did not expound on their deaths, nor did he state that their deaths were attributable to their mother's murder. We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Directed Verdict\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Appellant argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant him a directed verdict of acquittal on the rape and murder charges. We have sufficiently outlined the sufficiency of the evidence in this opinion already to refute this claim. We will not protract this opinion by unnecessarily repeating it here. When viewing the evidence in its entirety, it was not clearly unreasonable for a jury to find Appellant guilty of the crimes charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Statutory Aggravator\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Appellant next urges the Court to vacate his sentence of death on the grounds that the jury failed to find a statutory aggravator. In order to impose the death sentence upon a defendant, a jury must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of at least one of the statutory aggravators as listed in KRS 532.025(2)(a). In the case before us, the jury was instructed on the following aggravating circumstance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   In fixing a sentence for the defendant, Larry Lamont White, for the offense of the murder of Pamela Armstrong you shall consider the following aggravating circumstance which you may believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to be true: (1) The defendant committed the offense of murder while the defendant was engaged in the commission of rape in the first degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Appellant takes issue with the jury's response to this question. The jury's verdict form read as follows: \"We the jury, find beyond a reasonable doubt that the following aggravating circumstances exists in the case as to the murder of Pamela Armstrong.\" Underneath this aggravator, the jury foreman wrote the word \"Rape.\" Appellant claims that the jury's finding of \"rape\" does not constitute a finding that the Appellant's murder of Armstrong was committed while he was engaged in the commission of first-degree rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Appellant's argument has merit to the extent that the jury's one word answer of \"rape\" does not specify whether the jury believed Appellant committed first-degree rape during the commission of Armstrong's murder. Yet, we may assume that the jury made the proper finding of the statutory aggravator based on the jury's likely interpretation and understanding of the verdict forms and instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Based on the instructions and verdict form, the jury was given the option of finding only one aggravator-murder accompanied by first-degree rape, and was instructed that it could not impose a death sentence unless the aggravating circumstance was found: These instructions are clear. In the Commonwealth, we assume that juries follow instructions.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Appellant's claim relies entirely on the fact his indictment was not signed by a circuit court judge or circuit court clerk. RCr 6.06 requires only that indictments be signed by the Grand Jury foreperson and the Commonwealth's attorney. Appellant fails to direct the Court to any statutory or precedential authority indicating that the lack of a circuit court judge or clerk's signatures renders the indictment invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Furthermore, RCr 6.06 prohibits any challenge to the indictment on signatory grounds \"made after a plea to the merits has been filed or entered.\" Appellant pled \"not guilty\" to the crimes charged in January 2008, but did not challenge the indictment until July of 2014. For these reasons, Appellant's argument is not only waived, but lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jury Inquiry\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Appellant maintains that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by failing to conduct an adequate inquiry regarding whether any jurors viewed an inflammatory news article. The article at issue was released at the beginning of the trial and labeled Appellant as a \"serial killer\" who raped and murdered two other women. Appellant moved for a mistrial, arguing that the jury had likely been exposed to the news article. In response, the trial court informed the jurors that a news article was released concerning the case and then asked the jurors if they had followed his previous admonition \"not to read anything or watch anything, [or] research anything.\" The jurors indicated that they had followed the trial court's admonition. Appellant made no further objections about the matter and did not ask for additional admonitions.

For this reason, we grant the trial court's wide-ranging discretion, as \"this distinction will often be anything but clear and will hinge to a large extent on the trial court's estimate of the potential juror's demeanor.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324122\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/313/577/#p599\">\n    313 S.W.3d at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   With regards to Juror 1159266, voir dire questioning revealed his opposition to the death penalty. Unfortunately for the trial court, his opposition was anything but consistent. When initially asked if he could consider the death penalty, Juror 1159266 responded in the negative. The potential juror subsequently explained that he did not believe in the death penalty, going so far as to say, \"I just don't think that being put to death is the proper punishment ever.\" When Appellant began asking the potential juror questions, he seemed to let up on his previously stated convictions and expressed that he could consider all available penalties. However, further questioning by the Commonwealth once again uncovered his bias against the death penalty and that it was never the proper punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Juror 1159422 also expressed contempt for the death penalty. When asked if she could consider the entire range of penalties, the potential juror stated, \"I'd prefer not to ...

She also explained that she was Catholic and didn't \"particularly like the death penalty.\" Appellant provided the potential juror with similar questioning regarding her ability to consider the death penalty as a possible sentence. She replied as follows: \"I wouldn't want to, no. I wouldn't want to, but could I? I guess anybody can do anything.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   When faced with conflicting and somewhat unclear answers, such as those provided by Juror 1159266 and Juror 1159422, we must look to the jurors' responses as a whole and ask if a reasonable person would conclude that the juror was substantially impaired in the ability to consider the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324122\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/313/577/#p599\">\n    313 S.W.3d at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In regards to the food stamp printout, Armstrong was stated to have left her apartment to obtain food stamps on the morning of her murder, but the food stamps were missing on her person when her body was discovered. In an attempt to confirm her whereabouts that morning, LMPD Detective Les Wilson testified that he obtained a printout from the food stamp office showing Armstrong as a recipient. After Detective Wilson's testimony, the parties realized the printout was missing. Both parties stipulated this fact and the trial court advised the jury that the food stamp printout was not within the case file. Appellant requested an instruction on the missing evidence.

The Commonwealth recognizes this rule of law in KRS 532.140, which forbids the imposition of death upon an \"offender with a serious intellectual disability.\" In order for a defendant to meet Kentucky's statutory definition of \"serious intellectual disability,\" and thus evade the death penalty, he or she must meet the following criteria pursuant to KRS 532.135 : (1) the defendant's intellectual functioning must be \"significant[ly] subaverage\"-defined by statute as having an intelligence quotient of 70 or less; and (2) the defendant must demonstrate substantial deficits in adaptive behavior, which manifested during the developmental period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Procedurally, trial courts require a showing of an IQ value of 70 or below before conducting a hearing regarding the second criteria of diminished adaptive behavior.

After applying the standard error of measurement, Appellant's IQ score has a range of 71 to 81. Such a score is above the statutory cutoff of 70, thereby failing to meet the \"significant subaverage\" requirement. Thusly, further investigation into his adaptive behavior was unnecessary. Nonetheless, Appellant submits that\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   forbids states from denying further exploration of intellectual disability simply based on an IQ score above 70. However, this Court can find no such prohibition. The holding of\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   renders a strict 70-point cutoff as unconstitutional if the standard error of measurement is not taken into account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2000.

The Flynn Effect is a term used to describe the hypothesis that \"as time passes and IQ test norms grow older, the mean IQ score tested by the same norm will increase by approximately three points per decade.\"\n   <em>\n    Bowling v.

Therefore, as applied, Appellant's 1971 IQ score of 76, would actually be 59 by today's standards-71 minus 12 points for the Flynn Effect and 5 points for the standard error of measurement-well below the 70-point threshold. Appellant, however, fails to cite any precedential or statutory authority indicating that trial courts must take into account the Flynn Effect. Indeed, KRS 532.140 is unambiguous and makes no allowance for the Flynn Effect, nor is such an adjustment mandated by this Court or the U.S. Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8952663\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/163/361/#p374\">\n    163 S.W.3d at 375-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, even if the Court was obliged to ignore the confines of KRS 532.135 and place less weight on Appellant's IQ score, there is ample evidence of Appellant's mental acumen. For example, Appellant often advocated for himself through numerous pro se motions. One such motion was written so persuasively that defense counsel specifically asked the trial court to rule on its merits. Consequently, we find no error in the trial court's denial of Appellant's motion for an evidentiary hearing or exclusion of the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Competency Hearing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Appellant also requests that the Court find reversible error in the trial court's failure to conduct a competency hearing. Pursuant to defense counsel's motion, the trial court ordered Appellant to undergo a competency evaluation. However, at the scheduled May 10, 2010 competency hearing, the trial court discovered that the Kentucky Correctional Psychiatric Center (\"KCPC\") was unable to perform an evaluation of Appellant due to his refusal to cooperate. At the scheduled hearing, Appellant informed the trial court that he had several complaints regarding his counsel. As it relates to the issue before us, Appellant explained to the trial court that he was competent and did not want to go to KCPC for an evaluation. Appellant further urged the Court to consider his 1984 evaluation which declared him competent. Several days later, the trial court ordered Appellant's counsel be removed due to irreconcilable differences. The issue of competency was not brought up again until Appellant's motion for a new trial in September of 2014, which was subsequently denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Competency hearings are implicated on statutory and constitutional grounds, both having separate standards governing those rights.

Moreover, Appellant was able to comport himself well in the courtroom, conveyed his thoughts without difficulty, and demonstrated a thorough understanding of the charges he faced.
