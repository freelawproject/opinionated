The state admits an officer submitted a prepared search warrant form, which was then executed by a circuit judge, authorizing a search for any deceased human fetus or corpse despite the fact the officer knew no probable cause existed for such provision. The state contends that, regardless of the lack of probable cause, the circuit court should have applied the severance doctrine to redact any invalid portion of the warrant and suppress only the evidence seized pursuant to the invalid portion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   When portions of a search warrant fail to satisfy the Fourth Amendment warrant requirements, the severance doctrine can be applied to redact the invalid portions of the warrant and permit evidence seized pursuant to the valid portions of the warrant to be admitted into evidence. The severance doctrine requires examination of all provisions in the search warrant and\n   determination of the constitutional validity of each provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When examined in its entirety, the invalid portions of the search warrant in this case so contaminate the whole warrant that they cannot be redacted pursuant to the severance doctrine. In addition to the corpse clause, another provision of the warrant lacks probable cause in that there are no facts in the search warrant application or affidavit establishing the likelihood that any individuals with outstanding arrest warrants would be found on the premises. Four other provisions of the warrant are so lacking in particularity that they permit search of the residence for evidence of any crime or offense. The complete lack of probable cause and particularity in the invalid portions of the warrant created a general warrant authorizing a broad and invasive search of the residence. The severance doctrine cannot be used to save a general warrant. Accordingly, the circuit court properly applied the exclusionary rule to suppress all evidence seized. The circuit court's order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2013, M.G. met Jennifer Gaulter and Phillip Douglass at the Argosy Casino, Hotel &amp; Spa. The group went to Mr. Douglass and Ms. Gaulter's hotel room for drinks, but M.G. left after she felt pressured to have sex with the couple. M.G. called her boyfriend, who picked her up and took her back to her apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The next morning, M.G. locked her apartment and went to work. While at work, she received a text message from Ms. Gaulter informing her she had left her handbag with her keys in the hotel room. M.G. agreed that Ms. Gaulter should leave the handbag at the hotel's front desk so M.G. could pick up the handbag after work. She later received another text from Ms. Gaulter inquiring whether she was at home or working. M.G. replied she was still at work and would call Ms. Gaulter after work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When M.G. returned home around 6:10 p.m., she found her apartment in disarray and several items of property missing. There were no signs of forced entry. She immediately called the hotel to check if her handbag and keys were still there. The hotel staff informed her the handbag was there. At M.G.'s request, the hotel staff looked in the handbag for her keys but did not find them. M.G. sent a text message to Ms. Gaulter about the missing keys and the theft. Ms. Gaulter did not respond. Around 7:30 p.m., M.G. reported the theft to the police. She estimated approximately $10,000 worth of her belongings had been stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When M.G. arrived at the hotel to pick up her handbag, a hotel staff member told her someone had already picked up the bag. Police investigated and found Mr. Douglass and Ms. Gaulter's home address in Blue Springs. M.G. identified the couple from photographs the police found on the Internet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsequent to this investigation, Detective Darold Estes, a 20-year veteran of the Kansas City police department, applied for a search warrant. His affidavit stated that, based on the above facts, there was probable cause to search Mr. Douglass and Ms. Gaulter's residence and to seize specific items believed to have been stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Along with his application and affidavit, Detective Estes submitted a prepared form for the search warrant to be executed by the judge. On the search warrant form, Detective Estes checked a box stating,\n   based on information provided in the affidavit, there was probable cause to search and seize any \"[d]eceased human fetus or corpse, or part thereof.\" The warrant then went on to list several items believed to be stolen from M.G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Kansas City police department conducted a search of the residence that evening.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   No one was home. The police seized a laptop and laptop case, a red purse containing various small items, a Coach purse, and a bracelet. M.G. confirmed all the property seized from the residence had been stolen from her apartment. Mr. Douglass and Ms. Gaulter were arrested and subsequently charged by indictment with burglary in the second degree, section 569.170,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and felony stealing, section 570.030, RSMo Supp. 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Douglass and Ms. Gaulter each filed a motion to suppress asserting the search warrant was invalid because the police did not have probable cause to search for a deceased human fetus or corpse, or part thereof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At a consolidated suppression hearing on the motions, Detective Estes testified he checked the corpse clause because, if a corpse was found during the search, he would be required to obtain a \"piggyback warrant\"-by checking the box, he was just saving the police from having to stop the search to obtain an additional search warrant if a corpse was found. On cross-examination, Detective Estes admitted there was no probable cause a human corpse would be found during the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the hearing, the state submitted additional suggestions in opposition to the motions to suppress arguing the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied because the error was caused by the judge's failure to correct the prepared warrant form. The state further contended the good-faith exception applied because the officers conducting the search reasonably relied on the constitutional validity of the warrant and did not expand the search beyond a search for the stolen items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The circuit court sustained the motions to suppress, finding the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply because Detective Estes intentionally checked the corpse clause box and thereby knowingly gave a false statement to the circuit court. The circuit court further concluded the warrant was invalid because it allowed officers to knowingly bypass the particularity requirement by checking boxes to search for items for which no probable cause existed, thereby rendering it, in essence, a general search warrant. The circuit court held the exclusionary rule was appropriate to deter intentional police misconduct and ordered the suppression of all evidence seized. Pursuant to section\n   547.200.1(3),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the state appealed the circuit court's order.

Likewise, a search warrant is invalid \"[i]f it does not describe the person, place, or thing to be searched or the property, article, material, substance, or person to be seized with sufficient certainty.\" Section 542.276.10(5), RSMo Supp. 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The circuit court concluded the warrant was invalid and suppressed all evidence seized because the warrant lacked probable cause and particularity in that Detective Estes intentionally checked the corpse clause of the search warrant form he prepared for the judge even though he knew the facts in his affidavit did not establish probable cause that a corpse or deceased fetus would be found. The state concedes there was no probable cause to search for and seize a deceased fetus, corpse, or part thereof. Nevertheless, it asserts the circuit court erred by suppressing all evidence seized because the invalid portion of the warrant-the corpse clause-could be redacted pursuant to the \"severance doctrine\" and all items were seized under the valid portions of the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Generally, \"all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is ... inadmissible in state court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But such argument has no relevance under the severance doctrine. Rather, it is just the opposite. The severance doctrine-which, again, the state requested be applied-rejects any notion that the extent of the actual search or the number of items seized somehow remedies otherwise invalid portions of a warrant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724030\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/463/1148/#p1154\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724030\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/463/1148/#p1154\">\n    at 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It concludes checking the corpse clause created merely the potential for a Fourth Amendment violation and the Supreme Court has \"never held that potential, as opposed to actual, invasions of privacy constitute searches for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And although that search was made pursuant to a warrant, by the state's own admission, that warrant violated the Fourth Amendment because at least one provision was not supported by probable cause. It follows that the question in this case is not whether a Fourth Amendment violation occurred-it did. Rather, the issue is what is the appropriate remedy for that Fourth Amendment violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The dissenting opinion reasons total suppression is inappropriate because the corpse clause was the only invalid portion of the warrant and could be redacted pursuant to the severance doctrine. In reaching its conclusion, the dissenting opinion divides the warrant into five categories, one of which is the corpse clause, and reasons the other four checked categories do not violate the particularity requirement because the warrant form tracked the language in section 542.271 and the sentence preceding the categories expressly referenced the application for the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   First, the sentence in the search warrant preceding the list of broad, generic categories states: \"Based on information provided in a verified application/affidavit.\" That statement merely notes the judge has considered the information in the application/affidavit. It does not incorporate the application/affidavit or say it is attached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Next, the language of the broad, generic categories does not merely \"track\" the language in section 542.271 ; it essentially repeats it verbatim. Such categories can hardly be said to be sufficiently particularized to the search and seizure at hand when they simply mirror the language of a statute intended to enumerate the broad, generic categories for which a search warrant may be issued. While the dissenting opinion states invalidating these categories would call into question the constitutional validity of section 542.271, it does nothing of the sort. It is merely a recognition that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, such broad, generic categories without\n   specification as to the crime or items to be seized do not satisfy the particularity requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Furthermore, to the extent the dissenting opinion relies on the search warrant application to cure the lack of the particularity, it overlooks an important detail. As the Supreme Court explains, most courts have held a warrant may be construed \"with reference to a supporting application or affidavit if the warrant uses appropriate words of incorporation,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   if the supporting documentation accompanies the warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Groh v.

The statement in\n    <em>\n     Groh\n    </em>\n    , therefore, simply sets forth the general principle that the items to be seized must be set forward in the warrant with particularity or at least by incorporation and accompaniment of the affidavit or application. The dissenting opinion further relies on\n    <em>\n     Bartholomew v.
