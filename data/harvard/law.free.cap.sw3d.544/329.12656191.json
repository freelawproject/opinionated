Gray raises a single claim on appeal; he argues that the trial court plainly erred in failing to\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   intervene in closing argument to prevent the State from personally attacking defense counsel. But because the State's arguments, which addressed Victim's credibility in the face of defense counsel's aggressive tactics, were permissible, the trial court committed no error, plain or otherwise, and we affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
