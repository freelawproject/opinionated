The trial court's order expressly states the motion was denied because the hearing on the motion was untimely. We affirm the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   ATW Investments, Inc. filed the underlying lawsuit against Kenneth E. Grubbs alleging claims for attorney malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act. On January 17, 2017, Grubbs filed and served on ATW a motion to dismiss pursuant to the TCPA. Although a hearing was initially set on the motion for March 16, 2017, the hearing was reset several times until a fourth amended fiat set the hearing for July 19, 2017. On July 17, 2017, ATW filed a response to Grubbs's motion asserting the motion should be denied because Grubbs did not obtain a timely hearing on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the hearing on the motion, the trial court heard the parties' arguments regarding the timing of the hearing and allowed the parties to file additional briefing. After reviewing the additional briefing, the trial court signed an order denying Grubbs's motion because the hearing was untimely. Grubbs appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    TCPA PROCEDURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[T]he Texas Citizens Participation Act or TCPA protects citizens from retaliatory lawsuits that seek to intimidate or silence them on matters of public concern.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Lipsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6872091\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/579/#p586\">\n    460 S.W.3d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 586 (Tex. 2015).

While there is no express consequence for the failure to timely set and hold a hearing, the statute provides that \"in no event shall the hearing occur more than 90 days after the service of the motion\" absent court-ordered discovery that did not occur in this case. The court has only thirty days after the hearing in which to rule, after which the motion is denied by operation of law and is appealable. If there were no consequence for failure to comply with these deadlines, the time limits would be meaningless and the goal of ensuring expeditious resolution would be thwarted. Meaningless deadlines for setting hearings, coupled with the automatic suspension of discovery while the motion remains pending, could invite gamesmanship aimed at avoiding discovery. Viewing the TCPA as a whole, we conclude that the hearing-setting deadline is mandatory and that failure to comply with it and a failure to show good cause for that noncompliance are a proper basis for denial of a motion to dismiss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In reaching its conclusion, the Austin court also noted that even if Morin had shown good cause for failing to timely set the hearing, the effect would be unclear \"because the hearing was not held within the ninety-day period that a good-cause extension warrants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2 n.3. Because \"the trial court did not make any finding regarding the fact that the hearing on the merits occurred more than ninety days after the motion was served,\" the Austin court did not further address the ninety-day procedural requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Braun v.

App.-Dallas Sept. 26, 2017, no pet.) (mem. op.), Molly Braun sought to appeal the \"denial\" of her motion to dismiss under the TCPA. The Dallas court first addressed whether it had jurisdiction to consider the appeal because \"[t]he trial court did not hold a hearing on Braun's motion to dismiss and did not expressly rule on the motion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204250235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Dallas court first noted, \"A defendant seeking the TCPA's protections must comply with the requirements of timely moving for dismissal and obtaining a hearing on the motion for dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204250235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"If the defendant complies with these requirements and the trial court denies the motion to dismiss, the defendant may bring an immediate appeal of the order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204250235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, if the defendant complies with the requirements but the trial court fails to rule on the motion to dismiss within thirty days after the hearing, the motion is denied by operation of law, and the defendant again has the right to an immediate appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204250235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Braun\n   </em>\n   , however, the motion to dismiss was not set for hearing until almost two months after the deadline for holding the hearing, and the trial court never expressly ruled on the motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. In response to the Dallas court's jurisdictional concern, Braun acknowledged the court lacked jurisdiction under a literal construction of the statute; however, Braun asserted a literal interpretation would have an absurd result and asked the court to \"read a provision into the statute that the motion is denied by operation of law if the trial court does not hold a hearing within the required time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Dallas court disagreed that the trial court's failure to hold a hearing on the motion which bars the trial\n   court from ruling on the motion is an absurd result, reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The statute requires a defendant seeking its protections to move for dismissal and obtain a hearing on the motion within certain clearly defined periods. The failure to meet these requirements results in the defendant forfeiting the statute's protections. This result is consistent with the TCPA's second purpose, to \"protect the rights of a person to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.\" If the defendant fails in its responsibility to obtain a timely hearing on the motion to dismiss, then the case can proceed to trial on the plaintiff's claims without the delay of an interlocutory appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3 (internal citations omitted). The Dallas court concluded that a movant's failure to meet the statutory burden of obtaining a timely hearing on its motion should result \"in the movant forfeiting the TCPA's protections, and the case should continue as if the motion to dismiss was never filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Similar to the argument made in\n   <em>\n    Braun\n   </em>\n   , Grubbs also argues a literal interpretation of the statute would lead to an absurd result because the hearing was postponed in this case to allow the parties to mediate. We disagree. Requiring a defendant seeking to invoke the protections of the TCPA to be mindful of the statutory deadlines established by the legislature in making decisions to postpone a hearing on the defendant's motion to dismiss is not absurd. As the Dallas court noted, the legislature enacted the procedural requirements to further the second stated purpose of the statute, namely to \"protect the rights of a person to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury.\" TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Grubbs further argues that penalizing him for the untimeliness of the hearing violates the parties' freedom to contract because ATW agreed to the resets. The record, however, contains no agreement by ATW referring to the 90-day deadline or agreeing to extend that deadline.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spectrum Healthcare Res., Inc. v. McDaniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324085\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/306/249/#p254\">\n    306 S.W.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 254 (Tex. 2010) (holding \"when parties use an agreed order to extend the section 74.351 threshold expert report deadline, the order must explicitly indicate the parties' intention to extend the deadline and reference that specific deadline;\" [o]therwise, the agreed order is ineffective to extend the section 74.351 deadline\"). More importantly, however, the statute itself expressly restricts agreements in this context, allowing parties to agree to set a hearing for a date later than the 60th day after the motion is served but precluding a hearing from occurring more than 90 days after the motion is served.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7324085\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/306/249/#p254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 27.004(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, Grubbs argues ATW waived the requirement that the hearing occur within 90 days by failing to object. This argument, however, ignores that Grubbs had the burden to timely obtain a hearing in his efforts to invoke the TCPA's protections. It was not incumbent on ATW to ensure that Grubbs met his burden or even to inform the trial court of Grubbs's failure. Instead, Grubbs's \"failure to meet [the procedural] requirements result[ed] in [his] forfeiting the statute's protections.\"\n   <em>\n    Braun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204250235\">\n    2017 WL 4250235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ;\n   <em>\n    see also Dal.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morning News, Inc. v.
