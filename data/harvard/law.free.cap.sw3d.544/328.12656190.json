Singleton raises a single claim on appeal; he argues that the trial court erred in admitting, at trial, a written statement he made to law enforcement that the trial court previously ruled inadmissible, at a suppression hearing, due to a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   violation. Because Singleton fails to demonstrate either error or prejudice, we affirm. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
