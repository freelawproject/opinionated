Appellant was sentenced as a prior and persistent offender, pursuant to Section 558.016, to two 15-year sentences for the counts of unlawful possession of a firearm, which were to run consecutively. Appellant also received a one-year sentence for the assault of a law enforcement officer, which was to run concurrent with the other sentences for a total sentence of 30 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment is affirmed pursuant to Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
