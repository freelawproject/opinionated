The only issue before us is whether the trial court erred in admitting the pistol as evidence in the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">On November 18, 1980, at 8:41 p.m., uniformed officer Phillip Sunada (Sunada) of the Honolulu Police Department was dispatched to a fight reported at 1134 Gulick Avenue, Honolulu. Sunada had been a police officer for over thirteen years. Arriving at the scene three minutes later, he observed that Police Officer Kim (Kim) was already there on the unimproved sidewalk fronting the address talking to a man with a \u201cbloody face.\u201d No fight was in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Sunada looked beyond Kim and the man with the \u201cbloody face\u201d toward the rear end of a covered garage. He saw five or six men cleaning up the area. One of them had a broom and was sweeping up broken glass and debris. He noticed two men, apart from this group, standing with their backs to the road. One of them, who turned out to be appellant, kept looking over his right shoulder in Sunada\u2019s and Kim\u2019s direction and appeared to be either \u201ctrying to stuff something down\u201d or trying \u201cto get something out from the waist band of his pants.\u201d Sunada \u201chad an idea it was possibly a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Cautiously but quickly, Sunada approached appellant. Appellant\u2019s hand was moving about in the area of his waist band. Sunada grabbed appellant\u2019s right arm, pulled it away from the waist band, and with his other hand touched appellant\u2019s waistline area. He felt a hard object and pulled appellant\u2019s pants away from his body. A semi-automatic pistol fell through appellant\u2019s right pants leg to the concrete floor of the garage. Sunada then arrested appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Appellant contends that the search of his person and seizure of the pistol was illegal and that the use of the pistol as evidence should have been suppressed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">In ruling on the validity of the search and seizure, we have reviewed the testimony presented at both the pretrial hearing on the motion to suppress and the bench trial. \u201cIn determining whether a trial court erred in admitting evidence claimed to have been illegally seized, an appellate court will usually not limit itself to the testimony received on the pretrial motion to suppress, but will also consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>pertinent testimony given at trial.\u201d 3 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Criminal </em>2d \u00a7 678, at 805 (1982). <em>See also Carroll v. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132 (1925); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>527 F.2d 692 (10th Cir. 1975). <em>Cf. State v. Crowder, </em>1 Haw. App. 60, 613 P.2d 909 (1980) (review of validity of arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The fundamental laws of our nation and state<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> decree that a person is entitled to be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion. However, in the interest of crime prevention and detection, <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 22 (1968), sanctions the investigative detention of a person by a police officer \u201cin appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner\u201d even absent a probable cause for arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In the application of the <em>Terry </em>doctrine, our supreme court has developed certain guidelines. In <em>State v. Madamba, </em>62 Haw. 453, 617 P.2d 76 (1980), the court stated that an investigative detention which does not measure up to an arrest based on probable cause consists of two aspects. The court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">The first aspect is the stop itself. In the general interest of effective crime prevention and law enforcement, \u201ca police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 22 (1968); <em>State v. Barnes; supra, </em>[58 Haw.] at 337, 568 P.2d at 1211. Where, therefore, an officer is in possession of information, the reliability of which has been sufficiently established, or where he can point to specific and articulable facts which would warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that criminal activity involving the suspect is afoot, the police is authorized to make a temporary investigative stop, [citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">The second aspect of the investigative stop, however, involves the right of the officer to further intrude upon the liberty of the person detained. In the case of the temporary detention of an individual, this intrusion ordinarily consists of a patdown of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>person. In an automobile stop, it usually takes the form of an order directing the occupant to step out of his vehicle followed by a frisk of his person. The authority of the officer in these situations is strictly circumscribed and is permissible only where such action is required for the protection of the officer and others nearby, <em>Terry v. Ohio, supra, </em>and \u201cfrom the specific conduct of the defendant, or from reliable information, or from the attendant circumstances, the officer may reasonably infer that the person stopped is armed and presently dangerous.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, supra, </em>at 338, 568 P.2d at 1212.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 456-57, 617 P.2d at 78-79. <em>See also State v. Bennett, </em>62 Haw. 59, 610 P.2d 502 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">What facts are \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201carticulable\u201d so as to justify an investigative stop cannot be explicitly defined. The cases indicate \u201cthe totality of the circumstances \u2014 the whole picture \u2014 must be taken into account.\u201d <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417 (1981); <em>State v. Goudy, </em>52 Haw. 497, 479 P.2d 800 (1971). The assessment of the \u201cwhole picture\u201d must, first, \u201cbe based upon all of the circumstances\u201d and, second, \u201cmust raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing.\u201d Such assessment process \u201cdoes not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities.\u201d All of the evidence constituting the \u201cwhole picture\u201d must be \u201cweighed not in terms of library -analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.\u201d <em>United States v. Cortez, supra, </em>at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Applying these standards and assessing the totality of the circumstances in the case before us, we are convinced that the stop and frisk of appellant was proper. Sunada was informed over the police radio that there was a fight at the designated address. Arriving at the scene, he saw Kim talking to a man with a bloody face and broken glass being swept up. He observed appellant looking over his right shoulder and trying either to stuff something down or pull something out from the waistband of his pants. He thought the \u201csomething\u201d was a weapon. Under the circumstances, it was reasonable for the officer, who had been on the police force for over thirteen years, to infer that the people present, including appellant, had been involved in a fight, that someone had gotten hurt in the fight, that weapons may have been used, that appellant\u2019s behavior and movements were suspicious, that appellant was concealing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>drawing out a weapon, and that he should disarm appellant to protect himself and Kim. The totality of the circumstances justified the officer\u2019s actions. In <em>Terry, supra, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AUN\"><em>Walter K. Horie (Jonathan J. Ezer </em>on briefs), Deputy Public Defender, for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A24\"><em>ArthurE. Ross, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, City and County of Honolulu, for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">When an officer is justified in believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others, it would appear to be clearly unreasonable to deny the officer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether the person is in fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the threat of physical harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">392 U.S. at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Appellant argues that a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d procedure consists of two aspects \u2014 the temporary investigative stop and the search for weapons. <em>State v. Madamba, supra. </em>The search aspect is \u201cgenerally limited to a patting down of the detainee\u2019s outer clothing.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>58 Haw. 333, 339, 568 P.2d 1207, 1212 (1977). Appellant complains that Sunada should have patted him down first instead of sticking his fingers in his pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Here, Sunada personally saw appellant trying to either stuff in or pull out what the officer believed to be a weapon from his pants. Under the circumstances, the officer\u2019s almost simultaneous action of grabbing appellant\u2019s right arm and with his other hand touching appellant\u2019s waistline area, then sticking his fingers in appellant\u2019s pants to pull his pants away from his body after feeling a hard object was not unreasonable. Sunada should not be denied the opportunity to protect himself and Kim from attack by a person suspected of carrying a weapon. <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143 (1972). Further, the officer was not required to await the \u201cglint of steel\u201d to protect his safety. <em>See People v. Foster, </em>83 A.D.2d 282, 443 N.Y.S.2d 835 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Appellant claims that the recent case of <em>State v. Faalafua, </em>64 Haw. 376, 641 P.2d 979 (1982) is dispositive of this case. We disagree. In <em>Faalafua, </em>the police officer relied on an alleged prostitute\u2019s secondhand information which he failed to verify. Here, firsthand personal observation of the police officer was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-11\"> Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress was heard and decided by Circuit judge Wendell K. Huddy on May 1, 1981. Appellant was convicted after a bench trial before Circuit Judge Philip T. Chun on May 14, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\"> <em>See </em>U.S. CONST. amend. IV and HAWAII CONST. art. 1, \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
