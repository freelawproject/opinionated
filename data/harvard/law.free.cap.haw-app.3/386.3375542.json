The investigating officer Olsten noted that defendant\u2019s face was flushed, his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, he had trouble maintaining his balance, had a strong odor of liquor on his breath, and his answers to Olsten\u2019s questions were confused. Olsten administered the field test for initial detection of drivers under the influence of intoxicating liquor and, when defendant failed all phases of the test, Olsten arrested him for drunk driving. When defendant was placed in Olsten\u2019s police vehicle, he began to make spontaneous statements. Olsten stopped him and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Later, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>either in the police vehicle or at the station, Olsten informed defendant that he would have to take either a breathalyzer test or a blood test to determine the alcohol content of his blood, and if he refused to be tested his driver\u2019s license would be revoked for six months after a hearing before a magistrate. Defendant refused to take either test. As required by the statute, Olsten submitted an affidavit to the court setting forth the events and a hearing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was held in the district court on May 7, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">At the hearing, Olsten testified that defendant\u2019s answers to Olsten\u2019s questions at the scene of the arrest indicated confusion or a refusal to cooperate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also testified that whenever he asked defendant which test he wished to take, defendant would ask him his advice as to which test to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">After the State rested, defendant moved to dismiss because the evidence indicated he was confused. He argued that the case of <em>State v. Severino, </em>56 Haw. 378, 537 P.2d 1187 (1975) was applicable and required a dismissal. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Defendant then testified that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>once at the scene of the accident. Thereafter, the only discussion between the defendant and Olsten related to the implied-consent law. When asked which test he would like to take, defendant would ask Olsten to tell him which test he should take. This occurred several times. Defendant testified that he was confused as to which test to take or whether he should refuse to take any test at all or talk to someone first, in view of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings that had been given to him. There was no evidence that defendant asked to consult an attorney before deciding.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The court found that defendant had not been confused by the fact that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given before he was informed about the implied-consent law provisions; that there was sufficient time lapse between the time the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given and the advice regarding the implied-consent law so that the former did not cause any confusion; that Olsten\u2019s testimony was far more credible than defendant\u2019s, and defendant was not confused as to his rights under <em>Miranda </em>\u201cversus\u201d his rights under the implied-consent law; and that if there had been confusion, defendant would have mentioned it at the time. The order revoking defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was subsequently entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether Olsten was required to affirmatively inform defendant that his constitutional rights under <em>Miranda </em>were not applicable to the chemical test requirements of the implied-consent statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Defendant argues that <em>Severino, supra, </em>establishes that a police officer who has advised a person under arrest for drunk driving of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>and then advises the driver of his rights under the implied-consent law must affirmatively advise the person arrested that the <em>Miranda </em>advice does not apply to his decision to take or not to take a chemical test.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\"><em>Severino </em>does not so hold. In <em>Severino </em>the facts show that the defendant was <em>contemporaneously </em>advised of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>and the requirements and sanctions of the implied-consent law. The defendant refused to answer any questions or take any tests <em>until he had been afforded an opportunity to talk to his lawyer. Severino, </em>56 Haw. at 380, 537 P.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">In <em>Severino, </em>our supreme court cites <em>State Department of Highways v. Beckey, </em>291 Minn. 483, 192 N.W.2d 441 (1971), which is also relied on by defendant in support of his argument. The Minnesota court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>said, in <em>Beckey:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">Where the <em>interrogating </em>officer undertakes to <em>repeat Miranda </em>warnings given by the <em>arresting </em>officer at the time of the arrest as well as to inform the person arrested of his rights and obligations under the implied-consent statute without at the same time making clear that his constitutional rights to counsel and to remain silent do not apply to the implied-consent statute, it is not unlikely that confusion will occur, resulting in the arrested person\u2019s being misled into believing that he may remain silent and that he is being offered the option to postpone his decision and the chemical test until he can consult an attorney. <em>Where the responses of the arrested person upon being requested to submit to a chemical test indicate that he is asserting a right which he has just been told he isfree to assert, it is incumbent upon the officer to make clear that he has no constitutional right to consult an attorney before deciding whether he will submit to a test but merely that, at the time the request is made, he has a right to choose between permitting the test or refusing the test at the risk of revocation of his driver\u2019s license. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">291 Minn, at 487, 192 N.W.2d at 445. Both <em>Severino </em>and <em>Beckey </em>are factually distinguishable from the case at bar.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\"><em>Severino </em>further holds that the burden is upon the defendant to show that he was in fact confused. 56 Haw. at 382, 537 P.2d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\"><em>Severino </em>holds only that, where a person arrested for drunk driving indicates by his responses that he is relying on his <em>Miranda </em>rights in refusing to submit to a chemical test for his blood alcohol content, the arresting officer is required to advise him that he has no constitutional right to counsel before deciding on whether he will submit, and the arrested person has the burden of showing that he was in fact confused by the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Actions taken under the implied-consent law are civil in nature. <em>Severino, </em>56 Haw. at 380, 537 P.2d at 1189. The question of confusion on the part of the person arrested involves determinations of fact and a trial judge\u2019s findings on those facts will not be overturned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>on appeal unless clearly erroneous.
