Defendants City and County of Honolulu (the City) and Erasmo Fiesta (Fiesta) appeal from the judgment in favor of plaintiff Leon Vieau based on a special jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The basic issue is whether the answers given by the jury on a special verdict form were inconsistent and conflicting and, therefore, warranted a new trial or remittitur. We answer no, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">On April 30, 1977, plaintiff accompanied his friend, Vernon Correa, on the latter\u2019s pickup truck to a landfill maintained by the City and known as the Kailua dump. At the dump, plaintiff helped Correa unload rubbish from the truck. While standing on the ground toward the rear of the truck, plaintiff was struck by a bulldozer owned by the City and operated by Fiesta, its employee. Plaintiff sustained injuries which resulted in the amputation of his left leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">On May 16, 1978, plaintiff filed suit against defendants. Defendants\u2019 answer alleged that plaintiff was contributorily negligent. Trial commenced on October 30, 1979. On November 8, 1979, the jury rendered its verdict on a special verdict form entitled \u201cVerdict Upon Special Interrogatories\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">1. Was Defendant City and County of Honolulu and/or Erasmo Fiesta negligent in the incident involving Leon Vieau on April 30, 1977?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">Yes_X_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">No_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-12\">If your answer to (1) is \u201cyes\u201d, answer (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-13\">2.

Otherwise, go on to question (6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-15\">6. What are the amounts of damages sustained by Plaintiff Leon Vieau as a result of the incident on April 30, 1977?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-16\">General damages $100,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-17\">Special damages $168,300.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-18\">Based on the verdict, judgment of $268,300 was entered in,favor of plaintiff on November 19, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-19\">On November 16,1979, defendants filed a motion entitled \u201cMotion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict or in the Alternative for Remittitur.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a hearing, the court entered its order denying defendants\u2019 motion. Defendants\u2019 appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-21\">Initially, we address the procedural problems involved in the case. The problems arose because defendants failed to move for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence. Both Rules 50(b) and 59, Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (1980) (HRCP), are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"AH5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Rule 50(b), HRCP, provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">Not later than 10 days after entry of judgment, <em>a party who has moved for a directed verdict </em>may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with his motion for a directed verdict.... [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Under Rule 50(b), HRCP, a timely motion for a directed verdict is a prerequisite to a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>Stahl v. Balsara, </em>60 Haw. 144, 587 P.2d 1210 (1978); <em>State v. Midkiff </em>55 Haw. 190, 516 P.2d 1250 (1973). Nothaving moved for a directed verdict after the close of the evidence, defendants were precluded from moving for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">However, defendants argue that the title to their motion was a misnomer and that the motion really was made pursuant to Rule 59, HRCP.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During oral argument, counsel for defendants stated that defendants\u2019 motion was based on Rule 59(a) (for new trial)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on Rule 59(e) (to alter or amend judgment),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in the alternative for remittitur under Rule 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We construe defendants\u2019 motion as asserting that the jury\u2019s finding that plaintiffs negligence was not the proximate cause of the accident was clearly against the weight of the evidence; that his negligence was responsible for 17% of the total damages of $268,300; and that, therefore, the judgment was excessive by 17% or $45,611. Defendants sought to have the judgment altered or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>amended, or in the alternative, to have the court order a remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">A Rule 59(a), HRCP, motion is an appropriate vehicle to challenge the size of a jury verdict. <em>See </em>11 Wright and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Civil </em>\u00a7 2807 (1973). If the trial court concludes that the verdict is excessive, it may order a new trial or a remittitur. The plaintiff then has the option of accepting the reduced amount of damages or proceeding to a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2815. However, under a Rule 59(e) motion, we doubt whether a trial court has the authority to alter or amend a judgment by reducing the amount of damages awarded by a jury, for this may defeat plaintiffs right to trial by jury. <em>See </em>6A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 59.12[1] (2d ed. 1982). <em>Cf. Davis v. Naviera Aznar S.A., </em>37 F.R.D. 223 (D. Md. 1965) (Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure did not authorize what amounted to an additur of the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Since defendants\u2019 motion was made \u201c[p]ursuant to Rule 59,\u201d we consider it to be a Rule 59(a) motion for a new trial or, in the alternative, for remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Plaintiff contends that defendants\u2019 motion in effect sought a review of the evidence as to whether plaintiffs negligence was a proximate cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Citing <em>Sheraton Hawaii Corp. v. Poston, </em>51 Haw. 142, 454 P.2d 369 (1969), plaintiff argues that, since defendants did not make a motion for directed verdict, the sufficiency of evidence on the question of proximate causation is not reviewable by this court. In <em>Sheraton Hawaii Corp., supra, </em>our supreme court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\"><em>In Pooler v. Stewarts\u2019 Pharmacies, Ltd., </em>42 Haw. 618, 620 (1958), this court warned that the sufficiency of evidence is not reviewable on appeal unless a motion for a directed verdict pursuant to Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 50(a) is made in the trial court. The reason given is that \u201c[t]he party who makes no motion for a directed verdict must be of the view that the evidence makes a case for the jury and should not be permitted to impute error to the court for sharing that view.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 148, 454 P.2d at 373. <em>See also Pooler v. Stewarts\u2019 Pharmacies, Ltd., </em>42 Haw. 618 (1958), and <em>cf., Jacobson v. Yoon, </em>41 Haw. 181 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"AZKZ\">However, in <em>Petersen v. City &amp; County, </em>53 Haw. 440, 496 P.2d 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>(1972), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">Since the motions for a directed verdict and for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence raise different issues, a party\u2019s failure to move for a directed verdict cannot be deemed a waiver of the right to appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 441, 496 P.2d at 6 (citations omitted). Further, the court distinguished <em>Pooler v. Stewarts\u2019 Pharmacies, Ltd., supra, </em>and <em>Sheraton Hawaii Corp. v. Poston, supra, </em>by stating that those cases merely held that an appellate court \u201cwould not enter a judgment in favor of a party who had not moved for a directed verdict.\u201d A failure to move for a directed verdict \u201ccannot be considered a waiver of the right to request a new trial.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Petersen v. City &amp; County, </em>53 Haw. at 442, 496 P.2d at 6, n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In light of <em>Petersen, supra, </em>we hold that despite the lack of a motion for a directed verdict, the denial of defendants\u2019 Rule 59(a) motion for new trial is reviewable by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Defendants make a two-pronged argument. First, defendants assert that the jury\u2019s answers to Questions 4 and 5 in the special verdict form were inconsistent because its finding of plaintiffs negligence in Question 3 could not simultaneously be a part of the \u201ccombined negligence\u201d as found in Question 5 and not be a proximate cause of the accident in Question 4, that the inconsistency was irreconcilable, and that the trial court erred in not granting a new trial. Second, defendants claim that the jury misunderstood what \u201cproximate cause\u201d meant, and since plaintiffs negligence was found to be a part of the \u201ccombined negligence\u201d in Question 5, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>court should have substituted an affirmative answer for the negative answer in Question 4 and ordered a new trial or remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Plaintiff also presents a two-pronged argument. First, plaintiff contends that in answering Question 5, the jury disregarded the instruction appearing on the special verdict form preceding Question 5 and the jury instruction, <em>infra, </em>given by the court. Thus, the trial court properly ignored the answer to Question 5 as surplusage. Second, citing <em>Little Rock Furniture Mfg. Co. v. Dunn, </em>148 Tex. 197, 222 S.W.2d 985 (1949), plaintiff argues that since Question 5 relates to \u201ccombined negligence\u201d and not contributory negligence, the conflict in the answers to Questions 4 and 5 is not fatal because plaintiffs negligence neither contributed to nor proximately caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">We agree with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">A conflict in the answers to questions in a special jury verdict form does not automatically warrant a new trial. A new trial will be ordered only if the conflict is irreconcilable. <em>Boudreau v. General Electric Co., </em>2 Haw. App. 10, 625 P.2d 384 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>63 Haw. 675 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The conflict caused by the jury\u2019s answers to Questions 4 and 5 was not due to lack of instructions. The special verdict form explicitly stated that Question 5 was to be answered only if the answers to Questions 2 and 4 were \u201cyes.\u201d If not, the jury was to go on to Question 6. Further, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0V\">The jury must determine whether any of the parties in this case was negligent and whether such negligence on part of the party was a proximate cause of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">In the event that you find that both Defendant and Plaintiff were negligent, <em>and that the negligence of each was a proximate cause of the accident, </em>you must determine the degree to which the negligence of each party contributed to the accident in terms of percentages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Transcript, Vol. 5 at 599 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">During its deliberation, the jury asked the court for the meaning of the words \u201cproximate\u201d and negligence.\u201d The court reread the instructions relating to the definitions of those words. <em>See </em>Transcript, Vol. 5 at 619-20. There could have been no confusion as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>what \u201cproximate cause\u201d meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The instructions were adequate and unambiguous. In answering Question 5, the jury disregarded those instructions. Under the circumstances, the trial court could have treated the answer to Question 5 as surplusage and ignored it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The application of the test developed by the Texas judiciary resolves the conflict between the answers to Questions 4 and 5 in favor of plaintiff. In <em>Little Rock Furniture, supra, </em>a personal injury case, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">[T]he court must consider each of the answers claimed to be in conflict, disregarding the alleged conflicting answer but taking into consideration all of the rest of the verdict, and if, so considered, one of the answers would require a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and the other would require a judgment in favor of the defendant, then the answers are fatally in conflict. It is essential that the party seeking to set aside a verdict on the ground of conflict must be able to point out that one of the conflicting answers of the jury, in connection with the rest of the verdict except the issue with which it conflicts, necessarily requires the entry of a judgment different from that which the court has entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">222 S.W.2d at 991. See <em>also Varela v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>550 S.W.2d 357 (Tex. Civ. App. <em>1977); Bender v. Southern Pac. Transp. Co., </em>600 S.W.2d 257 (Tex. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Here, defendants were the parties challenging the verdict. Unlike <em>Little Rock Furniture </em>where the question concerning proximate causation was left unanswered, in this case the jury answered \u201cno\u201d to whether plaintiffs negligence was a proximate cause of the accident. If the answer to Question 5 is ignored, we are left with a verdict finding that plaintiff was negligent, but that his negligence was not a proximate cause of the accident. If we ignore the answer to Question 4, we have a verdict holding that plaintiff was negligent and that 17 % of the \u201ccombined negligence\u201d was attributable to plaintiff. Question 5 did not refer to contributory negligence or proximate cause. Since ignoring the answers to either Question 4 or Question 5 will not lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>to a judgment contrary to that entered by the trial court, there is no fatal conflict. Defendants failed to satisfy the Texas test.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Defendants argue that <em>Orwick v. Belshan, </em>231 N.W.2d 90 (Minn. 1975), is a case on point and mandates a contrary result. <em>Orwick </em>was a personal injury action in which the six questions and answers on the special verdict form were very similar to those in the instant case. As in this case, in <em>Orwick </em>the jury found that plaintiffs negligence was not a proximate cause of his own injuries but, in the comparative negligence question, attributed a portion of the total causal negligence to plaintiff. The Minnesota Supreme Court held that the conflict should be resolved in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\"><em>Orwick </em>is distinguishable and inapposite. First, in <em>Orwick, </em>\u201cin neither the special verdict form .. . nor in the court\u2019s instructions was the jury told the conditions under which they were to answer the comparative negligence question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95. As discussed above, in this case, there were explicit instructions on the special verdict form preceding Question 5 and appropriate instructions to the jury by the court. Second, in <em>Orwick, </em>Question 5 read, \u201cAssuming the total negligence <em>which contributed to produce the plaintiffs injuries </em>to be 100%, then what percentage thereof do you attribute: ... (a) to defendant. . . (b) to plaintiff. . <em>.\"Id. </em>at 93, n.l (emphasis added). In the case at bar, Question 5 stated, \u201cAssuming that 100% represents the combined negligence . . . , what percentage of such combined negligence is attributable to each?\u201d In <em>Orwick, </em>the \u201ctotal negligence\u201d was modified by the words \u201ccontributed to produce the plaintiffs injuries.\u201d In this case, the general term \u201ccombined negligence\u201d was in no way connected to contribution to or proximate cause of the accident. Third, in <em>Orwick, </em>the court stated that the evidence established \u201cas a matter of law, that the plaintiffs negligence was a proximate cause of his own injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94. Our review of the evidence in the case indicates that the jury\u2019s special verdict as to proximate causation was not against the manifest weight of the evidence and not clearly erroneous. <em>See Petersen v. City </em>&amp; <em>County, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">We find no manifest abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 Rule 59, HRCP, motion. <em>Harkins v.
