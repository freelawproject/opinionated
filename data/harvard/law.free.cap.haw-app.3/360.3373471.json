Petitioners-appellants Delf\u00edn M. Ortiz, Jr. (Delf\u00edn) and Jocelyn Ortiz Will (Jocelyn) appeal that part of the August 11, 1980 judgment and order which held that respondentsappellees Dorothy Tam Moi Luke (Dorothy) and Gladys Tam Holt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(Gladys) acquired absolute title in Keamo\u2019s real property interests by adverse possession as against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the court\u2019s conclusion on adverse possession was erroneous. Our answer is yes, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Keamo married Kai Fook, also known as (aka) Tam Kai Fook, Ki Fook, Gai Fook, Tam Fook, Tam Ah Fook, Tam Gai Fook and Ah Fook Tam (Tam), on July 19, 1901. From this marriage, Dorothy was born on May 25, 1905, and Gladys, on February 18, 1908.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Shortly after the birth of Gladys, Keamo deserted Tam and began living with William Keamo (William). On September 22,1909, Keamo gave birth to Priscilla Tam, aka Priscilla Kuaiaina (Priscilla).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">On March 13, 1911, Tam filed for divorce from Keamo. The decree issued on August 2, 1911 granted Tam a divorce and gave him custody of Dorothy and Gladys. Neither the libel nor the decree of divorce mentioned Priscilla or a third child.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Keamo married William on August 21, 1911. Priscilla was given \u201chanai\u201d (meaning informal adoption) to Pilikila Kuaiaina, but Edith Gomes, aka Edith Machado, and Edith Cervantes (daughter of Pilikila Kuaiaina) took care of her primarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">Priscilla married Delf\u00edn Mathias Ortiz, Sr. (Ortiz) on July 29, 1927. Jocelyn was born to Priscilla on October 14, 1928, and Delf\u00edn, on October 29, 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">On July 11, 1931, Priscilla died. Ortiz died on October 16,1932. After their deaths, Jocelyn was raised (hanai) by Edith Cervantes. Delf\u00edn was raised by Leonilla Enabore.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">On December 29, 1941, William died. His estate was administered in probate court, and one-half of the net assets of his estate was distributed to Keamo.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">On April 17, 1947, Keamo died intestate. At the time of her death, Keamo owned undivided interests in real property as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-15\">TAX MAP KEY NO. AREA UNDIVIDED INTEREST</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axc\">2-1-04-25 5.0 acres 1/2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFu\">2-1-04-26 13.0 acres 18/98<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcLb\">2-1-04-32 43.37 acres 1/2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqL\">2-1-04-33 12.90 acres 18/96</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeT\">2-1-04-43 .20 acre 1/2</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>The foregoing real property interests are hereinafter referred to as the \u201cproperty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Reamo\u2019s estate was administered in a small estate proceeding (S.E. 54) in the Second Circuit Court, Territory of Hawaii. The order entered on July 27, 1949 (1949 Order) found and declared that Reamo\u2019s heirs were Dorothy and Gladys.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">On October 25, 1977, Delf\u00edn filed a petition for a decree determining and declaring the heirs of Reamo. The petition alleged that Delf\u00edn and Jocelyn were grandchildren of Reamo, and that the 1949 Order was in error. Jocelyn joined in the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">After a bench trial, the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law on October 11, 1979. The judgment and order was entered on August 11, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">We first confront appellees\u2019 claims on appeal (1) that the 1949 Order was res judicata, (2) that appellants failed to meet the burden of proof as to their title to the property, and (3) that the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the matter involving title to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">For the first time on appeal, appellees argue that the 1949 Order is res judicata as to appellants\u2019 claims in this action. Res judicata is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded in the court below. Rule 8(c), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (1980) (HRCP). Appellees having failed to do so, we will not consider this matter for the first time on appeal. <em>Exxon Corp. v. Texas Motor Exchange of Houston, </em>628 F.2d 500 (5th Cir. <em>1980); Santos v. Alaska Bar Ass\u2019n., </em>618 F.2d 575 (9th Cir. 1980) (failure to raise below is a waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">Appellees contend that appellants failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence their claim to one-third of the property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>This <em>contention </em>does not merit any consideration by us. Appellees failed to file a notice of appeal as required by Rule 73(a), HRCP (1980, as amended). <em>Orso v. City &amp; County, </em>56 Haw. 241, 534 P.2d 489 <em>(1975). But cf. In re Estate of Lorenzo, </em>61 Haw. 236, 239, 602 P.2d 521, 525 (1979) (a \u201csubsidiary question underlying the other issues raised by appellant\u201d may be considered); <em>Shoemaker v. Takai, 57 </em>Haw. 599, 607, 561 P.2d 1286, 1291 (1977) (\u201cno cross appeal is necessary in order that an appellate court may review a question closely related, in substance, to a question raised by the appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Again, for the first time on appeal, appellees argue that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction concerning title to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Ordinarily a judgment will not be reversed on a legal theory not raised in the court below'. An appellate court will deviate from this rule only when justice requires. <em>Earl M. Jorgensen Co. v. Mark Constr., Inc., </em>56 Haw. 466, 540 P.2d 978 (1975); <em>In re Taxes, Hawaiian Land Co., </em>53 Haw. 45, 487 P.2d 1070 (1971) <em>appeal dismissed, </em>405 U.S. 907 (1972), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>405 U.S. 1048 (1972); <em>Cabral v. McBryde Sugar Co., Ltd., </em>3 Haw. App. 223, 647 P.2d 1232 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">A court may properly render a judgment only if it has authority to adjudicate the type of controversy involved in the action. RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS \u00a7 11 (1982). And a judgment of a court without jurisdiction over the subject matter is suspect as to its validity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, justice compels us to address the issue of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Appellees argue that appellants\u2019 petition for determination and declaration of heirs invoked the jurisdiction of the court under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 603-21,7(a)( 1) (1976) ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that under \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>603-21.7(a)(l) the court had no authority to determine disputes involving real property claims; and that appellants should have filed an action under HRS \u00a7 669-1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">HRS \u00a7 603-21.5 (1976) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">The several circuit courts shall have jurisdiction, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, of: <em>% </em>sf:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">(3) Civil actions and proceedings, in addition to those listed in sections 603-21.6,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 603-21.7,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 603-21.8.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>[footnotes added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Our supreme court, in <em>Sherman v. Sawyer, </em>63 Haw. 55, 621 P.2d 346 (1980), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">The circuit courts are courts of general jurisdiction. <em>State v. Villados, </em>55 Haw. 394, 397, 520 P.2d 427, 430 (1974). We defined jurisdiction as \u201cthe power and authority on the part of the court to hear and judicially determine and dispose of the cause pending before it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 520 P.2d at 430. HRS \u00a7 603-21.5 gives the circuit court subject matter jurisdiction over civil actions and proceedings. Thus, the circuit court has jurisdiction over all civil causes of action unless precluded by the State Constitution or by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 621 P.2d at 348-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">HRS \u00a7 669-1 (c) confers on the circuit court jurisdiction over a quiet title action, the venue being in the circuit in which the property is located. An action to quiet title is a \u00a7 603-21.5 civil action or proceeding. We hold that under the broad statutory language of \u00a7 603-21.5, the court below had jurisdiction to adjudicate both a \u00a7 603-21.7(a)(1) determination and declaration of heirs matter and a \u00a7 669-1 quiet title claim. <em>See Sherman v. Sawyer, supra; McClung v. Fukushima, </em>53 Haw. 295, 492 P.2d 128 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">In reality, the alleged jurisdictional problem is of appellees\u2019 creation. No reasonable person commences an action for determination and declaration of heirs of a deceased as an academic exercise. Such action is generally commenced to determine heirship for the purpose of resolving ownership of real estate owned by a person dying intestate. Appellants did this by filing the petition on October 25, 1977. They sought to establish the fact that they were grandchildren of Keamo through Priscilla and thereby entitled to a one-third ownership of the property. During the course of the proceedings, appellees interjected the principle of adverse possession to divest appellants of their one-third share in the property. We cannot commiserate with their now complaining that the court below lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Appellants argue that the proceeding to quiet title is an <em>in per</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>sonam </em>action,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that Dorothy was never personally served in the case. The argument has no merit. The records clearly show that both Dorothy and Gladys jointly filed an answer in the case, were ably represented by counsel and prevailed on the adverse possession question.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Appellees and appellants were cotenants of the property. There was no dispute that appellees Dorothy and Gladys were daughters of Reamo. The trial court found that appellants Delf\u00edn and Jocelyn were the grandchildren of Reamo through Priscilla, Reamo\u2019s deceased daughter. By virtue of Section 12070, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in effect at the time of Reamo\u2019s death, Dorothy and Gladys, as owners of an undivided one-third interest each, and Delphin and Jocelyn, as owners of an undivided one-sixth interest each, were tenants in common of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\"><em>Since Nahinai v. Lai, </em>3 Haw. 317 (1871), it has been recognized in this jurisdiction that a cotenant may acquire title to the interest of his cotenant by adverse possession. <em>Yin v. Midkiff, </em>52 Haw. 537, 481 P.2d 109 (1971); <em>Kaahanui v. Kaohi, </em>24 Haw. 361 (1918). Our supreme court has held that \u201ca cotenant relying upon a claim of adverse possession has the burden to show the following essential requirements in order to acquire exclusive title as against the ones out of possession: (1) a clear intent to claim adversely; (2) adverse possession in fact; and (3) knowledge or notice of the hostile holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>brought home to the cotenant or cotenants out of possession.\u201d <em>Yin, supra, </em>52 Haw. at 540, 481 P.2d at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In a case involving adverse possession, the burden of proof is on the party claiming such possession. <em>Lai v. Kukahiko, </em>58 Haw. 362, 569 P.2d 352 (1977); <em>Smith v. Hamakua Mill Co., </em>15 Haw. 648 (1904). However, \u201cwhenever the parties to the action are cotenants and closely related by ties of blood, the burden of the cotenant claiming adversely is intensified.\u201d <em>Yin, supra, </em>52 Haw. at 540, 481 P.2d at 111-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Our supreme court has formulated a test as to the notice requirement applicable in the resolution of adverse possession claims between cotenants. In <em>City &amp; County of Honolulu v. Bennett, </em>57 Haw. 195, 552 P.2d 1380 (1976), it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">Following in the line of Fin and <em>Poka, </em>we lay down in this case the rule that, because of the general fiduciary relationship between cotenants, a tenant in common claiming by adverse possession must prove that he acted in <em>good faith </em>towards the cotenants during the statutory period. In most circumstances, this requirement of good faith will in turn mandate that the tenant claiming adversely must <em>actually notify </em>his cotenants that he is claiming against them. In the following exceptional circumstances, however, good faith is satisfied by less than actual notice: where the tenant in possession has <em>no reason to suspect </em>that a cotenancy exists; or where the tenant in possession makes a good <em>faith, reasonable effort to notify </em>the cotenants but is unable to locate them; or where the tenants out of possession already have <em>actual knowledge </em>that the tenant in possession is claiming adversely to their interests. In these limited circumstances, the notice requirement will be satisfied by constructive notice and \u201copen and notorious possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 209-210, 552 P.2d at 1390 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">In applying the <em>Bennett </em>test, we find that this case falls within the \u201climited circumstances\u201d category. Appellees had \u201cno reason to suspect\u201d that cotenants Delf\u00edn and Jocelyn existed, and the court so found.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Proceeding further with <em>the Bennett </em>test, we will assume that the 1949 Order was constructive notice to appellants and the world that appellees were claiming adversely. <em>Kalakaua v. Keaweamahi, 4 </em>Haw. 577 (1883). However, appellees failed to meet their burden of proving \u201copen and notorious possession\u201d for the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The evidence to support appellees\u2019 adverse possession claim is very skimpy. The only witness testifying on this matter was Gladys. Her testimony was that after the 1949 Order she \u201ctried to continue to get it [the property] rented\u201d; she \u201ctried to rent it out but there was confusion and trouble\u201d; she paid the real property taxes probably from 1950; she visited the property a total of three times since 1949; the property was leased to Ulupalakua Ranch, Inc. in August 1966; and it was still being leased to the same lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The documentary evidence consisted of (1) real property assessment notices for the property for 1977 addressed to Gladys and (2) the unrecorded Memorandum of Lease dated August 13, 1966 between Dorothy and Gladys, as lessors, and Ulupalakua Ranch, Inc., as lessee. The lease was for pasture purposes and the term was for \u201cone year from the date hereof and from year to year thereafter unless terminated by any of the parties hereto by thirty (30) days written notice.\u201d The stipulated rent was $120.00 per annum. The lessee was to pay all real property taxes. The lease demised all of the property, except Tax Map Key No. 2-1-04-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The evidence is insufficient to prove \u201copen and notorious possession\u201d by appellees prior to August 13,1966. \u201cIn disputes between cotenants, the presumption is that a cotenant in possession does not occupy the premises adversely to his cotenants but in common with them.\u201d <em>Redfearn v. Kuhia, </em>53 Haw. 378, 381, 494 P.2d 562, 564 (1972). \u201cThis presumption may be overcome only by conduct of one cotenant which constitutes an ouster or disseisin of the other cotenants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 494 P.2d at 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Appellees failed to overcome such presumption. Payment of real property taxes in itself does not establish adverse possession. It is one of the factors to be considered. <em>Okuna v. Nakahuna, </em>60 Haw. 650, 594 P.2d 128 (1979); <em>Lai v. Kukahiko, supra; Deponte v. Ulupalakua Ranch, </em>48 Haw. 17, 395 P.2d 273 (1964). Three visits to the property since 1949 by Gladys cannot constitute \u201copen and notorious\u201d or \u201ccontinuous\u201d possession. In <em>Okuna v. Nakahuna, supra, </em>our supreme court stated, \u201cInfrequent visits to the property to pick and gather fruits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>can hardly be said to constitute continuous possession or even possession at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656-57, 594 P.2d at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">At best, the evidence showed \u201copen and notorious possession\u201d by appellees commencing from August 13, 1966, the date of the Ulupalakua Ranch lease. The possession by their lessee inured to the benefit of appellees in their adverse possession claim. <em>Kainea v. Kreuger, </em>31 Haw. 108 (1929). According to Gladys, the lease was still in effect at the time of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Appellees were not in \u201copen and notorious possession\u201d of the property, however, for the statutory period of twenty years.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Their assertion of the adverse possession claim came within twenty years after the right first accrued on August 13, 1966.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The period of slightly more than eleven years was insufficient for appellees to perfect tide to the property by adverse possession against appellants. <em>Re Land Title, State of Hawaii, </em>49 Haw. 537, 425 P.2d 83 (1967), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>49 Haw. 575 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court was clearly erroneous in concluding that appellees acquired absolute fee title to the property by adverse possession against appellants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Reversed and remanded with direction that the findings of fact and conclusions of law entered on October 11, 1979 and the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>ment and order entered on August 11, 1980 be amended to be consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A8P\"><em>Michael J.
