A. Thompson and Son, Inc. and its insurance carrier Industrial Indemnity Co. (collectively Thompson), appeal from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>May 1, 1980 decision and order of the Labor and Industrial Relations Appeals Board (Board) which found that Thompson was a special employer of claimant Richard Danuser (Danuser) and was therefore required to pay Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits to Danuser. The only issue on appeal is whether the Board erred in that finding. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In 1973, Thompson was engaged, as a general contractor, in the construction of the Interstate Highway H-2 project between Kipapa Gulch and the Waiahole Ditch. The construction required soil to be moved from one area to another in order to level the ground. This was accomplished by use of a Catscraper.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Although Thompson owned several Catscrapers, it had to rent two Catscrapers, together with operators from Hi-Way Transportation and Contracting Co., Ltd. (Hi-Way) in order to complete the project within the contract period. Hi-Way was a construction contractor, but also rented out its equipment and operators. Thompson agreed to pay Hi-Way an hourly rate. Hi-Way maintained the equipment and paid the operators. The operator\u2019s hours, pay, vacations, lunch breaks, and other related matters were set by a union contract with Hi-Way. Thompson could not terminate the operators but did have the power to send an operator back and request another if the operator did not produce satisfactory results.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Hi-Way\u2019s operators were instructed to report to Thompson\u2019s job site beginning in March of 1973. Each day, they, along with Thompson\u2019s operators, received general instructions regarding their assignments. They were not instructed as to the basic operation of their Catscrapers. Danuser was one of those operators sent over from Hi-Way.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">In April of 1973 Danuser sustained a lower back injury while working on the Thompson project. He filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations. Hi-Way and Thompson disagreed as to who was liable for Danuser\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits. On June 21, 1978, the Director of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations issued a Decision and Order holding Thompson solely liable for the payments. Thompson appealed to the Board. On May 1, 1980, the Board issued its Decision and Order finding that Thompson was the special employer of Danuser and holding that Thompson was solely liable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Thompson\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied by the Board. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Thompson contends that the Board erred in finding that it was the special employer of Danuser and, hence, liable for all of the workers\u2019 compensation payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The Board\u2019s determination will not be overturned on appeal unless the record reveals it to be clearly erroneous, or arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. HRS \u00a7 91-14(g) (1976); <em>Yoshino v. Saga Food Service, </em>59 Haw. 139, 577 P.2d 787 (1978); De <em>Victoria v. H &amp; K Contractors, </em>56 Haw. 552, 545 P.2d 692 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Under the clearly erroneous standard, this court cannot set aside the findings of an administrative agency except where there is not substantial evidence in the record to support those findings or we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>DeFries v. Association of Owners, 999 Wilder, </em>57 Haw. 296, 555 P.2d 855 (1976); <em>De Victoria v. H &amp; K Contractors, supra. </em>A review of the record shows substantial evidence and has not left us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Neither do we find the board\u2019s determination to be arbitrary or capricious, <em>Hayes v. Yount, </em>87 Wash. 2d 280, 552 P.2d 1038 (1976); <em>Stempel v. Department of Water Resources, </em>82 Wash. 2d 109, 508 P.2d 166 (1973); <em>Petras v. Arizona State Liquor Board, </em>129 Ariz. 449, 631 P.2d 1107 (Ariz. App. 1981); <em>Dolan v. Rust, </em>195 Colo. 173, 576 P.2d 560 (1978), or an abuse of discretion, <em>Title Guaranty Escrow Services, Inc. v. Powley, </em>2 Haw. App. 265, 630 P.2d 642 (1981); <em>Hawaii Automotive Retail Gasoline Dealers Assn., Inc. v. Brodie, </em>2 Haw. App. 99, 626 P.2d 1173 (1981); <em>GLA Inc. v. Spengler, </em>1 Haw. App. 647, 623 P.2d 1283 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 386-1 (1976) defines employee for workers\u2019 compensation purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">\u201cEmployee\u201d means any individual in the employment of another person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">Where an employee is loaned or hired out to another person for the purpose of furthering the other person\u2019s trade, business, occupation, or profession, the employee shall, beginning with the time when the control of the employee is transferred to the other person and continuing until the control is returned to the original employer, be deemed to be the employee of the other person regardless of whether he is paid directly by the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>person or the original employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Under HRS \u00a7 386-1, a borrowed employee may be regarded as the employee of the borrowing employer for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation benefits notwithstanding the fact that the employee is paid by the original employer. <em>Yoshino, supra. </em>In determining whether a borrowing employer is a \u201cspecial employer\u201d of a \u201clent employee\u201d for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation, the principal determinant used is control of the employee. Under the control test, it must be shown that the employee was loaned or hired out to the borrowing employer for the purpose of furthering the borrowing employer\u2019s trade, business, occupation, or profession and control of the employee was transferred to the borrowing employer. <em>Id.; Harter v. County of Hawaii, </em>63 Haw. 374, 628 P.2d 629 (1981). Once these conditions are shown, the borrowing employer is considered a \u201cspecial employer\u201d of the \u201clent employee\u201d and becomes liable for his workers\u2019 compensation benefits if the employee is injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Thompson clearly qualifies as the special employer of Danuser. Danuser was hired out to Thompson for the purpose of furthering Thompson\u2019s trade or business. Thompson was in the business of constructing a roadway and Danuser\u2019s efforts furthered that business. Hi-Way, on the other hand, was also in the construction business and normally rented out its equipment only during breaks in its operation. Arguably, Hi-Way benefitted from Danuser\u2019s work. However, the fact that labor-loan situations involve a benefit to the original employers\u2019 interest does not preclude a finding that the borrowing employers are special employers. <em>Harter v. County of Hawaii, supra. </em>Danuser was injured while performing the same work as Thompson\u2019s equipment operators on Thompson\u2019s project and was directly furthering the trade or business of Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">It is also clear that Thompson controlled Danuser\u2019s work, as he was directly supervised by Thompson. Danuser reported daily to Thompson\u2019s supervisor for work instructions. The supervisor would inform him and all other Catscraper operators, including Thompson\u2019s own men, of the assignments for the day: where to pick up the dirt, where to dump it, and what routes to take. The assignments could be changed at any time and often were. Hi-Way provided no supervision over the operators lent to Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Thompson determined the days on which Danuser did or did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>not work for whatever reasons, including inclement weather. Neither Danuser nor Hi-Way had any part in those decisions although Danuser\u2019s pay was to a large degree determined by those decisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Additionally, if Thompson felt Danuser\u2019s work was inadequate, he could be sent back to Hi-Way and another operator requested.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AqO\"><em>John A. Roney (Stubenbjerg &amp; Roney </em>of counsel) for employer, insurance carrier-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AIq6\"><em>Jeffrey S. Portnoy (Kristin Brandsma </em>with him on the brief; <em>Cades, Schutte, Fleming </em>\u00a3s? <em>Wright </em>of counsel) for employer, insurance carrier-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Furthermore, the record indicates that Danuser knowingly consented to the establishment of the employment relationship with Thompson. <em>Harter v. Hawaii County, supra. </em>Danuser willingly went to work for Thompson, submitted himself to Thompson\u2019s supervision and considered Thompson his \u201cemployer\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Thompson contends that the control exercised over Danuser was not so extensive as to satisfy the transfer of control requirement of the rule. Thompson argues that the rule requires a showing of detailed control over Danuser\u2019s actual operational performance. However, the mere lack of direction of Danuser\u2019s operation of the equipment is not a determinative fact in the question of transfer of control. In situations such as this, deference to the professional skills of the loaned employee is to be expected. <em>See Harter v. County of Hawaii, supra. </em>Certainly Thompson exercised no less control over Danuser than over its own equipment operators. Furthermore, Thompson\u2019s right to refuse to use Danuser is the ultimate extension of control over his job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The assignment to Thompson was constant and for an extended period. This, as opposed to sporadic or short durational assignments, tends to support the finding of Thompson\u2019s control. <em>Kepa v. Hawaii Welding Co., Ltd., </em>56 Haw. 544, 545 P.2d 687 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The record contains substantial evidence that control over Danuser was transferred to Thompson at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-13\"> The record indicates that on some days when Thompson did not use him, he would report to Hi-Way\u2019s yard where, if any work was available, he might be employed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
