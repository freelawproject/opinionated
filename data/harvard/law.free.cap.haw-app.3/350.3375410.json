Anderson\u2019s arguments regarding the Statute Of Frauds and estoppel \u00e1re without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">On October 3,1978, Anderson, on behalf of her client, Marilynn Hinton (Hinton), submitted an offer to Oceanic to purchase a condominium unit on the standard real estate contract form De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>posit, Receipt, Offer and Acceptance (DROA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Anderson was a real estate sales agent and the owner of her own real estate company. The DROA was accompanied by Anderson\u2019s company\u2019s check for $1,000.00 as earnest money. Hinton had previously given her check to Anderson for the same amount payable to Anderson\u2019s company. This was deposited in the company\u2019s account to cover the deposit. The DROA required Hinton to make an additional $3,000.00 deposit within ten days of the opening of escrow. Also, it included a special condition that Hinton would obtain financing within fourteen working days of Oceanic\u2019s acceptance. The scheduled dosing date of the contract was November 16, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">On the same day of the offer, Sue Ann Worcester (Worcester), a real estate agent employed by A. Joel Criz &amp; Associates, Oceanic\u2019s broker, notified Anderson that Oceanic had accepted the offer. Escrow was opened at Title Guaranty Escrow Services, Inc. (Escrow), on or about October 24, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Hinton\u2019s accountant advised her that she would not be able to qualify for financing. Acting on that advice, Hinton, on or before October 24,1978, stopped payment on her $1,000.00 check. Thereafter, she failed to make the additional $3,000.00 deposit required under the DROA and did not obtain financing within the specified period.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">On or about November 7 or 8, 1978, Anderson learned that Hinton had stopped payment on the check and could not obtain financing. Anderson so informed Worcester on or about November 9,1978, and told Worcester that she was interested in purchasing the unit for herself. Worcester purportedly told Anderson that other purchasers for the unit were available and that by the time Anderson tendered a new offer, someone else would probably have purchased the unit. According to Anderson, Worcester suggested that Anderson \u201cjust have it [the contract] signed over from her [Hinton] to you.\u201d Also, according to Anderson, Worcester told her how to word the new document, to have Hinton sign it, and to inform Escrow of the arrangement. Shortly thereafter, Anderson talked to an employee of Escrow who confirmed that such arrangement was possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ble. She informed Escrow that a telegram and letter would follow. On or about November 11, 1978, Anderson gave an \u201cassignment\u201d letter to Hinton for her signature. Although Hinton apparently signed the letter, it was never received by Escrow.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 27, 1978, Escrow received a telegram stating: \u201cBe advised tide on Esplanade 18C shall be vested in Lilly Anderson. Marilynn Hinton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In the same conversation between Anderson and Worcester on November 9, 1978, Worcester informed Anderson that notwithstanding her attempt to obtain Hinton\u2019s rights under the contract the fact that closing was set for November 16 was a problem. According to Anderson, she told Worcester that since the contract allowed Oceanic\u2019s broker to extend the closing date for thirty days, Worcester could do so. Worcester told Anderson that in actuality Oceanic was not allowing extensions unless the buyer was willing to pay rent. Anderson agreed and Worcester said she would so inform Oceanic. However, Worcester never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">By letter dated November 15, 1978, Oceanic notified Anderson that because Hinton had failed to obtain financing within the 14 day period and the closing date was November 16, Oceanic considered the DROA null and void. The letter was mailed on November 16 and received by Anderson on November 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">After Anderson brought suit for specific performance, Oceanic moved for summary judgment. The court granted the motion after hearing on December 6, 1979. The court ruled that, at the time of the purported assignment, there was no contract in existence because Hinton had abandoned it. Additionally, the court ruled that an alleged new contract between Anderson and Oceanic for the purchase of the unit was unenforceable under the Statute Of Frauds, Hawaii Revised Statutes, Chapter 656 (1976, as amended). Summary judgment in favor of Oceanic was entered on December 27, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">On Monday, January 7, 1980, Anderson served on appellee a copy of a motion for reconsideration, citing Hawaii Rules of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Procedure (HRCP), Rule 59(e) (1972, as amended).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The motion was filed on January 21,1980, and an order denying said motion was entered on February 7,1980. Notice of Appeal was filed February 5, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">At the outset it is necessary to consider Oceanic\u2019s lack of jurisdiction argument. Oceanic contends that Anderson\u2019s Notice of Appeal was not timely filed, HRCP, Rule 73(a) (1972, as amended).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> HRCP, Rule 73(a) requires that a Notice of Appeal be filed within thirty (30) days of the judgment appealed from. However, a motion under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Rule 59(e) terminates that period and a new, full period for appeal begins to run from an order granting or denying such motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Oceanic argues, first, that service of the motion for reconsideration cannot be held effective, because when it was first served, an affidavit attached thereto was not signed or acknowledged. Second, Oceanic asserts that, even if that is considered effective service, the motion was not filed with the court within a reasonable time after service as required by Rule 5(d), HRCP (1972, as amended).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since the service was defective or the filing untimely, Oceanic argues, the motion did not terminate the running of time for filing the Notice of Appeal under HRCP, Rule 73(a), and the notice wras not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Before we address Oceanic\u2019s assertions, we note that, the HRCP do not specifically permit a motion for reconsideration of a court\u2019s decision, <em>Cuerva &amp; Associates v. Wong, </em>1 Haw. App. 194, 199 n.2, 616 P.2d 1017 (1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such motions have been treated by some courts as motions to alter or amend judgments pursuant to Rule 59(e), <em>Williams v. Bolger, </em>633 F.2d 410 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Smith v. Hudson, </em>600 F.2d 60 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>444 U.S. 986, 100 S.Ct. 495, 62 L.Ed.2d 415 (1979); <em>Wild v. St. Paul Companies, Inc., </em>612 F.2d 341 (8th Cir. 1979); because it is the substance of the pleadings that control, not its nomenclature. <em>Madden v. Madden, </em>43 Haw. 148 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Oceanic\u2019s first argument is without merit. Under HRCP, Rule 7(b)(1) (1972, as amended),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a motion is sufficient, with or without a valid affidavit, as long as \u201cthe motion is stated in a written notice of the hearing of the motion\u201d, the grounds for the motion are stated \u201cwith particularity\u201d, and the relief or order sought is set forth. The affidavit requirement of HRCP, Rule 59(c) (1972, as amended) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>refers to motions for new trial under HRCP, Rule 59(a) (1972, as amended).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 6A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00b6 59.12[3] at 59-253 and 59-254 (2d ed. 1948). Thus, the completeness or even complete lack of an affidavit does not effect the validity of the service of a motion not brought under Rule 59(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Appellee\u2019s second argument is also without merit. The courts have liberally construed the words \u201creasonable time\u201d in order to minimize the incidence of technical objections as to the time of filing. 4 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Civil </em>\u00a7 1152, p. 596 <em>(1969). See also </em>HRCP, Rule 1 (1980).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The record does not show any prejudice resulting from the delay in service. Having received the motion on January 7, 1980, Oceanic had ample time to prepare for the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The timely service of the motion for reconsideration terminated the thirty-day requirement for filing the notice of appeal. That time began to run on February 7, 1980, HRCP, Rule 73(a) (1972, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>amended), and the notice was timely filed. Therefore, this court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">In challenging the trial court\u2019s ruling that Hinton had abandoned the contract, Anderson advances the following arguments: (A) that the abandonment required the assent of Oceanic, which was never given, (B) that genuine issues of material fact pervaded the abandonment defense, and (C) that Oceanic was estopped from interposing the defenses of abandonment and Statute Of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Anderson argues that the trial court erred in ruling that the contract had been abandoned by Hinton because assent to the abandonment by Oceanic is necessary and none was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Citing <em>Earl M. Jorgensen Co. v. Mark Construction, Inc., </em>56 Haw. 466, 540 P.2d 978 (1975), and other cases, Oceanic objects to our considering this argument since Anderson never presented this legal theory below. We find that Anderson\u2019s proposition is not separate from but is a part of the issue of abandonment and sufficiently so to allow us to consider it on appeal. Rule 3(b)(3), Rules of the Hawaii Supreme Court (1980, as amended).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Lang v. Todd, </em>148 Neb. 726, 28 N.W.2d 434 (1947). Examination of the hearing transcript reveals the court\u2019s concern with whether or not Oceanic even knew about Hinton\u2019s acts at the time of the alleged assignment. The matter was sufficiently within the scope of attention of the trial court and is adequately briefed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Anderson refers us to <em>Lang v. Todd, supra, </em>which provides some support for the proposition that abandonment cannot become operative unless and until the vendor elects to treat the contract as having been abandoned. <em>Id. </em>at 732-34, 28 N.W.2d at 438-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">However, we feel the better rule to be that expressly embraced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>several jurisdictions that abandonment is an entirely unilateral action. Acceptance by the vendor is immaterial and does not affect the effectiveness of the abandonment. <em>Jakober v. E. M. Loew\u2019s Capitol Theatre, Inc., </em>107 R.I. 104, 110-11, 265 A.2d 429, 433 (1970); <em>Mason v. Hasso, </em>90 Ariz. 126, 130, 367 P.2d 1, 4 (1961); Hull v. <em>Clemens, </em>200 Or. 533, 548, 267 P.2d 225, 233 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Abandonment is evidenced as long as there is a voluntary relinquishment of a right or of property with the intention of not reclaiming it or reassuming its ownership or enjoyment. <em>Rich v. Runyon, </em>52 Or. App. 107, 627 P.2d 1265, 1268-69 (1981); <em>Katsaris v. United States, </em>499 F. Supp. 282, 283 (N.D. Fla. 1980). Intent to abandon and an external act effecting the intent must be shown. <em>Rich, </em>627 P.2d at 1269; <em>Katsaris, </em>499 F. Supp. at 283. Abandonment need not be expressed; it may be inferred from the conduct of the parties and the attendant circumstances. <em>Kolberg v. McKean\u2019s Model Laundry &amp; Dry Clean Co., </em>9 Ariz. App. 549, 550, 454 P.2d 867, 868 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">A motion for summary judgment is properly granted under HRCP, Rule 56(c) (1972, as amended)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Lau v. Bautista, </em>61 Haw. 144, 146-47, 598 P.2d 161, 163 (1979). In deciding the motion, both the trial court and the reviewing court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 147, 598 P.2d at 163, <em>Windward Partners v. Lopes, </em>3 Haw. App. 30, 640 P.2d 872 (1982). <em>See Kawaihae v. Hawaiian Insurance Companies, </em>1 Haw. App. 355, 619 P.2d 1086 (1980). We find there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the question of abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The record clearly shows Hinton\u2019s intent to abandon the contract and the actions she took to effect it. Therefore, Hinton had no contract to assign to Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">At the time Anderson spoke with Worcester on November 9, Hinton had clearly evinced an intent not to go through with any part of her bargain. She had stopped payment on her check, failed to deposit the additional $3,000.00 within ten days of opening escrow, and had not made efforts to obtain financing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Anderson\u2019s and Hinton\u2019s attempt to revive the contract was for naught.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">When a contracting party discovers the other party has abandoned a contract, he has as a remedy the right to conclude that the latter party intends not to perform his part of the bargain and treat the contract as a nullity. 17 AM.JUR.2d <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 484, p. 954 (1964). Although that determination, as in this case, may come some time after the act of abandonment, the abandonment is complete at the time of the breach, <em>Jakober, supra, </em>107 R.I. at 110-11, 265 A.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">c..</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Anderson\u2019s estoppel arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">First: Even assuming Worcester had authority to contract on Oceanic\u2019s behalf, she and Anderson never intended to create a new contract. Their entire discussion concerned a means of assigning and extending Hinton\u2019s contract. In fact, Worcester specifically discouraged Anderson from making a new offer. At oral argument Anderson\u2019s counsel stated she was seeking to enforce the Hinton contract, not any other. Therefore, the Statute Of Frauds is completely inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Second: The estoppel question was not raised by Anderson until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>her motion for reconsideration. The trial court stated that the motion presented nothing that was not considered by the court before entering judgment. The appellate review of a lower court decision on a motion for reconsideration is limited to a determination of whether there was an abuse of discretion. 6A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 59.15[4] at 59-293 and 59-294 (2d ed. 1948). Our review of the record does not indicate any abuse of discretion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab5\"><em>Wesley H.

A motion to alter or amend the judgment shall be served not later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b368-8\"> Rule 73(a), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">(a) How and When Taken. An appeal permitted by law from a circuit court to the supreme court and the intermediate court of appeals shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the circuit court within 30 days from the entry of the judgment appealed from, except that: (1) upon a showing of excusable neglect the circuit court in any action may extend the time for filing the notice of appeal not exceeding 30 days from the expiration of the original time herein prescribed; (2) if a timely notice of appeal is filed by a party, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days of the date on which the first notice of appeal was filed, or within the time otherwise herein prescribed, whichever period last expires. The running of the time for appeal is terminated as to all parties by a timely motion made by any party pursuant to any of the rules hereinafter enumerated, and the full time for appeal fixed in this subdivision commences to run and is to be computed from the entry of any of the following orders made upon a timely motion under such rules: granting or denying a motion for judgment under Rule 50(b); or granting or denying a motion under Rule 52(b) to amend or make additional findings of fact, whether or not an alteration of the judgment would be required if the motion is granted; or granting or denying a motion under Rule 59 to alter or amend the judgment; or denying a motion for a new trial under Rule 59. If the order or judgment appealed from is appealable only upon the allowance of the appeal by the court entering it, any application for such allowance must be made within 10 days after entry thereof and the appeal taken within 10 days after the allowance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Failure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the supreme court or the intermediate court of appeals deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal. If an appeal has not been docketed, the parties, with the approval of the circuit court, may dismiss the appeal by stipulation, filed in that court, or that court may dismiss the appeal upon motion and notice by the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\"> Rule 5(d), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">(d) Filing.

It is true that such provisions are for the buyer\u2019s benefit. At the same time, however, they serve as a safeguard to the seller. Failure to indicate within the prescribed period that financing is obtained is an indication that the buyer cannot qualify for the same with a lending institution, or does not intend to go through with the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
