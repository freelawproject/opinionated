Authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>for appeal by the State of an adverse interlocutory order is found in Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 641-13(7) (Supp. 1981).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Kaeka was indicted on January 21, 1981 for recklessly causing the death of Melody Pagaduan, thereby committing the offense of manslaughter in violation of HRS \u00a7 707-702(l)(a) (1976). On March 23, 1981 Kaeka moved to suppress certain inculpatory statements which she made on November 8, 1980 to Police Officer Benjamin Pedro, Jr., and on November 9, 1980 to Police Detective Louis Souza. Pursuant to Rule 12 of the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure, a pretrial evidentiary hearing was held on defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found the following facts: On November 8, 1980, at approximately 4:15 a.m., Officer Pedro arrived at the scene of a reported stabbing at 1038 C-3 Lunalilo Street. Upon his arrival, he observed 23-year-old Kaeka kneeling over the victim on the sidewalk fronting the apartment. As Officer Pedro approached Kaeka, he heard her say, \u201cMel, Mel, talk to me.\u201d As he looked to discover the identity of the victim, Kaeka stated, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I stabbed her. I stabbed her in the kitchen.\u201d Officer Pedro had not yet asked Kaeka any questions. He then read to Kaeka her <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966), procedural rights from the standard police printed card. After he read the final question on the card, \u201cWould you like to tell me what happened?\u201d, Kaeka replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019d like to talk to my father first.\u201d Officer Pedro then arrested Kaeka at about 4:30 a.m. and took her to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Unaware of Kaeka\u2019s statement to Officer Pedro, Detective Souza interviewed Kaeka at the police station 31 hours later. There is no evidence in the record that Kaeka had talked or tried to talk to her father. Detective Souza began the interview by reading to Kaeka her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Miranda </em>rights from the standard police printed form. When asked if she understood what \u201ccounsel\u201d meant, Kaeka replied, \u201c[S]omething like an attorney.\u201d Detective Souza then explained the word \u201ccounsel,\u201d drawing an analogy to a high school counselor. He also asked her what the word \u201cattorney\u201d meant to her, whereupon she responded \u201clawyer.\u201d After these explanations, Kaeka answered and initialled the questions on the form as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">Do you want an attorney now: Yes-No <em>X. </em>D.K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">If you decide to answer my questions without a lawyer being present, you still have the right to stop answering at anytime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0jn\">Do you understand what I have told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">Yes <em>X. </em>D.K. No_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">Would you like to tell me what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">Yes X_ D-K- No_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-11\">Signed: Davelynn Kaeka K.K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-12\">Name</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-13\">1038-C3 Lunalilo St._</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-14\">Address</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-15\">11-9-80 11:35 [AM] PM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-16\">Date Time</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-17\">Kaeka then made an inculpatory statement, the subject of this appeal, which was typed by the police and signed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-18\">In an oral ruling rendered at the close of the evidentiary hearing, the trial court found that the statements made by Kaeka at the scene of the crime were spontaneous declarations not obtained by interrogation and, hence, were admissible. The court also found that the statement given to Detective Souza while Kaeka was in custody was voluntarily given and that Kaeka had fully understood her rights and had waived them knowingly and intelligently.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the court concluded that Kaeka\u2019s indication at the scene of the crime that she wanted to talk to her father before talking to the police required the suppression of the statement made to Detective Souza. The State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>appeals from that portion of the order granting the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The State\u2019s claim of error below rests on two bases: first, that Kaeka\u2019s indication that she wanted to talk to her father before talking to the police was not tantamount to an invocation of her right to counsel, and, second, that although Kaeka did invoke her right to remain silent, the invocation did not create a per se proscription against subsequent interrogations. In response, Kaeka argues that the trial court was correct; that Kaeka\u2019s statement that she wanted to talk to her father was equivalent to a request for an attorney; that Kaeka\u2019s invocation of her right to remain silent created a per se proscription against subsequent police-initiated interrogations; and that this invocation necessarily precluded the police from any further attempts to interrogate her. Kaeka also contends that the police violated HRS \u00a7 803-9(4) (1976) and that the exclusionary rule should apply to suppress the evidence which was obtained in violation of said statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\"><em>Miranda v. Arizona, supra, </em>which was based on the fifth amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination, drew a distinction in consequences flowing from an individual\u2019s request to remain silent as opposed to a request for an attorney,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> holding, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, <em>the interrogation must cease. </em>... If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the <em>interrogation must cease until an attorney is present. </em>At that time, the individual must have an opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have him present during any subsequent questioning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">384 U.S. at 473-474 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Unlike the right to counsel, invocation of the right to remain silent does not create a per se proscription of infinite duration upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>any further police-initiated questioning. <em>Michigan v. Mosely, </em>423 U.S. 96, 102, 96 S. Ct. 321 (1975); <em>United States v. Pheaster, </em>544 F.2d 353, 367 (9th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Incisco v. United States, </em>429 U.S. 1099, 97 S. Ct. 1118 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Because of the difference in effect, we must first determine whether Kaeka\u2019s response to Officer Pedro\u2019s questions was a statement that she wanted to remain silent or that she wanted an attorney. The State agrees that Kaeka\u2019s statement to Officer Pedro was an invocation of her right to remain silent. It disputes that the request to see her father was also an indication of her desire for an attorney. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In <em>Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 99 S. Ct. 2560 (1979), the Supreme Court refused to construe a minor\u2019s request to see his probation officer as a request for an attorney. Like the probation officer in <em>Fare, </em>a parent who is not trained in the law is unable to give legal advice or to protect a child\u2019s interest before the police and courts. Moreover, a parent\u2019s communications with a child are not shielded by a privilege. Rule 501, Hawaii Rules of Evidence, Chapter 626, Hawaii Revised Statutes (1981). Consequently, we decline to construe an adult\u2019s request to talk to her father as a request for an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Kaeka urges us to adopt the rationale in <em>People v. Burton, </em>6 Cal.3d 375, 491 P.2d 793 (1971). In <em>Burton, </em>a minor\u2019s request to see one of his parents was construed as the minor\u2019s invocation of \u201chis Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>491 P.2d at 798. <em>Burton, </em>however, did not deal with an adult defendant and did not clearly indicate whether the minor\u2019s request was to remain silent or obtain an attorney or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">The next question is whether Detective Souza violated Kaeka\u2019s fifth amendment rights when he, in effect, asked her if she had changed her mind about remaining silent. More specifically, the issue is whether Kaeka\u2019s right to cut off questioning was scrupulously honored by the police. <em>Michigan v. Mosely, supra </em>at 104. The answer is clearly yes since the facts show that Officer Pedro immediately ceased questioning upon Kaeka\u2019s invocation of her right to remain silent; that Detective Souza did not talk to Kaeka until 31 hours after her prior invocation of her right to remain silent; that Detective Souza advised Kaeka of her <em>Miranda </em>rights before questioning her; and that Kaeka then made her statements \u201cvoluntarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>and intelligently.\u201d Based on such facts, we hold that the principles of <em>Miranda </em>were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">On appeal Kaeka raises the issue of whether the alleged violation of HRS \u00a7 803-9(4) (1976)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by the police mandates suppression of her subsequent confession under the exclusionary rule. In spite of her failure to raise this issue below, we will consider it. Rule 52(b), Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure. However, we find this contention without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">First, Kaeka has failed to show a violation of HRS \u00a7 803-9(4). The record contains uncontradicted testimony by Detective Souza that Kaeka had free access to a telephone during her detention. It contains no evidence that she was denied a \u201cfair opportunity\u201d to see or consult with her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Second, even assuming a violation of HRS \u00a7 803-9(4), such statutory violation (right to consult with a family member) as contrasted to a constitutional violation (right to consult with an attorney) would not result in the application of the exclusionary rule. Section 803-10, HRS (1976),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> imposes a penal sanction of up to one year of imprisonment for violation of HRS \u00a7 803-9. Neither it nor any other statute requires the exclusion of voluntary statements made by an arrested person to the police in cases where the police have violated the arrested person\u2019s rights under HRS \u00a7 803-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The limited scope of the exclusionary rule was defined by the Hawaii Supreme Court <em>in Rossell v. City and County, </em>59 Haw. 173, 579 P.2d 663 (1978). \u201cGenerally, where evidence has been obtained in violation of a statute, that evidence is not inadmissible per se in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>criminal proceeding unless the statutory violation has constitutional dimensions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>59 Haw. at 187 (citations omitted).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AmA\"><em>Thomas M. Pico, Jr., </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for plaintiff-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AxY\"><em>Anthony H. Yusi (Milton S. Tani </em>on the brief), Deputy Public Defenders, for defendant-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Here, the alleged statutory violation lacks constitutional dimensions since Kaeka\u2019s fifth amendment rights were not infringed. Consequently, the exclusionary rule does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in suppressing Kaeka\u2019s statement to Detective Souza. The suppression order is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> \u00a7 641 -13 <em>By State in criminal cases. </em>An appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the State from the district or circuit courts to the supreme court, subject to chapter 602, in all criminal cases, in the following instances:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">(7) From a pre-trial order granting a motion for the suppression of evidence, including a confession or admission, or the return of property in which case the intermediate appellate court or the supreme court, as the case may be, shall give priority to such an appeal and the order shall be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal[.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-19\"> The State agrees with the trial court\u2019s factual findings that Kaeka \u201cfully understood her rights\u201d and gave her statements to Detective Souza \u201cvoluntarily and intelligently.\u201d If Kaeka disagrees with the trial court\u2019s factual findings, query whether she could or should have cross-appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b461-12\"> We note that this case does not involve Kaeka\u2019s sixth amendment right to counsel.
