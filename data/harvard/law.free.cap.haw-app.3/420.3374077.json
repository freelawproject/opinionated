Rosa (Rosas) and against defendant-appellant CWJ Corporation, Ltd., dba Solar Hawaii (CWJ), for breach of contract and for unfair and deceptive trade practices. The court dismissed the complaint as to defendant-appellant Charles W. Johnston (Johnston), but entered an order denying him attorney\u2019s fee and costs. CWJ and Johnston appeal from such judgment and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">The appeals involve the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-15\">1. Whether CWJ failed to prove its affirmative defense of accord and satisfaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-16\">2. Whether the court\u2019s determination that CWJ committed unfair and deceptive trade practices was proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-17\">3. Whether the court properly awarded costs of$l,066.95 to Rosas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-18\">4. Whether the court properly denied Johnston\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fee and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-19\">We answer yes to issues 1 and 2 and affirm, but answer no to issues 3 and 4 and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-20\">On or about October 30, 1978, Rosas and CWJ entered into a contract for the purchase and installation of a thermo-syphon type of solar water heating unit with a storage tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-21\">On November 14, 1978, the solar water heating system was installed. Simultaneously, the existing electric water heater was removed. During the installation, John W. Gale, an employee of CWJ, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>informed his employer that the system as designed would never provide hot water to the occupants of Rosas\u2019 home. Despite such notification, CWJ instructed that the installation be completed as designed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">As designed and installed, the system failed to provide hot water between November 14,1978 andjanuary 4,1979. Rosas called CWJ almost daily requesting repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">On November 23, 1978, Gale made a service call. He informed Rosas that the system could not be repaired to provide hot water.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">On November 27,1978, Adam Pilakowski and George Medeiros, both employees of CWJ, met Rosas at their home. On behalf of CWJ, they agreed with Rosas that (1) the system as installed would not work, (2) the system would be removed, (3) all funds paid by Rosas would be refunded, and (4) all damages to Rosas\u2019 home caused by the installation and removal of the system would be repaired and the premises restored to the original condition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cNovember 27th agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">On December 15,1978, Johnston, President of CWJ, sent a letter to Rosas. The letter in substance stated that (1) in accordance with Rosas\u2019 wishes the system would be removed as soon as possible, (2) the amount to be reimbursed to Rosas would be $2,200.00 (purchase price of $3,450.00 less CWJ\u2019s cost for installation and removal of system of $ 1,250.00), and (3) Rosas should sign the letter if the terms were agreeable. Mrs. Rosa signed the letter. This is hereinafter referred to as the \u201cDecember 15th letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">On January 4, 1979, CWJ removed the system, but failed to provide Rosas with an electric water heater. On January 17, 1979, CWJ delivered and installed a new electric hot water heater and gave Rosas a cashier\u2019s check for $2,200.00, which Rosas negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">On April 20, 1979, Rosas filed a complaint against Johnston and CWJ in four counts. Count I alleged breach of contract, Count II negligence, Count III fraud, and Count IV deceptive business practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">On October 5, 1979, a bench trial was held. After the conclusion ofRosas\u2019case, thecourt dismissed Counts II and III of the complaint as to CWJ and dismissed the entire complaint as to Johnston.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>On October 29, 1979, the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and Judgment were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">On November 28, 1979, Orders denying CWJ\u2019s motion for new trial and denying Johnston\u2019s motion to assess attorney\u2019s fee and costs were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">CWJ contends that the December 15th letter and its subsequent performance thereunder constituted an accord and a satisfaction of any and all claims of Rosas. Consequently, the court below erred in awarding any damages to them. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The case of <em>Teledyne Mid-America Corp. v. HOH Corp., </em>486 F.2d 987 (9th Cir. 1973), holds that an effective accord and satisfaction requires the following prerequisites: (1) existence of a \u201cbona fide dispute\u201d between the parties involved, (2) tender by the obligor which gives the obligee adequate notice that a compromise is being proposed, and (3) effective acceptance of the compromise offer in order to discharge the original obligation. We find that CWJ failed to prove prerequisite (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">The claim of accord and satisfaction is an affirmative defense,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and CWJ had the burden of proving such defense. It was incumbent upon CWJ to prove that on or before December 15,1978, there was between Rosas and CWJ \u201ca bona fide dispute as to the existence or extent of liability.\u201d <em>Rust Engineering Company v. Lawrence Pumps, Inc., </em>401 F.Supp. 328, 333 (D. Mass. 1975). <em>See also Fire Insurance Association v. Wickham, </em>141 U.S. 564 (1891); <em>La-Z-Boy Chair Company v. Hinds, </em>364 F.Supp. 33 (D. S.C. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">When the December 15th letter (claimed by CWJ to be the accord) was signed, there was no bona fide dispute between Rosas and CWJ. Unquestionably, there was a bona fide dispute prior to the November 27th agreement. Rosas complained that the system failed to deliver hot water as promised. CWJ insisted that the system should be working or would work with some slight changes or repairs. However, such dispute was resolved by the November 27th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>agreement, whereby CWJ agreed to remove the system, refund all payments made by Rosas and fix all damages to the Rosas\u2019 home caused by the installation and removal of the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Absent a bona fide dispute, the December 15th letter was not an accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\"><em>Trask v. Shinn, </em>41 Haw. 374 (1956) does not support CWJ. There, accord and satisfaction was applicable since the claim involved was unliquidated and the subject of a dispute. Here, the amount CWJ was obligated to refund to Rosas under the November 27th agreement was a liquidated claim. CWJ could not reduce the amount to be refunded to Rosas by simply labelling the December 15th letter an accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">CWJ failed to meet its burden of proving its affirmative defense. The facts and applicable law lead us to the conclusion that the December 15th letter and subsequent performance by CWJ thereunder did not constitute accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">CWJ argues that its acts did not constitute \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\u201d under Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 480-2 (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">In Count IV of their complaint, Rosas sought treble damages under HRS \u00a7 480-13 (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To prevail under HRS \u00a7 480-13, Rosas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>had to establish (1) violation by CWJ of HRS chapter 480, (2) injury to Rosas\u2019 property resulting from such violation, (3) proof of the amount of damages, and (4) that the action was in the public interest or that CWJ was a merchant. <em>Ai v. Frank Huff Agency, Ltd., </em>61 Haw. 607, 607 P.2d 1304 (1980); <em>Wiginton v. Pacific Credit Corp., </em>2 Haw. App. 435, 634 P.2d 111 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The undisputed evidence was that CWJ prepared and distributed to homeowners a 4-page marketing brochure entitled \u201cSTOP RENTING YOUR ELECTRICITY.\u201d The last page of the material included the following printed representations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">We scientifically tailor a system for your home, keeping two things in mind:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">1. EFFICIENCY \u2014 To Do The Job It Was Intended To</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">2. DURABILITY \u2014 To Last Beyond The Payback Period</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">WE ARE PROFESSIONALS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">Solar Hawaii is a division of CWJ Contractors, a kamaaina firm that has been in business for over 16 years. What makes us unique in the solar business is that we have a staff of licensed engineers, electricians, plumbers, designers and installers who allow us to design a system just for you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">Rosas relied on the representations contained in the material and entered into the contract with CWJ for the purchase and installation of the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">The representations were false. Neither Solar Hawaii nor CWJ Contractors had been in business for 16 years, but in fact Solar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Hawaii had been in operation less than three years as of August 1978. CWJ and Solar Hawaii did not have a single engineer licensed in the State of Hawaii on their staff. CWJ failed to scientifically tailor an efficient system for Rosas\u2019 home, since it failed to provide hot water from the time of its installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Further, CWJ installed the system knowing it was defective in design. CWJ failed to provide a reasonable and effective service and repair program to correct the system after installation. It disregarded the needs and requests of Rosas, its customers. It had Rosas execute the disadvantageous December 15th letter as a prerequisite to any relief from the defective system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In language, HRS \u00a7 480-2 is virtually a duplication of \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> HRS \u00a7 480-3 (1976)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> contains a clear legislative intent that interpretation of \u00a7 5(a)( 1) by the Commission and federal courts should guide our courts in their construction of \u00a7 480-2. But \u201cour courts must interpret and apply the statute in the light of conditions in Hawaii.\u201d <em>Island Tobacco Co. v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>63 Haw. 289, 300, 627 P.2d 260, 268 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The Commission and federal courts have found the following false representations to be unfair or deceptive acts or practices under \u00a7 5(a)(1): (1) that a business had continued for more than 50 years when it had not, <em>Macher v. F.T.C., </em>126 F.2d 420 (2d Cir. 1942); (2) that a corporation was established in 1904, when it was actually incorporated in 1932, <em>Re Art National Manufacturers Distributing Co., </em>58 F.T.C. 719 (1961), <em>aff'd </em>298 F.2d 476 (2nd Cir. 1962), <em>cert. denied. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>370 U.S. 939 (1962), <em>reh\u2019g. denied. </em>371 U.S. 854 (1962); (3) that salesmen of a furnace company were heating engineers, when they were not, <em>Holland Furnace Company v. F.T.C., </em>295 F.2d 302 (7th Cir. 1961); and (4) that plaintiffs bureau of research would furnish accurate information on every subject matter through its staff of competent editors, all experts in their particular field, when there was only \u201cone old man\u201d available, <em>Consolidated Book Publishers, Inc. v. F.T.C., </em>53 F.2d 942 (7th Cir. 1931), cert. <em>denied. </em>286 U.S. 553 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Under \u00a7 5(a)(1), \u201c[a] practice is unfair when it offends established public policy and when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.\u201d <em>Spiegel, Inc. v. F.T.C., </em>540 F.2d 287, 293 (7th Cir. 1976). <em>See also F.T.C. v. Sperry Hutchinson Co., </em>405 U.S. 233 (1972). Furthermore, under \u00a7 5(a)(1), proof of actual deception is unnecessary. \u201cMisrepresentations are condemned if they possess a tendency to deceive.\u201d <em>Trans World Accounts, Inc. v. F.T.C., </em>594 F.2d 212, 214 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In the light of the foregoing criteria, the Commission\u2019s and federal courts\u2019 application of \u00a7 5(a)(1), and the concern of our legislature for consumers,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we hold that the false representations in the 4-page brochure, the installation of the system which failed to provide hot water to Rosas and other acts and omissions of CWJ set forth above constituted acts or practices violative of HRS \u00a7 480-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The record includes sufficient evidence establishing the other three essential elements required under HRS \u00a7 480-13 for Rosas to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">In <em>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330 (1979), the Court stated that \u201c[a] consumer whose money has been diminished . . . has been injured \u2018in his . . . property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339. In construing the words \u201cinjured in his. . . property\u201d included in HRS \u00a7 480-13, our supreme court adopted the construction given the same words by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Sonotone. Ai v. Frank Huff Agency, Ltd., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Rosas proved that their money had been diminished when the system they had purchased from and had installed by CWJ failed to provide hot water as represented and they had not been refunded the purchase price in full and reimbursed other losses. Rosas were injured in their \u201cproperty\u201d within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 480-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Rosas proved the amount of damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">Unreimbursed purchase price $1,334.96</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">Loss of wages 400.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">Cost of repair to home 345.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">$2,079.96</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Pursuant to HRS \u00a7 408-13, the sum of $2,079.96 was trebled to $6,239.88.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">There is no dispute that CWJ was a \u201cmerchant\u201d as defined in HRS chapter 490.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus no HRS \u00a7 480-13 showing that the Rosas\u2019 suit would be in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d was necessary. <em>See Ai v. Frank Huff Agency, Ltd., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-13\">Accordingly, we find no error in the court\u2019s findings and conclusions that CWJ committed unfair and deceptive trade practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">CWJ contends that the court improperly awarded costs of $1,066.95 to Rosas. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">The record supports CWJ\u2019s contention. The trial transcript contains no testimony concerning costs nor any reference to the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>sion of cost sheets into evidence by the court. The only reference to the cost sheets is in the Clerk\u2019s Minutes of October 5, 1979 which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">2:50 P.M. DEFENDANT RESTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">Opening argument by Mr. Kobayashi. List of costs of court (marked Plaintiffs [sic] Exhibit 12) was received by the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">2:57 P.M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">End of opening argument by Mr. Kobayashi. Argument by Mr. Bogetto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Nothing in the record reveals that counsel for CWJ had an opportunity to examine the cost sheets (Exhibit 12) or to object to all or any items on the sheets.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Absent stipulation by the parties, the allowance of costs under HRS \u00a7 607-9 (1976)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or \u00a7 480-13<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is subject to the procedure set forth in Rule 54(d), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) (1980).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">Since fair play decrees that CWJ be given an opportunity to object to any item in Rosas\u2019 cost bill, we hold that the award of costs to them was improper. On remand, Rosas should proceed to tax costs as provided by Rule 54(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">In the opening brief, CWJ stated that a question presented for decision was whether the trial court erred in the manner in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Rosas were awarded attorney\u2019s fee and costs. However, CWJ presented no argument in its briefs nor oral argument concerning attorney\u2019s fee. We deem that CWJ has abandoned its appeal as to attorney\u2019s fee. <em>Quality Furniture, Inc. v. Hay, </em>61 Haw. 89, 595 P.2d <em>1066 (1979) reh\u2019g denied, </em>61 Haw. 661 (1979); <em>State v. Kahua Ranch, </em>47 Haw. 466, 390 P.2d 737 (1964), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>47 Haw. 485, 391 P.2d 872 (1964); <em>Dement v. Atkins &amp; Ash, </em>2 Haw. App. 324, 631 P.2d 606 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Johnston argues that the court erred in denying his request for attorney\u2019s fee and costs. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">We start with the fundamental rule in this jurisdiction that \u201c[n]o attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded as damages or costs unless so provided by statute, stipulation, or agreement.\u201d <em>Food Pantry v. Waikiki Business Plaza, Inc., </em>58 Haw. 606, 618, 575 P.2d 869, 878 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">Johnston claims that he is entitled to attorney\u2019s fee under HRS \u00a7 607-14 (1976). This section provides that in \u201cactions in the nature of assumpsit\u201d attorneys\u2019 fee shall be taxed against and paid by the \u201closing party.\u201d He states that as to Rosas <em>vis-a-vis </em>Johnston, the former were the losing parties and must be taxed his attorney\u2019s fee. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Rosas argue that the action sounded in tort and not in assumpsit. This is not true. All four counts of the complaint named both Johnston and CWJ. Count I alleged breach of contract. An action for the recovery of damages for non-performance of a contract is one in assumpsit. <em>Braham v. Honolulu Amusement Co., </em>21 Haw. 583 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Rosas contend that they were not \u201closing parties\u201d under the authority <em>of Yoshida v. Nobrega, </em>39 Haw. 254 (1952). In <em>Yoshida, </em>the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s demurrer and awarded defendant attorney\u2019s fee. On appeal, the supreme court ruled that plaintiffs were not the \u201closers\u201d intended by section 9754, Revised Laws of Hawaii 1945 (the predecessor of HRS \u00a7 607-14), since the judgment was not \u201cupon the merits or final in form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">In this case, the dismissal was on the merits. After the completion of Rosas\u2019 case, Johnston moved to dismiss under Rule 41(b), HRCP (1980), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-13\">After the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court without a jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant, without waiving his right to offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. The court as trier of the facts may then determine them and render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">If the defendant\u2019s motion is granted at this stage, it is \u201ca decision on the merits in favor of defendant.\u201d 9 Wright <em>8c </em>Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Civil </em>\u00a7 2371, at 224 (1971). Thus <em>Yoshida </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Rosas also argue that they were not the \u201closing parties\u201d since they prevailed over CWJ in the action. In multiple parties cases, a party may be a losing party <em>vis-a-vis </em>two other parties, <em>Smothers v. Renander, </em>2 Haw. App. 400, 633 P.2d 556 (1981), and a party may be a loser as to one party and a winner as to another, <em>Cuerva &amp; Associates v. Wong, </em>1 Haw. App. 194, 616 P.2d 1017 (1980). HRS \u00a7 607-14 does not preclude Rosas from being the prevailing parties as to CWJ and the losers as to Johnston in the taxation of attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Finally, Rosas argue that the same attorney defended both CWJ and Johnston. Whether Johnston was a party or not, counsel had to render the legal services to CWJ and Johnston had not shown what part of counsel\u2019s fee was actually incurred by him. Thus Johnston was properly denied attorney\u2019s fee. This argument should be directed to the amount, if any, of attorney\u2019s fee to be awarded to Johnston on remand, not to Johnston\u2019s right under HRS \u00a7 607-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">As a prevailing party <em>vis-a-vis </em>Rosas, Johnston is entitled to seek taxation of costs under Rule 54(d), HRCP, and HRS \u00a7 607-9. However, \u201c[t]he allowance of costs to the prevailing party is not obligatory under the language of Rule 54(d), HRCP, [citations omitted], and the circuit court is vested with a sound discretion in allowing or disallowing all costs or only particular items [citations omitted].\u201d <em>Harkins v. Ikeda, </em>57 Haw. 378, 386, 557 P.2d 788, 793-94 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">In its opening brief, CWJ contended that the court\u2019s conclusions that Rosas suffered mental distress, that they are entitled to recover $2,500.00 for such mental distress, and that Mr. Rosa sustained special damage for lost wages in the amount of $400.00 were erroneous. However, CWJ presented no argument in its brief nor oral argument on these points, and we consider these contentions to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>been abandoned. <em>Quality Furniture, Inc. v. Hay, supra; State v. Kahua Ranch, supra; Dement v. Atkins &amp; Ash, supra.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1L\"><em>Philip D.
