We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Barbara and Earl were married on April 29,1961. They had four children: Earl, born May 13, 1962; Derrick, born August 27, 1964; Cheryl, born December 27, 1968; and Christy, born December 28, 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">On October 29, 1970, while at work, Earl suffered a myocardial infarction (heart attack). He suffered a second one on February 8,-1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">On September 19, 1975, Barbara sued Earl for a divorce. On January 9, 1976, the Third Circuit Family Court held a hearing on the uncontested calendar which both parties and their attorneys attended. The court orally granted the divorce to Barbara and stated the apparently agreed-to terms thereof on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">On February 4, 1976, Earl filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation based on the myocardial infarction suffered on October 29, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">On February 17, 1976, the court filed a decree granting absolute divorce and awarding child custody which, <em>inter alia, </em>awarded custody of the children to Barbara and required Earl to pay unsegregated child and spousal support of $538 per month commencing January 1976; required Earl to provide medical and dental insurance coverage for the minor children \u201cto the maximum amounts available to him through his employment\u201d and to pay the uninsured portion \u201cto a maximum of $400.00 per year\u201d; awarded Barbara the 1970 Chevrolet and the household furnishings and appliances; awarded Earl the 1964 Rambler; awarded Earl and Barbara each one-half of the savings accounts, the savings bonds, and the $1,000 federal income tax refund; awarded each one-half of the residence but gave Barbara exclusive use and occupancy of it until all of the children reached 18 at which time it was to be sold and the proceeds equally divided between the parties; and required each party to pay his or her own costs and fees. The decree scheduled the issues of child support, children\u2019s tuition, spousal support, and mortgage payment for \u201cfurther hearing and review by this Court before the end of May, 1976.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">On May 28,1976, Barbara and Earl stipulated on the record that effective June 1,1976, Earl was obligated to pay child support of $50 per month per child and pay $150 on the monthly mortgage payments on the jointly owned residence; that the residence would be sold when the last child reached 21 years of age or left the residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>or terminated full-time education, whichever came first; that Earl was required to pay the children\u2019s tuitions at St. Joseph\u2019s School; and that \u201c[t]he matter of alimony will be left in abeyance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">As of June 1976 Barbara was receiving, financial assistance from Hawaii\u2019s Department of Social Services and Housing (DSSH).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">On April 26,1977, in response to the County Corporation Counsel\u2019s order to show cause, Earl\u2019s monthly support obligation was amended, and he was required to pay $133 for the house mortgage and $167 to DSSH. DSSH agreed to cover all of the children\u2019s uninsured medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Earl remarried on November 7, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">On December 2, 1977, Earl received a lump sum settlement of $20,000 for his February 8, 1975, myocardial infarction. On April 19, 1978, for his October 29, 1970, myocardial infarction Earl was awarded $7,820.36 for weekly benefits, $5,500 for lump sum disfigurement, $100 reimbursement for mileage, and $3,634.70 reimbursement for out-of- pocket expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">On December 29, 1978, in response to Corporation Counsel\u2019s November 17, 1978, order to show cause (in which Earl\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation awards are mentioned), the prior order was continued and Earl was additionally ordered to pay the children\u2019s tuitions, fees, and books at St. Joseph\u2019s School.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">On March 12, 1979, Barbara filed an order to show cause asking for spousal support and for an advance of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. On April 12, 1979, Barbara filed an amended order to show cause adding a request for one-half of Earl\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Her memos in support of the motion asserted only one basis for her request: That she was entitled to one-half of the awards because the divorce decree did not dispose of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">On August 6, 1979, the court filed a decision in which it denied Barbara\u2019s claim to one-half of Earl\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">1. The decree is final and cannot be amended because Barbara has not satisfied Rule 59(g)\u2019s, Hawaii Family Court Rules (HFCR) (1977), requirement that \u201c[a] motion to alter or amend the decree or decision and order shall be filed not later than 10 days after entry of the decree or decision and order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">2. Barbara has not moved for relief from the decree under Rule 60(b), HFCR (1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>3. If Barbara had moved under Rule 60(b), HFCR (1977), for relief from the decree, the motion was untimely because it was not made within a reasonable time as required by Rule 60(b), HFCR (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">On October 4, 1979, the court filed a decision in which it (1) denied Barbara any spousal support, (2) denied Barbara any attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses, and (3) ordered Earl to pay Barbara\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses on appeal \u201cin an amount not exceeding $250.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Barbara contends that it was error for the trial court not to equally divide the workers\u2019 compensation settlements \u201csince property of the parties not disposed of by a decree granting absolute divorce and awarding child custody vests equally in the parties as tenants in common by operation of law.\u201c Barbara\u2019s contention is correct only if at the time of the divorce the workers\u2019 compensation entitlements were jointly owned by Earl and Barbara. <em>Jendrusch v. Jendrusch, </em>1 Haw. App. 605, 623 P.2d 893 (1981); <em>Vaughan v. Williamson, </em>1 Haw. App. 496, 621 P.2d 387 (1980). Here, however, those entitlements were Earl\u2019s, not Earl and Barbara\u2019s. Since the decree of divorce did not as a matter of fact or law change Earl\u2019s ownership, Earl continues to have sole title to those entitlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Consequently, the real issue is whether after the decree of divorce was filed, the lower court retained any jurisdiction to change Earl\u2019s sole ownership. In our view, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 580-56(a) (1976) and Rule 59, HFCR (1977), compel the conclusion that on and after the eleventh day after the Third Circuit Family Court issued its divorce decree without reserving jurisdiction over property, it no longer had jurisdiction to divide and distribute Earl\u2019s property. <em>Jendrusch, supra; Vaughan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The lower court had jurisdiction to entertain a motion for relief from decree or order under Rule 60(b), HFCR (1977), but Barbara did not make such a motion, choosing instead to rely solely on her erroneous assertion that the family court retained jurisdiction under HRS \u00a7 580-47 (1976, as amended) to award her one-half of the entitlement. Rule 60(b), HFCR (1977), specifically requires a \u201cmotion.\u201d Since Barbara did not satisfy that requirement, she may not on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>appeal complain of the failure to award her relief under Rule 60(b), HFCR (1977). Moreover, even if Barbara had made a \u201cmotion,\u201d the standard of review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion under Rule 60(b), HFCR (1977), is whether there has been an abuse of discretion, 11 Wright <em>8c </em>Miller, Federal Practice <em>8c </em>Procedure: <em>Civil </em>\u00a7 2857 (1975), and we find no such abuse here.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AWL\"><em>Lionel D. Meyer (Nakasato &amp; Meyer </em>of counsel) on the briefs for plaintiff-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AOR\"><em>Andrew P. Wilson </em>on the briefs for defendant-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Barbara contends that the trial court erred in denying her an award of spousal support and attorney\u2019s fees and costs at the trial level and in awarding her only $250 for costs and fees on appeal. The standard of appellate review of each of these issues is whether there has been a manifest abuse of the trial judge\u2019s wide discretion in such matters. <em>Carson v. Carson, </em>50 Haw. 182, 436 P.2d 7 (1967); <em>Horst v. Horst, </em>1 Haw. App. 617, 623 P.2d 1265 <em>(1981 ); Ahlo v. Ahlo, </em>1 Haw. App. 324, 619 P.2d 112 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In making its decision, the lower court properly examined each issue under the relevant portions of HRS \u00a7 580-47 (1976, as amended) and decided, <em>inter alia, on </em>the basis of substantial evidence that Barbara \u201chas failed to use her talents in income producing endeavors or to prepare herself to do so and that she has in fact malingered\u201d; that \u201cshe has apparently been content with receiving State assistance\u201d; that \u201c[n]early half of [Earl\u2019s] moderate income is committed to support expenses for four minor children\u201d; and that an order of spousal support would \u201cprobably cause an invasion of his capital. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Consequently, we find no abuse of discretion here either.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
