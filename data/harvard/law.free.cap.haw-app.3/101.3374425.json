We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Appellee\u2019s amended complaint below claimed that, as a result of mutual mistake, she had conveyed a parcel of land not intended to be conveyed to appellant and that as a result of appellant\u2019s refusal to correct the mistake, appellee had been made a defendant in the instant action. Although the relief asked was indemnification, her suit essentially was equitable. The court denied indemnification, denied appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and awarded her costs in the amount of $163. Appellant urges that she should have been awarded attorney\u2019s fees because of the warranty clause in the deed and because the suit was one in the nature of assumpsit under \u00a7 607-14, HRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The third-party complaint, however, was basically an equitable action in the nature of reformation rather than an action in the nature of assumpsit, and accordingly, would not fall within the scope of \u00a7 607-14, HRS. <em>Smothers v. Renander, </em>2 Haw. App. 400, 633 P.2d 556 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Appellant also claims that she should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees under the warranty clause in the deed. The deed in question employs the standard language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">And the Grantor, in consideration of the premises, does, for herself and her heirs, executors and administrators, covenant and agree to and with said Grantee, as aforesaid, that she (the Grantor) is lawfully seized in fee simple of the real property described in said Exhibit \u201cA\u201d hereby conveyed and that the same is free and clear of and from all encumbrances, except as mentioned in Exhibit \u201cA\u201d and those made, suffered or permitted by Grantee; that the Grantor has good right to sell and convey said real property as aforesaid, and that the Grantor, and her heirs, executors and administrators shall WARRANT AND DEFEND the same unto the Grantee, as aforesaid, against the lawful claims and demands of all persons, except as aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">Had appellant\u2019s title been attacked by some third party, it is well-settled that she would be able, in an action for breach of covenan't, to recover from appellee her attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending her title. <em>Morris v. Petero, </em>4 Haw. 23 (1877). Since the action to recover such fees would have been in the nature of assumpsit, statutory attorney\u2019s commissions in that action under \u00a7 607-14, HRS, would have been recoverable also. Appellant would not, however, have been able to recover attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the action against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>appellee for breach of covenant except as provided by \u00a7 607-14, HRS, since, as has been said:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ADG\"><em>Jack C. Morse </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ACQ\"><em>Daral G. Conklin (Conklin, Schneider &amp; Love </em>of counsel) for appellee.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-4\">Nor can the covenantee recover an attorney\u2019s fee incurred in his action against the covenantor for the breach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">20 AM. JUR.2d, COVENANTS, CONDITIONS, ETC., \u00a7 152 (1965) at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">If we were to read the warranty clause in isolation from the rest of the paragraph in which it appears, it would seem literally to support appellant\u2019s position. However, viewed in the context of the paragraph as a whole, it is apparent that it is a warranty of seisin, freedom from encumbrances and of the grantor\u2019s right to sell and convey. None of those were attacked by appellee\u2019s suit and accordingly, we hold the warranty clause inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
