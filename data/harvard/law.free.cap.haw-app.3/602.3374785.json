The land was purchased on January 6, 1972 for $5,900.00 and the house was purchased in March 1973 for $29,397.00.

It is undisputed that [Husband] had ten surviving children from his prior two (2) marriages, four of which were minor children during a period of this marriage. The tax returns of [Wife] and [Husband] evidence alimony paid to one ex-wife in the sum of $14,410.00 over the period of this marriage. [Husband] denied any obligation to pay child support. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-17\">7. It is undisputed that [Wife] had two children by her prior marriage which were minors during a period of this marriage. [Husband] testified [Wife] received the sum of $13,315.00 as and for child support from 1970 through 1976.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-18\">8. The income tax returns of [Wife] and [Husband] show fairly accurately the income of the parties during the period of this marriage. [Husband] averaged approximately $10,000.00 per year from 1970 through 1977. [Wife] averaged approximately $4,500.00 per year during the same period. However, the tax returns do not reflect [Wife\u2019s] child support or the income produced by her business (approximately $4,000.00 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>year) which was set off against depreciation and travel expenses and in substantial part used for the direct benefit of [Wife] and [Husband] ([Wife\u2019s] Exhibit 50).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">For the years 1977, 1978 and 1979, [Wife] and [Husband] lost approxmately $12,000 per year. Therefore, $12,000 a year was required just to keep the business (Chew-Chew Caboose) operating to say nothing of the everyday expenses of [Wife] and [Husband]. Since the only income or cash asset of [Husband] was his then $1,800 per year pension, [Wife] must have provided these monies from her savings or income from property acquired before the marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">In fairness to both [Wife] and [Husband], their income or loss of income gives no substantial advantage to either regarding their respective claims for division of property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Trial lasted a total of six days spread out over a four-month period. It was conducted on the theory that Wife was entitled to all of her premarital assets, the proceeds therefrom, and all of the assets that were acquired in whole or in substantial part with said proceeds. Consequently, most of the trial involved an item by item recreation of the ten-year financial history of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\"><em>Au-Hoy v. Au-Hoy, </em>60 Haw. 354, 590 P.2d 80 (1979), is authority for the rule that: \u201cWhere the parties, throughout their marriage, have treated their earnings separately, maintained separate expenses and accumulatd separate estates, it is within the discretion of the Court to allow each to keep his or her separate estate where such award is fair and equitable under all circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">However, the instant case does not present such a situation. Some of the income from wife\u2019s separate property went into her separate bank accounts while some went into joint bank accounts. Some of it was applied to joint uses. Both the separate and the joint accounts were used whenever the couple needed money. Tax returns were filed jointly and marital funds were used to pay all taxes no matter what income generated the tax. The three Leilani Estates lots were purchased in joint names and the monthly payments were made from joint funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Further, the method used by the trial court in allocating the three Leilani Estates lots is inherently inequitable. For example, the trial court concluded that the purchase of Lot 44 and its house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>involved $31,125.87 of Wife\u2019s funds and $1,670.00<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of Husband\u2019s funds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court, however, awarded Husband only $1,670.00 and awarded Wife the house and lot. Husband was not credited with a proportionate share of the appreciation in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">When dividing property in a divorce case, the family court is required to consider all circumstances of the case, exercise its discretion, and make a \u201cjust and equitable\u201d division of property. HRS \u00a7 580-47 (1976, as amended). For an appellate court to conclude that there has been an abuse of discretion, it must appear that the trial court clearly exceeded the bounds of reason or disregarded rules or principles of law or practice to the substantial detriment of a party litigant. <em>Ahlo, supra; Title Guaranty v. Powley, </em>2 Haw. App. 265, 630 P.2d 642 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">This case involves a substantial amount of premarital property. In these kinds of cases, the following information is particularly relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">1. Itemized description and value at or about the DOM of all property owned by each party at the DOM.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">2. Itemized description and amount as of the DOM of all debts owed by each party at the DOM.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">3. Itemized description and value as of the date of acquisition of all property acquired during the marriage by only one of the parties by inheritance or gift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-10\">4. Itemized description and value of all property owned by one or both of the parties at the TOD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-11\">5. Itemized description and amount of all debts owed by one or both of the parties at the TOD.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">This information will permit the segregation of nonmarital property net values (the DOM net value of each of the parties\u2019 premarital property and the date of acquisition net value of prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>erty acquired by only one of the parties during the marriage by gift or inheritance) from marital property values (value at the TOD of all property owned by either or both parties minus nonmarital net values) and will facilitate the decision-making and review processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">As a general rule, it is equitable to award each divorcing party the DOM net value of his or her premarital property. In this case, however, no evidence was offered to prove and no determination was made of the DOM values of many of the assets and liabilities which Wife brought into the marriage. The explanation is that it was Husband\u2019s position in the lower court (and on appeal) that each party is entitled to the return of the assets (or their values if the assets were converted into cash) which each brought into the marriage. He did not ask for a share of the appreciation in value which Wife\u2019s premarital separate property received during the marriage. Husband\u2019s position caused that evidence to be irrelevant and he cannot now complain of not being awarded a share of that appreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">On that basis, Wife is entitled to the return of the following items or values:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">A-l. Garrison Street property: $39,612.72.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">A-2. Edison Street property: $41,000.00 (approximately net sales price).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">A-3. (a) Toledo, Ohio property: $4,892.98; (b) Toledo, Ohio property: promissory note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-11\">A-4.

American Safety, Inc., stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-17\">B-7. P.J. Models: $6,322.30 (estimated value).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-18\">On the same basis, Husband is entitled to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-19\">C-l. (a) $6,000.00 from the sale of the Gertrude Street residence; (b) minus the amount of the two Sears debts; (c) plus the bedroom furniture and appliances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-20\">D-l.

His VA disability pension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">As a general rule, it is equitable to award each divorcing party, the date of acquisition net value of gifts and inheritances which he or she received during the marriage. In this case, there are no facts justifying departure from the general rule. On that basis, Wife should be awarded the savings bonds (B-8) and Husband should be awarded $5,000.00 cash insurance (D-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The following items were returned in actual or equivalent kind: Toledo, Ohio property promissory note (A-3(b)), St. Clair property promissory note (A-4), 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado (B-3), houseold goods and furniture (B-4), Bell &amp; Howell stock (B-5), the five 1,000 savings bonds (B-8), automobile (D-l(a)), premarital retirement benefits (D-3), and VA disability pension (D-4).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">It appears reasonable and equitable to cancel against each other the various claims and obligations involving the American Safety, Inc., stock (B-6), the automobile debt (D-l(b)), the two Sears debts (C-l(b)), the bedroom furniture and appliances (C-l(c)), and the coins (D-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Concerning nonmarital property, what remains is Wife\u2019s entidement to the Garrison Street property proceeds (A-l), the Edison Street property proceeds (A-2), the Toledo, Ohio property proceeds (A-3(a)), the Toledo Trust cash (B-2), the P. J. Models\u2019 proceeds (B-7), and Husband\u2019s entitlement to the Gertrude Street proceeds (C-l(a)), and the $5,000.00 insurance payment (D-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Wife\u2019s entitlement adds up to $92,708.00; husband\u2019s adds up to $11,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">At this juncture, the remaining assets and debts available to satisfy those remaining entitlements are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-15\">Item Value</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axk\">A.

Given that finding and considering \u201call of the other circumstances of the case,\u201d HRS \u00a7 580-47 (1976, as amended), we conclude that the manner in which the lower court divided the remaining items was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Accordingly, we hold that the lower court abused its discretion when it (1) required Husband rather than Wife to pay the solar heater debt and (2) failed to award Husband $11,000.00 in consideration of the value of his nonmarital property. Consequendy, the lower court is ordered to amend its decree (1) to obligate Wife and not Husband to pay for the Hawaii National Bank solar heater debt; (2) to order the full payment in cash of all of the debts that have been assigned to Husband as his sole and separate obligation; and (3) to award to Husband the net amount remaining from the $11,000.00 gross awarded to him after payment of his assigned debts pursuant to number (2) above.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As so amended, the decree dividing property is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">This case is remanded to the family court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\"> This order is an appealable order. <em>Cleveland v. </em>Cleveland, 57 Haw. 519, 559 P.2d 744 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-12\"> Finding of fact 3(b) states that the \u201cDearborn business property\u201d (Garrison Street property) was sold \u201cfor $44,000.00 cash.\u201d In that respect, it is clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b618-21\"> Wife used her Brighton State Bank account to purchase her daughters\u2019 one-third equitable interest in the St. Clair County property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b619-19\"> Finding of fact 16 states, in relevant part: \u201c[T]he Honolulu Federal Savings Certificate as deposited therein is [Wife\u2019s] childrens\u2019 share of the St. Clair property proceeds.\u201d This finding is clearly erroneous. Wife opened the Honolulu Federal Savings and Loan account on March 19, 1980 with money withdrawn from \u201cthe Huntington Bank in Toledo.\u201d The payments from the sale of the St. Clair property are in the People Bank of Port Huron. Moreover, Wife testified that to satisfy her daughters\u2019 claims to a portion of the St. Clair proceeds she had cashed her $13,500.00 Brighton State Bank certificate, put it into the parties\u2019joint checking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>account, and then, on October 19, 1979, purchased a $13,500.00 Capital Life Insurance savings account in the name of her daughters. In her answering brief, Wife attempts to justify finding of fact 16 by stating, \u201cThe trial court apparently considered the deposit into the [Honolulu Federal Savings and Loan] account as partial repayment by WIFE to her children for their share of the proceeds from the sale of the St. Clair property[.]\u201d No mention is made that the source of finding of fact 16 was Wife\u2019s proposed findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\"> The trial court\u2019s calculations appear not to account for Husband\u2019s involvement in the monthly payments of the house mortgage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b623-14\"> Since the cash purchase price of the house and lot was $35,297.00, it follows that the purchase involved at least $2,501.10 more than the total of the amounts attributed to Husband and Wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7, 8\">\n<p id=\"b623-15\"> 8 Where the parties first commenced an economic partnership and later married, it may be appropriate to obtain this information as of the time they commenced their economic partnership.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b624-21\"> Wife used her Brighton State Bank account to purchase her daughters\u2019 one-third equitable interest in the St. Clair County property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b625-17\"> As a general rule, it is equitable to require the divorcing party who is awarded the residence to pay the outstanding debt which relates to its solar heater's costs.
