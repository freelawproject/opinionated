Petitioner Jane Doe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>III, gave birth to a six-pound six-ounce female child on October 18, 1965. She filed this action on May 12, 1978. Respondent Richard Roe, III, appeals the lower court\u2019s decree declaring him to be the father of petititioner\u2019s female child. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Respondent cites three errors on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">I. That the following findings of fact are clearly erroneous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">1. That the credible testimony is that of the Petitioner and not the Defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">4. That the Defendant during the period of conception was not sterile, but able to impregnate a woman;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">II. That in this case retrospective application of HUPA \u00a7 584-7 is not constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">Both Rule 52(a) of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure and Rule 52(a) of the Hawaii Family Court Rules provide that findings of fact \u201cshall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-15\">We determine whether findings of fact are clearly erroneous under Rule 52(a), HRCP, by application of the following standard of review: Findings of fact are clearly erroneous unless supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Shoemaker v. Takai, </em>57 Haw. 599, 561 P.2d 1286 (1977). Substantial evidence is credible evidence which is of sufficient quantity and probative value to justify a reasonable person in reaching a conclusion. <em>In re Charley\u2019s Tour &amp; Transp. Inc., </em>55 Haw. 463, 522 P.2d 1272 (1974). Even though the findings are supported by substantial evidence, they may be set aside on appeal if the appellate court decides that they are against the clear weight of the evidence or otherwise reaches a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>DeFries v. Association of Owners, </em>57 Haw. 296, 555 P.2d 855 (1976); <em>State v. Patterson, </em>58 Haw. 462, 571 P.2d 745 (1977); 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Civil </em>\u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>2585 (1971); 2 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure: <em>Criminal </em>\u00a7 374 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\"><em>Yorita v. Okumoto, </em>3 Haw. App. 148, 643 P.2d 820 (1982) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Respondent contends that because the trial court concluded \u201cthat the allegations contained in the Petition are proved by a clear standard\u201d we must review this case on appeal as if the Petitioner\u2019s burden were to produce \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence rather than a preponderance. We disagree. As long as the trial court applied no less than the proper burden of proof, it made no error of which respondent can complain, and its decision will be reviewed on appeal under the proper burden which in cases under the Uniform Parentage Act is a preponderance. <em>Doe H v. Roe II, </em>3 Haw. App. 233, 647 P.2d 305 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Respondent concedes that petitioner produced some evidence. He argues that she produced no credible evidence on the contested issues of whether the parties engaged in sexual intercourse at the critical time<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and whether respondent was able at that time to impregnate petitioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">With respect to his ability to impregnate, respondent was tested once in 1965 and his sperm count per cubic centimeter was three million; whereas, the normal count is sixty million. A urologist testified that assuming three million was an accurate count, the chances of respondent impregnating petitioner \u201cis very low . . . but not impossible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">With respect to the question of whether the parties engaged in sexual intercourse during the critical period, petitioner testified that they did and respondent testified that they did not. The trial judge believed petitioner and not respondent. Respondent, on appeal, wants this court to hold the lower court\u2019s credibility finding to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>clearly erroneous because some of petitioner\u2019s testimony at trial differed from some of her deposition testimony taken some twenty months prior to trial. These differences were pointed out to the trial judge during the trial. Applying the general rule that the credibility of the witnesses is for the trial court to determine, <em>Shinn v. Lee, Ltd., </em>57 Haw. 215, 553 P.2d 733 (1976), and based upon a thorough review of the record, we do not find the trial court\u2019s findings to be against the clear weight of the evidence, and we do not reach a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\"><em>Roe v. Doe, </em>59 Haw. 259, 581 P.2d 310 (1978), left open the possibility that in certain cases retrospective application of HUPA \u00a7 584-7 might violate the putative father\u2019s constitutional right of due process. Respondent contends that this is one of those cases. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">To bring his constitutional rights into play, respondent must \u201cdemonstrate that he had acted in specific reliance on the bar of the statute of limitations and that special hardships or oppressive results would follow from the lifting of the bar. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">In support of his claim, respondent points to evidence which he says proves that he was led by petitioner to believe that he would never be subject to a paternity claim. Petitioner testified that four days after the child\u2019s birth she called him and \u201ctold him he\u2019s the father of a baby girl and he hung up\u201d; that they saw each other in 1968 and \u201cwe went riding and we had a cup of coffee and just talked\u201d but did not discuss the child; and that respondent never admitted being the father of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">With respect to the \u201cspecific reliance\u201d requirement, respondent contends that since he \u201chad no reason to believe he would be subject to a paternity suit, he should be deemed to have relied upon the two-year statute of limitations that was in effect at the time the relevant events of this case occurred.\u201d In our view respondent\u2019s contention does not qualify as \u201cspecific reliance.\u201d On the contrary, respondent admitted that he had no knowledge of any statute of limitation until after he had been served with a complaint in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>With respect to the \u201cspecial hardships or oppressive results\u201d requirement, respondent reasons as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">1. Since he did not think he was the father and petitioner never gave him any indication that she would file a paternity action, respondent did not discuss \u201chis previous relationships\u201d with his present wife<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now that suit has been filed, respondent\u2019s \u201cmarriage has suffered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">2. If an action had been filed within two years from birth, respondent could have (a) \u201chad meaningful medical tests\u201d performed to prove his alleged sterility; and (b) gathered evidence to corroborate his version of events.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">With respect to no. 1, it is respondent\u2019s burden to show that special hardships or oppressive results would follow from the lifting of the bar. In this case the respondent admits that his marriage suffered when his relationship with petitioner was revealed to his present wife. He has not sufficiently demonstrated that his marriage will suffer more if we allow the bar to be lifted or that his marriage will stop suffering if we allow the bar to be enforced. Moreover, we hesitate to allow respondent to use consequences caused by his own lack of candor as the basis for a constitutional defense against a paternity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">With respect to no. 2(a), respondent did have a \u201cmeaningful medical test\u201d performed which proved that he was infertile, not sterile.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">With respect to no. 1 and no. 2(b), such problems are of the general variety which always exist in this kind of case. To create a constitutional defense, respondent must demonstrate specific and direct reliance on the bar of the statute of limitations and resultant hardship. He has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">The essence of respondent\u2019s argument is that petitioner\u2019s acts or non-acts should bar this paternity claim. If this were the usual two-party case, we would have more sympathy for respondent\u2019s position. However, paternity cases involve not only the rights of petitioner and respondent, but also the rights of the child, and we are very reluctant to allow the child\u2019s rights to be diminished by the acts or non-acts of his or her mother.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AgW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Edward C.
