Nishihara appeals from the judgment holding her liable on a promissory note in favor of plaintiff American Security Bank (the Bank) and dismissing her counterclaim for damages under the Truth-In-Lending Act (TILA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-14\">The issues raised on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-15\">1. Whether the court erred in finding defendant liable on the note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-16\">2. Whether the complaint failed to join an indispensable party and should have been dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-17\">3. Whether the court erred in dismissing defendant\u2019s counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-18\">We answer no to all the questions and affirm the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZj\">On June 25, 1975, defendant and her husband, Denis Y. Nishihara (Denis) executed and delivered to the Bank a note in the principal amount of $6,693.43 (the Note).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-19\">On January 27, 1976,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a decree was entered granting Denis an absolute divorce from defendant (the Decree). The Decree incorpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>rated by reference the agreement in contemplation of divorce dated January 5, 1976 (the Agreement), which provided <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">3. The Husband agrees to pay all outstanding debts of the marriage incurred as of the date hereof and these debts include those listed on Exhibit \u201cA\u201d attached hereto. Any unknown debts not listed on Exhibit \u201cA\u201d are assumed by the Husband and he agrees to hold the Wife harmless from all debts now owed by the parties known or unknown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Exhibit \u201cA\u201d attached to the Agreement listed, among others, an outstanding debt of $5,998.43 owed to the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">On July 19, 1976, Denis filed a petition for bankruptcy. The petition listed the Bank as an unsecured creditor for $5,998.43. On July 20, 1976, the referee in bankruptcy issued a restraining order enjoining the Bank and other creditors from commencing any suit for recovery of debts against Denis. Denis was discharged in bankruptcy on October 26, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">On November 16, 1976, the Bank sued defendant for the balance due on the Note. On December 10, 1976, defendant filed her answer and counterclaimed for damages, alleging numerous violations under TILA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">After a bench trial, the court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law on August 31, 1981. On September 3, 1981, defendant\u2019s counterclaim was dismissed and a judgment for the Bank was entered, and defendant filed a notice of appeal on October 5, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">In contending that she is not liable on the Note, defendant presents a novel theory. She argues that (1) under the Decree, Denis\u2019 assumption of the marital debts was in lieu of child support and alimony; (2) such \u201cin lieu\u201d assumption of marital debts cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>discharged in bankruptcy;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) the Bank\u2019s failure to contest the bankruptcy court\u2019s discharge of Denis\u2019 marital debts effectively released defendant, a joint obligor, from liability on the Note; and (4) holding defendant liable on the Note is contrary to public policy. Defendant\u2019s reasoning is flawed and unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">First, the Agreement incorporated in the Decree does not expressly provide that Denis\u2019 assumption of marital debts is in li\u00e9u of payment of child support and alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Second, the district court below was not the proper forum for the construction of the Decree. For a determination that Denis\u2019 assumption of marital debts was in lieu of child support and alimony payments and, therefore, not dischargeable in bankruptcy, defendant should have gone to the family court, <em>Young v. Young, </em>234 Ga. 256, 215 S.E.2d 258 <em>(1975); Jones v. Jones, </em>300 Minn. 182, 220 N.W.2d 287 (1974); <em>Cunningham v. Cunningham, </em>497 S.W.2d 941 (Ct. App. Ky. 1973); <em>Nesbit v. Nesbit, </em>80 N.M. 294, 454 P.2d 776 (1969), or to the bankruptcy <em>court, Matter of Catlow, </em>663 F.2d 960 (9th Cir. 1981); <em>In re Spong, </em>661 F.2d 6 (2d Cir. 1981); <em>Shacter v. Shacter, </em>467 F. Supp. 64 (D. Md. 1979), <em>aff'd, </em>610 F.2d 813 (4th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Third, the Bank owed no duty to defendant to challenge the discharge in bankruptcy of the debt owed it by defendant and Denis. <em>In re Spong, supra, </em>cited by defendant, does not impose such duty on the Bank. In <em>Spong, </em>the judgment of divorce required the husband to pay the wife\u2019s attorney his fee in monthly installments. The attorney, as a creditor, resisted the discharge in bankruptcy of the fee owed him on the ground that the husband\u2019s undertaking to pay his wife\u2019s legal fee fell within the definition of alimony and support.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Fourth, inaction by the Bank did not constitute a release of Denis under the Uniform Joint Obligations Act, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) ch. 483 (1976). Defendant ingeniously argues that the Bank\u2019s failure to contest the discharge of Denis in bankruptcy constituted a release by the Bank of Denis from the Note, and that since such release was without reservation of rights against defendant, a joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>obligor, the Bank\u2019s claim against defendant was satisfied under HRS \u00a7 483-5, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">If an obligee releasing or discharging an obligor without express reservation of rights against a co-obligor, then knows or has reason to know that the obligor released or discharged did not pay so much of the claim as he was bound by his contract or relation with that co-obligor to pay, the obligee\u2019s claim against that co-obligor shall be satisfied to the amount which the obligee knew or had reason to know that the released or discharged obligor was bound to such co-obligor to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Defendant contends that the Bank had reason to know that Denis had agreed with defendant to assume and pay the entire balance of the Note. There is nothing in the record to support that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">We construe an HRS \u00a7 483-5 \u201crelease\u201d or \u201cdischarge\u201d to mean a voluntary and knowing release or discharge of an obligor by an obligee. See 76 C.J.S. <em>Release </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9, 24 (1952 &amp; Supp. 1982). Otherwise, the requirement of an \u201cexpress reservation of rights against a co-obligor\u201d is meaningless. An obligee\u2019s inaction under these circumstances cannot result in a \u00a7 483-5 release or discharge \u2014 constructive, implied or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Fifth, the bankruptcy and divorce cases cited by defendant and the Bankruptcy Act merely pronounce the public policy that a husband shall not be discharged in bankruptcy from his obligation for child support, maintenance and alimony. We are unaware of any public policy requiring the release of a wife from marital debts assumed by the husband in a divorce proceeding. Defendant in fact admits that the Decree did not release her obligation under the Note. So we fail to understand how \u201cpublic policy\u201d requires the intervening discharge of Denis in bankruptcy to result in defendant\u2019s release.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">Defendant claims that Denis was an indispensable party in this action. Thus, the trial court erred in denying her Rule 12(b), District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP) (1981),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> motion to dismiss. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Initially, we hold that being a co-obligor on the Note does not <em>per se </em>result in Denis being an indispensable party. The Bank\u2019s note expressly provides that it \u201cbinds jointly and severally all signing as Borrower.\u201d The general rule is that \u201cas joint and several obligations involve separate obligations on the part of each obligor each may be sued separately.\u201d 2 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 328, at 675 (W. Jaeger 3d ed. 1959 &amp; Supp. 1982). <em>See Jett v. Phillips </em>&amp; <em>Associates, </em>439 F.2d 987 (10th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Professor Hazard states that \u201can indispensable party is one whose relationship to the controversy is so immediate and so intimate that the court is said to be <em>unable </em>to proceed without him.\u201d G.C. Hazard, Jr., <em>Indispensable Party: The Historical Origin of a Procedural Phantom, </em>61 Colum. L. Rev. 1254 (1961) (emphasis in the original). The classic federal test in determining indispensability as set forth in <em>Shields v. Barrow, </em>58 U.S. (17 How.) 130, 15 L.Ed. 158 (1855) is that indispensable parties are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">Persons who not only have an interest in the controversy, but an interest of such a nature that a final decree cannot be made without either affecting that interest, or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final termination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and\" good conscience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">58 U.S. (17 How.) at 139, 15 L. Ed. at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Our supreme court has stated, \u201cThe rule regarding indispensable parties is founded on equitable considerations, and is not jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Midkiff v. Kobayashi, </em>54 Haw. 299, 324, 507 P.2d 724, 739 (1973). In determining indispensability, the courts have con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>sidered and weighed the following factors: (1) the possibility that an absent person will be adversely affected; (2) the possibility of inconsistent judicial decisions imposing undue hardship on the defendant; and (3) the likelihood of the defendant being harassed by multiple suits. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Indispensable Parties in the Federal Courts, </em>65 Harv. L. Rev. 1050 (1952); 3AJ. Moore &amp;J. D. <em>Lucas, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 19.07[1] (2d ed. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Applying the foregoing principles, we find that the trial court properly held that Denis was not an indispensable party. Having obtained a discharge in bankruptcy, there was no possibility of Denis being adversely affected by a decision for or against defendant. There could be no inconsistent decisions to impose undue hardship on defendant. Even if the family court or bankruptcy court should determine that Denis\u2019 assumption of the marital debts was in lieu of child support and alimony payments and, thus, such debts were not dischargeable in bankruptcy, that would not release defendant <em>visa-vis </em>plaintiff. Also, there is absolutely no likelihood of defendant being harassed by multiple suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Defendant claims that specification of an annual percentage rate of \u201c14:35%\u201d rather than \u201c14.35%\u201d violated the disclosure requirements of TILA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">This claim was first made in Defendant\u2019s Post-Trial Memorandum filed on August 25,1981, after the presentation of evidence had been completed on August 7, 1981. This was grossly unfair on the part of defendant since the Bank was deprived of an opportunity to present evidence that the alleged violation was unintentional and resulted from a bona fide error. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(c); <em>Turner v. Firestone Tire </em>&amp; <em>Rubber Co., </em>537 F.2d 1296 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Palmer v. Wilson, </em>502 F.2d 860 (9th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6B\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>Fred Paul Benco </em>for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AGK\"><em>Walter T. Shimoda </em>for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Be that as it may, we fail to see how the use of a colon instead of a decimal point in the annual percentage rate renders the disclosure to be \u201ctotally ambiguous\u201d and \u201cmeaningless\u201d as claimed by defendant. Defendant\u2019s contention that the annual percentage rate may be interpreted to mean 14/35% or be read as 35% or 14% is strained and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Further, the record indicates that the annual percentage rate was explained to defendant and Denis before they executed the Note. At trial, Hiroo Watanabe, branch manager of the Bank, testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">Q [Mr. Benco] Did you read that [the front page of the Note] to them or just summarize it in your own words?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">A I explained to them about the <em>percentage rate, </em>term of the loan, monthly payments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Transcript at 14 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">We hold that the trial court did not err in finding and concluding that there was no violation of disclosure requirements under TILA by the Bank. The dismissal of the counterclaim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-20\"> Finding of Fact No. 3 erroneously states that defendant and Denis were decreed to be divorced on January 5, 1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-13\"> Since the Bank raised the defense of statute of limitations against defendant\u2019s counterclaim, the case remained dormant pending the decision in <em>Pacific Concrete F.C.U. v. Kauanoe, </em>62 Haw. 334, 614 P.2d 936 (1980), which held that a debtor\u2019s counterclaim alleging TILA violations in a creditor\u2019s collection suit is in the nature of a recoupment defense and is not barred by the statute of limitations contained in TILA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b611-9\"> In 1976 when Denis filed for bankruptcy, Section 17A(7) of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)) provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, whether allowable in full or in part, except such .as ...

Now, however, Rule 12(b)(7), HRCP (1981), reads \u201c(7) failure to join a party under Rule 19,\u201d and thus differs from Rule 12(b)(7), DCRCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Prior to the 1972 amendment, Rule 19, HRCP, dealt with necessary joinder of parties. Rule 19, HRCP (1981), now deals with joinder of persons needed for just adjudication.
