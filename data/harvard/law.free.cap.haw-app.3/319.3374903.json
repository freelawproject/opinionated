F. Williams, Inc. (Williams), appeals the summary judgment against it in favor of defendant City and County of Honolulu (City), third-party defendant Yasuo Arakaki (Arakaki), and fourth-party defendant Dames and Moore (D&amp;M).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Sua sponte </em>we note that the judgment did not resolve all claims as to all parties and that it was not made final as permitted by Rule 54(b), Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (1972) (HRCP).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, we hold that under Rule 54(b) it is not appealable and that we do not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>Park v. Esperanza, </em>2 Haw. App. 232, 629 P.2d 644 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The facts are as follows: By contract dated December 6, 1968, City hired Arakaki as consulting engineer to prepare plans and specifications for the construction of a sewer system in Lanikai. Arakaki hired D&amp;M, a California general partnership, to prepare a soil investigation report, which it submitted on August 18, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Thereafter, City invited sealed bids on the project. Included in the bid/contract documents were copies of Arakaki\u2019s plans and specifications and City\u2019s General Provisions of Construction Contracts (June, 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">City awarded the contract to Williams on July 8, 1976, which commenced work on July 12, 1976. On September 16, 1976, while excavating a portion of the sewer line described as \u201cLine A,\u201d Williams unexpectedly encountered \u201cextremely dense hard live coral\u201d and thus was required to expend much more labor and material than originally estimated.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">On July 15, 1977, Williams asked City for additional compensation. On September 6,1977, City denied the claim. On July 19,1978, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Williams sued City alleging that the bid/contract documents represented that the ground through which the trenching had to be done was cemented sand, not hard coral.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">City sued Arakaki as a third-party defendant. Arakaki sued D&amp;M as a fourth-party defendant. Arakaki counterclaimed against City. D&amp;M counterclaimed against Arakaki and cross-claimed against City. City cross-claimed against D&amp;M.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">All parties moved for summary judgment. Williams asked only for partial summary judgment against City on the issue of liability. City asked only for judgment against Williams. Only Arakaki and D&amp;M asked'for judgment with respect to all claims filed by or against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">On February 7, 1980, the lower court entered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdW\">\n<em>ORDER GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENTS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">Motions for Summary Judgments by Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff CITY &amp; COUNTY OF HONOLULU, Third-Party Defendant/Fourth-Party Plaintiff YASUO ARAKAKI, and Fourth-Party Defendant DAMES &amp; MOORE, and a Motion for Summary Judgment by Plaintiff having come on regularly for hearing on January 29, 1980, memoranda of counsel having been reviewed and argument of counsel considered,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Motions for Summary Judgment by Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff CITY &amp; COUNTY OF HONOLULU, Third-Party Defendant/Fourth-Party Plaintiff YASUO ARAKAKI, and Fourth-Party Defendant DAMES &amp; MOORE be granted. Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment is hereby denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">Summary Judgment is hereby entered in favor of Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiff CITY &amp; COUNTY OF HO<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>NOLULU, Third-Party Defendant/Fourth-Party Plaintiff YASUO ARAKAKI, and Fourth-Party Defendant DAMES &amp; MOORE and against Plaintiff M. F. WILLIAMS, INC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACT\">Although the lower court specifically decided all motions, it issued only one corresponding judgment when it should have entered no less than three.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Although Rule 58, HRCP,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contains different language than Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we cite federal precedent and Rule 58, HRCP, in holding that the order granting and denying the motions (the second paragraph of the court\u2019s order) is not a \u201cjudgment\u201d as that word is used in Rules 54(a), 58, and 73(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>HRCP, and Rule 23, Rules of the Circuit Court of the State of Hawaii (1971).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 54.03 (2nd ed. 1982); 6A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6\u00b6 58.01 [8] and 58.02 (2nd ed. 1982). An order granting a motion for judgment is not a judgment unless it contains appropriate language such as is contained in the third paragraph of the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">We acknowledge that cases may have been decided and terminated in the past on the basis of an order worded as is the second paragraph. In those cases, the courts may have interpreted the relevant rules differently, may not have recognized the problem, or may have passed over the issue because it was never raised. In any event, the holding of this case will have prospective application only to pending and future cases. We do not intend, by this ruling, to resurrect terminate cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The third and final paragraph of the order is a \u201cjudgment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, the \u201cSummary Judgment\u201d \u201cin favor of\u201d Arakaki and D&amp;M \u201cand against\u201d Williams was erroneously issued because they asserted no claims against Williams and Williams asserted no claims against them. Thus, the only valid \u201cjudgment\u201d entered was the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cin favor of\u201d City \u201cand against\u201d Williams. There is no judgment in favor of D&amp;M and against Arakaki and City nor in favor of Arakaki and against City.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqig\"><em>Howard K. Hoddick (Hoddick, Reinwald, O\u2019Connor &amp; Marrack </em>of counsel) for plaintiff-appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Since the one valid \u201cjudgment\u201d did not \u201cadjudicate\u201d all the claims of all the parties, it did not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties and, absent court action under Rule 54(b), it is not final or appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Our analysis and decision is not a sanctification of procedure for procedure\u2019s sake. Since Rule 73(a)\u2019s critical thirty-day appeal period runs \u201cfrom the entry of the judgment appealed from,\u201d we must be very careful when we decide what is and what is not an appealable judgment. Practitioners have enough difficulty deciding when their notices of appeal must be filed. <em>See Employees\u2019 Retirement System v. Big Island Realty, Inc., </em>2 Haw. App. 151, 627 P.2d 304 (1981); <em>Sturkie v. Han, </em>2 Haw. App. 140, 627 P.2d 296 (1981). We ought not unnecessarily add to their confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">This case is a good example. Williams\u2019 suit against City alleges breach of warranty, misrepresentation, mistake, and negligence. All subsequent complaints, counterclaims, and cross-claims among City, Arakaki, and D&amp;M are for indemnification. All disputes other than the Williams-CCH dispute are dependent upon the disposition of that dispute. A ruling in favor of City moots all of the other disputes but it does not \u201cadjudicate\u201d them. Moreover, a ruling in favor of Williams does not moot nor adjudicate any of the other disputes. If the judgment appealed from is deemed to have finally disposed of all claims between all parties, then, since only Williams appealed, the judgments in favor of Arakaki against City and in favor of D&amp;M against Arakaki and City are unappealed and <em>res judicata. </em>That being the case, if this court decided to reverse the summary judgment and remand this case for trial, the trial would involve only Williams and City. City would not have Arakaki and D&amp;M to look to for indemnification, and City would suffer for not having appealed judgments that were never explicitly entered against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Hopefully, this case will encourage trial courts and counsel to be more assiduous in satisfying the mandates of Rule 58, HRCP, and Rule 23, RCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">Appeal dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Adrienne Sepaniak King, </em>Deputy Corporation Counsel, County of Honolulu, for defendant and third-party plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A8o\"><em>Michiro Iwanaga (Burke, Ashford, McPheeters, Broner &amp; Gilardy </em>of counsel) for third-party defendant and fourth-party plaintiffappellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A3A\"><em>Terence J.

When the court directs that a party recover only money or costs or that all relief be denied, the clerk shall enter judgment forthwith upon receipt by him of the direction; but when the court directs entry of judgment for other relief, the judge shall promptly settle or approve the form of the judgment and direct that it be entered by the clerk.
