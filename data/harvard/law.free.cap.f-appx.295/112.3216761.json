The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied the motion, and we review its order for abuse of discretion. <em>Arnold v. Nursing &amp; Rehab. Ctr. at Good Shepherd, LLC, </em>471 F.3d 843, 847 (8th Cir.2006). Its interpretation of the settlement agreement is reviewed de novo. <em>Gilbert v. Monsanto Co., </em>216 F.3d 695, 700 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-21\">The 1995 settlement agreement provided an initial fee award of $100,000 for the class attorneys, as well as additional fees \u201cif the plaintiffs obtain relief for a breach of this agreement.\u201d The agreement also specified that the \u201c[e]mployer is not liable for any other fees and costs of the class, unless it breaches this Settlement Agreement.\u201d The district court determined on March 28, 2007 that the Arkansas State Police Department had satisfied its obligations under the agreement, terminated court supervision of the department, and denied as moot a class motion to extend and enforce the agreement. The district court later denied a request by the class for an additional $203,500 in attorney fees for its efforts to ensure compliance with the agreement, pointing out that the settlement agreement unambiguously permitted additional fees only if the agreement were breached and a court awarded relief based on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award attorney fees under the agreement since the class did not show that it had obtained relief for any breach of it. The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-16\">.
