Fender contends that the court erred in refusing to count as Authority employees those employed by the Counties, so that she could establish the number of employees required to define the Association an \u201cemployer\u201d under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">Title VII prohibits employers, including local, state or governmental entities, from discriminating during the hiring process on the basis of sex. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a); <em>see also Rioux v. City of Atlanta, Ga., </em>520 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir.2008) (an employment discrimination suit applying Title VII to a local governmental entity). Title VII, however, limits the definition of an \u201cemployer\u201d to entities that have \u201cfifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b). The \u201cemployee-numerosity requirement\u201d is an element of a plaintiffs claim for relief, rather than a jurisdictional issue. <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Cory., </em>546 U.S. 500, 515, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 1245, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">In <em>Lyes v. City of Riviera Beach, Florida, </em>166 F.3d 1332 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc), </em>we addressed the appropriate test for determining whether separate local government entities should be aggregated as a single employer for the purposes of meeting the statutory definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 1341. We held that \u201cwhere a state legislative body creates a public entity and declares it to be separate and distinct, that declaration should be entitled to a significant degree of deference, amounting to a presumption that the public entity is indeed separate and distinct for purposes of Title VIL\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1344. If a \u201cfact finder reasonably could conclude the plaintiff has <em>clearly </em>overcome the presumption\u201d that the entities are separate, the employees are aggregated. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>at 1345 (emphasis in original). The standard is high, however, and the presumption is only overcome with strong evidence. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\"><em>Lyes </em>articulated two ways to rebut the presumption against aggregating the employees of separate government entities. <em>See Lyes, </em>166 F.3d at 1345. First, a plaintiff may rebut it by presenting evidence that a governmental entity was created or maintained to evade federal employment discrimination law. <em>See id. </em>at 1344. Second, and absent an evasive purpose, a plaintiff can show that a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the presumption is clearly outweighed. <em>See id. </em>at 1345-46. The plaintiff must show it is outweighed by \u201cfactors manifestly indicating that the public entities are so closely interrelated with respect to control of the fundamental aspects of the employment relationship that they should be counted together under Title VII.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1345. Relevant factors in this analysis include, but are not limited to: centralized control of operations; authority to hire, transfer, promote, discipline or discharge; authority to establish work schedules or direct assignments; and obligation to pay the plaintiff. <em>See id. </em>We noted that \u201cthe source of a governmental entity\u2019s funding is a poor indication of whether it should be aggregated with another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1346 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Under Georgia law, two or more counties may create a joint authority for the purpose of operating emergency 911 systems. <em>See </em>1993 Ga. Laws 1368, <em>amended </em>by 1998 Ga. Laws 1017 (current version at Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 46-5-138 (Supp.2007)). An authority created under this statute has \u201call of the powers necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate\u201d the provision of emergency 911 services, including the power to \u201cbring and defend actions\u201d and \u201cto make and execute contracts.\u201d Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 46-5-138(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">Since the Authority has never had more than fifteen employees, and Fender has not presented evidence either establishing that the Counties created or maintained the Authority to evade Title VII or clearly overcoming the presumption that the Authority and the Counties are separate entities, the district court did not err in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-7\">. A separate test applies to determine if multiple parties constitute a \u201cjoint employer.\u2019\u2019 <em>See e.g., Virgo v. Riviera Beach Assoc., Ltd., </em>30 F.3d 1350, 1359-60 (11th Cir.1994). Because Fender did not raise this before the district court and does not do so on appeal, any claim in this respect is deemed waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
