TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">This matter is before the court following receipt of the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s answer to the questions we certified on September 11, 2007. <em>See Mecham v. Frazier, </em>193 P.3d 630, 2008 UT 60 (Utah 2008). In that answer, the court ruled (1) the Utah Governmental Immunity Act does confer immunity from suit for state officers, and (2) that the Act does not require a notice of claim against state officials, in their individual capacities, to expressly aver \u201cfraud\u201d or \u201cmalice.\u201d 193 P.3d 630, 111. Rather, the UGIA \u201crequires that a notice of claim contain only (1) a brief statement of the facts, (2) the nature of the claim asserted, and (3) the damages incurred by the claimant so far as they are known.\u201d <em>Id. </em>UK 19, 21 (\u201cUGIA requires only enough specificity in the notice to inform as to the nature of the claim so that the defendant can appraise its potential liability.\u201d (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In light of the Utah Supreme Court\u2019s decision, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dated October 6, 2004, and remand this matter to the United States District Court for the District of Utah with instructions to conduct additional proceedings in accord with the state court\u2019s decision. We note in this regard that no federal questions remain in this appeal in light of our decision in related appeal number 05^1297. <em>See Mecham v. Frazier, </em>500 F.3d 1200 (10th Cir.2007). As a result, this Order and Judgment disposes of all remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Consequently, the abatement is lifted, the decision of the district court is VACATED, and this matter is REMANDED for further proceedings in accord with this Order and Judgment. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b294-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
