Torrence, a prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>seeks a writ of mandamus compelling the District Court to order production of discovery materials. For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-25\">Torrence filed a complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against prison officials in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Torrence has filed four motions requesting that the District Court order the production of allegedly discoverable information. The Court denied three such motions, and one remains pending.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>In his petition, Torrence alleges that the District Court arbitrarily denied his discovery motions and colluded with Defendants to deny Torrence a fair trial. He alleges that such actions violate his rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and seeks a writ directing the District Court to order that Defendants produce the sought-after information.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Mandamus is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d that we have discretion to award only when a petitioner demonstrates, among other things, a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to relief. <em>In re Pressman-Gutman Co., </em>459 F.3d 383, 398-99 (3d Cir.2006). Mandamus lies only when there is no other remedy, <em>Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court for the S. Dist. of Iowa, </em>490 U.S. 296, 309, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989), and must not be used as a mere substitute for appeal. <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 379 (3d Cir.2005). Because Torrence\u2019s petition amounts to an appeal of the District Court\u2019s denial of his discovery motions, mandamus is not an appropriate remedy and we deny his petition. <em>See Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Philippines, </em>951 F.2d 1414, 1422 (3d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-16\">.
