On appeal, Broxton argues that the district court erred by: (1) using hearsay in determining his sentence, in violation of the Confrontation Clause; and (2) imposing an unreasonable sentence when it varied from a guidelines range of 97-121 months\u2019 imprisonment to a total sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-18\">If a defendant does not raise his allegation of sentencing error before the district court, we review the issue only for plain error. <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1227 (11th Cir.2006) (reviewing for plain error a defendant\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred during sentencing by relying on hearsay testimony in violation of the Confrontation Clause). \u201cUnder plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) affects substantial rights. When these three factors are met, we may exercise discretion and correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We review the ultimate sentence the district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.Bd 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">First, Broxton has not shown that the district court erred by using hearsay in determining his sentence in violation of the Confrontation Clause. \u201c \u2018Hearsay5 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Fed. R.Evid. 801(e). In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights under the Confrontation Clause prohibit the use of \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay unless the witness was unavailable at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him. However, we have refused to extend <em>Crawford </em>to the sentencing context, and have held that a sentencing court may consider reliable hearsay in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1253-54 &amp; n. 68 (11th Cir.2005) (observing that, because <em>Crawford </em>did not address sentencing, the use of reliable hearsay at sentencing was unaltered by that decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Here, there is no evidence that the statements Broxton complains of were actually used during his \u2014 as opposed to his codefendant\u2019s \u2014 sentencing hearing. However, even if these statements, or any other alleged hearsay, were used at Broxton\u2019s hearing, their use would not violate his rights because we permit the use of reliable hearsay at sentencing. <em>See id. </em>Thus, applying a plain error standard of review \u2014 which we must since Broxton did not raise this objection before the district court \u2014 we cannot say that the district court erred, much less plainly erred, in relying on hearsay when imposing Broxton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Broxton likewise has not demonstrated that his sentence is unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c\u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States,</em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c\u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cThe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The district court is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). It is sufficient if the district court acknowledges that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1274, 1280-81 (2007), we addressed the sentence of Broxton\u2019s codefendant and determined that her sentence, including the upward variance from a guidelines range of 51-63 months to a total term of imprisonment of 240 months, was reasonable. We noted that the district court stated that it considered, among other things, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and noted how some of them applied to Turner\u2019s case. In addition, the district court found the guidelines range inadequate due to Broxton and Turner\u2019s discussions about how, if Broxton had been home when the federal agents had come to execute the search warrant at his and Turner\u2019s house, he would have killed the federal agents and the two of them would have then fled the country. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The district court used almost identical language to explain the sentences of both Turner and Broxton, and imposed a very similar upward variance in both cases. In so doing, district court expressly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and how relevant factors applied to Broxton, and stated its concern about Broxton\u2019s telephone conversations regarding murdering federal agents. On this record, Broxton\u2019s sentence \u2014 for many of the same reasons as Turner\u2019s \u2014 was reasonable, <em>Turner, </em>474 F.3d at 1281, and Broxton has not met his burden of showing otherwise. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
