Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Such a causal nexus is required to support the grant of asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2006); <em>Abdel-Rahman v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 444, 450-51 (4th Cir.2007); <em>Saldarriaga v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 461, 466 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-19\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Eseme\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Eseme fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-20\">Finally, we affirm the denial of Eseme\u2019s request for protection under the CAT. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Eseme\u2019s evidence did not establish that it is more likely than not that he would be subjected to torture at the hands of government agents or with their acquiescence if he were to return to Cameroon. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2008) (to establish eligibility for CAT protection, the applicant must show that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-21\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
