Tykarsky\u2019s challenges to his convictions were raised in a previous appeal to this Court. <em>See United States v. Tykarsky, </em>446 F.3d 458 (3d Cir.2006). There, we joined several of our sister courts of appeals in holding that the involvement of an actual minor, as distinguished from an adult government decoy, is not a prerequisite for conviction under \u00a7 2422(b) or \u00a7 2423(b). We upheld Tykarsky\u2019s conviction but remanded for re-sentencing. After his re-sentencing, Tykarsky filed this appeal, raising previously adjudicated issues to preserve them for review by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">We do not reconsider previously addressed issues concerning convictions after limited remand for re-sentencing. In <em>United States v. Kikumura, </em>947 F.2d 72 (3d Cir.1991), we held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">[A defendant] cannot continue to litigate questions already decided by this Court in a prior proceeding.... Indeed, under the law of the case doctrine, when a court \u201cdecides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 77 (quoting <em>Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 816, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988)). The judgment of the District Court will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-10\">.
