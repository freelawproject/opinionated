We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-22\">This court has jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand to apply for adjustment of status. <em>See Ochoa-Amaya v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2007). In a motion to remand, \u201cit is the movant\u2019s burden to establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BIA may deny a motion to remand if the movant has failed to meet his burden of establishing prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. <em>Id. </em>at 992-93. Mata Torres failed to prove that he has a visa immediately available to him, as is required to establish prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status. Thus, we cannot say that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-23\">This court also has jurisdiction to review claims regarding administrative closure. <em>See Alcaraz v. INS, </em>384 F.3d 1150, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>1161 (9th Cir.2004). Administrative closure is \u201can administrative convenience\u201d that allows removal of a case from the immigration judge\u2019s calendar only if both parties to the removal proceeding agree. <em>Matter of Lopez-Barrios, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 203, 204 (BIA 1990). The Department of Homeland Security opposed Mata Torres\u2019s request for administrative closure, and therefore we cannot say that the BIA erred in denying the opposed request for administrative closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
