The district court enhanced Gutierrez-Chavez\u2019s sentence by eight levels based on a determination that his second state law conviction for possession of marijuana qualified as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-17\">Gutierrez-Chavez contends that in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47,127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), his second state law conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony. In <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008), we rejected the same arguments made by Gutierrez-Chavez in this appeal. For the reasons set forth in <em>Cepeda-Rios, </em>we also affirm Gutierrez-Chavez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-22\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Gutierrez-Chavez challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
