Judge Sifton sentenced Anzora to a term of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was at the lowest end of the 46-57 month Guidelines range. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">On appeal, Anzora argues that his sentence was proeedurally and substantively unreasonable. The standard for reasonableness review \u201cis akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006). Such review \u201cdoes not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In determining \u201cwhether a sentence is reasonable, [the Court] ought to consider whether the sentencing judge \u2018exceeded the bounds of allowable discretion^] ... committed an error of law in the course of exercising discretion, or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir.2005)). We have previously recognized that \u201cin the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Judge Sifton sentenced Anzora to a term of imprisonment at the low end of the advisory Guidelines range. We have considered Anzora\u2019s arguments and conclude that his sentence was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
