The district court sentenced him to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment but later reduced that term to 90 months in light of Rayford\u2019s substantial assistance. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CrimP. 35(b). Rayford, though, violated the terms of his supervised release shortly after he was discharged from custody in 2006. His probation officer reported in January 2007 that Rayford had been arrested on separate occasions for domestic battery and assault. Rather than revoking Rayford\u2019s supervised release \u2014 as the probation officer recommended initially \u2014 the district court amended the conditions of Rayford\u2019s supervised release to include drug and alcohol treatment, mental-health treatment, and a twelve-month stay at a Salvation Army halfway house. But Ray-ford did not last long at the halfway house; he racked up three unexcused absences in five weeks, refused to take a breathalyzer test, and was finally asked to leave the program. His probation officer recommended revocation a second time in May 2007, but before the court could hold another hearing, Rayford pleaded guilty to a slew of new state charges \u2014 domestic battery, assault, and criminal damage to property \u2014 and was sentenced to 120 days\u2019 imprisonment. At a revocation hearing in August 2007, the district court revoked Rayford\u2019s supervised release and imposed another 36 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">Rayford appeals, but his attorney is at a loss for nonfrivolous arguments and has asked to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We invited Rayford to comment on the pending motion. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b). He did not respond. That leaves us with only the one potential issue posed in counsel\u2019s supporting brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">Counsel questions whether Rayford could argue that his term of reimprisonment is unreasonable but concludes that the contention would be frivolous. We agree. Our review of additional imprisonment imposed on revocation of supervised release asks whether the term is plainly unreasonable, a very narrow standard. <em>United States v. Kizeart, </em>505 F.3d 672, 675 (7th Cir.2007). A district court must consider the policy statements found in Chap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>ter 7 of the guidelines and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) before determining an appropriate period of reimprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>United States v. Neal, </em>512 F.3d 427, 438 (7th Cir.2008). In Rayford\u2019s case the court acknowledged that the revocation table recommended an imprisonment range of 5 to 11 months given Rayford\u2019s Grade C violations and his criminal history category of III. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. Yet the court opted for a longer term-36 months-in light of Rayford\u2019s failure to \u201cadjust[ ] at all to supervision.\u201d In reaching its decision, the court noted that Rayford had become \u201can extreme burden on the probation office\u201d and had not modified his behavior despite numerous opportunities for mental-health treatment and anger-management counseling. That is ample consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
