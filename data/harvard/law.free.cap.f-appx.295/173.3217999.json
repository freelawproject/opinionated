Specifically, he challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a sixteen-level enhancement for having a previous conviction of a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), a 1996 conviction in New York for manslaughter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also alleges that his Sixth Amendment right to a jury was violated because the district court relied on facts not found by a jury to sentence him. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-15\">In reviewing sentences <em>post-Book</em>er; we first determine whether the district court correctly calculated the Sentencing Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 991 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Grissom, </em>525 F.3d 691, 696 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-17\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1) states: \u201cIf the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after \u2014 (A) a conviction for a felony that is ... (ii) a crime of violence ..., increase [the offense level] by 16 levels.\u201d Comment l(B)(iii) to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and specifically lists manslaughter. Manslaughter thus qualifies as a <em>per se </em>crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Guzman, </em>506 F.3d 738, 742-44 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cWhen an offense is specifically enumerated by the Application Notes as a \u2018crime of violence,\u2019 we have consistently drawn the conclusion that the offense is a <em>per se </em>crime of violence under the Guidelines.\u201d). Nevertheless, we still apply the <em>Taylor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>categorical/modified categorical inquiry with respect to a <em>per se </em>crime of violence to ensure that the \u201cstatutory definition used by [the state court] comports with the generic and contemporary meaning of the offense of\u2019 manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Sanguino was convicted of first degree manslaughter in 1996 under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 125.20. Sanguino argues that because N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 125.20(3) defines manslaughter to include the death of a woman resulting from an abortional act committed on the victim who has been pregnant for at least 24 weeks, \u00a7 125.20 is not categorically a crime of violence;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he also argues that his record of conviction is insufficient to demonstrate he was actually convicted of a crime of violence under the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">We need not resolve whether \u00a7 125.20(3) is categorically a crime of violence because Sanguino\u2019s record of conviction is sufficient to affirm the sentencing enhancement under the modified categorical approach. The government urges us to rely on three documents: the sentence and commitment form and the indictment, both of which were presented to the district court, as well as the transcript of Sanguino\u2019s 1996 manslaughter plea colloquy before the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Queens: Criminal Term, Park K-2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The sentence and commitment form specifically refers to indictment number 3564-95. The indictment, which bears the same number identified on the sentence and commitment form, lists the statutory basis for the count as \u201c125.20-1,\u201d an obvious reference to N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 125.20(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The indictment describes the offense with this paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">The defendant, on or about July 30, 1995, in the County of Queens, with intent to cause serious physical injury to Marcos Lezama, struck Marcos Lezama in the eye with a metal plant stand, and thereby inflicted a wound which penetrated Marcos Lezama\u2019s brain and thereby caused his death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">The sentence and commitment form and the indictment clearly demonstrate that Sanguino was convicted for violating \u00a7 125.20(1), not \u00a7 125.20(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">The transcript of the plea colloquy eliminates any doubt about which subsection served as the basis of Sanguino\u2019s conviction. During the plea colloquy, Sanguino specifically admitted that he threw a metal plant stand at the victim and that he did so with the intent to hurt the victim. This colloquy demonstrates that Sanguino\u2019s \u201cplea ... \u2018necessarily\u2019 rested on the fact identifying\u201d the crime of conviction as a crime of violence. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 21, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Vidal, </em>504 F.3d 1072,1086 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (listing plea colloquy as one of the documents that is appropriate to consult during the modified categorical analysis (citing <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254)).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">This record conclusively establishes that Sanguino was convicted for what is traditionally understood as generic voluntary manslaughter, not for anything even approaching \u201cabortional act\u201d manslaughter as defined in N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 125.20(3). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>We reject Sanguino\u2019s challenge to the sentence enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Sanguino\u2019s second argument focuses on the continuing vitality of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in light of subsequent Supreme Court cases. As Sanguino concedes, we have repeatedly addressed and rejected all of these arguments. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d 748, 751 n. 3 (9th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Grisel, </em>488 F.3d 844, 846-47 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc); <em>United States v. Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d 1090, 1096-97 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cAll of these arguments ... are squarely foreclosed by our precedents.\u201d). We therefore summarily reject them again here.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b200-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
