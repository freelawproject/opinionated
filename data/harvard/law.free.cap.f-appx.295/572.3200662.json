He was sentenced to 185 months\u2019 imprisonment and a five-year term of supervised release. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the federal prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Government has responded, and Jackson has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-16\">Defense counsel argues that Jackson\u2019s federal prosecution violates the prohibition against double jeopardy because he was previously charged by the state of North Carolina for the same conduct that formed the basis for his federal prosecution. The Double Jeopardy Clause protects a defendant from repeated prosecution for the same offense, including the right to have guilt or innocence decided in a proceeding once jeopardy has attached. <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 672-73, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982). Jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury is empaneled and sworn. <em>Crist v. Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 37-38, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978); <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 388, 95 S.Ct. 1055, 43 L.Ed.2d 265 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">Although the Double Jeopardy Clause generally protects against successive prosecutions for the same offense, the dual sovereignty exception usually eliminates the double jeopardy bar to a federal prosecution after a state prosecution. <em>See Heath v. Alabama, </em>474 U.S. 82, 89, 106 S.Ct. 433, 88 L.Ed.2d 387 (1985) (\u201c[T]he Court has uniformly held that the States are separate sovereigns with respect to the Federal Government because each State\u2019s power to prosecute is derived from its own \u2018inherent sovereignty,\u2019 not from the Federal Government.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Rinaldi v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 22, 28, 98 S.Ct. 81, 54 L.Ed.2d 207 (1977) (\u201c[T]he Constitution does not deny the State and Federal Governments the power to prosecute for the same act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">The only recognized exception to the dual sovereignty doctrine is the sham pros-</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>ecution exception, which applies when federal and state prosecutors have manipulated the system in order to achieve the equivalent of a second prosecution. This exception requires proof that Jackson\u2019s federal prosecution was \u201ca sham and a cover\u201d for a second state prosecution. <em>Bartkus v. Illinois, </em>359 U.S. 121, 124, 79 S.Ct. 676, 3 L.Ed.2d 684 (1959). We find no evidence of a sham prosecution; we therefore find Jackson\u2019s double jeopardy claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We further find Jackson\u2019s claims regarding his armed career criminal status raised in his pro se supplemental brief without merit. We therefore affirm Jackson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Jackson, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Jackson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Jackson. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
