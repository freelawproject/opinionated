The four of them entered the United States on tourist visas in May of 1992, but they remained in the country beyond the time period authorized by their visas. Removal proceedings were inexplicably not initiated against the family until over 10 years later. They all conceded that they were subject to removal, but requested relief in the form of cancellation of removal pursuant to \u00a7 240A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b and, in the alternative, voluntary departure pursuant to \u00a7 240B of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c. Following a hearing in August 2006, the Immigration Judge (IJ) denied their applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-15\">The IJ concluded that the Alshareqis had failed to demonstrate the level of hardship necessary to warrant the discretionary relief of cancellation of removal. In a <em>per curiam </em>order, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) subsequently dismissed the Alshareqis\u2019 appeal. The Alshareqis timely petitioned this court for review, arguing that the IJ and the BIA had improperly decided the question of hardship. For the reasons set forth below, we DISMISS IN PART for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and DENY the remainder of the petition on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ai\">A. Factual background</p>\n<p id=\"b29-17\">Abdulelah and Anissah Alshareqi have been married since 1991. The couple has had seven children together. Mahran is the only one of their children not born in the United States. He was born in Yemen. Abdulelah also had two children from a previous marriage, Dhiyab and Hamis. They too were born in Yemen. The Alshareqi couple and the three Yemen-born children came to the United States in 1992. Because of their birth outside of the United States, Dhiyab, Hamis, and Mahran are the only children included in the removal proceedings against the Alshareqis. Dhiyab allegedly left the United States in 2003, causing the IJ to order his removal <em>in absentia </em>at the hearing in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-18\">At that hearing, testimony was received from Abdulelah, Anissah, Anissah\u2019s brother, and the Alshareqis\u2019 two oldest United States citizen children. The general thrust of the evidence presented was that (1) the educational opportunities for women in Yemen are significantly less than those available in the United States, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the quality of medical care is inferior, and (3) the Alshareqis\u2019 daughters would not be able to participate in many of the activities that they currently enjoy, such as watching television shows of their choosing, going to the movies, and spending time with friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Abdulelah also offered testimony regarding an asylum application that he filed in 1993. After filing the application, however, he never completed the process. Abdulelah nevertheless mistakenly believed that he had been granted asylum. In his 2006 application for cancellation of removal, Abdulelah indicated that he had \u201cgiven false testimony for the purposes of obtaining immigration benefits.\u201d Abdulelah acknowledged during cross-examination that he had told the attorney who filled out his application for cancellation of removal that he had \u201cfiled for political asylum to get an employment authorization card.\u201d But he explained that he did not intentionally lie on his asylum application and that he did not know that his attorney had stated on the cancellation-of-removal application that Abdulelah had given false testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">B. Procedural background</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Removal proceedings were initiated against Abdulelah in 2002 and against the other Alshareqis in 2003. The Alshareqis conceded that they are subject to removal, but requested relief in the form of cancellation of removal and, in the alternative, voluntary departure. They did not seek asylum. A hearing on their applications for cancellation of removal was held in August of 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Following the witnesses\u2019 testimony, the IJ concluded that the Alshareqis were not eligible for cancellation of removal. The IJ addressed Abdulelah\u2019s and Anissah\u2019s applications first, because the childrens\u2019 applications are dependent on the IJ granting relief to the parents. In a lengthy order, the IJ discussed the Alshareqis\u2019 testimony about the alleged hardship that their children would suffer if the family moved to Yemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">On appeal, the BIA agreed with the decision of the IJ denying the applications for cancellation of removal. The BIA determined that the IJ had given proper weight \u201cto evidence in the record regarding country conditions, educational benefits, social benefits, and the decrease in the respondents\u2019 children\u2019s lifestyle upon return to Yemen.\u201d Ultimately, the BIA concluded that those \u201cfactors, whether considered individually or cumulatively, do not rise to the level of \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual\u2019 \u201d hardship. The Alshareqis timely petitioned for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">A. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">We review de novo the existence of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Abu-Khaliel v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 627, 630 (6th Cir.2006). Alleged due process violations are also reviewed de novo. <em>Garza-Moreno v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 239, 241 (6th Cir.2007). We review the denial of a continuance under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Abur-Khaliel, </em>436 F.3d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-13\">B. Cancellation of removal and the Alshareqis\u2019 due process claim</p>\n<p id=\"b30-14\">A nonpermanent resident alien is eligible for the discretionary relief of cancellation of removal if the alien</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-15\">(A) has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less that 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-16\">(B) has been a person of good moral character during such period;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-17\">(C) has not been convicted of an offense under [\u00a7\u00a7 212(a)(2), 237(a)(2), or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>237(a)(3) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3) ]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">(D) establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). Although there was some analysis by the IJ as to whether Abdulelah would qualify for cancellation of removal \u201cas a matter of discretion\u201d based on his failure to pursue the asylum application that he filed in 1993, the BIA dismissed the Alshareqis\u2019 appeal solely on the basis of their failure to establish the requisite \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to a qualifying relative. The dispositive question, therefore, is whether Abdulelah\u2019s and Anissah\u2019s American-born children would suffer such a hardship if their parents were removed. With respect to Hamis and Mahran, they do not have any qualifying relatives unless their parents are granted the relief of cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">We lack the authority, however, to review the underlying merits of the Alshareqis\u2019 request for cancellation of removal. Section 242(a)(2)(B)\u00ae of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, explicitly provides that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b [cancellation of removal] of this title.\u201d This explicit limitation on our appellate jurisdiction has been interpreted by this court, and by all of our sister circuits that have addressed the issue, to prohibit review of the hardship determination. <em>Santana-Albarran v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 699, 703 (6th Cir.2005) (explaining that this court has jurisdiction to review the \u201cnon-discretionary factual determination\u201d that an alien has \u201cfailed to demonstrate a continuous physical presence,\u201d but citing <em>Valenzuela-Alcantar v. INS, </em>309 F.3d 946, 950 (6th Cir.2002), for the proposition that \u201cthe IJ\u2019s determination of the extreme-hardship issue is discretionary and thus, not subject to judicial review\u201d); <em>see also De La Vega v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006) (concluding that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae deprives the court of appellate jurisdiction regarding cancellation of removal on the basis that the alien fails to demonstrate \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d) (citing cases from other circuits to the same effect).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The Alshareqis attempt to circumvent this explicit jurisdictional bar by repeatedly asserting that they \u201cdo not challenge the BIA\u2019s decision itself but the method employed by the BIA in reaching its decision.\u201d According to the Alshareqis, the IJ and the BIA did not apply the proper test for determining eligibility for cancellation of removal and therefore violated the Alshareqis\u2019 due process rights. The Alshareqis contend that the BIA \u201cfailed to demonstrate that it properly weighed all of the relevant factors used in assessing hardship.\u201d Notably, however, they do not elaborate on which specific factors the BIA allegedly failed to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">They also raise a challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination that Abdulelah was not entitled to cancellation of removal because he had previously lied on an asylum application in order to obtain authorization to work in the United States. This argument ignores that fact that even if Abdulelah\u2019s asylum application did not call into question whether he was \u201cof good moral character,\u201d the IJ and BIA ultimately concluded that Abdulelah and Anissah were ineligible for cancellation of removal because they failed to demonstrate that their children would suffer the necessary hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Despite our lack of jurisdiction over the underlying discretionary determination of whether the Alshareqis\u2019 children would suffer hardship if their parents were removed, we retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or matters of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Almuhtaseb v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 743, 748 (6th Cir.2006). The Alshareqis\u2019 claim that their due process rights were violated, and \u201cFifth Amendment guarantees of due process extend to aliens in deportation proceedings, entitling them to a full and fair hearing.\u201d <em>Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 696, 699 (6th Cir.2001). But this court has explicitly held that \u201c[t]he failure to be granted discretionary relief does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700; <em>Ashki v. INS, </em>233 F.3d 913, 921 (6th Cir.2000) (concluding that an illegal alien \u201chas no constitutionally-protected liberty interest in obtaining discretionary relief from deportation\u201d). Putting aside the fact that the Alshareqis\u2019 due process claim is little more than an attempt to have us review the unreviewable discretionary determination of whether their United States citizen children would suffer extreme hardship, we conclude that they have no due process rights to cancellation of removal for the reasons articulated in <em>Huicochear-Gomez </em>and <em>Ashki.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Because we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s factual determination related to hardship and because we conclude that Abdulelah\u2019s and Anissah\u2019s due process rights were not violated, there is no need to address whether the IJ abused her discretion in denying Hamis\u2019s and Mahran\u2019s motion to sever and continue them individual claims. Hamis\u2019s and Mahran\u2019s eligibility for cancellation of removal depends entirely on whether their parents are awarded relief. Because Abdulelah and Anissah were denied the relief of cancellation of removal, and because no due process claim exists with respect to that decision, there can be no abuse of discretion by the IJ in denying their children\u2019s motion to sever and continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we DISMISS IN PART for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and DENY the remainder of the petition on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
