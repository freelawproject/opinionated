Horn denying Liu\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xue Liu, </em>No. A 95 688 235 (B.I.A. June 11, 2007), <em>ajfg </em>No. A 95 688 235 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 20, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">The BIA explicitly declined to adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and instead accepted Liu\u2019s testimony as credible. When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). In this appeal, therefore, we review both the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s decisions, with the exception of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhang v. US. I.N.S., </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>522 U.S. 359, 377, 118 S.Ct. 818, 139 L.Ed.2d 797 (1998) (explaining that \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review \u201cgives the agency the benefit of the doubt, since it requires not the degree of evidence which satisfies the <em>couR </em>that the requisite fact exists, but merely the degree which <em>could </em>satisfy a reasonable factfinder\u201d). However, we will vacate and remand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005) (rejecting the Immigration Judge\u2019s conclusions when he \u201crelied on speculation, failed to consider all of the significant evidence, and appeared to place undue reliance on the fact that [certain] documents were not authenticated\u201d); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006) (agreeing that \u201cerror-infected finding[s]\u201d could be remanded, but avoiding remand because it was clear that the IJ would adhere to the decision were the case remanded).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Even accepting Liu\u2019s testimony as credible, the BIA nonetheless affirmed the IPs determination that Liu failed to demonstrate past persecution on account of a protected ground. Substantial evidence supports that determination. Liu admitted that she did not practice Falun Gong in China and had no connection to the movement other than through her older sister, a Falun Gong practitioner, who asked her to hand out flyers about the movement. In January 2004, Liu agreed to pass out flyers disguised as a New Year\u2019s gift. She was arrested for this conduct in February 2004, and during her day-long detention she was interrogated and hit in the face five or six times. Liu testified she was released because the authorities accepted her story that she was unaware of the contents of the flyer, and because she promised not to get involved in Falun Gong. It is undisputed that the Chinese government took no further action directed at Liu arising out of her individual involvement in Falun Gong and the single February 2004 incident does not rise to the level of \u201cpersecution\u201d as defined in the INA. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that to constitute persecution, the harm must rise above \u201cmere harassment\u201d); <em>Tsering v. Mukasey, </em>263 Fed.Appx. 142, 145 (2d Cir.2008) (two periods of detention, each for multiple days, did not \u201cdemonstrate that [the petitioner] suffered harm that was sufficiently severe to constitute persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The other two incidents of alleged persecution recounted by Liu were also related to her sister\u2019s involvement in Falun Gong, not hers, and for that reason were properly given less weight by the BIA and IJ. <em>Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc) (\u201c[Applicants can become candidates for asylum relief only based on persecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer.\u201d). In the June 2004 incident, authorities briefly detained and beat Liu\u2019s sister, who thereafter went into hiding. No harm was inflicted on Liu personally as a result of this incident. In the July 2004 incident, village officials searching for Liu\u2019s sister visited Liu\u2019s house and when Liu would not give up her sister\u2019s location, they beat Liu, although they did not take her into custody. The harm inflicted on Liu on this occasion was on account of her refusal to cooperate with the officials, not on account of a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The BIA and IJ properly concluded that the February, June and July 2004 incidents, even when considered in the aggregate, did not establish a pattern of persecution against Liu. <em>See Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Security, </em>494 F.3d 281, 290 (2d Cir.2007) (indicating that the IJ must take \u201c \u2018[t]he cumulative effect of the applicant\u2019s experience ... into account\u2019 \u201d in evaluating claims of persecution (quoting <em>Poradisova v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 70, 80 (2d Cir.2005))). A reasonable factfinder could decide that Liu failed to carry her burden of establishing that she suffered harm because of her individual involvement in a protected activity. <em>See Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 137, 141 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cAs a general principle, an asylum appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>cant cannot claim past persecution based solely on harm that was inflicted on a family member on account of that family member\u2019s political opinion or other protected characteristic. That is because an applicant must rely upon harm the applicant has suffered individually.\u201d (citation omitted)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Petitioner argues that the BIA applied an improper standard for past persecution by failing to consider the context of the two incidents in which Liu was beaten. Specifically, petitioner relies on background materials (made part of the record) that document the Chinese government\u2019s actions to eradicate the Falun Gong movement. However, it is undisputed that after the February 2004 incident, the government exhibited no further interest in Liu\u2019s personal connection to Falun Gong, and any subsequent harm to Liu was a result of her failure to cooperate with the investigation of her sister. This context was fully appreciated and considered by the BIA and IJ, and supplies the underpinning of their decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Liu\u2019s claim concerning future persecution is further diminished by her testimony that her parents and sister continue to live in the same house and that her sister continues to practice Falun Gong in private, even while being \u201cmonitored\u201d by the Chinese government. <em>See Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 813 (2d Cir.1999) (finding that where asylum applicant\u2019s mother and daughters continued to live in petitioner\u2019s native country, a claim of well-founded fear was diminished). In addition, Liu testified that, as of the date of her removal proceeding, she had no connection to the movement other than reading books and teaching herself the practice at home. She admitted to familiarity with just the first of the five exercises. The only evidence she offered as to her personal involvement in Falun Gong were photographs, all taken on the same day, of herself alone striking poses purportedly part of the practice. Since entering the United States, Liu has not engaged in any public Falun Gong activities, or become a member of any organization that does. No independent corroboration of Liu\u2019s practice of Falun Gong was presented to the IJ. \u201c[Wjhere the circumstances indicate that an applicant has, or with reasonable effort could gain, access to relevant corroborating evidence, his failure to produce such evidence in support of his claim is a factor that may be weighed in considering whether he has satisfied the burden of proof.\u201d <em>Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">As Liu did not meet her burden of proof to support her asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Because Liu has failed to sufficiently challenge the denial of her CAT claim before this Court, and because addressing this challenge does not appear to be necessary to avoid manifest injustice, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">For the foregoing reasons, Liu\u2019s petition is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\">. The BIA\u2019s decision appears to merge the June and July incidents into one; however, the IJ\u2019s decision separately and accurately summarized Liu\u2019s testimony about all three incidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
