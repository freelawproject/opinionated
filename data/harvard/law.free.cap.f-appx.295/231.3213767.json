Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review a dismissal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i) for an abuse of discretion and we review de novo a claim that the summary dismissal violated the petitioner\u2019s due process rights. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 1006, 1009 (9th Cir.2005). We deny in part and dismiss in pai\u2019t the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-25\">The BIA\u2019s summary dismissal of Jiron-Gutierres\u2019 appeal was not an abuse of discretion because he failed to state specific grounds for appeal in his Notice of Appeal and did not file a separate brief or statement. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1152, 1157 (9th Cir.2004). Because BIA regulations, the notice of appeal form and the briefing schedule warned Jiron-Gutierres that the BIA could summarily dismiss his appeal if he failed to specify the reasons for his appeal or file a brief in support of his appeal after indicating that he would file such a brief, the BIA\u2019s summary dismissal did not violate Jiron-Gutierres\u2019 due process rights. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i); <em>See Singh, </em>416 F.3d at 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-26\">We lack jurisdiction to review the underlying merits of Jiron-Gutierres\u2019 appeal because the BIA\u2019s dismissal was only on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>procedural grounds. See <em>Singh, </em>361 F.3d at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b257-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
