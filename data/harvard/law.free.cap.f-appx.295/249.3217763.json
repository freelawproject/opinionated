Hattabaugh (\u201cHattabaugh\u201d) appeals his conviction by jury for twelve counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">First, Hattabaugh contends that the government misused other acts evidence in an attempt to establish that he had a propensity to lie. Hattabaugh concedes that evidence of his Oklahoma real estate transaction during the course of the charged crimes was admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence Rule 404(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as evidence of his motive. Hattabaugh, however, argues that the district court erred in refusing his request for a specific limiting instruction regarding the other acts evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review whether contested evidence falls within the scope of Rule 404(b) under a de novo standard of review. <em>United States v. DeGeorge, </em>380 F.3d 1203, 1219 (9th Cir.2004). We review a district court\u2019s decisions on limiting instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Beltran-Garcia, </em>179 F.3d 1200, 1205 (9th Cir.1999). We may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record. <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>516 F.3d 1117, 1120 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">The government argues that the evidence regarding Hattabaugh\u2019s real estate transaction was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the wire fraud charged and was therefore admissible regardless of Rule 404(b). We agree. \u201cEvidence should not be treated as \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence when \u2018the evidence concerning the [\u201cother\u201d] act and the evidence concerning the crime charged are inextricably intertwined.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Soliman, </em>813 F.2d 277, 279 (9th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>United States v. Aleman, </em>592 F.2d 881, 885 (5th Cir.1979) (alteration in original)). \u201cWe have recognized two categories of evidence that may be considered \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with a charged offense and therefore admitted without regard to Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>DeGeorge, </em>380 F.3d at 1220 (citing <em>United States v. Vizcarra-Martinez, </em>66 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir.1995)). Evidence of other acts may be directly admitted if either (1) the evidence \u201cconstitutes a part of the transaction that serves as the basis for the criminal charge\u201d or (2) the government finds it necessary in order \u201cto offer a coherent and comprehensible story regarding the commission of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Here, the evidence of Hattabaugh\u2019s real estate transaction fits both categories: (1) it was part of Hattabaugh\u2019s overall scheme to finance the purchase of the Oklahoma real estate using funds from the fraud scheme, and (2) it was necessary for the government to tell the story in order to show why Hattabaugh had a particular and pressing reason to commit the charged offenses. Because we conclude that the evidence regarding the real estate transaction was admissible as direct evidence, \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with Hattabaugh\u2019s fraud charges, no limiting instruction was required under Rule 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Even if the evidence in question was admissible only under Rule 404(b) to prove motive, the district court did not in the circumstances here abuse its discretion when it declined to give the requested limiting instruction. <em>See Soliman, </em>813 F.2d at 279 (holding that the \u201cgiving of a limiting instruction is but one factor in deciding whether there has been an abuse of discretion\u201d and an instruction that the defendant \u201cis not on trial for any act or conduct not alleged in the indictment\u201d when admitting \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence would not warrant a finding that the district court abused its discretion). Here, the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury accomplished the limiting effect. The district court instructed the jury that it was \u201conly to determine whether [Hattabaugh was] guilty or not guilty of the charges in the indictment\u201d and that Hattabaugh was \u201cnot on trial for any other conduct or offense not charged in the indictment.\u201d The jury was further instructed that it \u201cshould consider evidence as to the acts, statements, and intentions of others or evidence about other acts of the defendant[\u2019]s only as they relate to the charge[s] against the defendant.\u201d This constituted a limiting admonition such that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Certainly, a more specific instruction could have been given, and it might have been better practice to do so, but any error was harmless. <em>United States v. Bradshaw, </em>690 F.2d 704, 710 (9th Cir.1982) (noting that although a more carefully drafted instruction could have been given for the admitted Rule 404(b) evidence, the instruction that \u201c[t]he defendant here is not on trial for any act or conduct not alleged in the indictment\u201d did not amount to reversible error); <em>see also United States v. Frega, </em>179 F.3d 793, 806 n. 16 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cJury instructions, even if imperfect, are not a basis for overturning a conviction absent a showing that they prejudiced the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Second, Hattabaugh contends that (1) the government improperly vouched for its witnesses in direct examination and in closing arguments, and (2) the government improperly attacked defense counsel and improperly portrayed Hattabaugh as a liar during closing arguments. When the defendant fails to object to the prosecutor\u2019s alleged vouching, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>508 F.3d 1205, 1209 (9th Cir.2007). When there is no objection to alleged improper comments made during closing arguments, the plain error standard also applies. <em>United States v. Tam, </em>240 F.3d 797, 802 (9th Cir.2001). Plain error is (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Dallman, </em>533 F.3d 755, 761 (9th Cir.2008). \u201cIf these three conditions are met,\u201d reversal is proper only if, viewed in the context of the entire trial, the error \u201cseriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u201cAs a general rule, a prosecutor may not express his opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt or his belief in the credibility of government witnesses.\u201d <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>v. Necoechea, </em>986 F.2d 1273, 1276 (9th Cii'.1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Improper vouching \u201cconsists of placing the prestige of the government behind a witness through personal assurances of the witness\u2019s veracity, or suggesting that information not presented to the jury supports the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have recognized that prosecutors must be given \u201creasonable latitude\u201d and \u201cthus can argue reasonable inferences based on the evidence, including that one of the two sides is lying.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We conclude that the government\u2019s questioning during direct examination and the government\u2019s statements during closing arguments were within its permissible prosecutorial realm, and that there was no improper vouching or improper comments made during closing arguments that constituted plain error. Instead, the government had reasonable leeway to describe an inescapable conflict in the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\">.

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person but may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.
