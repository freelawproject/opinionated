For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">A jury found Abusaid guilty of (1) one count of maintaining an establishment for the purpose of unlawfully distributing or using a controlled substance, specifically Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (\u201cMDMA\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2) and (b), and (2) one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). In calculating Abusaid\u2019s criminal history category for sentencing, a probation officer assessed Abusaid five criminal history points based on three convictions for operating a dance hall or rave club without a license and one conviction for operating a bottle club and selling alcohol without a licence. Based on this and other calculations, the district court sentenced Abusaid to two concurrent terms of 97 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirmed Abusaid\u2019s convictions and sentences on appeal. <em>United States v. Abusaid, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 951 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-16\">Abusaid filed a motion for modification of sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), arguing that his criminal history category was calculated based on local ordinance convictions and that Amendment 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines recently instructed that local ordinance violations should not be counted toward a defendant\u2019s criminal history category. The government responded that Amendment 709 was not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) and was not, therefore, retroactive, such that it did not authorize modification under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied the motion, citing the government\u2019s reasoning. The deputy clerk mistakenly docketed Abusaid\u2019s motion, the government\u2019s response, and the district court\u2019s denial of the motion as dealing with a \u201cMotion for retroactive application of the crack guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-17\">Abusaid filed a motion for reconsideration, a motion to order the district court\u2019s deputy clerk to removal all references to \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d from the docket sheet, and a motion for the district court judge to recuse herself for demonstrating bias against Abusaid by \u201crubber stamping deni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>al orders on a regular and ongoing basis.\u201d The district court denied Abusaid\u2019s motions. On April 11, 2008, Abusaid filed a NOA from the district court\u2019s denial of his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Simms, </em>385 F.3d 1347, 1356 (11th Cir.2004). We also review the denial of a motion for modification of sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Pursuant to the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement on retroactive reduction of sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). In <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir. 2003), we interpreted the above language and established a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d that \u201camendments claimed in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions may be retroactively applied solely where expressly listed under \u00a7 lB1.10(c).\u201d Amendment 709 is not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">In <em>Armstrong, </em>as here, the movant conceded that the amendments in question were not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), but argued that these amendments were clarifying and that clarifying amendments always are retroactive. <em>Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 908. We acknowledged that clarifying amendments, or amendments that do not effect a substantive change, but instead provide persuasive evidence of how the Sentencing Commission originally envisioned application of the relevant guideline, apply retroactively, but rejected the movant\u2019s argument and established a rule that clarifying amendments \u201cmay only be retroactively applied on direct appeal of a sentence or under a \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 908-909.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Abusaid\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Simms, </em>385 F.3d at 1356.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Motions for modification of sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>tence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) must be based on retroactively applicable amendments, or amendments listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l); <em>Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 909. Amendment 709 is not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Therefore, Abusaid\u2019s motion did not state grounds on which the district court could modify his sentence, such that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to do so. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219. Moreover, to the extent that Abusaid argues that Amendment 709 was merely clarifying and therefore applied retroactively to modify his sentence, we previously have rejected this argument. <em>See Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 908-09.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court also did not err in denying Abusaid\u2019s motion to order the district court\u2019s deputy clerk to remove all references to \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d from the docket sheet and motion for the district court judge to recuse herself, as Abusaid has not demonstrated, and the record otherwise does not suggest, that the docketing error affected Abusaid\u2019s rights or that the district court judge acted antagonistically toward Abusaid. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-10\">. As an initial matter, we note that, despite the government\u2019s argument otherwise, we have jurisdiction over Abusaid's appeal from the denial of his motion for reconsideration. The government points to the \u201canticipatory\u201d notices of appeal that Abusaid filed at the same time as his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and motion for reconsideration and argues that these notices were ineffective to perfect appeal. We agree with the government\u2019s position that these notices were effective and, indeed, previously <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed the appeals taken by way of these notices. <em>See United States v. Abusaid, </em>Case No. 08-10409-J <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>(11th Cir. Feb. 29, 2008); <em>United States v. Abusaid, </em>Case No. 08-11147-J (11th Cir. Apr. 16, 2008). However, we conclude that we nevertheless have jurisdiction because of the above-mentioned April 11, 2008, notice of appeal from the denial of his motion for reconsideration and other motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\">. To the extent that Abusaid argues that the district court should have construed his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as an amendment to his \u00a7 2255 motion, his argument is without merit, as there was no reason for the district court to construe the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as such. Likewise, to the extent that Abusaid argues that the district court erred in assessing criminal history points based on the offenses in question regardless of Amendment 709, his argument is not properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
