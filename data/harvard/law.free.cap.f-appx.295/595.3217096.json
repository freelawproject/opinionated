Turner asserts that the district court erred when it: (i) denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of an allegedly invalid anticipatory search warrant; (ii) refused to instruct the jury regarding simple possession of cocaine as a lesser-included offense; and (iii) denied his Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">We conclude that the district court correctly denied Turner\u2019s motion to suppress. The district court correctly determined that the anticipatory search warrant was supported by probable cause because the warrant application affidavit attested that a police-intercepted package containing approximately $20,000 worth of cocaine would be found at a particular address when that package was delivered to that address by a police officer dressed as a FedEx delivery person. <em>See United States v. Grubbs, </em>547 U.S. 90, 96-97, 126 S.Ct. 1494,164 L.Ed.2d 195 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>We also find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury regarding cocaine possession as a lesser-included offense to the distribution charges. Given the significant amount of evidence introduced by the Government regarding Turner\u2019s drug distribution activities, whether Turner was a distributor was not \u201csufficiently in dispute to allow a jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater and guilty of the lesser offense,\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>985 F.2d 1248, 1258-59 (4th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Wright, </em>131 F.3d 1111, 1112 (4th Cir.1997) (holding that for an element to be \u201csufficiently in dispute,\u201d either \u201cthe testimony on the distinguishing element must be sharply conflicting, or the conclusion as to the lesser offense must be fairly inferable from the evidence presented\u201d) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Last, we find the district court correctly denied Turner\u2019s Rule 29 motion. The Government\u2019s evidence was more than sufficient to establish that Turner committed the crimes of which the jury convicted him; the Government produced several witnesses who testified that Turner was a distributor of marijuana and cocaine, that he possessed significant amounts of those drugs in his residence and had the means of packaging the drugs for distribution, that Turner possessed and carried a gun when he sold drugs, and that he and his co-conspirator were engaged in a partnership whereby the co-conspirator would obtain drugs and Turner would sell them for profit. Because \u201ca reasonable finder of fact could accept [the Government\u2019s evidence] as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the jury\u2019s verdict must be sustained. <em>See United States v. Alerre, </em>430 F.3d 681, 693 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
