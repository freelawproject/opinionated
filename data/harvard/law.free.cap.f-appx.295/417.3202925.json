Nov. 2, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, we remain mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Maghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)) (\u201cThere is a strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close as promptly as is consistent with the interest in giving the adversaries a fair opportunity to develop and present their respective cases.\u201d); see <em>also INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (\u201cMotions for reopening of immigration proceedings are disfavored for the same reasons as are petitions for rehearing and motions for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. This is especially true in a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">When the agency denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the the agency\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A party may file only one motion to reopen and such motion must be filed within ninety days of the issuance of a final administrative order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, those time and numerical limitations do not apply to a motion to reopen that is \u201cbased on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">It is undisputed that Lin\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, Lin claimed in his motion that local officials had learned of the recent birth of his first child and that because of this \u201cnew development,\u201d he feared being subjected to a forced sterilization. The BIA properly found that this change in personal circumstances could not establish changed country conditions excusing the untimeliness of Lin\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2005) (finding that the birth of U.S. citizen children constitutes a change in personal circumstances and not a change in country conditions, and therefore does not establish an exception to the filing deadline for motions to reopen); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Moreover, although Lin submitted letters from his father and neighbor stating that his parents were detained due to his family planning violation, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that he failed to present any evidence of changed country conditions where the letters did not reference past policy or any change in policy enforcement. <em>See Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233. Because the BIA properly found that Lin\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish changed country conditions, it properly denied Lin\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Accordingly, we need not reach its other findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition <em>for </em>review is DENIED. Any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-12\">. We lack jurisdiction to review any challenge to the BIA's decision not to reopen Lin\u2019s proceedings sua sponte because that decision was \"entirely discretionary.\u201d <em>Azmond Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\">. We need not decide whether Lin\u2019s motion was properly deemed numerically barred where his first \"motion to reopen\" was construed by the BIA as a motion to reconsider.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\">. Although Lin's motion to reopen included a brief reference to his former attorney's alleged ineffective assistance, because he failed to reference the BIA's Endings in this regard in his brief to this Court, we deem waived any such claim. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
