GUIDO CALABRESI, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b415-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Defendants-Appellants Jeffrey and Chad Lutz (\u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal from their sentences imposed by the United States District Court for the District of Vermont (Sessions, <em>J.) </em>following their guilty pleas on cocaine-related offenses involving cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Appellants argue on appeal that they are entitled to a remand for resentencing to give the District Court an opportunity to reconsider its sentence in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States,</em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). <em>See United States v. Regalado, </em>518 F.3d 143 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">In <em>Regalado, </em>this Court recognized that remand is necessary where \u201cit is impossible to know, <em>ex post, </em>whether the court would have exercised its discretion to mitigate the sentencing range produced by the 100-to-l [crack-to-powder cocaine] disparity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147. Remand in these circumstances is designed to give a district court \u201can opportunity to indicate whether it would have imposed a non-Guidelines sentence knowing that it had discretion to deviate from the Guidelines to serve those objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Here, remand pursuant to <em>Regalado </em>would be futile and is therefore unnecessary. The District Court made a point to state \u201cfor the record,\u201d that it did not think that <em>Kimbrough </em>\u201cwould make any difference to me at this point.... I don\u2019t think it would have an impact at all.\u201d [A. 94] Moreover, the District Court understood that it could impose non-Guidelines sentences that reflected its judgment about the crack-to-powder disparity. It simply chose not to exercise this discretion, opting instead to impose Guidelines-range sentences. This choice was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">We have considered all of Appellants\u2019 claims and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
