Kilkenny pled to offenses involving bank fraud, mail fraud, and structuring. Kilkenny\u2019s initial sentence (235 months) was vacated in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Kilkenny, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 360 (2d Cir.2005). Kilkenny appealed the sentence imposed on that remand (216 months) which was vacated on the ground that the district court should have applied the 2000 Sentencing Guidelines rather than the 2002 Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Kilkenny, </em>493 F.3d 122 (2d Cir.2007). The Guidelines range under the 2000 Guidelines is 97-121 months. On the second re-sentencing (from which this appeal is taken) Kilkenny was sentenced to 216 months for the bank fraud violation, 60 months for the mail fraud violation, and 60 months for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>structured financial transactions violation, to run concurrently. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Kilkenny contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because (1) some of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors cited by the district court in support of its sentence were already taken into account in computing the Guidelines sentence; (2) mitigating factors balance the aggravating factors and counsel in favor of a within-Guidelines sentence; and (3) the sentence he received was considerably greater than the maximum Guidelines sentence. We review Kilkenny\u2019s sentence for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u201cReasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006). Instead, \u201cthe familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States,</em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cappellate \u2018reasonableness\u2019 review merely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion\u201d). In considering whether the sentence imposed falls \u201cinside or outside the Guidelines range,\u201d we review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596. When considering a sentence outside the Guidelines range, we review the totality of the circumstances and \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation [from the Guidelines], but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. Accordingly the Guidelines provide \u201cthe starting point and the initial benchmark\u201d for the district court, <em>id. </em>at 596, but they do not usurp the district court judge\u2019s \u201csuperior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597 (quotations and citation omitted). We cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">1. Kilkenny argues that the district court impermissibly considered certain factors under \u00a7 3553(a) \u2014 the number of victims and his failure to accept responsibility \u2014 that had already been considered in calculating the appropriate Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">District courts may decide whether the rough approximation of sentences suggested by the Sentencing Guidelines achieves the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a) in each particular instance. <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). In making this determination, district courts may \u201ccontextually evaluate each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, including those factors the relevant guideline(s) already purport to take into account, even if the facts of the case are less than extraordinary.\u201d <em>United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 808 (10th Cir.2008). The district court determined that the two-level enhancement for an offense involving more than one victim did not adequately reflect the more than sixty victims of Kilkenny\u2019s offenses; and that the denial of a sentence reduction for Kilkenny\u2019s failure to take responsibility did not adequately reflect Kilkenny\u2019s cavalier attitude as exhibited by his comments to the Probation Officer pri- or to his first sentencing. We \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance\u201d here. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">2. Kilkenny argues that mitigating factors balance the aggravating factors and militate in favor of a within-Guidelines sentence. Kilkenny does not argue that the district court failed to consider relevant mitigating factors; he simply disagrees with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the factors supporting an increased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>sentence far outweigh those supporting a decrease. This balancing is precisely the task that, under \u00a7 3553(a), is assigned to the district court. <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">3. Finally, Kilkenny argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. The fact that a sentence exceeds the Guidelines maximum does not mean that the sentence is substantively unreasonable; rather, the sentencing judge must \u201cconsider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. And while \u201ca major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one,\u201d due deference must be given to the district court\u2019s determination that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the extent of the variance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">There was no abuse of discretion here. At the sentencing proceeding, the district court heard testimony, considered written submissions, and discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In particular, the district court noted: the number of Kilkenny\u2019s victims and the fact that many were close family members and friends; his continued failure to accept responsibility for his crimes; his history of \u201cgreed, deceit, lies, and fabrications\u201d; and the terrible impact of his financial crimes on those of his victims who are elderly. After this review, the court imposed a sentence which, in its reasoned opinion, reflected the totality of the circumstances based on reasons that were \u201csufficiently compelling to support the degree of variance\u201d from the Guidelines calculation. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Accordingly, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
