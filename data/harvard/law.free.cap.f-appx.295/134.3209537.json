Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of due process violations in removal proceedings, including claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-23\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioner failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relatives. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number><em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the performance of petitioner\u2019s former attorney did not result in prejudice, and thus his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel fails. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 899-900 (9th Cir.2003) (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s conduct was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b160-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
