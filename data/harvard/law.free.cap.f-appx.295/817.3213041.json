But the district court observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>this was the third lawsuit premised on Larkin-Gordon\u2019s injuries, and because her earlier lawsuits \u2014 which named only the prescribing doctor as a defendant \u2014 demonstrated discovery of her injury as early as 1999, Larkin-Gordon was barred by Illinois\u2019s two-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>735 ILCS 5/13-202, 5/13-213(d). Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Ortho-McNeil-Janssen.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Larkin-Gordon\u2019s opening brief in this court presents an assortment of photographs, testimonials, news articles, briefs from unrelated litigation, and a letter that concludes, \u201cI feel what you already have should be looked at again and I get a fair chance in presenting my case.\u201d We sympathize with Larkin-Gordon, but Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a) requires more, even from a pro se litigant. <em>See Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001). At a minimum, this court demands a cogent argument \u201cconsisting of more than a generalized assertion of error, with citations to supporting authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In her reply brief, Larkin-Gordon tries to remedy the problem by citing legal authority and distilling her \u201cstrongest\u201d argument \u2014 that Ortho-McNeil-Janssen \u201cshould not receive the benefit of the statute of limitations time windows since they themselves did not warn of all the effects of the medication from the start.\u201d That contention belongs in her opening brief, though; arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are waived. <em>See, e.g., Harper v. Vigilant Ins. Co., </em>433 F.3d 521, 528 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Even if we could entertain Larkin-Gordon\u2019s argument, she would not prevail. Statutes of limitation are no less enforceable because some meritorious claims will fall by the wayside. \u201cThe theory is that even if one has a just claim it is unjust not to put the adversary on notice to defend within the period of limitation and that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.\u201d <em>Order of R.R. Telegraphers v. Ry. Express Agency, Inc., </em>321 U.S. 342, 349, 64 S.Ct. 582, 88 L.Ed. 788 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
