Anderson alleges that the Postal Service discriminated and reta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Hated against her on the basis of race, sex, age, and prior Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) complaints, and subjected her to a hostile work environment. In a thorough opinion addressing Anderson\u2019s numerous factual contentions, the district court concluded that Anderson failed to articulate a prima facie case for any of her claims, and granted summary judgment for the Postal Service. Having reviewed the briefs and record, we reach the same conclusion. Because a separate opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose, we affirm the court\u2019s judgment, adopting its analysis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-26\">.

Moreover, Anderson has failed to allege sufficient facts to show a genuine issue regarding the existence of an actionable hostile-work-environment claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
