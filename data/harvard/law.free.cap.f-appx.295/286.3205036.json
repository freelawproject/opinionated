LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Fredrick Abram, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, requests a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for habeas relief. Because reasonable jurists would not find it debatable whether the district court erred in its procedural ruling, we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">On January 10, 2008, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, Abram filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) before the district court. On January 28, Abram filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2254. On the same day, the district court denied Abram\u2019s motion to proceed IFP and ordered that Abram pay the $5.00 filing fee within 30 days or his petition would be dismissed. On February 4, Abram filed a response to the district court\u2019s January 28 order. In the response, Abram claimed he lacked sufficient funds to pay the $5.00 filing fee and moved the court to reconsider its decision denying him leave to proceed IFP. The response stated that a copy of his inmate trust fund account statement was attached, but no such attachment was included in the filing. Abram later filed a copy of his account statement on February 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">On March 7, the district court denied the motion to reconsider and dismissed Abram\u2019s petition without prejudice for failure to pay the filing fee. The district court concluded, based on its review of Abram\u2019s account statement, that Abram had sufficient resources to pay the required filing fee. In particular, the district court found that Abram had a balance of $71.03 when he filed his petition, that he had a balance of $6.12 on February 11, and that a total of $55.37 had been deposited into his account between February 4 and February 6. Accordingly, the court found no reason Abram could not have paid the filing fee within 30 days of the January 28 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">On March 20, Abram filed a \u201cmotion to have civil action number 08-cv-00169 BNB re-instated,\u201d which the district court construed as a timely motion to reconsider. Abram conceded he had $6.12 in his inmate account on February 11, but he argued that it was immediately removed to cover hygiene items. On April 3, the district court denied the motion to reconsider its March 7 dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">On April 4, Abram filed a notice of appeal, a motion for a COA, and a motion to proceed IFP on appeal. On April 8, the district court denied a COA, and on April 29, the court denied Abram\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(a)(3). Abram now seeks a COA in this court so that he may appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. He also moves for leave to proceed IFP.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">A COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2). \u201c \u2018This standard requires an applicant to show that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yang v. Archuleta, </em>525 F.3d 925, 928 (10th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). When a district court dismisses a state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the merits of the prisoner\u2019s constitutional claims, we will only grant a COA if two conditions are met. First, the petitioner must show that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Second, the petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling. <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id.; Laurson v. Leyba, </em>507 F.3d 1230, 1232 (10th Cir.2007). In such a circumstance, no appeal is warranted. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Abram cannot meet his burden as to the second requirement. <em>See id. </em>at 485, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (\u201cEach component of the \u00a7 2253(c) showing is part of a threshold inquiry, and a court may find that it can dispose of the application in a fair and prompt manner if it proceeds first to resolve the issue whose answer is more apparent from the record and arguments.\u201d). Before this court, Abram reiterates the argument he made before the district court that he lacked sufficient funds to pay the required filing fee. Moreover, he contends that the district court deliberately misrepresented the contents of his inmate trust fund account statement. In particular, he argues that although his account statement reflects the various balances identified by the district court in its March 7 order, in reality his available balances demonstrate he lacked sufficient funds to pay the filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">It appears the district court misread Abram\u2019s account statement. As Abram points out, the account statement reflects both a \u201cbalance\u201d and an \u201cavailable balance,\u201d which appears to reflect the actual amount of money subject to withdrawal. The district court\u2019s erroneous reading of the account statement, however, does not change the fact that Abram had sufficient resources to pay the $5.00 filing fee. On February 6, after Abram had notice that his motion to proceed IFP had been denied, Abram had more than a $5.00 available in his trust account. The reasons for Abram\u2019s spending do not change the fact that he had sufficient resources to pay the required filing fee. <em>See Cosby v. Meadors, </em>351 F.3d 1324, 1327 (10th Cir.2003). Therefore, jurists of reason would not find it debatable whether the district court erred in dismissing Abram\u2019s petition for failure to pay the required fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY a COA and DISMISS the appeal. We GRANT Abram\u2019s motion to supplement the record. Because we agree with the district court that this appeal is not taken in good faith, we DENY Abram\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>to proceed IFP on appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
