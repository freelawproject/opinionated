Wilmshurst appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing as untimely his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that state and county employees violated his civil rights by unlawfully inspecting his property and by using evidence from the inspection to bring a state civil suit against him. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Morales v. City of Los Angeles, </em>214 F.3d 1151, 1153 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-25\">The district court properly concluded that Wilmshurst\u2019s section 1983 action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations because the alleged facts underlying Wilmshurst\u2019s claim occurred in 2002 and 2003, and he filed his complaint in January 2006. <em>See Jones v. Blanas, </em>393 F.3d 918, 927 (9th Cir.2004) (discussing one- and two-year statutes of limitations).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-26\">The district court properly concluded that the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine was inapplicable because Wilmshurst did not plead facts demonstrating that defendants engaged in a pattern of unlawful conduct. <em>See Knox v. Davis, </em>260 F.3d 1009, 1013 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that this court has repeatedly held that a mere continuing impact from past violations is not actionable).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b231-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
