Judge McMahon sentenced Diaz to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment, the mandatory minimum sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), finding that his 1991 and 2001 New York state convictions for third degree attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance were \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d within the meaning of that statute. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">A state drug offense is a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA if it is one \u201cfor which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). At the times of his 1991 and 2001 convictions, attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in New York was punishable by more than ten years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Darden, </em>539 F.3d 116, 120 (2d Cir.2008). However, in December 2004, the Legislature amended the drug laws, reducing the statutory maximum sentence for Class C drug felonies to less than ten years. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On appeal, Diaz argues that the district court erred in looking to the maximum sentence at the time of the 1991 and 2001 convictions and not the maximum sentence at the time of his 2007 sentencing in holding that his previous drug convictions were \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d under the ACCA. Based on our recent decision in <em>Darden, </em>we agree. In <em>Darden, </em>we decided this exact issue, concluding that because the ACCA uses the present tense \u201cis prescribed\u201d as opposed to the past tense \u201cwas prescribed,\u201d \u201csentencing courts should examine current state law\u201d to determine whether an offense is a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121. In its brief in this case (submitted as <em>Darden </em>was pending before this Court), the Government conceded that if <em>Darden </em>reached this conclusion, \u201cimposition of the 180-month mandatory minimum here would constitute plain error and re-sentencing would be warranted.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 12 n.*.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and the case REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
