R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b898-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">In these consolidated petitions, John Chiang Nien Wu, a native and citizen of China, seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying his motion to reconsider its prior decision declining to reopen deportation proceedings to allow him to apply for relief under former \u00a7 212(c). Pursuant to the REAL ID Act of 2005, we construe Wu\u2019s transferred habeas petition as a petition for review. <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 928-29 (9th Cir.2005). Wu also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his motion to terminate later removal proceedings. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider. <em>Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005). We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">In his opening brief in No. 05-73255, Wu fails to address the BIA\u2019s dispositive determination that there was no error of fact or law in its prior decision denying his motion to reopen on the ground that Wu is ineligible for relief under former \u00a7 212(c). He has therefore waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision denying his motion to reconsider. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived). In light of this waiver, we need not address the contentions raised in Wu\u2019s opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">In his opening brief in No. 06-74251, Wu repeats his arguments from No. 05-73255, contending that later removal proceedings were improper because his original deportation proceedings should have been reopened based on ineffective assistance of counsel to allow him to apply for relief under former \u00a7 212(c). We therefore deny the petition for review in No. 06-74251.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">No. 05-73255: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-17\">No. 06-74251: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b898-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
