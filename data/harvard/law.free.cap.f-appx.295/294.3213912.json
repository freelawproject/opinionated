The district court dismissed the \u00a7 1983 action because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Baldaufs \u201cfailures to comply adequately with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 and the court\u2019s orders regarding partial filing fee payments.\u201d R. Vol. II, doc. 287 at 2. Baldauf, appearing pro se, argues that 1) his motion for default should have been granted; 2) his failure to pay the filing fee was the fault of his custodian, the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC); 3) the district court improperly treated his request for counsel as a request for private counsel when, in fact, Baldauf requested an interim appointment of class counsel pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(g); and 4) exhaustion should not bar his claims. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review dismissal for failure to comply with court orders for abuse of discretion, <em>Cosby v. Meadors, </em>351 F.3d 1324, 1326 (10th Cir.2003). Having found no such abuse, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">As mentioned above, Baldauf argues that CDOC failed to make payments on his behalf. That argument is foreclosed by <em>Cosby, </em>351 F.3d at 1332 (refusing to excuse prisoner\u2019s failure to pay on this ground because \u201cit was still Plaintiffs obligation to notice this lapse and not spend the money until the required payments were made to the court\u201d). Baldaufs argument that since the court\u2019s last fee-payment order he has complied with \u00a7 1915 and, implicitly, should therefore be excused from prior payment defaults is similarly unavailing. The last order issued by the district court was not the first time Baldauf had been placed on notice that failure to make payment may result in dismissal without further notice. <em>See </em>Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge, R. Vol. II, doc. 226 at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action for failure to comply with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, it is unnecessary for us to reach the other issues Baldauf raises on appeal. Baldaufs motion to proceed on appeal without prepayment of fees is GRANTED. Baldauf is reminded that he remains obligated to make partial payments to this court until the entire appellate filing fee is paid in accordance with \u00a7 1915(b). The mandate shall issue forthwith. This appeal counts as a strike against Plaintiff under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b321-9\">PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">I concur in the judgment but respectfully dissent to the grant of IFP status.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
