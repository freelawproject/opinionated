He argues on appeal that: (1) the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict because his actual laptop computer was never produced at trial, and there was no mention that the laptop had been damaged by an electrical surge prior to its seizure; and (2) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request production of the laptop and by failing to assert that the laptop had been damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">Examination of the record indicates that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict, a rational trier of fact could have found that the Government proved all of the essential elements of Vargas\u2019s crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Morales, </em>272 F.3d 284, 287 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Lankford, </em>196 F.3d 563, 575 (5th Cir.1999). Moreover, we do not consider Vargas\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not raise them in district court and the present record is insufficiently developed to resolve them. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087,1091 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b693-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
