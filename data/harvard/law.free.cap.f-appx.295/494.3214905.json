We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, we recount only those facts essential to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">Cooley raises one argument on appeal: the District Court erred in believing that it was required to run the 36-month sentence consecutively. In support of this claim, Cooley focuses myopically on one portion of the transcript at which the District Judge stated: \u201cHow about if it\u2019s reversed? You\u2019re asking me to consider a sentence that may be reversed.\u201d At pages 12 and 16 of his brief, Cooley argues that the foregoing statement refers to the sentence the District Court was imposing for violations of his conditions of supervised release. Cooley asserts that the District Court erroneously believed that a consecutive sentence was mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">To put it kindly, Cooley\u2019s argument mischaracterizes the record. As the Government points out at page 21 of its brief, when the District Court made the statement regarding reversal, it was referring to Cooley\u2019s 72-month federal sentence in a separate case. This statement was in response to Cooley\u2019s argument that he was entitled to leniency on his supervised release violation in light of the lengthy term of imprisonment that had been imposed upon him in a separate case. Moreover, the record is devoid of any evidence to suggest that the sentencing judge was unaware of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory. The record demonstrates that the District Court considered the arguments of counsel for both sides and, in the exercise of its sound discretion, determined that Cooley\u2019s \u201clengthy history of violent criminal conduct\u201d warranted a consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-17\">In sum, because Cooley\u2019s sole argument is premised upon a fallacy and the imposition of a consecutive sentence was reasonable, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
