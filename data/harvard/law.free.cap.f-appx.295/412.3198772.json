July 16, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-25\">I. MOTION TO REOPEN</p>\n<p id=\"b439-26\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-27\">Here, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s untimely motion to reopen. A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after the date on which a final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, this time limit does not apply to a motion to reopen that is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Such changes are regularly referred to as \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d and distinguished from \u201cchanged personal circumstances.\u201d <em>Jian Huan Guan v. B.I.A., </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The BIA properly found that the birth of Chen\u2019s children in the United States was a change in personal circumstances that did not warrant an exception to the ninety-day filing deadline. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, Chen specifically asserted that her motion was based on changes in her personal circumstances, and she never claimed a change in country conditions. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in denying her motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">II. SUCCESSIVE ASYLUM APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Chen also argues that she is authorized by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) to reapply for asylum based solely on the birth of her children in the United States, and that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h) is inconsistent with that statute and therefore invalid. Chen also argues that if 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h) is found to be valid, then it must be interpreted to include changed personal circumstances, not simply changed country conditions. Those arguments are unavailing. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D), an individual may file an untimely or successive asylum application based on changed circumstances, including changed personal circumstances, if she files such application while still in removal proceedings or within ninety days of the issuance of a final order of removal. <em>See Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 156-57 (2d Cir.2008), <em>ajfg Matter of C-W-L, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 346 (BIA 2007). However, an individual \u201cunder a final removal order must file a successive asylum application in conjunction with a motion to reopen and in accordance with those procedural requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Chen was required to comply with the ninety-day filing deadline for motions to reopen or establish an exception to that deadline as delineated in the Act and regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 152-53. The relevant provisions of the Act and regulations, in turn, require a showing of changed country conditions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Thus, Chen\u2019s argument that she was permitted to file a successive asylum application fails because she was under a final order of removal, and her motion to reopen was untimely. <em>See Yuen Jin, </em>538 F.3d at 156-57.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">III. MOTION TO REMAND</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Chen has filed a motion to remand her case to the BIA, arguing that we should take judicial notice of the documents that we first addressed in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir.2006). She contends that we should do so, even though the documents at issue are not part of the administrative record, because they reflect a change in country conditions that materially affects her eligibility for asylum. This argument is unavailing, because we will not remand a case to the BIA to order it to consider evidence that was not in the record before it. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 272 (2d Cir.2007). Accordingly, Chen\u2019s motion to remand is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED, the Petitioner\u2019s motion to remand is DENIED, and the Respondent\u2019s motion to suspend is DENIED as moot. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\">. Our decision in <em>Yuen Jin, </em>538 F.3d 143, has now rendered the Government\u2019s motion to suspend moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
