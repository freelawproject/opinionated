A Magistrate Judge issued a report recommending denial and dismissal of Johnson\u2019s petition, determining that although Johnson\u2019s trial counsel representation was deficient, trial counsel\u2019s performance was not prejudicial to Johnson because a reasonable jury would not have determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>he was not guilty, even with the supporting testimony of the two uncalled witnesses. The District Court approved and adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation, as supplemented by its memorandum, and issued an order denying and dismissing Johnson\u2019s petition. For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Because we write solely for the parties who are familiar with the facts and proceedings in the District Court, we need only briefly recite the facts. The testimony at trial established that the victim, Joseph Goldsby, who was selling crack cocaine, was shot and killed on March 1, 1990. Johnson approached the victim\u2019s car with an unknown male and female and engaged the victim in drug-related conversation. Two eyewitnesses to the incident, Darryl Alexander and Mark Jackson, testified that they knew Johnson and detailed his involvement in the murder. Jackson also testified that Johnson approached him several days after the murder and told him to \u201cbe careful what you say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Johnson testified and called Richard Duncan as a witness to establish an alibi defense. Johnson and Duncan testified that they were away from the scene of the crime, that they were in a car getting high on narcotics and were unaware of Golds-by\u2019s murder until they were so advised by a man named James Smith, also known as \u201cSeed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Robin Johnson and Derrick Holmes, two additional witnesses present at the scene of the murder, gave statements to the police shortly after the date of the crime. Appellant Johnson\u2019s trial counsel reviewed these statements, but did not interview Robin Johnson or Holmes and did not call them as witnesses at trial. The crux of Johnson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that the testimony of Robin Johnson and Holmes would have supported his alibi defense, and that it was unreasonable and prejudicial for Johnson\u2019s trial counsel to fail to interview and call these two witnesses after reviewing their police statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">We are to decide the sole issue of whether Johnson was denied competent counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment because his lawyer failed to interview or call Derrick Holmes and Robin Johnson, two eyewitnesses who would have supported Johnson\u2019s alibi defense at his murder trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), the Court set forth a two-prong test that a petitioner must satisfy before a court will find that counsel did not provide effective assistance. Under <em>Strickland, </em>a petitioner must show (1) that his attorney\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) that there exists a reasonable probability that, barring counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 687,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The Magistrate Judge and the District Court determined that a reasonable jury would not have determined that Johnson was not guilty, even with the supporting testimony of Robin Johnson and Derrick Holmes. We agree. Even if Johnson\u2019s trial counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, his deficiency did not prejudice Johnson. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">To satisfy the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, a petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\u201d of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>The Magistrate Judge noted that the evidence against Johnson was not overwhelming, because the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s two main eyewitnesses, Darryl Alexander and Mark Jackson, was contradicted by their earlier police statements that they could not identify the culprits in the victim\u2019s shooting. But Johnson\u2019s alibi was not fully credible either. Although the testimony of Robin Johnson and Derrick Holmes would have furnished some support of Johnson\u2019s alibi defense, we agree with the District Court that there is no reasonable probability that their testimony would have created a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jurors. Two eyewitnesses to the incident-Alexander and Jackson-testified that they knew Johnson and described in specific detail Johnson\u2019s involvement in the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Neither Robin Johnson nor Derrick Holmes were eyewitnesses to the shooting. Neither provided Johnson with an affirmative alibi, as did Duncan, the defense witness called at trial. Rather, the testimony of Holmes and Robin Johnson merely would have established that they did not see Johnson while they were present buying drugs. At trial, the Commonwealth came forth with eyewitnesses to the killing who specifically saw Johnson standing outside the victim\u2019s car in the process of attempting to fire his gun at the victim. No witnesses came forward to allege that the person attempting to fire his gun in this matter was someone other than Johnson. At best, the testimony of Holmes and Robin Johnson would show that they did not see Johnson in the brief time they were there. In view of the detailed eyewitness testimony to the crime presented at trial, such testimony does not create a reasonable probability that the jury would have doubted its guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\u00a1l! ^ ^</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">We have considered all contentions raised by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253. Johnson\u2019s federal habeas petition was pending pri- or to the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AED-PA\u201d), so this case must be decided by the law as it existed before AEDPA became effective. <em>See Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 322-323, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997); <em>Buehl v. Vaughn, </em>166 F.3d 163, 169 (3d Cir. 1999). Under pre-AEDPA law, ineffective assistance of counsel claims present mixed questions of law and fact. <em>Buehl, </em>166 F.3d at 169. State court findings of fact are presumed correct if they are fairly supported by the record, but whether counsel was effective is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
