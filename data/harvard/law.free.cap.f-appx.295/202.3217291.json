Orlyn appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order requiring that Orlyn return $5,209 in fees paid to him on behalf of his client, Hiroshi Takeuchi, who was a debtor in bankruptcy. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1). We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Law Offices of Nicholas A. Franke v. Tiffany (In re Lewis), </em>113 F.3d 1040, 1043 (9th Cir.1997). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-23\">The district court properly concluded that, once Orlyn filed Takeuchi\u2019s bankruptcy petition, the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to review Orlyn\u2019s fees. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a) (\u201cA voluntary case under a chapter of this title is commenced by the filing with the bankruptcy court of a petition\u201d); \u00a7 329(b) (providing that bankruptcy courts may review and order the return of an attorney\u2019s compensation); <em>In re Lewis, </em>113 F.3d at 1044-45 (affirming a bankruptcy court order that pre-petition funds be disgorged under section 329).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-24\">The district court properly concluded that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Orlyn failed to make proper disclosures under section 329, and consequently ordered the disgorgement of all fees. <em>See In re Lewis, </em>113 F.3d at 1045 (stating that the bankruptcy court has broad and inherent authority to deny any and all compensation when an attorney fails to meet the requirements of section 329); <em>see also Neben &amp; Starrett, Inc. v. Chartwell Fin. Corp. (In re Park-Helena Corp.), </em>63 F.3d 877, 882 (9th Cir.1995) (affirming denial of all fees when debtor\u2019s attorney disclosed falsely that pre-petition retainer was paid by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>debtor corporation, when in fact retainer was paid by president of debtor corporation).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The district court properly concluded that Orlyn received adequate notice and opportunity to respond to the United States Trustee\u2019s motion for an accounting and for disgorgement of fees, evidenced by his timely opposition and presentation of arguments at the hearing. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P.2017(a) (providing that a motion under section 329 requires that the bankruptcy court make its determination \u201cafter notice and a hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Orlyn\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b228-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
