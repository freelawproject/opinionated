In revoking Wesley\u2019s supervised release, the district court sentenced Wesley to 23 months of imprisonment and 13 months of supervised release. This sentence was above the guidelines range for his revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Wesley argues that his revocation sentence was either unreasonable or plainly unreasonable because (1) his conduct did not distinguish him from others in his sentencing range, (2) the district court focused too heavily on his need for drug treatment, and (3) the district court did not explicitly mention the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in sentencing him. Because Wesley did not object to his sentence in the district court, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>484 F.3d 783, 792 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Wesley admitted the facts supporting the revocation of his supervised release. Those admitted facts included repeated violations of the prohibition on using and possessing narcotics. Wesley also failed to submit to mandatory urine tests and failed to turn himself in after agreeing to do so voluntarily. While he contends that his conduct was \u201caverage,\u201d the number of violations, some occurring almost immediately after his release, supports a finding that his conduct was considerably worse than the \u201caverage.\u201d The district court expressly stated in the judgment that the revocation and sentence were based upon the government\u2019s presentation and the defendant\u2019s admissions. At the sentencing hearing, the district judge stated clearly that he considered \u201cthe range of punishment provided by the policy statement,\u201d and concluded that the guidelines range was not \u201cadequate in this case when I consider all of the factors the Court is to consider under 18 United States Code Section 3553(a).\u201d \u201cExamining the full sentencing record reveals the district court\u2019s reasons for the chosen sentence and allows for effective review by this court.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 659 (5th Cir.2008). As in <em>Bonilla, </em>\u201cour task would have been easier\u201d if the district court had more clearly spelled out its reasoning. <em>Id. </em>However, we cannot find on this record that the district court plainly erred in stating its reasoning and in imposing a sentence above the guidelines given the facts admitted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-16\">In sum, Wesley has not shown that the district court failed to consider the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a) or the policy statements found in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines, and thus he has not shown that the district court plainly erred in imposing a sentence that was within the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>\u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 90-93 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
