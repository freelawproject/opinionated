He argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to call an exculpatory witness. He also contends that the state court decision denying him relief involved an unreasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-16\">Specifically, Gideon argues that his counsel knew that Boniface Choete was a relevant witness and listed him on the witness list but failed to subpoena him to testify. He argues that the failure to call Choete to testify resulted in an unfair trial as Choete\u2019s testimony would have established Gideon had no knowledge of the guns police found in his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-17\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo </em>but we are \u201chighly deferential\u201d to the state court\u2019s decision. <em>Davis v. Jones, </em>506 F.8d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2007). Pursuant to \u00a7 2254(d), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), federal courts may only grant habeas relief on claims previously adjudicated in state court if the adjudication (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-19\">In this case, the state court ruled that Gideon\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument failed as he did not allege that Choete was available to testify, and did not identify what testimony he would provide. See <em>Nelson v. State, </em>875 So.2d 579, 583 (Fla.2004), (a defendant must identify the testimony that would have been provided, and allege that the witness was available to testify in order to establish prejudice under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>The district court subsequently denied Gideon\u2019s federal petition here noting that Gideon had failed to explain how Choete would be able to testify that Gideon had no knowledge of the guns, and that although Choete\u2019s testimony may have been relevant to impeach the testimony of the arresting officer, it would not have affected Gideon\u2019s constructive possession of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">We find no error. The state court denied Gideon\u2019s claim on its merits and applied the correct legal rule, thus, the decision was not \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law. The holding that Gideon could not show prejudice because he did not allege that Choete was available to testify, was a reasonable application of federal law to the facts of the case. As such, we defer to the state trial court\u2019s decision under \u00a7 2254(d). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Gideon\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
