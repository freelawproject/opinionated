With this amended memorandum, the panel has voted to deny the petition for panel rehearing and the petition for rehearing en banc. No further petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc may be filed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The full court has been advised of the petition for rehearing en banc and no active judge has requested a vote on whether to rehear the matter en banc.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition de novo. <em>See Rodriguez Benitez v. Garcia, </em>495 F.3d 640, 643 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam). We review the \u201clast reasoned decision\u201d of the state courts, which here is the California Court of Appeal decision. <em>See Edwards v. Lamarque, </em>475 F.3d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), which governs our review of challenges to state convictions brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, a petitioner must demonstrate that the state court\u2019s decision on the merits was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law under United States Supreme Court precedent, or that the decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 70-73, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). The district court concluded that Hernandez failed to carry his burden under AEDPA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-16\">The use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors solely on grounds of presumed racial or other group bias is prohibited under both the United States and California Constitutions. <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986); <em>People v. Wheeler, </em>22 Cal.3d 258, 272, 148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748 (1978). In <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court set out a three-step process for the trial court to determine whether a peremptory challenge is race-based in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See Snyder v. Louisiana, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1203, 1207, 170 L.Ed.2d 175 (2008); <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 767, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxH\">First, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race[; sjecond, if that showing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question[; and tjhird, in light of the parties\u2019 submissions, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number><em>Snyder, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1207 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In applying <em>Batson </em>to determine a prosecutor\u2019s discriminatory intent, the trial court must evaluate the prosecutor\u2019s credibility, <em>Snyder, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1207, and determine whether the stated reasons are race-neutral, relevant to the case, and \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s genuine reasons for exercising a peremptory strike, rather than pretexts invented to hide purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>Green v. LaMarque, </em>532 F.3d 1028, 1030 (9th Cir.2008). The trial court must undertake a sensitive inquiry into all circumstantial and direct evidence bearing on the prosecutor\u2019s intent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s ruling on the issue of discriminatory intent must be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1207. We give the trial court\u2019s findings on intent great deference because such determinations lie \u201cpeculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province,\u201d and \u201cin the absence of exceptional circumstances, we would defer to the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We conclude that the state court satisfied its requirement to properly apply <em>Bat-son, </em>the relevant clearly established federal law under United States Supreme Court precedent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The Court of Appeal determined, as it was required to do under the third step in the <em>Batson </em>test, that the prosecutor\u2019s proffered reasons for using peremptory challenges to strike jurors were not pretextual and were the prosecutor\u2019s genuine reasons for exercising a peremptory strike. The record supports the state court\u2019s conclusion that the bases for challenge offered by the prosecution were legitimate, nondiscriminatory, and genuine. <em>See Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98 &amp; n. 20, 106 S.Ct. 1712; <em>Green, </em>532 F.3d at 1030. Thus, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, Supreme Court precedent. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">We also conclude that the state court findings were neither clearly erroneous nor unreasonable in light of the evidence presented. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). The Court of Appeal adequately examined the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons for dismissing each challenged juror in determining whether the reasons were legitimate, nondiscriminatory, and genuine. Our review of the record does not reveal that similarly situated members of a different race were allowed to serve, nor does it reflect a statistical record suggesting \u201cextensive evidence of purposeful discrimination\u201d against Hispanic jurors. <em>See Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 241, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005). Thus, Hernandez has not met his burden of showing that \u201cany appellate court to whom the defect is pointed out would be unreasonable in holding that the state court\u2019s fact-finding process was adequate.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Maddox, </em>366 F.3d 992,1000 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b262-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
