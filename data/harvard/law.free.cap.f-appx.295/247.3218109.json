Miguel Medina (Medina) did not raise any of his procedural due process claims before the BIA. Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to hear them. <em>See Tall v. Mukasey, </em>517 F.3d 1115, 1120 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-23\">2. Medina\u2019s substantive due process argument that he will be denied necessary medical care if deported has no legal basis. The cases cited by Medina stand for the proposition that \u201cdue process forbids governmental conduct that is deliberately indifferent to the medical needs of non-convicted detainees\u201d and focus on the care given to detainees while they are detained. <em>See, e.g., Haitian Centers Council, Inc. v. Sale, </em>823 F.Supp. 1028, 1044 (E.D.N.Y.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-24\">3. Medina\u2019s argument that he is eligible for asylum based on his political opinions or upon his participation in student protests are without merit. Medina\u2019s participation in student protests does not support a well-founded fear of future persecution based on Medina\u2019s inclusion in a particular social group. As the IJ noted, Medina\u2019s testimony regarding the human rights protests established a group no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>more defined than students in protest. There was no testimony of shared viewpoints or voluntary association. <em>See Arteaga v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 940, 944-45 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">4. Medina\u2019s failure to meet the requirements for asylum necessarily forecloses eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
