Ortega argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea due to its involuntary nature. The denial of Ortega\u2019s motion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Grant, </em>117 F.3d 788, 789 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-14\">Under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B), withdrawal of a guilty plea may be permitted before a defendant is sentenced for \u201cany fair and just reason.\u201d In determining whether a district court has abused its discretion in denying withdrawal, this court traditionally considers seven relevant factors. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (1984)). Those factors are: (1) whether the defendant asserted his innocence; (2) whether withdrawal would prejudice the Government; (3) whether the defendant delayed in filing the motion to withdraw; (4) whether withdrawal would inconvenience the court; (5) whether adequate assistance of counsel was available; (6) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary; and (7) whether withdrawal would waste judicial resources. <em>Id. </em>No single factor is determinative; instead, the court makes its determination based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Badger, </em>925 F.2d 101, 104 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-15\">Ortega\u2019s assertion of a possible defense to the assault charges does not amount to an affirmative assertion of innocence. Further, the district court correct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ly determined that there was nothing before it in any written or oral presentation which indicated that Ortega was asserting his innocence. With respect to the <em>Can-factors </em>of prejudice to the Government, the timing of the motion, and inconvenience to the court, the district court found these to be neutral factors. However, the court did note that it would have to \u201cstart all over\u201d if the case proceeded to trial. The district court found that the issue of counsel\u2019s assistance to Ortega weighed against withdrawal, and Ortega concedes that the record does not suggest that this factor weighs in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The district court also noted that it was inconvenienced to the extent that granting Ortega\u2019s motion would encourage the trend toward the filing of baseless motions to withdraw after sentencing determinations had been made. \u201cThe rationale for allowing a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea is to permit him to undo a plea that was unknowingly made at the time it was entered.\u201d <em>Caur, </em>740 F.2d at 345. \u201cThe purpose is not to allow a defendant to make a tactical decision to enter a plea, wait several weeks, and then obtain a withdrawal if he believes that he made a bad choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ortega\u2019s argument that the district court erred in making this observation is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The district court also correctly found that Ortega\u2019s original guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. To enter a knowing and voluntary guilty plea, the defendant must have a \u201cfull understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u201d <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 244, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). At the rearraignment, Ortega acknowledged that he was pleading guilty \u201cfreely and voluntarily\u201d because he was guilty of the offense and \u201cfor no other reason.\u201d The district court noted that it \u201cspecifically handled firsthand\u201d Ortega\u2019s plea and that it had a lengthy plea colloquy with Ortega wherein it saw \u201cno confusion whatsoever\u201d from Ortega. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to withdraw. <em>See Grant, </em>117 F.3d at 789. Appointed counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw based on a breakdown in the attorney client relationship is denied. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">AFFIRMED; COUNSEL\u2019S MOTION TO WITHDRAW IS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b672-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
