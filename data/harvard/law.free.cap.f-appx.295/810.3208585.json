The first was against the State of Illinois and Judge Michael Mallon, the first judge involved in the divorce proceeding. The second included those two defendants as well as Judge Stephen Pemberton \u2014 he heard Davenport\u2019s motion to disqualify Judge Mallon \u2014 and the clerk of the Ogle County court, where the divorce proceedings were heard. The district court dismissed both suits based on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, under which a federal district court lacks jurisdiction to review state court judgments. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>Hemmer v. Ind. State Bd. of Animal Health, </em>532 F.3d 610, 613 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and, for the purpose of our review, we accept as true the allegations in Davenport\u2019s complaints. <em>See Evers v. Astrue, </em>536 F.3d 651, 656 (7th Cir.2008). In October 2005 Judge Mallon dissolved Davenport\u2019s marriage, but reserved the issues of property, support, and maintenance. About five months later, the attorney for Davenport\u2019s wife moved to vacate the order dissolving the marriage, and Judge Mallon granted the motion over Davenport\u2019s objection. Judge Mallon later entered a second judgment of dissolution, and Davenport appealed. The appeals court affirmed, holding that Judge Mallon had the power to vacate the first order, and the Illinois Supreme Court denied Davenport\u2019s petition for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">While the case was on appeal, the wife\u2019s attorney moved to transfer title of a car and sought attorneys fees. Davenport argued that Judge Mallon lacked jurisdiction while the case was before the appeals court, but Judge Mallon granted the motion to transfer title. Davenport appealed that ruling, but the appellate court dismissed the appeal. Davenport moved unsuccessfully to substitute another judge for Judge Mallon, and Judge Mallon later granted the motion for attorneys fees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Davenport responded with his first federal lawsuit charging that Judge Mallon misapplied the law and was not impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">After he filed his first suit in federal court, Davenport moved in state court to disqualify Judge Mallon. The clerk entered the following into the court\u2019s docket: \u201cPlaintiffs Motion to Substitute Judge is granted. Case given to Judge Pemberton.\u201d Davenport appeared before Judge Pemberton and asked that Pemberton also be disqualified. Before ruling, Judge Pemberton determined that the docket should not have shown that the motion to disqualify Judge Mallon was granted; instead, it should have shown that Pemberton was assigned to hear the motion. The clerk corrected the docket, and Davenport launched another motion to disqualify Judge Pemberton, which Judge Pemberton reviewed himself and denied. Davenport responded with another federal lawsuit against the same defendants as the first one as well as Judge Pemberton and the clerk of Ogle County Circuit Court, accusing them of misapplying the law and denying him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">On appeal Davenport argues that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not apply to any of his claims, but he is largely incorrect. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars Davenport\u2019s request that a federal district court review or revise a preexisting state-court judgment (the second dissolution of the marriage). <em>See Lance v. Dennis, </em>546 U.S. 459, 460, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 163 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2006). The appellees assume that the postdissolution orders on title transfer, fees, and disqualification are interlocutory and therefore not subject to <em>Rooker-Feldman, see TruServ Corp. v. Flegles, Inc., </em>419 F.3d 584, 591 (7th Cir. 2005), but that premise may be incorrect. <em>See In re Marriage of Gaudio, </em>368 Ill.App.3d 153, 306 Ill.Dec. 239, 857 N.E.2d 332, 335 (2006) (identifying split among appellate courts on finality of postdissolution orders when other postdissolution issues remain pending). They are correct, though, that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not bar jurisdiction over the claim against the clerk regarding the questionable docket entry, <em>see Snyder v. Nolen, </em>380 F.3d 279, 289 n. 10 (7th Cir.2004) (per curiam). In any event, Davenport\u2019s claims that are not barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>are barred for other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">First, the district court properly dismissed all claims against the State of Illinois because a state is not a \u201cperson\u201d subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 64, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Second, the court correctly dismissed the claims against the judges because they are absolutely immune. Although Davenport asserts that the judges acted without jurisdiction while the state case was on appeal, he does not dispute that his controversy was justiciable within the state courts and the adverse rulings were judicial in nature; absolute judicial immunity therefore defeats his claims. <em>See Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9,11-12, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991); <em>Dawson v. Newman, </em>419 F.3d 656, 660-61 (7th Cir. 2005); <em>Dellenbach v. Letsinger, </em>889 F.2d 755, 760 (7th Cir.1989). Finally, judicial clerks enjoy absolute immunity when they take administrative acts at the direction of a judicial officer. <em>Snyder, </em>380 F.3d at 286-87. As Davenport explains in his complaint, he objects to the clerk\u2019s making a docket entry \u201csolely on the face of a letter from Judge Pemberton.\u201d Thus, the clerk is entitled to immunity as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Because Davenport\u2019s claims are all barred, the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaints is</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
