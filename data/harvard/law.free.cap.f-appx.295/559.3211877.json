To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 488-84, 112 S.Ct. 812,117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Lin fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-20\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Lin\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Lin failed to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-21\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-17\"> Lin\u2019s brief merely recites the requirements for establishing a claim under the Convention Against Torture. She fails to raise any specific claims in this regard and has therefore waived appellate review. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (\u201d[T]he argument ... must contain ... appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies.\u201d); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (\"Failure to comply with the specific dictates of [Rule 28] with respect to a particular claim triggers abandonment of that claim on appeal.\u201d); <em>see also Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
