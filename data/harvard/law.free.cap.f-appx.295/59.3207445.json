Six Unknown Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Robinson continues to suffer from impaired vision, muscle spasms, and numbness in his face as a result of the attack. The district court dismissed Robinson\u2019s complaint upon initial screening for failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The procedural history of this case is troubling. On March 3, 2006, before filing his complaint, Robinson filed a \u201cPetition to preserve documentary evidence before the commencement of a civil action\u201d in which he asked the district court to order officials at the prison where he is incarcerated to preserve videotaped evidence of the attack. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 27(a). Robinson explained that he intended to bring a claim under <em>Bivens </em>and the Federal Tort Claims Act, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) &amp; 2674, but was unable to file a lawsuit in federal court at that time because he was still exhausting his administrative remedies under the FTCA, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a). According to Robinson, the entire October 4, 2005 attack was recorded by the prison\u2019s security camera, but the tape was scheduled to be recycled pursuant to the prison\u2019s policy of storing such surveillance footage for only six months. Robinson also submitted a copy of a disciplinary report issued against him as a result of the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The district court granted Robinson\u2019s petition and ordered prison staff to preserve the evidence. The district court also told Robinson on June 7, 2006, that he had only 21 days to file his complaint. If he did not file his complaint within that time, the court told him his petition to preserve evidence would be dismissed. The court\u2019s deadline ignored the statute of limitations; the two-year period for bringing a <em>Bivens </em>action would have extended at least until October 2007, <em>see, e.g., Myles v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 551, 552 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Bontkowski v. Smith, </em>305 F.3d 757, 762 (7th Cir.2002), and Robinson had six months after the Bureau of Prisons denied his administrative claim (which the Bureau had not yet done) in which to file a tort action, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b); <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 109 n. 4, 113 S.Ct. 1980,124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">On June 28, 2006, Robinson responded with a \u201cMotion to hold suit in abeyance\u201d and an attached complaint. His motion indicated that he wanted to bring a negligence claim but was still unable to do so because prison officials had \u201cyet to respond or acknowledge receipt of [the] administrative claim\u201d under the FTCA. As a result, Robinson advised the court that he was \u201cskeptical about submitting this complaint.\u201d Robinson also reminded the court that the statute of limitations on his <em>Bivens </em>claim was two years and asked the court to hold his entire suit in abeyance until his administrative case was resolved in the prison system and he was able to amend his complaint to add the negligence claim. The court denied Robinson\u2019s motion and dismissed his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Our review of a dismissal under \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim is de novo. <em>Westefer v. Snyder, </em>422 F.3d 570, 574 (7th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s directive and Robinson\u2019s response suggest that Robinson filed his <em>Bivens </em>complaint only as a placeholder, in response to the court\u2019s sua sponte deadline, because he feared the district court would permit prison officials to destroy the evidence he needed to pursue his intended claim, a negligence action under the FTCA. In effect, Robinson wanted all along to bring a negligence suit but was forced into bringing a potentially frivolous <em>Bivens </em>action because his FTCA claim would have been premature. <em>See McNeil, </em>508 U.S. at 109, 113 S.Ct. 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">We conclude that the district court erred when it required Robinson to file a complaint within 21 days, effectively moving up the statute of limitations and creating an impossible situation for a prisoner who was dependent on the prison-review system for proper exhaustion. Robinson\u2019s petition to preserve evidence was an entirely legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>mate request given the circumstances, <em>see Nissei Sangyo Am., Ltd. v. United States, </em>31 F.3d 435, 440 (7th Cir.1994); <em>Deiulemar Compagnia Di Navigazione v. M/V Allegra, </em>198 F.3d 473, 484 (4th Cir.1999), and his decision to invoke Rule 27 did not give the district court authority to then compel Robinson to file his planned lawsuit prematurely. We therefore VACATE the order dismissing Robinson\u2019s complaint and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this order. The district court shall permit Robinson to amend his complaint to flesh out the allegations of his <em>Bivens </em>claim and, if feasible at this time, to add his FTCA claim. The district court shall also ensure that prison officials do not destroy the videotaped evidence until both the constitutional and statutory claims have been fully litigated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
