We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-21\">1. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b570-22\">Because we write solely for the parties, we assume familiarity with the case and discuss only those facts necessary to our decision. Schettino alleges that he was disabled between March 26, 2001 and May 12, 2002 due to a combination of back and knee problems, obesity, gastrointestinal reflux disease, and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ found, in step three of his analysis, that Schettino\u2019s impairments, while severe, did not meet the criteria of an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. I.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ further found that Schettino possessed the residual functional capacity to perform only sedentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>work. That finding led the ALJ to conclude in step four that Schettino could not have performed his past relevant work as a baker and cake decorator during the time period at issue. However, the residual functional capacity finding, taken in conjunction with Schettino\u2019s age, education, and work experience, led the ALJ to conclude in step five that Schettino was not disabled during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The Appeals Council denied Schettino\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security. Schettino sought review by the District Court. After the District Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision, Schettino filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">On appeal, Schettino argues that the ALJ\u2019s step three analysis was flawed in three ways. First, he alleges that the ALJ failed to take his obesity into account when determining whether his impairments met the criteria for a listed impairment. Second, he alleges that the ALJ failed to consider the combined effect of all of his impairments when determining whether they met the criteria for a listed impairment. Third, he argues that the ALJ\u2019s step three analysis was so conelusory as to prevent meaningful judicial review. We disagree on all counts. The ALJ explicitly stated that he had taken Schettino\u2019s obesity into consideration under step three, but nevertheless found that Schettino\u2019s impairments did not, alone or in combination, meet the criteria of a listed impairment. In particular, the ALJ found that Schettino\u2019s impairments did not meet the criteria set forth in 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, Section 1.00 for the musculoskeletal system and, specifically, did not meet the criteria set forth in Listing 1.02 because the evidence of record did not demonstrate that Schettino was unable to ambulate effectively. The ALJ also found that Schettino\u2019s impairments did not meet the criteria set forth in Section 13.00 and, specifically, did not meet Listing 13.05(A) for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">Not only are those findings capable of judicial review, we have reviewed them and we conclude that they are supported by substantial evidence. For example, among the medical evidence summarized by the ALJ is a report from Dr. Potashnik, who noted that Schettino walked without an assistive device. Because \u201cineffective ambulation\u201d is defined in Section 1.00 as \u201chaving insufficient lower extremity functioning ... to permit independent ambulation without the use of a hand-held assistive device(s) that limits the functioning of both upper extremities,\u201d the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Schettino could ambulate effectively, and therefore could not meet the criteria in Listing 1.02, is supported by substantial evidence. Also reviewable and supported by substantial evidence is the ALJ\u2019s finding that Schettino\u2019s impairments did not meet the criteria set forth in Listing 13.05(A) for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma because there was no evidence in the record that Schettino had had \u201c[i]ntermediate or high-grade lymphoma persistent or recurrent following initial antineoplastic therapy\u201d or \u201c[l]ow-grade or indolent lymphoma requiring initiation of more than one antineoplastic treatment regimen within a consecutive 12-month period.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Schettino next argues that the ALJ failed to articulate a rationale underlying his finding that Schettino possessed the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work. Again, we disagree. The ALJ extensively discussed the medical evidence in the record and, based on that evidence, found that Schettino could perform sedentary work because he could lift ten pounds, stand or walk for two hours, and sit for six hours. The ALJ\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence, including a report authored by a physician from New Jersey\u2019s Disability Determination Services, who opined that Schettino was able to stand or walk for at least two hours, as well as sit for six hours, in an eight-hour workday and occasionally lift twenty pounds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-13\">. In a decision prior to the decision now on appeal, the ALJ determined that Schettino was entitled to disability insurance benefits as of May 13, 2002. The issue in this appeal is whether he was entitled to benefits before that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b570-23\">. Although the ALJ did not explicitly state at step two that Schettino's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was severe, the ALJ considered in step three whether Schettino's impairments met the criteria in Listing 13.05(A) for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Like the District Court, our role on appeal is to determine whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b571-14\">. Perhaps recognizing that substantial evidence supports that finding, Schettino argues that, while his impairments \u201cmay or may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>not\u201d meet Listing 13.05, the AU's step three analysis was nevertheless flawed because the ALJ erroneously failed to categorize Schettino\u2019s non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma as \"severe\u201d at step 2. (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 17.) However, even assuming that was error, it was harmless because the AU specifically analyzed in step three whether Schettino\u2019s impairments met the criteria set forth in Listing 13.05(A) for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and found that they did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">. Schettino nevertheless argues that the AU's finding that he possessed the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work on May 12, 2002 \u201dignore[s] the benefits of hindsight\u201d because the AU determined in a previous decision that Schettino was entitled to disability insurance benefits as of May 13, 2002, a day later. (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 23.) But the AU\u2019s determination that Schettino was entitled to benefits as of May 13, 2002 was not the result of a finding that Schettino\u2019s residual functional capacity had deteriorated as of that date. Instead, the AU found that Schettino became an individual \"closely approaching advanced age\" on May 13, 2002, which, combined with findings regarding his education and prior work experience and the finding that he could perform sedentary work, led the ALJ in step 5 to conclude under the pertinent regulation that Schettino was disabled as of that date. <em>Compare </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 2, Table 1, Rule 201.14 (individual \"closely approaching advanced age\u201d with sedentary residual functional capacity and Schettino's education and previous work experience should be deemed \"disabled\u201d), <em>with id. </em>at Rule 201.21 (\"younger individual\u201d with sedentary residual functional capacity and Schettino\u2019s education and previous work experience should be deemed \"not disabled\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
