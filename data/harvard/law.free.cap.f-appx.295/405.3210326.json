Feb. 21, 2008), <em>ajf\u2019g </em>No. A73 675 826 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 12, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-29\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified and supplement<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ed by the BIA decision. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Passi v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 98, 101 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">As a preliminary matter, to the extent that Li attempts to challenge the merits of the BIA\u2019s 1996 decision, which denied his democracy movement claim, that decision is not properly before us. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001). Only the BIA\u2019s February 2008 decision is before us as that is the only decision from which a petition for review was timely filed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Li\u2019s argument that he established persecution based on his involvement in the democracy movement before this Court ignores the fact that the agency consistently treated his reopened proceedings as limited to his family planning claim, as Li himself did before the IJ on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">With respect to his family planning claim, Li argues that he should be deemed to have been persecuted based on his wife\u2019s forcible abortion and the detention of his mother for two days because of his opposition to the family planning policy. With respect to his mother\u2019s detention, Li contends that it constituted persecution of him because of the \u201cpsychological torture\u201d he endured. Therefore, he asserts that he should be presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Li failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. Li is not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum or withholding of removal based on the forcible abortion of his wife or the detention of his mother because \u201capplicants can become candidates for asylum relief only based on persecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer.\u201d <em>See Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 308 (2d Cir.2007). To the extent Li\u2019s brief may be understood to argue that the police detained his mother in order to persecute him, that argument fails. Indeed, no evidence indicates that Li\u2019s mother was mistreated or threatened with mistreatment. <em>See Ai Feng Yuan v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir.2005), <em>overruled on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (upholding agency\u2019s determination that applicant had not been persecuted where applicant \u201cwas detained only briefly, and was not mistreated while in custody\u201d). Therefore, the BIA properly found that Li failed to establish that he had been persecuted on that basis. <em>See Tao Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 137, 141 (2d Cir.2007) (finding that harm to a family member as a means of targeting the applicant will only amount to persecution where the applicant \u201cwas also within the zone of risk when the family member was harmed, and suffered some continuing hardship after the incident\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Because the record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Li failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution, the BIA properly affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 182 (2d Cir.2004). Because Li fails to challenge the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>zales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of voluntary departure in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
