The conviction was entered pursuant to Davidson\u2019s guilty plea on one count of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(c) (Count One); possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (Count Two); and possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2) (Count Three). The District Court imposed a sentence of 111 months, and Davidson timely filed this appeal. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">On appeal, Davidson raises a cavalcade of issues, nearly all of which are meritless. The sole exception is the District Court\u2019s imposition of a $300 fine for both Counts One and Two, which is arguably invalid; rather than explore and adjudicate the issue, in accordance with the Government\u2019s stated preference at oral argument, we simply strike the $300 fine on Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Davidson\u2019s conviction and sentence of imprisonment and MODIFY the fine imposed in accordance with the Guidelines calculation and the Government\u2019s concession.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
