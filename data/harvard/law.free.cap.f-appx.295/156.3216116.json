The ALJ concluded Sanders had a severe impairment within the meaning of the regulations, but that Sanders retained a residual functional capacity that enabled him to perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy. Sanders contends substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s determination of Sanders\u2019s mental residual functional capacity or the ALJ\u2019s finding Sanders could perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy. Because substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">First, in determining Sanders\u2019s residual mental functional capacity, the ALJ credited the testimony of the examining physician over that of the non-examining physician. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1). Though the ALJ departed from an earlier Veterans Affairs disability determination, the ALJ provided \u201cpersuasive, specific, valid reasons for doing so that are supported by the record.\u201d <em>McCartey v. Massanari, </em>298 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir.2002). The previous disability determination was several years old, and intervening medical records demonstrated Sanders\u2019s condition had improved. Second, the vocational expert did not contradict the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles, </em>but instead adjusted available statistics in order to conform his testimony to the classifications found in the <em>Dictionary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
