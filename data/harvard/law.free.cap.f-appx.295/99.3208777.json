He argues that the court abused its discretion because it did not \u201cfairly take into account\u201d certain 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as it did not properly consider his educational goals and achievements while on probation, and it made a statement at sentencing about his alleged drug use that was not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-21\">We reject this argument. The district court stated that it had taken into account all the section 3553 factors. Moreover, the court was not required to comment explicitly on A.E.B.\u2019s educational goals and achievements. <em>See United States v. M.R.M., </em>513 F.3d 866, 868 (8th Cir.2008) (while this court has found reference to some \u00a7 3553(a) factors useful in determining whether district court permissibly considered certain evidence as relevant in juvenile proceeding, it has not declared that district court must balance all \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making juvenile disposition), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. June 17, 2008) (No. 07-11488); <em>cf. United States v. White Face, </em>383 F.3d 733, 740 (8th Cir.2004) (district court need not mechanically list every \u00a7 3553(a) consideration when sentencing defendant upon revocation of supervised release). To the extent the district court\u2019s reference to A.E.B.\u2019s alleged drug use was improper, we find no indication that the court gave this allegation significant weight in determining his sentence. <em>See United States v. Long Soldier, </em>431 F.3d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir.2005) (abuse of discretion occurs when court, inter alia, gives significant weight to improper or irrelevant factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-23\">After careful review, we conclude that A.E.B.\u2019s revocation sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Griggs, </em>431 F.3d 1110, 1111, 1115 (8th Cir.2005) (reviewing sentence imposed after revocation of probation under \u201cunreasonableness\u201d standard announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 258-63, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)); <em>cf M.R.M., </em>513 F.3d at 868 (this court has jurisdiction to determine whether sentence imposed under Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act was imposed in violation of law or is plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>ly unreasonable; district court enjoys broader discretion when sentencing juvenile offender than when sentencing adult).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Accordingly, we allow counsel to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-20\">. The Honorable Charles B. Kornmann, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
