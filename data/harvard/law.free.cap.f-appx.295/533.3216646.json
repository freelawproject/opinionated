The only issue on appeal is the reasonableness of the sentence. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">I. Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">Because the facts are well known to the parties, we will discuss them only briefly here.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">Williams was indicted for knowingly and willfully escaping from an institution in which he was lawfully confined, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 751(a) and 4082(a). Williams escaped from the Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution. Williams pled guilty to the indictment on February 27, 2007. The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines provided a range of 27 to 33 months imprisonment for Williams\u2019 offense. In addition, Guidelines \u00a7 5G1.3(a) provides, \u201cIf the instant offense was committed while the defendant was serving a term of imprisonment ... the sentence for the instant offense shall be imposed to run consecutively to the undischarged term of imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-15\">The District Court held a sentencing hearing on July 23, 2007. Prior to that hearing, Williams had submitted a memorandum requesting a downward departure pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.4 and 5K2.0(a)(3). Section 5H1.4 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aik\">\u201cPhysical condition ... is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure may be warranted. However, an extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to depart downward; <em>e.g., </em>in the case of a seriously infirm defendant, home detention may be as efficient as, and less costly than, imprisonment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-16\">Section 5K2.0(a)(3) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-17\">\u201cA departure may be warranted in an exceptional case, even though the circumstance that forms the basis for the departure is taken into consideration in determining the guideline range, if the court determines that such circumstance is present in the offense to a degree substantially in excess of, or substantially below, that which ordinarily is involved in that kind of offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-18\">Williams sought a departure pursuant to \u00a7 5H1.4 on the basis of his medical condition and under \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3) on the ground that his escape represented an \u201cexceptional case.\u201d Williams claimed that he had escaped from Fort Dix to obtain necessary medical care, as evidenced by the fact that, about four weeks after his escape, he visited an emergency room in California, where he could not be turned away for lack of insurance. While at the emergency room, Williams (using an alias) underwent an angioplasty, a catheterization, and the insertion of two stents.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>In addition to a downward departure, Williams also requested a 27-month sentence that would run concurrently with his existing sentence. Williams argued that a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range was appropriate based on consideration of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">After hearing arguments from counsel and a statement from Williams, the District Court denied Williams\u2019 request for a downward departure and imposed a sentence of 33 months imprisonment, the top of the Guidelines range. While acknowledging that it had the discretion to grant a downward departure under \u00a7 5H1.4, the District Court concluded that Williams was not entitled to one because his criminal history demonstrated that he had committed offenses since the onset of his medical ailments and because the record failed to establish that the Bureau of Prisons had failed to address or was incapable of addressing Williams\u2019 medical problems while he was at Fort Dix. With respect to Williams\u2019 request for a concurrent sentence, the District Court determined that, under the Guidelines, an individual who commits an offense while serving a term of imprisonment should receive a sentence consecutive to the unfinished term. The District Court concluded further that the facts and circumstances of Williams\u2019 case did not justify the imposition of a concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In considering Williams\u2019 request for the minimum sentence in the Guidelines range under \u00a7 3553(a), to run concurrently with his undischarged sentence, the District Court concluded that the maximum Guidelines sentence was appropriate. The District Court reasoned that Williams had a history of escaping federal supervision and that the need to deter such conduct by Williams and other inmates was a \u201cvery important consideration\u201d in cases involving escape. The District Court noted that Williams could have sought a remedy for an alleged failure by the federal institution to address his medical needs by pursuing administrative relief and civil litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Williams appealed. He argues that the District Court\u2019s sentence is unreasonable because, in light of his proffered reason for escaping, a consecutive sentence at the top of the Guidelines range is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">Generally, following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 326-28 (3d Cir.2006). Reasonableness review essentially calls upon us to \u201cask[ ] whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">We apply a deferential standard in examining the District Court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330. \u201cThe pertinent inquiry is whether the final sentence, wherever it may lie within the permissible statutory range, was premised upon appropriate and judicious consideration of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Lessner, </em>498 F.3d 185, 204 (3d Cir.2007) (internal quotation omitted). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of proving its unreasonableness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">Williams has failed to meet that burden in this case. As we set out above, the record indicates that the District Court reasonably considered and applied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining his sentence. The District Court\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable simply because the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>trict Court did not afford Williams\u2019 proffered reason for escape the mitigating weight he believes it deserved. The record demonstrates that the District Court gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the \u00a7 3558(a) factors and determined that a consecutive sentence of the maximum length within the Guidelines range was necessary for deterrence and protection of the public. We find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
