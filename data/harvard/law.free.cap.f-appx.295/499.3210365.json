We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Dowling was employed as a Branch Manager at the Peebles Road Office of Citizens Bank until she was dismissed in May 2004. Dowling was responsible for the branch\u2019s retail banking operations and supervised 10-15 employees. During the period relevant to this litigation, Dowling reported to Regional Manager Charlotte Bullock and Regional Director of Retail Banking Craig Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Beginning in 2003, Citizens made it a priority to open new consumer checking accounts. To this end, Bullock and Campbell pressured their employees to solicit family members and friends to open accounts, which could be established with initial deposits of $10. Employees who met this and similar performance goals were eligible for incentives, including vacation packages and prizes. The bank\u2019s 2003 Retail Incentive Program provided that \u201c[a]ny attempts at gaming, altering or modifying results in any element of the employee incentive program are grounds for withholding payment and disciplinary action up to and including termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">Pursuant to the incentive program, Citizens awarded Dowling a company-paid vacation to the Caribbean in early 2004. Shortly thereafter, Campbell received an anonymous letter stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-17\">Someone needs to seriously research Marianne <em>[sic </em>] Dowling and Teresa Rotando of the Peebles Rd office for gaming in checking accounts. Everyone in our region knows, it\u2019s like an unspoken issue among us. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair because of this that she keeps being rewarded with trips and incentive [sic] and those of us that make our goals the right way are overlooked. We could never figure out how she always pulled out making her goal. The proof is all in black and white, you just need to look.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A09\">App\u2019x 167. Campbell asked Richard Sedory, Vice President of Human Resources, and Matt Clydesdale, Director of Corporate Security, to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">Assisted by an auditor, Clydesdale discovered that Dowling had opened 114 checking accounts in her name or in the names of her family members and friends. Most were opened with nominal deposits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>and closed after short periods of time during which little or no account activity occurred. Two of Dowling\u2019s employees\u2014 Teresa Rotondo and Assistant Branch Manager Terry Braun \u2014 engaged in similar conduct. In addition, Braun had been transferring funds from the bank\u2019s general ledger to customers\u2019 personal and business accounts to inflate her performance rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Campbell confronted Dowling about the aforementioned activities on May 3, 2004. Despite Dowling\u2019s insistence that she did not intentionally violate bank policy, Campbell fired her because he \u201cno longer had confidence in her as a manager.\u201d Campbell also fired Braun, but issued only a warning to Rotondo because \u201cit appeared that she was acting under the instructions[ ] ... of Ms. Dowling,\u201d and \u201cgiven her status as a less experienced nonmanagement employee,\u201d she was less culpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Dowling sued Citizens for employment discrimination claiming that she was fired because of her sex, age, association with her disabled husband, and expected exercise of Family Medical Leave Act rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Magistrate Judge recommended that Citizens\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted because Dowling failed to \u201crefute the Defendant\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for her termination.\u201d The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation and entered summary judgment in favor of Citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary, and we apply the same standard as the District Court. <em>Marzano v. Computer Science Corp., </em>91 F.3d 497, 501 (3d Cir.1996). We will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and Citizens is \u201centitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In making this determination, we \u201cview the facts in the light most favorable\u201d to Dowling and \u201cdraw all inferences\u201d in her favor. <em>Marzano, </em>91 F.3d at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Citizens argues that even if Dowling made out <em>prima facie </em>cases for each of her claims, it responded with legitimate, nondiscriminatory justifications for her termination. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 763 (3d Cir.1994). Dowling argues that Citizens\u2019s justifications are insufficient \u201cto meet [her] prima facie case,\u201d and that the justifications are \u201cpretext for the sort of discrimination prohibited\u201d by Title VII, the ADEA, the ADA, the FMLA, and the PHRA. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">To show pretext, a claimant must present \u201csome evidence ... from which a fact-finder could reasonably either (1) disbelieve the employer\u2019s articulated legitimate reasons; or (2) believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Fuentes, </em>32 F.3d at 764-65; <em>see Torre v. Casio, Inc., </em>42 F.3d 825, 830 (3d Cir.1994). Most of Dowling\u2019s arguments focus on the former category of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">First, Dowling argues that Citizens proffered \u201cinconsistent\u201d and \u201cshifting\u201d justifications for her discharge. It is true that inconsistency is indicative of pretext, <em>see, e.g., Fuentes, </em>32 F.3d at 764, but Citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>zens\u2019s justifications were not inconsistent. When Campbell fired Dowling, he told her that he lost \u201cconfidence in her as a manager.\u201d Subsequently, Citizens prepared an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission statement indicating that Dowling was dismissed for: (1) her improper \u201cgaming\u201d in checking accounts, and (2) her failure to properly supervise her staff (especially Braun and Rotondo). These explanations are entirely consistent; the EEOC statement simply specifies the reasons for Campbell\u2019s loss of confidence in Dowling\u2019s managerial abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Second, Dowling argues that because she did not intentionally violate bank policy, Citizens\u2019s reliance on her \u201cgaming\u201d activities as a basis for her termination was pretextual. We are unpersuaded because Citizens need not show that Dowling intentionally violated company policy in order to have a legitimate reason for firing her. <em>See Kautz v. Met-Pro Corp., </em>412 F.3d 463, 467-68 (3d Cir.2005). So long as Citizens\u2019s decision was not motivated by discriminatory animus, we defer to it. <em>Id. </em>at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Third, Dowling argues that she established pretext through evidence that Citizens treated similarly situated employees more favorably. <em>See Simpson v. Kay Jewelers, </em>142 F.3d 639, 645-46 (3d Cir. 1998). Specifically, she complains that Scott Vidovich, a \u201c30-year-old male branch manager\u201d who failed to audit his tellers in accordance with bank policy, and Teresa Rotondo, who engaged in gaming, received only warnings for their conduct. We find these employees\u2019 situations distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Vidovich, like Dowling, failed to properly supervise his employees, allowing one to embezzle $69,800. Unlike Vidovich, however, Dowling\u2019s negligent supervision was compounded by her own gaming activities. Conversely, Rotondo engaged in gaming activities, but she was a non-management employee under Dowling\u2019s direct supervision. Accordingly, Citizens had a legitimate reason to view Rotondo as less culpable and less of a threat to the proper and efficient operation of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Finally, Dowling shifts her focus from discrediting Citizens\u2019s explanations to suggesting \u201cinvidious discriminatory reason[s]\u201d that \u201cmore likely than not\u201d motivated the bank\u2019s decision. <em>Fuentes, </em>32 F.3d at 764. Dowling highlights Bullock\u2019s testimony that she believed Campbell was hiring \u201cyoung kids\u201d to replace older branch managers. Bullock admitted, however, that her belief was based on \u201crumor [more] than anything else.\u201d Dowling also points to statistical evidence that she claims substantiates Bullock\u2019s speculation by showing that \u201conly eight persons over the age of 50 were hired or promoted to the position of branch manager out of a total of 39\u201d applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">This evidence falls short of demonstrating that discriminatory animus was more likely than not a motivating factor in Citizens\u2019s decision to fire Dowling. First, the ADEA protects individuals over the age of forty, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631, and Dowling\u2019s statistics show that 15 of the 39 individuals promoted to branch manager fell into this class. Second, Dowling\u2019s statistics address neither the characteristics of the applicant pool from which the remaining 24 \u201cyoung kids\u201d were selected nor the characteristics of the branch managers they replaced. Without these comparisons, we cannot determine whether qualified individuals over the age of 40 were rejected in favor of less qualified, younger applicants. <em>See Ezold v. Wolf, Block, Schorr &amp; Solis-Cohen, </em>983 F.2d 509, 542-43 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">In short, Dowling presented insufficient evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Citizens\u2019s legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>mate, nondiscriminatory justification for her dismissal was pretextual. Intentionally or otherwise, Dowling violated the bank\u2019s policy against \u201cgaming\u201d and supervised her employees so negligently that one managed to steal from the bank\u2019s general ledger. Her supervisor\u2019s loss of confidence in her as a manager was neither pretextual nor improper. We will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\">.
