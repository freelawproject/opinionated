Kandi moved for redetermination of his tax liability in the district court after the IRS concluded that he was liable for unpaid employment taxes that accrued in 2001. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Kandi challenges the validity of Treasury Regulations \u00a7 301.7701-1, \u00a7 301.7701-2, and \u00a7 301.7701-3. Kandi did not challenge the validity of the regulations before the district court. This court ordinarily declines to consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Dream Palace v. County of Maricopa, </em>384 F.3d 990, 1005 (9th Cir.2004). Here, however, we exercise our discretion to consider Kandi\u2019s argument because \u201cthe issue is purely one of law, does not affect or rely upon the factual record developed by the parties, and [consideration of the issue] will not prejudice\u201d the government. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Janes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>279 F.3d 883, 888 n. 4 (9th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The Internal Revenue Code grants authority to the Treasury Department to \u201cprescribe all needful rules and regulations for the enforcement of this title.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7805(a). The regulations Kandi challenges provide for the taxation of certain business entities, including limited liability companies (\u201cLLCs\u201d). Kandi concedes that Congress has not clearly addressed how LLCs should be taxed. Where Congress has not directly addressed the question at issue, courts defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute if it is \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">We conclude that the agency\u2019s interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code here was reasonable. The Internal Revenue Code defines person, partnership and corporation, but it does not state whether an LLC fits under any of these definitions. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701. The broad statutory definitions of \u201cemployer\u201d Kandi cites similarly do not answer the question of who constitutes the employer for federal tax purposes in the context of a sole member LLC. The regulations at issue here were a reasonable attempt by the Treasury Department to fill in gaps left in the statute regarding the taxation of LLCs and other new forms of business entities. <em>See McNamee v. Dept. of Treasury, </em>488 F.3d 100, 109 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Littriello v. United States, </em>484 F.3d 372, 378 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">The recent decision by the IRS to adopt new regulations regarding the taxation of sole member LLCs does not change the result here. <em>See </em>72 Fed.Reg. 45,891 (Aug. 16, 2007). The new regulations are applicable to taxes on wages paid after January 1, 2009, and thus do not apply to Kandi\u2019s unpaid 2001 employment taxes. <em>Id. </em>The agency\u2019s recent decision to adopt an alternative approach also does not mean that the regulations challenged here are incompatible with the statute. Either approach is permissible under the statute because the statute is silent on how LLCs should be taxed. Finally, the agency\u2019s decision to adopt a new approach does not strip it of Chevron deference. <em>See Natl. Cable &amp; Telecomm. Ass\u2019n v. Brand X Internet Svcs., </em>545 U.S. 967, 981, 125 S.Ct. 2688, 162 L.Ed.2d 820 (2005) (\u201cAgency inconsistency is not a basis for declining to analyze the agency\u2019s interpretation under the <em>Chevron </em>framework.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Because the agency\u2019s attempt to fill in gaps in the Internal Revenue Code was reasonable, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment to the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b899-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
