Feb. 21, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">We ordinarily review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). Here, however, Xiao\u2019s brief, prepared by counsel Andre Sobolevsky, is of such poor quality that it waives any challenge to the BIA decision under review. The brief Sobolevsky submitted, inter alia: (1) refers to the Petitioner, Bao Hua Xiao, as Chen Xin Lin; (2) repeatedly implies that the petition is a challenge to the BIA\u2019s affirmance of an IJ\u2019s decision rather than the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen; (3) refers to the submission of documentary evidence although Xiao submitted no evidence; and (4) argues that the IJ failed to consider evidence showing the widespread torture of members of house churches where Xiao never applied for CAT relief before the IJ and never claimed to be a member of a house church. Even the portions of the brief that are arguably responsive to the actual decision under review refer to nonexistent evidence. Under such circumstances, we deem waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of Xiao\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005). Attorney Sobolevsky is warned that further briefing of this quality will result in sanctions. We refer this matter to the Court\u2019s Grievance Panel for investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
