Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231 and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cantave argues that she established eligibility for asylum based on a protected ground, specifically membership in a particular social group. She also argues that she established eligibility for CAT relief based on evidence of the possibility that she would be tortured if returned to Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In this case, the BIA issued its own opinion rather than adopting the IJ\u2019s removal order. We therefore review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To the extent that the BIA based its decision on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). We review the BIA\u2019s findings of fact under the substantial evidence test, which requires that we \u201cview the record in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of \u201crefugee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\"><em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Not all \u201cexceptional treatment\u201d constitutes persecution. <em>Zheng v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006). Rather, persecution is \u201can extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">An asylum applicant may not show merely that she can establish a listed factor, but must show a causal connection between the persecution, or feared persecution, and a listed factor. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Those eligible for asylum are protected not only against persecution by government forces, but also against persecution by non-governmental groups that the government cannot control. <em>See Sanchez v. Attorney General, </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004) (concerning withholding of removal). Evidence that an individual has been the victim of criminal activity, however, does not constitute evidence of persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. <em>See id. </em>at 438 (citing <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 494-95 (3d Cir. 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">To establish a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of future persecution, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. An asylum applicant can establish a well-founded fear of future persecution by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotation omitted). Alternatively, an applicant can establish a well-founded fear of persecution by establishing that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of persons similarly situated on account of the statutorily listed factor. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). Allegations of a future threat are less persuasive if the petitioner\u2019s family remains in her country without incident. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The BIA defines \u201cmembership in a particular social group\u201d as persons who hold an immutable characteristic or common trait such as sex, color, kinship, or, in some cases, shared past experiences such as land ownership or military service. <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985), <em>overruled on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439, 439 (BIA 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">To obtain CAT relief, the applicant must \u201cestablish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). \u201cTorture\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">[A]ny act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). If an applicant cannot show that she has a well-founded fear of persecution, then she cannot show that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s removal order because Cantave had not shown that she had suffered persecution on account of a protected ground. As the BIA observed, Cantave \u201cdid not establish that she suffered mistreatment in the past, or is likely to suffer any harm in the future in her native Haiti, on account of a protected ground under the Act.\u201d \u201cRather, the motivation of the individuals who killed [her] father, briefly kidnapped [her], and beat [her] stepmother, was theft. Moreover, [Cantave] has failed to establish that she was targeted by the government of Haiti or by a group from which the government was unable or unwilling to protect her.\u201d Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusions that Cantave failed to establish eligibility for asylum based on a protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ground and to eligibility for CAT relief, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-6\">. In her brief to this court, Cantave does not argue that she qualifies for withholding of removal under the INA. Therefore, she has abandoned that issue. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-14\">. \"To reverse the [BIA\u2019s] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
