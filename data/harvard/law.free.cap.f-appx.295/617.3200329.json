In his petition, Raifsnider, who was convicted of being a felon in possession of firearms and was sentenced to a 180-month term of imprisonment based on his prior violent felony convictions, attacked the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The district court determined that Raifsnider was challenging his conviction and his sentence and that Raifsnider could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his claim did not satisfy the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-21\">Raifsnider argues that \u00a7 2241 can be used to attack the constitutionality of a criminal statute. Here, however, Raifsnider\u2019s constitutional challenge is, in effect, an attack on his 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. A motion under \u00a7 2255 provides the primary means of \u201ccollaterally attacking a federal sentence.\u201d <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-22\">Raifsnider has not pointed to any retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision that applies to his claim, nor has he shown that his claim was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when it should have been raised. Raifsnider has not met his burden to show that he is entitled to proceed under the savings clause. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>see also Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Raifsnider requests that this court consider his claim pursuant to a writ of <em>audita querela. </em>Because Raifsnider\u2019s claim regarding the constitutionality of the statute under which he was sentenced is not a \u201clegal defense arising after judgment,\u201d he cannot proceed under a writ of <em>audita querela. See Jimenez v. Trominski, </em>91 F.3d 767, 768 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b643-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
