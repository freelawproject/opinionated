Edwards (\u201cEdwards\u201d), a federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion as time barred and the district court\u2019s subsequent denial of his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">In a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Garcia v. United States, </em>278 F.3d 1210,1212 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">\u201cThe decision to alter or amend a judgment is committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Drago v. Jenne, </em>453 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, we review the district court\u2019s denial of a Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">After reviewing the record, reading the pai\u2019ties\u2019 briefs, and having the benefit of oral argument, we hold that the district court did not err in finding that Edwards\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely. Because the district court found that Edwards\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court was untimely, the petition did not toll the time for filing his \u00a7 2255 motion. Second, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Edwards\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion because he failed to meet the standard for relief under the Rule. Specifically, Edwards did not demonstrate that the documents he attached to his Rule 59(e) motion had been unavailable to him prior to the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. Because we conclude that there is no merit to any of the arguments Edwards makes in this appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment denying Edwards\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and the order denying his Rule 59(e) motion to set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
