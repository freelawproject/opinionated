We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">Harris challenges his sentence as procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-16\">A. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b456-17\">A sentencing court must determine the Sentencing Guidelines range, then consider the Guidelines range, along with the other factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall v. United States,</em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). <em>Inter alia, </em>Harris argues that the sentencing court improperly (1) based its departure from the Guidelines range on his failure to provide the court \u201cinsight\u201d as to why he set fires, (2) failed to identify a Guidelines range that correlates to Harris\u2019 criminal history or likelihood to recidivate in determining the extent of the departure from the recommended Guidelines sentence, and (3) failed to make a specific ruling on a controverted matter of fact contained in Harris\u2019s Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). We reject Harris\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-20\">1. Silence As a Basis for Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b456-21\">The district judge identified four reasons motivating his belief that the Guidelines failed to reflect Harris\u2019s \u201cdangerousness\u201d and likelihood to recidivate. One of those reasons was that \u201cthe defendant has not provided the Court with any insight as to why he committed arson repeatedly or why he selected the location that he did to commit arson.\u201d Harris argues that the district court therefore contravened our instruction that \u201ca sentence may not, because of a defendant\u2019s refusal to cooperate, be increased or additional punishment imposed beyond what would otherwise have been meted out.\u201d <em>United States v. Bradford, </em>645 F.2d 115, 117 (2d Cir.1981). However, <em>Bradford </em>is inapposite because it warns against increasing punishment based on failing to cooperate with a prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>cutor \u2014 not with the sentencing court and probation office. In <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>201 F.3d 99 (2d Cir.1999), we vacated a sentence that had been augmented because of the defendant\u2019s failure to cooperate; but that case is distinguishable on several grounds. First (as in Bradford), the cited failure to cooperate was with the government\u2019s investigations. Second, a five-year incremental sentence was attributed solely to the defendant\u2019s silence, whereas here Harris\u2019s silence was one of four reasons for an increase. And finally, the court did not penalize Harris for silence itself; the sentencing court <em>inferred </em>from Harris\u2019s behavior that he was dangerous and likely to recidivate, and it departed from the Guidelines sentence on that basis. The court\u2019s challenged comment is properly understood as an observation that defendant had not provided any reason to take a more favorable view of this behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">2. Mechanics of Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Harris argues that the district court failed to \u201cdetermine the extent of [the] departure [from the recommended Guidelines sentence] ... by using, as a reference, the criminal history category applicable to defendants whose criminal history or likelihood to recidivate most closely resembles that of [Harris].\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(A) (2007). Harris did not object on that basis in the district court. Even here, he has failed to identify a point of reference that the district court should have considered. Accordingly, Harris has not demonstrated that the omission he cites resulted in a greater sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Harris\u2019s idea that the district court erred in failing to \u201cpause at each category above the applicable one to consider whether the higher category adequately reflects the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s record\u201d is defeated by well settled law. <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>343 F.3d 72, 78 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">3. Mechanics of Factfinding at Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Harris argues that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(3) because the court adopted the PSR in its entirety as a finding of fact without ruling on an objection to one portion of the PSR. Upon review of the record, we conclude that the district judge\u2019s statement adopting the PSR satisfied his obligation under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. <em>Cf. United States v. Prince, </em>110 F.3d 921, 924 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cA district court satisfies its obligation to make \u2018findings sufficient to permit appellate review ... if the court indicates, either at the sentencing hearing or in the written judgment, that it is adopting the recommendations in the [presentence report (\u201c]PSR [\u201d) ].\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>76 F.3d 442, 456 (2d Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">B. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">\u201cReasonableness review does not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge. Rather, the standard is akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006). Having considered the recommended Guidelines sentence, the other factors laid out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and Harris\u2019s arguments on appeal, we see no good reason to believe that Harris\u2019s sentence \u2014 which was more than twice the recommended Guidelines sentence \u2014 was actually unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">C. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">We have considered Harris\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
