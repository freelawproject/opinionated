On appeal, Mobley argues that: (1) his sentence was unreasonable because it was more than twice the maximum guidelines range of 13 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the district court failed to consider that he stipulated to the violations or that he presented certain mitigating evidence at sentencing; and (2) the violations did not require mandatory revocation of supervised release and he partially completed the conditions of supervised release. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-19\">We review the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir. 2006). \u201c[Reasonableness\u201d review \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-20\">The district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a sentence of imprisonment for the violation after considering factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), and (a)(4)-(7),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> if it \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Upon such a finding, the district court may \u201crequire the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines provides guidance on the length of a sentence to be imposed after revocation of supervised release. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[T]he policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>statements of Chapter [Seven] are merely advisory and not binding,\u201d but \u201cthe district court is required to consider the policy statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen exceeding the recommended range, the court must normally indicate that it considered the Chapter [Seven] policy statements.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cThe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.... \u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Mobley has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable. As for procedural reasonableness, the record shows that the district court considered the U.S.S.G. Chapter Seven policy statements and guidelines range, the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a), and the parties\u2019 arguments in determining the sentence, specifically finding that the mitigating evidence Mobley proffered carried marginal value. While the district court did not consider specifically each \u00a7 3553(a) factor in determining the sentence, it is not required to do so. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Because a lengthy discussion is not required to establish procedural reasonableness, and as here, the district court \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority,\u201d Mobley\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">As for substantive reasonableness, the district court found that Mobley had an extensive criminal history with previous probation violations, intentionally disobeyed the instructions of the probation officer (specifically advising the probation officer that he would not follow his instructions), and committed multiple violations of the conditions of his supervised release. Moreover, Mobley\u2019s mitigating evidence did not show that Mobley acted unintentionally in violating the conditions of his supervised release or that he likely would submit to the court\u2019s authority in the future. And although Mobley did not commit a criminal offense in violating the conditions of his supervised release, stipulated to the violations, and partially complied with the terms of his release, he nevertheless deliberately committed multiple violations and rebuked the district court\u2019s prior instructions to submit to the authority of the law. On this record, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the intentional nature of Mobley\u2019s violations, coupled with his history of violating probation and the multitude of his violations, justified a harsher sentence \u2014 more than twice the guidelines range \u2014 in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, namely the nature and circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>the violations, Mobley\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need to deter future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583(e); <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597 (holding that a major variance \u201cshould be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-17\">. These factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (3) the need to protect the public; (4) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (5) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (6) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (7) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (8) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), and (a)(4)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
