The Appellants were convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit identity theft, wire fraud, fake entries and false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000), thirteen counts of wire fraud and aiding and abetting such fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1343, 2 (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2008), eleven counts of false statements on HUD forms, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1001, 2 (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2008), one count of conspiracy to commit money laun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>dering, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1956(h) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008), and five counts of money laundering and aiding and abetting such conduct, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i), 2 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008). The Woods\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there were no meritorious issues for appeal, but suggesting the court review the sufficiency of the evidence. The Woods have filed a pro se supplemental brief. The Government declined to file a brief. Finding no meritorious issues, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The Woods were convicted after a four-day jury trial during which the Government established that the Woods, as approved mortgage lenders for the Government National Mortgage Association (\u201cGinnie Mae\u201d) submitted fraudulent mortgage documents using the names, signatures and social security numbers of friends and relatives for their own enrichment. The evidence further established the Woods laundered some of the funds they received in order to conceal their scheme. In addition, the Woods filed other fraudulent documents with the Government in order to become approved lenders and to conceal their fraudulent conduct. We have reviewed the record and find the evidence was sufficient. We have also considered the issues raised in the Woods\u2019 pro se supplemental brief and find the arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the Woods\u2019 convictions and sentences. We also deny the Woods\u2019 pending pro se motions to submit the cases on their informal brief, to relieve their retained appellate counsel, to expedite review, to reconsider their motion for release pending the appeal, and for a new trial based on a deficient record on appeal. This court requires counsel inform their clients, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If either requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the Appellants. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
