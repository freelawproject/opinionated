He now appeals, questioning the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) in the wake of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Because Nava-Vega did not raise the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Section 1326(a) provides a two-year maximum term of imprisonment for any alien who illegally returns to the United States after having been deported. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). If the removal was subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony, the statutory maximum increases to twenty years. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2). In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-36, 243-44, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a sentencing factor rather than a separate criminal offense. We have expressly determined that the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi </em>and remains the law. <em>United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216, 220 (4th Cir.2002). We therefore conclude that Nava-Vega\u2019s claim is without merit and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
