For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-21\">We previously set forth the factual background of this appeal when we affirmed the judgment of conviction on Wood\u2019s direct appeal. <em>See U.S. v. Shaheed Wood, </em>486 F.3d 781 (3d Cir.2007). Although we affirmed the conviction, we reversed the upward adjustment the court had imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2, and we remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether Wood\u2019s juvenile adjudications resulted in \u201ca juvenile sentence to confinement of at least 60 days,\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-22\">Wood now challenges the sentence imposed on remand arguing that the privileges and opportunities he was afforded while confined at the juvenile facilities he was sentenced to were such that he did not serve a \u201cjuvenile confinement\u201d under the sentencing guidelines. However, despite the fact that Woods was afforded such liberties as home visits and participation in educational programs, we do not accept his contention that his juvenile sentences fall short of the level of restriction required for \u201cconfinement\u201d under the Guidelines. The rehabilitative nature of his stay at those juvenile institutions does not negate the reality that he was nevertheless sentenced to \u201cconfinement\u201d for a period in excess of sixty (60) days and that those sentences constitute \u201cjuvenile confine-</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ment\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. 4A1.2(d)(2)(A). <em>United States v. Davis, </em>929 F.2d 930 (3d Cir.1991), <em>See </em>also <em>United States v. Williams, </em>291 F.3d 1180, 1194 (9th Cir. 2002) (collecting cases). Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
