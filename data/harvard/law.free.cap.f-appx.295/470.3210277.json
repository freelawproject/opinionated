We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">In the aftermath of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for \u201creasonableness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 262, 125 S.Ct. 738, \u201ca deferential standard limited to identifying abuse of discretion regardless of whether a challenged sentence is \u2018inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d 163, 170 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States,</em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Our review proceeds in two steps: first we \u201cascertain whether the sentence was administered without procedural error,\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>524 F.3d 209, 214 (2d Cir.2008); and second, if the sentence is \u201cprocedurally sound,\u201d we must \u201cconsider [its] substantive reasonableness,\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>128 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>597, by evaluating \u201cwhether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported\u201d the sentence imposed, <em>id. </em>at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">On this appeal, Rivera-Contreras argues that the district court committed procedural error in failing (1) to state its reasons for imposing the challenged sentence as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c); (2) to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and (3) to note the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines. Because Rivera-Contreras failed to raise these objections before the district court, we review his claims only for \u201cplain error,\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>see United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d 204, 208 (2d Cir. 2007), which we do not find in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">1. <em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Although 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) requires a district court to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence,\u201d the statement need not be \u201clengthy ... particularly where the parties have not argued meaningfully against a Guidelines sentence under \u00a7 3553(a) or for a departure.\u201d <em>United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d at 210. In any event, failure to satisfy \u00a7 3553(c) \u201cdoes not constitute plain error if the district court relies on the PSR, and the factual findings in the PSR are adequate to support the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Espinoza, </em>514 F.3d 209, 212 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Here, as in <em>Espinoza, </em>Rivera-Contreras had the opportunity to review the PSR before his sentencing and was put on notice of the District Court\u2019s reliance on the PSR. The district court\u2019s statement \u2014 \u201cSo I will adopt the recommendation of 57 months.... \u201d \u2014 can, in context, only be understood to convey reliance on the facts and calculations in the PSR. Sentencing Tr. at 7. Rivera-Contreras did not challenge the facts or the Guidelines calculation set forth in the PSR before the district court and he does not argue on appeal that the facts in the PSR fail to provide \u00a7 3553(a) support for the challenged sentence. Further, Rivera-Contreras did not argue in the district court for a non-Guidelines sentence. Rather, he urged a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines. In this context, while the district court might well have said more to explain its sentence, we identify no plain \u00a7 3553(a) error in its implicit reliance on an unchallenged PSR. <em>See United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d at 209 (emphasizing that reversal for plain error should be used sparingly and only to avoid miscarriage of justice).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">2. <em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) Factors; Advisory Guidelines</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Rivera-Contreras argues that the district court also committed procedural error in failing to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and to note specifically that the Guidelines were only advisory. Neither point merits lengthy discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">\u201c[W]e presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors,\u201d <em>United States v. Legros, </em>529 F.3d 470, 478 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted), and considered the advisory nature of the Guidelines, <em>see United States v. Espinoza, </em>514 F.3d at 213. \u201cIn other words, no \u2018robotic incantations\u2019 are required to prove the fact of consideration, and we will not conclude that a district judge shirked her obligation\u201d simply because the judge did not individually consider each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d at 212 (\u201cWhile the district court did not recite its thoughts on each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>it is clear that we impose no such general requirement.\u201d), or expressly state that the Guidelines are advisory, <em>see United States v. Villafuerte, </em>502 F.3d at 210. This presumption will end our inquiry where, as here, defendant advanced no \u00a7 3553(a) arguments for the district court to consider, the district court relied on an unchallenged PSR that identified facts relevant to \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, and the record demonstrates the district court\u2019s awareness of the advisory nature of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In sum, because defendant has failed to demonstrate procedural error in sentencing, and does not contend that his sentence is substantively unreasonable, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
