For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Hurt was released on parole in connection with a sentence for carrying a firearm without a license. A condition of that parole was that he refrain from using, possessing, or selling controlled substances. During a meeting with his parole officer, however, he revealed that he had purchased Xanax \u201coff the streets\u201d without a prescription and consumed it. The officer administered a urine test, the results of which were positive for benzodiazepine (an ingredient of Xanax). Based on these results and other considerations that aroused suspicion of drug activity \u2014 for instance, Hurt\u2019s apparently significant wealth despite the lack of any verified employment \u2014 the parole department decided to search Hurt\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-14\">When parole officers and law enforcement personnel executed the search, Hurt pointed a gun at one of them and initially disobeyed an order to put the gun down. A search of the apartment ultimately revealed crack cocaine, a digital scale, a pot and large silver utensils with cocaine-base residue on them, and similar items. A jury convicted Hurt of the crimes noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-15\">After enhancing Hurt\u2019s offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) for creating a \u201csubstantial risk of serious bodily injury\u201d to a law enforcement officer, the District Court imposed a below-Guidelines sentence of 300 months\u2019 imprisonment. Hurt appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">He argues that the officers\u2019 search of his apartment violated the Fourth Amendment. We disagree. Because Hurt was on parole, the officers needed only \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that they would find evidence of a parole violation in Hurt\u2019s apartment. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>221 F.3d 438, 443-44 (3d Cir.2000). Given, among other considerations, the positive drug test and the parole officer\u2019s knowledge that drug users typically store their drugs at home, the officers met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">Hurt also argues that, because he did not intend to cause bodily injury and thus did not commit aggravated assault, the District Court should not have applied the \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) enhancement for creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury to a law enforcement officer. He bases this argument on commentary to the enhancement Guideline that \u201c[s]ubsection (c) applies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault.\u201d \u00a7 3A1.2(c) application note 4(A). But \u201c \u2018tantamount\u2019 does not mean \u2018identical\u2019\u201d; it is sufficient that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Hurt\u2019s conduct clearly presented the necessary risk of harm and that he had \u201cample reason to know that fear will be caused.\u201d <em>United States v. Lee, </em>199 F.3d 16,18-19 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Nor do we agree that the District Court engaged in impermissible double-counting when it applied the enhancement despite also sentencing Hurt for possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime. \u201c[0]nly when the Guidelines explicitly prohibit double counting will it be impermissible to raise a defendant\u2019s offense level under one provision when another offense Guideline already takes into account the same conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Fisher, </em>502 F.3d 293, 309 (3d Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Wong, </em>3 F.3d 667, 671 (3d Cir. 1993)). Hurt points to no explicit prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Hurt\u2019s final two arguments do not persuade us. First, viewing the record as a whole, we are satisfied that at sentencing the District Court adequately considered the pertinent 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and reasonably applied them to Hurt\u2019s case to arrive at its below-Guidelines sentence. Second, the District Court did not commit a gross abuse of discretion in permitting the Government to admit proof of the interstate commerce element of the felon-in-possession count. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>513 F.3d 62, 84 (3d Cir.2008) (district court\u2019s decision regarding order of proof is not reversible absent \u201c \u2018gross abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>United States v. Chrzanowski, </em>502 F.2d 573, 576 (3d Cir.1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-12\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
