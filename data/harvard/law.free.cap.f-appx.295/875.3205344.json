Faris and Carolyn M. Faris appeal pro se from the tax court\u2019s decision, entered after a bench trial, permitting the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to proceed with an action to collect their federal income tax liabilities for 1997 and 1998. We have jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). We review de novo the tax court\u2019s legal conclusions and for clear error its findings of fact. <em>Charlotte\u2019s Office Boutique v. Comm\u2019r, </em>425 F.3d 1203, 1211 (9th Cir.2005). We review for an abuse of discretion the tax court\u2019s imposition of sanctions under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673. <em>Wolf v. Comm\u2019r, 4 </em>F.3d 709, 716 (9th Cir.1993). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The tax court did not err in concluding that petitioners were precluded from challenging the tax liabilities for 1997 and 1998 because they had notice of the deficiencies but failed to petition the tax court for a deficiency hearing. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) (permitting challenge to the underlying tax liability if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that they were improperly denied a face-to-face collection due process (\u201cCDP\u201d) hearing is unavailing. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-l(d)(2)(A-D6) (\u201cA CDP hearing may, but is not required to, consist of a face-to-face meeting\u201d). Other than raising frivolous arguments, petitioners\u2019 request for a CDP hearing challenged the propriety of Internal Revenue Service administrative procedures, but these procedures were verified by the Forms 4340 sent to petitioners. <em>See Huff v. United States, </em>10 F.3d 1440, 1445-46 (9th Cir.1993) (concluding that Form 4340 provides presumptive evidence that a tax has been validly assessed); <em>see </em>cist) 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-l(d)(2)(A-D7) (offering the opportunity for a face-to-face conference to those taxpayers who present in their CDP hearing request relevant, non-frivolous arguments).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">The tax court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a $2,500 sanction on petitioners for continuing to advance frivolous arguments after they were repeatedly warned that the arguments were frivolous. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a) (providing for sanctions up to $25,000 where \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s position in such proceeding is frivolous or groundless\u201d); <em>Grimes v. Comm\u2019r, </em>806 F.2d 1451, 1454 (9th Cir.1986) (per curiam) (imposing sanctions against pro se litigant for advancing groundless arguments).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-11\">We deny respondent\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b902-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
