He claims that the district court misapplied California\u2019s issue preclusion law or, alternatively, improperly failed to apply an equitable exception to California\u2019s issue preclusion law.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">In a prior action in California state court, pursuant to CaLPenal Code \u00a7 1405 Moore petitioned for access to the same DNA evidence at issue in this suit. The California court denied Moore\u2019s petition, stating that it did \u201cnot raise a reasonable probability that, in light of all of the evidence, [Moore\u2019s] verdict or sentence would have been more favorable\u201d had the DNA test results been available at the time of his trial. <em>In re Kenneth Moore, </em>No. 67113B (Cal.Super.Ct. Dec. 10, 2002). The district court concluded that Moore in his \u00a7 1983 suit had to show at least a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019\u201d that access to the DNA evidence would have affected the outcome of his original criminal proceedings. <em>Moore v. Lockyer, </em>2005 WL 2334350, at *9 (N.D.Cal. Sept.23, 2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985)). Because the state court had already determined that Moore could not meet that standard, the district court held that California\u2019s issue preclusion law barred Moore\u2019s federal claim and dismissed the suit. <em>See id. </em>at 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">For California issue preclusion law to bar Moore\u2019s federal claim, \u201cthe decision in the [state court] proceeding must be final and on the merits.\u201d <em>Lucido v. Superior Court, </em>51 Cal.3d 335, 272 Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223, 1225 (1990). California issue preclusion law also requires that the \u201cissue sought to be precluded from relitigation\u201d be \u201cidentical to that decided in a former proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moore petitioned the state court for access to the DNA evidence in order to challenge his conviction for the rape of Linda S. Moore argues that the order denying his petition did not address this narrow issue but rather the broader question of whether access to the DNA evidence would have affected his <em>overall </em>sentence, which was based on convictions for multiple crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">However, the state court order stated clearly that Moore\u2019s petition did not raise a reasonable probability that his \u201cverdict or sentence\u201d would have been more favorable had the DNA test results been available. <em>See In re Kenneth Moore, </em>No. 67113B (Cal.Super.Ct. Dec. 10, 2002). Because \u201cverdict\u201d is singular, we conclude that the state court was referring only to Moore\u2019s verdict and sentence with respect to the rape of Linda S. The order does go on to say that the \u201cevidence of [Moore\u2019s] guilt of the <em>crimes </em>\u201d he committed is \u201coverwhelming.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). But \u201ccrimes\u201d does not imply that the court was concerned with whether access to the DNA evidence would lower Moore\u2019s overall sentence. Rather, the court used the term \u201ccrimes\u201d to develop the argument that the rape of Linda S. was \u201cstrikingly similar\u201d to other offenses for which Moore was convicted, meaning that he likely would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>been convicted of the rape even if DNA evidence had been available at trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We therefore conclude that the state court order addressed the merits of Moore\u2019s petition and decided the identical question subsequently raised in district court. Therefore, we reject Moore\u2019s claim that the district court misapplied California\u2019s issue preclusion law.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We also reject Moore\u2019s claim that the district court failed to apply an equitable exception to California\u2019s issue preclusion law. Moore\u2019s \u201cequity\u201d claim amounts to an allegation that the state court made a mistake. One California case suggests such claims are colorable, <em>see Greenfield v. Mather, </em>32 Cal.2d 23, 35, 194 P.2d 1 (1948), but it has since been deemed of \u201cdoubtful validity\u201d and \u201cseverely criticized.\u201d <em>Slater v. Blackwood, </em>15 Cal.3d 791, 796, 126 Cal.Rptr. 225, 543 P.2d 593 (1975). Issue preclusion aims to \u201cpromote judicial economy by minimizing repetitive litigation.\u201d <em>People v. Taylor, </em>12 Cal.3d 686, 695, 117 Cal.Rptr. 70, 527 P.2d 622 (1974). We do not believe a California court would make an equitable exception to issue preclusion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
