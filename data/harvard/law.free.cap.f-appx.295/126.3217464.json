We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Manatt v. Bank of Am., </em>339 F.3d 792, 796 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Green\u2019s hostile work environment claim because the alleged conduct was neither severe nor pervasive enough to alter the conditions of Green\u2019s employment. <em>See id. </em>at 799 (affirming summary judgment for employer on Title VII claim of racial hostile work environment); <em>Brooks v. City of San Mateo, </em>229 F.3d 917, 923 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cIn order to prevail on her hostile work environment claim, [a plaintiff] must show that her workplace was permeated with discriminatory intimidation that was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of her employment\u201d) (brackets, ellipses, and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Green\u2019s retaliation and disparate treatment claims because even if Green established a prima facie case, he failed to raise a triable issue as to whether the College\u2019s nondiscriminatory reasons for discontinuing his tai chi classes were pretextual. <em>See Aragon v. Republic Silver State Disposal, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 654, 664 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that a plaintiff had not \u201cpresented the substantial and specific evidence required to demonstrate that [his employer\u2019s] reasons for [his] lay off were a pretext for racial discrimination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">Green\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b153-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ed by 9 th Cir.
