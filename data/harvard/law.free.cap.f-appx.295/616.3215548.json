The district court denied Dedrick\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because he had not shown that his claims satisfied the requirements of the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 savings clause. Dedrick argues that the district court should have construed his \u00a7 2241 petition as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and transferred it to this court as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Dedrick also argues that the indictment was \u201cbogus\u201d; he was never in possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>of the cocaine base; and he is actually innocent of the enhanced sentence because he did not receive notice concerning the career criminal enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In order to satisfy the criteria of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, Dedrick must show that his claims are based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and that the claims were foreclosed by circuit law at the time when they should have been raised at trial, on appeal, or in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001). Dedrick has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dedrick\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED. To the extent that Dedrick seeks authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion raising the above claims, the motion is DENIED. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(2), 2255(h).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
