LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Christopher Pierce, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, requests review of the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We construe this request as an application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), but we lack jurisdiction over Pierce\u2019s application because it was untimely filed. Because the district court denied Pierce a COA, he may not appeal the district court\u2019s decision absent a grant of COA by this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A COA may be issued \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This requires Pierce to show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). We deny Pierce\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Pierce was convicted in New Mexico state court of one count of first degree murder, three counts of criminal sexual penetration in the first degree, one count of criminal sexual contact in the third degree, and sixteen counts of child abuse. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder conviction, plus a consecutive eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment on the sexual penetration convictions, and various concurrent terms of imprisonment on the remaining counts. Pierce\u2019s child abuse convictions and sentences were vacated on direct appeal. Following his state collateral appeal, Pierce filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, raising nineteen claims. Adopting a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court denied his application in an order entered on November 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-15\">After receiving the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief, Pierce stated under penalty of perjury that he submitted a notice of appeal from that decision to a court \u201cin Washington.\u201d Attachments to his affidavit suggest that he in fact sent his notice to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on or around December 16, 2007. Pierce also submitted the affidavit of a prison employee who states that he delivered this notice to the prison mail room on December 14, 2007. Pierce asserts in his affidavit that this submission was sent back to him with the notation \u201cReturn to Sender.\u201d There is no evidence that the Federal Circuit attempted to transfer the notice of appeal to the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, where Pierce\u2019s notice of appeal should have been filed. Upon receiving the returned notice, Pierce resubmitted his notice of appeal to the district court, putting it into the prison mail sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tem on December 28, 2007. The district court received this notice of appeal on January 8, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">This court has no jurisdiction over the merits of Pierce\u2019s claim unless his notice of appeal was timely filed. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007); <em>Alva v. Teen Help, </em>469 F.3d 946, 948 (10th Cir.2006). Notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days from the entry of the judgment or order appealed, subject to the provisions of the so-called \u201cprison mailbox rule.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (30-day time limit); 4(c) (exception for prisoners who deposit the notice of appeal into an institutional mail system within the filing period). In this case, Pierce\u2019s notice of appeal was due on December 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">When a notice of appeal is filed in the wrong circuit, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 allows transfer to a court with jurisdiction if a transfer is \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. Section 1631 further provides that upon such transfer, the appeal will be deemed filed on the date initially filed with the incorrect court. <em>Id. </em>But this provision cannot save Pierce\u2019s appeal, because the record does not indicate that his first notice was ever filed in the Federal Circuit at all. <em>See Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8-9, 121 S.Ct. 361, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000) (defining \u201cfiling\u201d to include both delivery of a legal document and acceptance of that document by court officials). Because the Federal Circuit simply returned Pierce\u2019s documents to him, it appears that no notice of appeal was ever filed in that court, much less transferred to the District of New Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Thus, we may consider only Pierce\u2019s second notice of appeal, which can be deemed filed in the district court no earlier than the date that Pierce submitted it to the proper address through the prison mail system. Fed. R.App. P. 4(c). He deposited this notice in the mail on December 28, 2007 \u2014 more than 30 days after the district court\u2019s order. Even if Pierce were to receive the benefit of the prison mailbox rule, this notice of appeal would still be untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Accordingly, Pierce\u2019s application for COA is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Appellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
