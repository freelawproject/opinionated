We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude that the decision to deny a continuance was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (2008); <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1998). We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-25\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
