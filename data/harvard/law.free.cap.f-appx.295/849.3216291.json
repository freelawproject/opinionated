He admitted in a written plea agreement to distributing approximately 100 kilograms of cocaine. This, plus Sleepers\u2019s prior convictions (covered by an information under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851), set the statutory minimum penalty at 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was the sentence the district court imposed. After the Sentencing Commission lowered the offense level for crack cocaine and made the change retroactive, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); Amendment 706, Sleepers asked the district court to reduce his sentence. The judge declined, and Sleepers has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-22\">All that need be said to resolve this appeal is that Sleepers\u2019s sentence is already the lowest permitted by law. It therefore makes no difference how much of the 100 kilograms was crack and how much was cocaine hydrochloride, or what changes the Commission has made to the Guidelines. Nothing the Commission has done could authorize (or purports to authorize) a district judge to disregard a statutory minimum penalty. See <em>Neal v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 284, 116 S.Ct. 763, 133 L.Ed.2d 709 (1996). (Sleepers believes that his 240-month sentence is unlawful because the \u00a7 251 information was untimely, but he has already filed and lost a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>collateral attack. The requirements of a successive collateral attack have not been satisfied, so application of the statutory minimum is no longer open to question. See <em>Godoski v. United States, </em>304 F.3d 761, 763 (7th Cir.2002).)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
