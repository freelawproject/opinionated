We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1050 (9th Cir.2001), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-21\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Mejia\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See id. </em>Mejia failed to establish past persecution because the threats from his ex-wife were not on account of a protected ground. <em>See id. </em>at 1051-52. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Mejia failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution because any problems he might encounter with his ex-wife\u2019s siblings would be personal retribution and not persecution, <em>see id., </em>there is no objective evidence that Mejia will be targeted by his nephew\u2019s unknown kidnapers, <em>see Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003), and there is no evidence that the unknown people who killed Mejia\u2019s father for unknown reasons have imputed any political opinion to Mejia, <em>see INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Therefore, Mejia\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-22\">Because Mejia has not \u201cspecifically and distinctly argued and raised\u201d in his opening brief any challenge to the denial of withholding of removal or CAT protection, he has waived these claims. <em>See Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b185-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
