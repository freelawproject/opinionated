We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>substantial evidence, <em>Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1151 (9th Cir.2005), and we grant petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s determination that the Mongolian government is willing or able to protect Ochir from persecution because Ochir\u2019s credible testimony and asylum application statement established that he was attacked in jail because of his political opinion and that the government ignored his reports of the attack. <em>See Kalubi v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1134, 1137 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cTestimony must be accepted as true in the absence of an explicit adverse credibility finding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Because this finding was the BIA\u2019s basis for denying relief, we grant the petition for review and remand Ochir\u2019s asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT claims to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">We deny Ochir\u2019s request to hold proceedings in abeyance pending the adjudication of the 1-130 petition filed on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b253-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
