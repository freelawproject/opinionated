We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Becke </em>(B.I.A. Nov. 13, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
