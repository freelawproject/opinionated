The district court granted a certificate of appealability on two issues: (1) whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the way that the trial court handled the State\u2019s challenge under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and (2) whether counsel on direct appeal was ineffective for failing to argue that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Following our careful review of the record, the briefs, and the applicable law, we conclude the district court properly denied Long\u2019s petition, for the reasons cited in the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough report, adopted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. Long\u2019s pro se motion is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-7\">. The Honorable J.
