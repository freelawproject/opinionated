Further, to the extent that Guo claims that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte authority to reopen or reconsider, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See Lenis v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2008) (collecting cases). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\"> We find that only the Board\u2019s denial of Guo's \"motion for reinstatement\u201d is properly before this court as he failed to petition this court for review of the Board's previous orders. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000) (setting forth thirty-day appeal period); <em>Stone v.
