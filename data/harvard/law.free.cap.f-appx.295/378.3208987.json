WINTER, Hon. GUIDO CALABRESI, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b405-13\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b405-14\">The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Chatigny, <em>J.) </em>granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss George Cuartero\u2019s action and to affirm the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (\u201cIRS\u201d) determination denying George Cuartero\u2019s request for the removal of a tax lien. The District Court also denied Cuartero\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The IRS alleges that Cuartero has repeatedly filed frivolous tax returns. Cuartero, acting <em>pro se, </em>challenges the legality of the federal taxation system and argues that as a \u201cnonresident alien\u201d he is not liable for any tax payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">Cuartero\u2019s tax protestor theories have been specifically, repeatedly, and emphatically rejected by courts, and the IRS has issued a publication warning taxpayers against making them. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cooper, </em>170 F.3d 691, 691 (7th Cir.1999) (\u201cnonresident alien\u201d argument has been rejected so often that it is \u201cno longer merely frivolous,\u201d but \u201cfrivolous squared\u201d); <em>Connor v. Comm\u2019r, </em>770 F.2d 17, 20 (2d Cir.1985) (argument that wages are not income \u201chas been rejected so frequently that the very raising of it justifies the imposition of sanctions\u201d); <em>see also </em>Internal Revenue Service, <em>The Truth About Frivolous Tax Arguments </em>(2007), <em>available at </em>http:/Avww.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/friv_ tax.pdf (describing frivolous arguments and warning taxpayers about the consequences of making them). We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Cuartero\u2019s action and affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Cuartero\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-16\">The Government has also moved, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, for an order imposing sanctions of $8,000 against Cuartero for maintaining a frivolous appeal, saying that such sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>are necessary to deter him and to defray the attorney and other costs associated with defending against his frivolous appeal. We agree that Cuartero\u2019s arguments are so patently frivolous that his very making them is sanctionable. <em>See Schiff v. United States, </em>919 F.2d 830, 832-35 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court and GRANT the request for sanctions in the amount of $8,000. Cuartero is ORDERED to comply with the sanction within 20 days by sending to counsel for the Government a check, payable to the United States Treasury, in the amount of $8,000; failure to comply with this order will expose Cuartero to the risk of civil and/or criminal contempt.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
