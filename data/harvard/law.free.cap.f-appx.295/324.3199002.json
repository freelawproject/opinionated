U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc)). \u201c[W]e review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). The agency\u2019s factual findings are conclusive \u201cunless the record demonstrates that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir. 2002) (internal quotations and citation omitted). We review legal determinations <em>de novo. Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-18\">To qualify for asylum or withholding of removal, Gomez must establish that he has a well-founded fear that, if removed to his home country, he will be persecuted \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1)(A), 1231(b)(3)(A). Gomez argues that, if he returns to Honduras, he will face persecution because of his membership in the \u201cparticular social group\u201d comprised of \u201cHonduran schoolboys who conscientiously refuse to join gangs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>To qualify as a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 <em>et seq., </em>a group must be defined by a \u201cshared characteristic ... that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1193, 1196 (11th Cir. 2006) (citing <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 233 (BIA 1985), <em>overruled, on other grounds by Matter of Mogharrabi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439, 447 (BIA 1987)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have also held that the group must have sufficient \u201csocial visibility,\u201d and that the \u201cparticular social group\u201d persecution basis should not be defined so broadly that it becomes \u201ca catch-all for all groups who might claim persecution.\u201d <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>446 F.3d at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In <em>Castillo-Arias, </em>we held that noncriminal informants working against a Columbian drug cartel were not a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the INA. <em>Id. </em>at 1196-98. We reasoned, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) noncriminal informants opposing drug cartels lacked the requisite social visibility, (2) the group was too numerous and inchoate, and (3) even if the group\u2019s members became recognizable after their activities were disclosed to the cartel, \u201ctheir defining attribute is their persecution by the cartel,\u201d and thus recognizing them as members of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d would render that definition a \u201ccatch all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1197-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Applying this definition of \u201cparticular social group,\u201d we conclude that Gomez cannot show that his group qualifies. Honduran schoolboys who refuse to join gangs are not a socially visible group, and are, additionally, too numerous and inchoate. <em>See Matter of S-E-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579, 582-83 (BIA 2008) (stating that Salvadoran youths who reject or resist membership in MS-13 are neither socially visible nor part of a group with \u201cparticular and well-defined boundaries\u201d); <em>Matter of E-A-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 591, 594-95 (BIA 2007) (\u201cPersons who resist joining gangs have not been shown to be part of a socially visible group within Honduran society.\u201d). Moreover, Gomez\u2019s purported group is so broad and persecution-defined that recognizing it under the INA would permit the \u201cparticular social group\u201d persecution basis to become a \u201ccatch all\u201d ground for all persons alleging persecution in Honduras who cannot establish refugee status under any of the other recognized grounds. Accordingly, we agree with the BIA\u2019s determination that \u201cHonduran schoolboys who conscientiously refuse to join gangs\u201d does not constitute a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d and conclude it was a permissible construction of the controlling statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Gomez next argues that substantial evidence does not support the BIA\u2019s determination that he was not persecuted on account of his political opinion. We agree with the government that the record evidence in this case is not so overwhelming that a reasonable fact finder would be compelled to conclude that Gomez was persecuted on account of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The record demonstrates that the MS-13 were trying to recruit Gomez, and his encounters with the MS-13 were due to his refusal to join the gang. Moreover, there is no record evidence demonstrating that Gomez was politically active against gangs or that he possessed a political opinion or had one imputed to him by the MS-13 gang members. Thus, because the record contains substantial evidence to support the BIA\u2019s determination, the petition for review is due to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Finally, Gomez argues that he is entitled to CAT relief because it is more likely than not, based on the threats and assaults he had already experienced by the MS-13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>that he will be subjected to severe pain or suffering if he is returned to Honduras.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">We conclude from the record that the BIA correctly denied CAT relief. First, the physical violence Gomez suffered does not meet the definition of torture. Second, although Gomez\u2019s testimony was credible that the police did nothing, the record evidence demonstrates that the Honduran government has taken steps to address gang violence. Because the record evidence does not compel the finding that the Honduran government acquiesced in the arguably mental torture Gomez experienced, Gomez cannot establish his entitlement to CAT relief. Accordingly, we deny Gomez\u2019s petition for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
