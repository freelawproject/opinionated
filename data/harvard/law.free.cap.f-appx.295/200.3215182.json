Pursuant to the REAL ID Act of 2005, we construe Raju\u2019s transferred habeas petition as a petition for review, and we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 928-29 (9th Cir.2005). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, and review for substantial evidence the factual findings regarding counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Lin v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 1014, 1023-24 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-20\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Raju did not establish ineffective assistance by his former counsel because Raju failed to challenge meaningfully his former counsel\u2019s declaration in which former counsel alleged that she made diligent efforts to contact Raju and his criminal defense counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 1023 (petitioner must establish that counsel\u2019s performance prevented him from reasonably presenting his case). Because Raju did not establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the BIA did not abuse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>discretion by denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b227-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
