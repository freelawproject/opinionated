May 22, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision pro-vides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Camara\u2019s motion to reconsider. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2), an individual \u201cmay file only one motion to reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider.\u201d In its May 2007 decision, the BIA properly construed Camara\u2019s and Kante\u2019s appeal as a second motion to reconsider, and denied it as number-barred. <em>See Jie Chen v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 76, 78 n. 5 (2d Cir.2006). Camara asserts that the BIA should have granted her second motion to reconsider, notwithstanding this limitation, because her previous counsel had rendered ineffective assistance. However, there are no exceptions to the numerical limitations for motions to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">Camara argues that the ineffective assistance of counsel can toll the time limits for motions to reopen, but hers was a motion to reconsider. Thus, even if the BIA had considered the substance of the motion, it would have been properly denied as simply recasting arguments that the BIA had previously rejected. <em>See Jin Ming Liu, </em>439 F.3d at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
