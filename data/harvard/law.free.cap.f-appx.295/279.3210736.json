HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Petitioner Ikenna G. Nkwonta, a native and citizen of Nigeria who is proceeding in this appeal pro se, petitions for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) decision denying his applications for asylum and restriction on removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We deny the petition for review and affirm the denial of Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s applications for asylum and restriction on removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">I. Standards for Asylum and Restriction on Removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">We recently summarized the standards that must be met before a court can grant asylum or restriction on removal to an illegal alien, such as Mr. Nkwonta,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who is seeking to avoid deportation due to a fear of persecution in their homeland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-15\">First, in order to be eligible for asylum, an alien must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that she is a refugee, meaning that she is outside the country of her nationality and \u201cis unable or unwilling to return to ... that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also Elzour v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 1143, 1148-49 (10th Cir.2004). She can establish refugee status in three ways: (1) by showing a well-founded fear of future persecution; (2) by showing past persecution sufficient to give rise to a presumption that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution; or (3) by showing past persecution so severe that it supports an unwillingness to return to the country where the persecution occurred. <em>Chaib v. Ashcroft, </em>397 F.3d 1273, 1277 (10th Cir.2005). To prove a well-founded fear of [future] persecution, \u201cit need not be shown that the situation will probably result in persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tion, but it is enough that persecution is a reasonable possibility.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 440, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 ... (1987)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-5\">Second, an alien may apply for restriction on removal in order to avoid being returned to the country of persecution. Restriction on removal under the INA prohibits the removal of an alien to a country \u201cif the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Under the statute, the alien must establish \u201ca clear probability of persecution[.]\u201d <em>Elzour, </em>378 F.3d at 1149. Like an asylum claim, once an alien has shown past persecution, there is a \u201cpresumptive entitlement to restriction on removal on the same basis.\u201d <em>[Niang v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 1187, 1195 (10th Cir.2005).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\"><em>Hayrapetyan v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 1330, 1335-36 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We have also recently reiterated the meaning of the term \u201cpersecution\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM8\">Although persecution is not defined in the INA, we have held that a finding of persecution requires the infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ (in race, religion, or political opinion) in a way regarded as offensive and must entail more than just restrictions or threats to life and liberty. Such persecution may be inflicted by the government itself, or by a non-governmental group that the government is unwilling or unable to control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1337 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">II. Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s Persecution Allegations and Proceedings Below.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Mr. Nkwonta claims that he suffered past persecution in Nigeria and has a well-founded fear of future persecution if he is forced to return to Nigeria as a result of his past membership in a student-cult group known as the \u201cBlack Axe Confraternity.\u201d In his brief on appeal, the United States Attorney General has succinctly and accurately summarized Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s allegations regarding his experiences with the Black Axe Confraternity as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\">[In his application for asylum and restriction on removal,] Nkwonta asserted that during his first year at the University of Lagos, he was forced to join a \u201ccult\u201d named the \u201cBlack Axe Confraternity\u201d (\u201cBlack Axe\u201d) against his will. Nkwonta explained that the Black Axe \u201cstarted out like fraternities here in the USA, [but it] became corrupt and evil and [was] used by corrupt politicians ... to rig elections and also [commit] political assassinations.\u201d Nkwonta further postulated that the organization \u201cbullies, maims, and often kills innocent people\u201d without recourse because it is sponsored by corrupt politicians and is uncontrollable by the Nigerian government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">According to Nkwonta\u2019s account, in November 2001, a friend and fellow student, Mohammed Danjuma (\u201cDanjuma\u201d), drove him and two other students to a secluded area following a party. Nkwonta reported that he was forced from the car at gunpoint and fifteen to twenty armed people forcefully conscripted him into the Black Axe by means of a \u201cblood oath\u201d and beatings. Nkwonta indicated that he was a reluctant member of the Black Axe for four months and that he grudgingly paid his dues and attended meetings because \u201cthere was no way I could avoid them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-14\">However, Nkwonta asserted that in April 2002, he was able to renounce his membership in the Black Axe at a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>rally upon the admonition of a \u201cpreacher based [] in the USA.\u201d Nkwonta then recounted that two days after the rally, he was detained by the Lagos University Police and forced to divulge the names of the \u201cBlack Axe members who had forced me to join against my will.\u201d Nkwonta stated that he later learned that Danjuma was arrested and prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">Continuing with his story, Nkwonta reported that following his disassociation with the Black Axe threatening notes were left on his mother\u2019s car and his sister witnessed \u201ca group of men wearing Black Axe colors gathered outside [his] home and fired shots in the air.\u201d Furthermore, Nkwonta asserted that on September 9, 2002, four men \u201cdressed in Black Axe clothing\u201d abducted him, castigated him for being a traitor, beat him, tied him to the back of a car, and dragged him around a deserted soccer field. Nkwonta stated that he was hospitalized for five days and hired police protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">Nkwonta further alleged that his older brother, \u201cwho would pass as my twin,\u201d was stabbed and beaten in October 2002, purportedly because \u201c[the attackers] seemed to think he was me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEB\">Resp. Br. at 9-11 (first alteration added; citations to administrative record and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In February 2006, the IJ held a hearing on Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s applications for asylum and restriction on removal, and Mr. Nkwonta was represented by counsel at the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ told Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s counsel that he had significant doubts about the merits of Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s applications, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">one of the difficulties in the case in my opinion from [Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s] perspective is to show a nexus between his claimed harm and any of the five statutory grounds for asylum. In this regard, I guess he would claim social group, but normally, the social group works when you\u2019re a member of the social group being persecuted.... In addition, except in a few Circuits, voluntary associations of people are not social groups for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Rather, the Board of Immigration Appeals has told us to look for immutable characteristics or common traits that either cannot or shouldn\u2019t, they should not be required to change. So, I don\u2019t see that [Mr. Nkwonta] is having any problems here because of membership in a social group. It\u2019s almost like being a member of a gang, a criminal gang, and then leaving and having problems because your leaving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Agency ROA at 152. In response to the IJ\u2019s statements, Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s counsel stated that Mr. Nkwonta \u201cis a member of a social group. It\u2019s a social group of students who are forced to join a violent fraternity. It\u2019s uncontroverted testimony that he was forced into it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">After hearing further argument from counsel for both sides, the IJ entered an oral decision denying Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s applications for asylum and restriction on removal, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">Even assuming that we accept [Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s] story as true and correct in all respects, the Court believes [he] has failed to state any claim for asylum [or restriction on removal]. In this regard [Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s] difficulties, he says, resulted from his \u2014 essentially\u2014conscription into a violent fraternity and then his difficulties with that organization upon his attempting to leave it. Again, here this in the Court\u2019s view is not a social group situation as we have no immutable characteristics that are involved here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>but rather we have an associational situation even though he says [] he was forced into this. It was a matter of association rather than any type of characteristic with which this particular respondent was born in terms of tribe or clan or other social group where we do have immutable characteristics. Again, the Court does not understand the 10th Circuit to be one that recognizes social group based on associational connections rather than immutable characteristics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">Essentially, again, the Court\u2019s unable to see here that [Mr. Nkwonta] has established a nexus even if we take his story as true between the difficulties he claims to have experienced in Nigeria and one of the five statutory grounds for asylum. The Court believes, therefore, that he has also failed to establish eligibility for [restriction on removal].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 43-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Mr. Nkwonta subsequently appealed to the BIA, and he was represented by the same attorney in the BIA proceedings. The BIA dismissed the appeal, concluding as follows: that he was persecuted by the confraternity on the basis of his membership in a particular social group. However, he has not specified the particular social group in which he has claimed membership. We are unable to conclude that [Mr. Nkwonta] has established that he experienced harm or faces a reasonable risk of harm on account of his membership in a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d as this term has been defined for purposes of determining asylum eligibility. <em>See Matter of A-M-E &amp; J-G-U-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 69 (BIA 2007); <em>Matter of C-A- </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 951 (BIA 2006); <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211 (BIA 1985)....</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">It has not been shown that the Immigration Judge erred in concluding that even assuming credibility, [Mr. Nkwonta] has not established the requisite nexus between any past or prospective harm and a protected ground under the Act. [Mr. Nkwonta] did not identify nor can we find any evidence in the record that would suggest that any harm inflicted on [him] by the Black Axe confraternity was motivated by actual or imputed political opinion. On appeal, [Mr. Nkwonta] also claimed, without any specificity,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">III. BIA\u2019s Streamlining Regulations and Standards of Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">\u201cBecause this petition [for review] follows reasoned opinions from both the IJ and BIA, we will first delineate the scope of our judicial review.\u201d <em>Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 1274, 1278 (10th Cir.2006). As we recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-14\">Until 1999, all appeals to the BIA were decided by three-member panels whose opinions constituted the final decision of the agency. Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Attorney General in 1999 and 2002, the BIA now has three options: decision by a three-member panel with a full explanatory opinion, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6), summary affirmance by a single member of the board without opinion, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), or decision via a brief order by a single member of Board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>affirming, modifying, or remanding the IJ\u2019s decision, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1008.1(e)(5)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">Our scope of review depends upon which of these three forms the BIA decision takes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201cIf the case is more significant than an (e)(4) case and less significant than an (e)(6) case,\u201d <em>[Cruz-Funez v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1187, 1190 (10th Cir. 2005) ], a single BIA member can decide the merits of the appeal and issue \u201ca brief order, affirming, modifying, or remanding\u201d the IJ\u2019s order, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5). Such an order is a \u201cmiddle ground ... between the full opinion and summary affirmance options.\u201d <em>[Uanreroro v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 1197, 1203-04 (10th Cir.2006) ]. In <em>Uanreroro </em>we held that such an order constitutes \u201cthe final order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a),\u201d and thus the Court \u201cwill not affirm on grounds raised in the IJ decision unless they are relied upon by the BIA in its affirmance.\u201d 443 F.3d at 1203-04.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\"><em>Sarr v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 783, 789-90 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">After addressing the merits of Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s applications for asylum and restriction on removal in a three-page decision, a single member of the BIA \u201cdismissed\u201d Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>Agency ROA at 4. This was an erroneous disposition, however, because, while the controlling regulations provide for \u201csummary dismissals\u201d by the BIA in certain limited circumstances, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2), none of those circumstances apply here. In addition, the BIA member\u2019s decision was clearly not a summary affirmance without an opinion under \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), as the member issued a substantive decision addressing the merits of Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s applications. As a result, we will treat the BIA member\u2019s disposition as a \u201cbrief order\u201d under \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5) \u201caffirming\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, and, in accordance with our precedent, we will review that order as the final order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard, and its legal determinations <em>de novo.\u201d Hayrapetyan, </em>534 F.3d at 1335. \u201cUnder the substantial-evidence standard, our duty is to guarantee that [the BIA\u2019s] factual determinations are supported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence considering the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Niang, </em>422 F.3d at 1196 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe BIA\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive unless the record demonstrates that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cIn this circuit, the ultimate determination whether an alien has demonstrated persecution is a question of fact, even if the underlying factual circumstances are not in dispute and the only issue is whether those circumstances qualify as persecution.\u201d <em>Hayrapetyan, </em>534 F.3d at 1335 (quotation omitted). However, \u201c[w]hat constitutes a particular social group is a pure question of law that we review de novo.\u201d <em>CruzFunez, </em>406 F.3d at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">IV. Analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">In the notice of appeal that he submitted to the BIA, Mr. Nkwonta asserted that the IJ erred: (1) \u201cin failing to find that [he] has been persecuted by the Black Axe fraternity ... on the basis of his political opinion and membership in a particular social group because he was forced to join the Black Axe fraternity against his will and take part in the induction ceremonies\u201d; (2) \u201cin failing to find that [he] was persecuted by the Black Axe fraternity by having his life threatened and by being beaten up by Black Axe fraternity members after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>he denounced his membership in the fraternity\u201d; and (3) \u201cin failing to find that [he] has a well-founded fear of future persecution if he returns to Nigeria because the Black Axe Fraternity has already beaten him up.\u201d Agency ROA at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">As noted by the BIA member in his decision, however, in the brief that Mr. Nkwonta submitted to the BIA, his counsel failed to identify any political opinions which were held by or imputed to Mr. Nkwonta that were motivating the conduct of the Black Axe members. <em>Id. </em>at 11-14; <em>see also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (holding that persecution must be on account of the <em>victim\u2019s </em>political opinion or other protected characteristic, not that of the persecutor). Likewise, Mr. Nkwonta has failed to identify any such political opinions in the pro se brief that he submitted to this court. This failure is fatal to any political-opinion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">As further recognized by the BIA member, Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s counsel also made no effort in the BIA proceedings to identify the particular social group in which Mr. Nkwonta was claiming membership. Agency ROA at 11-14. On this point, it was simply not enough for Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s counsel to identify the Black Axe Confraternity and then allege that Mr. Nkwonta had been harmed by members of that group. <em>Id. </em>at 12. First, Mr. Nkwonta has never alleged that he was persecuted <em>because of his membership in the Black Axe Confraternity. </em>To the contrary, his alleged persecution is based on: (1) his forced and violent conscription into the ranks of the Black Axe Confraternity; and (2) the harm he endured after he denounced and left the group. In the proceedings before the BIA, however, Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s counsel failed to articulate a social-group status <em>belonging to Mr. Nkwonta </em>that motivated either of these categories of alleged persecution, and Mr. Nkwonta has duplicated that failure in the pro se brief that he submitted to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Second, even if Mr. Nkwonta were claiming that he was persecuted because of his membership in the Black Axe Confraternity, we can say unequivocally that a criminal gang/cult like the Black Axe Confraternity does not qualify as a \u201csocial group\u201d under the \u201cimmutable characteristic\u201d test that this court has adopted for evaluating social-group persecution claims. <em>See Niang, </em>422 F.3d at 1198-99 (adopting definition of \u201cparticular social group\u201d that BIA formulated in <em>In re Acosta, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 211 (BIA 1985),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which requires a group of persons who all share a common, immutable characteristic, <em>i.e., </em>a characteristic that the members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences). To state the obvious, membership in a criminal gang/cult is not something that a person either cannot change or should not be required to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">Finally, as noted above, at the hearing before the IJ, Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s counsel did attempt to articulate a particular social group, arguing that Mr. Nkwonta belonged to a social group consisting of \u201cstudents who are forced to join a violent fraternity.\u201d Agency ROA at 153. We agree with the Attorney General, however, that this \u201cputative particular social group is overbroad and too indefinite to constitute a \u2018particular\u2019 social group within the meaning of the INA.\u201d Resp. Br. at 31; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>also In re </em>S-E-G-, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579, 582 (BIA 2008) (noting that BIA\u2019s \u201crecent decisions hold[ ] that membership in a purported social group requires that the group have particular and well-defined boundaries\u201d). Further, it is an impermissible circular definition, defining a group in terms of those who suffer persecution. <em>See Rreshpja v. Gonzales, </em>420 F.3d 551, 555-56 (6th Cir.2005) (noting that \u201calmost all of the pertinent decisions have rejected generalized, sweeping [social group] classifications,\u201d and that \u201ca social group may not be circularly defined by the fact that it suffers persecution. The individuals in the group must share a narrowing characteristic other than their risk of being persecuted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In sum, we agree with the Attorney General that, \u201c[b]eeause [Mr.] Nkwonta has never asserted that his initiation [into the Black Axe Confraternity] or his and his family\u2019s subsequent harm was in relation to anything other than the Black Axe\u2019s desire for additional conscripts or in retaliation for his defection, he has not shown that his alleged persecution or fear thereof was on account of a protected ground.\u201d Resp. Br. at 32; (citing <em>Ustyan v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1215, 1217 (10th Cir. 2004) (finding no persecution where petitioner failed to show that his beating, detention in a cell exposed to chlorine gas, and the destruction of his home were on account of his ethnic identity or imputed political beliefs and not simply in retaliation for his resistence to recruitment efforts); <em>Bartesaghi-Lay v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 819, 822-23 (10th Cir.1993) (finding that reprisal for alien\u2019s rejection of solicitation to join drug-smuggling operation was not on account of a protected ground)). Accordingly, the BIA did not commit a legal or factual error in denying Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s applications for asylum and restriction on removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">y. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY the petition for review and AFFIRM the BIA\u2019s denial of Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s applications for asylum and restriction on removal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.

The BIA also made an alternative finding to the effect that Mr. Nkwonta put forth insufficient evidence to show that he \u201cwas persecuted and fears persecution by a group that the government [of Nigeria] is unwilling or unable to control as required for asylum and [restriction on] removal.\u201d Agency ROA at 4. Because we rely on the BIA\u2019s initial determination of unprotected status to affirm the denial of Mr. Nkwonta\u2019s applications for asylum and restriction on removal, we do not need to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">.
