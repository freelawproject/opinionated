As a result of his guilty plea and cooperation with government authorities, Torres received a sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment, a fine, and five years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, Torres argues that, because of his substantial cooperation, the District Court should have imposed a shorter sentence of imprisonment. Finding no merit in that argument, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b577-21\">Because we write only for the parties, we limit our recitation to those facts pertinent to our resolution of Torres\u2019s appeal. In exchange for a share of $25,000, Torres agreed to assist several other individuals in murdering Jose Hernandez and Jorge Martinez, two former members of a drug organization based in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1998, in Puerto Rico, Torres and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>an associate attempted to murder Hernandez, but, instead, they mistakenly killed Ricky Guevara-Velez, a Mend of Hernandez\u2019s. Torres drove the vehicle used during the killing, and his associate fired the fatal shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">After discovering that Hernandez had not been killed, Torres agreed to travel to Philadelphia and to kill Hernandez there. Along with several co-conspirators, Torres spent several days in Philadelphia preparing to carry out the killing. During the course of the conspirators\u2019 preparations, however, the FBI arrested Torres. After Torres was taken into custody, his co-conspirators were unable to locate Hernandez. On July 12, 1998, however, they succeeded in shooting and killing Martinez. Luis Garcia, Martinez\u2019s 17-year-old nephew, was also killed in that shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">After his arrest, and in return for the government\u2019s promise not to seek the death penalty against him, Torres provided substantial information to the government about the other members of the conspiracy. He also told the government about his participation in Velez\u2019s killing. Prior to receiving that information from Torres, the government \u201cknew nothing about\u201d Velez\u2019s murder. (Appellant App. at 89.) Torres also testified truthfully and extensively before a grand jury and during the trials of his co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Because of Torres\u2019s cooperation, the government agreed to move for a downward departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to that agreement, the government recommended a sentence of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment, a substantial reduction from the otherwise applicable mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment. The District Court accepted the government\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">We understand Torres to be raising two distinct challenges to his sentence. First, he argues that, because of his cooperation with the government, the District Court should have granted a greater downward departure from his mandatory minimum sentence. Second, he argues that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to impose a lesser sentence pursuant to the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">We reject the first argument because we have consistently declined to review the extent of a downward departure granted by the District Court. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 332-33 (3d Cir.2006) (explaining that, even post-Boo/c-<em>er, </em>we do not review appeals by defendants challenging the extent of a downward departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">We must also reject Torres\u2019s second argument. The Supreme Court has instructed that, when reviewing the sentence imposed by the District Court, we:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-15\">must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-16\"><em>Gall v. United States</em>,-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>The Court then further explained that \u201c[ajssuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in reviewing the defendant\u2019s sentence, we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justify the extent of the variance. The fact that [we] might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Torres does not point to any procedural errors by the District Court. Rather, the crux of his argument is that, in considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the District Court failed to give sufficient weight to the extent of his cooperation with the government following his arrest. He also points out that he has been a model prisoner since his arrest. Notwithstanding Torres\u2019s post-arrest cooperation and conduct, however, the fact remains that he participated in cold-blooded killings for pecuniary gain. On this record, we cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion, particularly when the Court relied heavily on Torres\u2019s cooperation with the government in deciding to depart from the mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment that Torres otherwise faced.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">For the reasons stated, we will affirm the sentence imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-13\">. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">Upon motion of the Government, the court shall have the authority to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
