Roberson has not shown the district court erred in denying his claims against Dr. Patel.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Roberson did not establish that his April 2005 sick call requests or grievances provided Dr. Patel notice of his complaint of a broken toe. Dr. Patel examined Roberson\u2019s feet in May 2005, and found no swelling, no deformities, some loss of range of motion, no pain or tenderness, no redness or warmth; although Roberson complained of a <em>knot on </em>his toe, there was no indication he \u2014 complained of a <em>broken </em>toe at that appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Roberson first complained of a broken toe to Dr. Patel in an examination on 23 June 2005. At that time, Dr. Patel observed no swelling, no deformity, no redness or warmth, no tenderness, full range of motion at the metatarsal carpal joint, no pain, and felt no mass; he ordered an X-ray of the toe. Thus, Roberson\u2019s medical records show Dr. Patel did not act with deliberate indifference to Roberson\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>See Domino v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Roberson contends that Correctional Officer Jones acted with deliberate indifference by failing to issue wider boots to Roberson, as ordered by Dr. Patel. The medical records and grievances show that Dr. Patel did not issue a prescription for wider boots, but rather referred Roberson to Officer Jones\u2019 office to have his feet measured. Roberson\u2019s allegations indicate that, at most, Officer Jones was negligent in measuring his feet and not providing wider boots. Acts of negligence do not constitute deliberate indifference. <em>See Domino, </em>239 F.3d at 756; <em>see also Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Therefore, the judgment is AFFIRMED. Roberson\u2019s motion for en banc hearing is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
