REENA RAGGI, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b455-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Vito Forestier appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on October 2, 2007, following a four-day jury trial held in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Karas, J.). On appeal, Forestier argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions for (1) distributing or possessing with intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), and 841(b)(1)(C); and (2) possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u201cA defendant challenging the sufficiency of trial evidence bears a heavy burden, and the reviewing court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Gagliardi, </em>506 F.3d 140, 149 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Forestier contends that the evidence was not sufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that he intended to distribute the small amount of heroin found on his person. It is true that \u201ca small amount of drugs, without more, is insufficient to show that the defendant intended to distribute drugs.\u201d <em>United States v. Gamble, </em>388 F.3d 74, 77 (2d Cir.2004) (per curiam). But it is also true that \u201cany amount of drugs, however small, will support a conviction when there is additional evidence of intent to distribute.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>54 F.3d 1040, 1043 (2d Cir.1995). When Forestier was arrested, he had not only the heroin \u2014 which was divided into 43 separate glassines \u2014 but a loaded gun, a bulletproof vest, a large amount of cash, and four cell phones, two of which contained a phone number labeled \u201cphone tap\u201d which a DEA agent testified was often used by drug dealers. We must view this evidence \u201cnot in isolation but in conjunction,\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>176 F.3d 52, 89 (2d Cir.1999), directing our inquiry \u201cto the totality of the government\u2019s case and not to each element, as each fact may gain color from others.\u201d <em>United States v. Guadagna, </em>183 F.3d 122,130 (2d Cir.1999). Doing so in this case, we find that the evidence was sufficient to support Forestier\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">We have considered all of Defendants Appellant\u2019s arguments and found them to be without merit. We therefore AFFIRM the convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
