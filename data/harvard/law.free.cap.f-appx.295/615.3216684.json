He did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>not appeal, and he unsuccessfully sought relief via a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. He now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The primary vehicle for challenging federal custody is a motion under \u00a7 2255. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e) if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. <em>Id. </em>at 878. Under our savings clause test, Salazar must present a claim \u201c(i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that he may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in his trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Salazar\u2019s arguments regarding the jurisdiction of the sentencing court and his innocence of the offense do not satisfy the savings clause as they are not based on a retroactive Supreme Court decision demonstrating that he was convicted for conduct that did not constitute a crime. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 831 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
