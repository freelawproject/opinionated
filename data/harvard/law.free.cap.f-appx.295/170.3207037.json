Costa appeals from his guilty-plea conviction and 204-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(vii) and 846, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), interstate travel in aid of a racketeering enterprise, and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a)(2), and conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-21\">Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, 386 </em>U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Costa\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Costa has filed a pro se supplemental brief, and the government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-22\">We have reviewed Costa\u2019s supplemental brief and the government\u2019s motion, and we have conducted an independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80-81, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-23\">In light of the valid appeal waiver, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED. <em>See United States v.

Herrera-Blanco, </em>232 F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir.2000) (remanding sua sponte to correct the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-26\">DISMISSED; REMANDED to correct the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b196-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
