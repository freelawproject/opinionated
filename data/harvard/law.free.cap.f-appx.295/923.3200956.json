McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Pro se Plaintiff Martin Vasquez Arroyo appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. We review the court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint de novo. <em>See Riddle v. Mondragon, </em>83 F.3d 1197, 1201 (10th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">In his complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant committed perjury when testifying against Plaintiff, apparently in Plaintiffs criminal trial. However, \u201call witnesses enjoy absolute immunity from civil liability under \u00a7 1983 for their testimony in a prior trial.\u201d <em>Hunt v. Bennett, </em>17 F.3d 1263 (10th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Briscoe v. La-Hue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983)). We therefore agree with the district court that Plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 action did not state a claim on which relief could be granted, and we accordingly AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">We advise Plaintiff that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and we remind him that, upon incurring three strikes, he will no longer be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in a civil action in federal court unless he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious injury,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). We also remind Plaintiff of his obligation to continue making partial payments until his filing fee has been paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b950-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1. After examining Plaintiff\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
