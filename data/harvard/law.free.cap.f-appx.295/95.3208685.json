After LeFlore exhausted his state remedies, he petitioned for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied his petition but certified the appeal-ability of his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Because the Wisconsin Court of Appeals did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">During jury selection for LeFlore\u2019s trial, at which he was charged with crashing into another car and killing an innocent person while fleeing the police, the trial judge asked the prospective jurors whether they had ever been victims of an accident. Juror number three responded that he had been attacked on a city bus ten years earlier and, in response to further questioning by the court, said that the case had gone to trial. When asked if the incident might bias him in any way, juror number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>three responded: \u201cIt\u2019s- hard to say. I don\u2019t know whether it would or not. I suppose I couldn\u2019t say until \u2014 .\u201d At that point the judge cut off the juror, saying: \u201cI\u2019m sure the lawyers will follow up. That\u2019s it for now.\u201d LeFlore\u2019s lawyer then pressed juror number three on the issue, forcing him to admit that he had felt \u201cintimidated\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d during the attack. And when asked if his close friend or relative who was a law enforcement officer might influence his deliberations as a member of the jury, juror number three responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Following his trial, LeFlore filed a motion attacking his lawyer\u2019s failure to challenge juror number three either peremptorily or for cause during voir dire. After the motion was denied by the trial court and the judgment affirmed by the Wisconsin Court of Appeals, the Wisconsin Supreme Court denied LeFlore\u2019s petition for review. LeFlore then filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied by a magistrate judge hearing the case at the parties\u2019 consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">On appeal LeFlore first argues that he was denied his right to an impartial jury because several jurors, including juror number three, were biased. But the magistrate judge declined to issue a certificate of appealability on this issue because LeFlore procedurally defaulted it when the state court of appeals determined that he had waived it by failing to move to strike juror number three for cause. <em>See, e.g., Harding v. Sternes, </em>380 F.3d 1034, 1043 (7th Cir.2004) (state prisoners must exhaust their state remedies for federal court to review \u00a7 2254 petition). We therefore will not review this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">LeFlore next argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney failed to strike juror number three. He asserts that his lawyer\u2019s failure to strike the juror prejudiced his trial. We review the magistrate judge\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and his findings of fact for clear error. <em>Bintz v. Bertrand, </em>403 F.3d 859, 865 (7th Cir.2005). LeFlore\u2019s petition is governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AED-PA). The writ may issue only if the state appellate court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(2). A state court\u2019s application of clearly established federal law is \u201cacceptable, even if it is likely incorrect, so long as it is reasonable.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Loftus, </em>518 F.3d 453, 456 (7th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Wright v. Van Patten,</em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 743, 169 L.Ed.2d 583 (2008)). Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are analyzed under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), which requires LeFlore to show that trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below minimal professional standards and that this alleged deficiency prejudiced him. <em>See Suggs v. United States, </em>513 F.3d 675, 678 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Here, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland. </em>The state court determined that LeFlore\u2019s attorney was not deficient because he \u201cperformed exactly as proficient counsel should.\u201d After the trial judge discovered that juror number three had been the victim of a beating on a bus, LeFlore\u2019s trial counsel immediately posed several follow-up questions to the juror about his state of mind, which did not reveal an inability for juror number three to remain impartial. The attorney thus made the strategic decision not to strike the juror, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>which is, under <em>Strickland, </em>\u201cvirtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. And although juror number three replied \u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d when asked if his close friend or relative who was a law enforcement officer might influence his duties as a juror, Wisconsin does not recognize equivocal answers as establishing a grounds for a challenge for cause. <em>See State v. Erickson, </em>227 Wis.2d 758, 596 N.W.2d 749, 759 (1999) (\u201c[A] prospective juror need not respond to voir dire questions with unequivocal declarations of impartiality.\u201d). LeFlore therefore fails to show how the state appellate court\u2019s decision unreasonably applied <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
