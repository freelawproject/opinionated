The district court held that judicial estoppel barred Rose from asserting her causes of action against Beverly.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-20\">In this court, Rose raises three issues. First, Rose contends the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Second, Rose contends Beverly\u2019s notice of removal was untimely. Third, Rose contends the district court abused its discretion by concluding she was judicially es-topped from asserting her claims against Beverly.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">The district court correctly denied Rose\u2019s motion to remand the case to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Federal question jurisdiction exists over Rose\u2019s cause of action for breach of contract. The district court determined Rose\u2019s employment was governed by a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d). This conclusion was not clear error: Rose\u2019s position was listed as part of the bargaining unit in filings before the National Labor Relations Board; Rose herself signed a petition to decertify the bargaining unit; and Rose introduced no evidence of an employment agreement separate from the CBA. Rose\u2019s breach of contract claim is therefore a suit for breach of a CBA that gives rise to federal question jurisdiction under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a); <em>Young v. Anthony\u2019s Fish Grottos, Inc., </em>830 F.2d 993, 997-98 (9th Cir.1987). Because federal question jurisdiction exists over Rose\u2019s breach of contract claim, the district court could exercise jurisdiction over her pendent state-law claims. <em>See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Beverly\u2019s removal notice was timely. Rose\u2019s complaint did not disclose on its face that Rose\u2019s suit was one for breach of a CBA. Beverly\u2019s subjective knowledge to the contrary is irrelevant. <em>See Harris v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>425 F.3d 689, 695 (9th Cir.2005). Beverly filed its removal notice within thirty days of the \u201creceipt by the defendant ... of a ... paper from which\u201d Beverly could \u201cfirst ascertainf ] that the case is one which is or has become removable.... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Because Rose both failed to disclose the existence of her claims against Beverly in bankruptcy proceedings, and obtained a discharge of debts on the basis of her false representation that she had no unliquidated or contingent claims against third parties, the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that judicial estoppel bars Rose\u2019s claims. <em>See Hamilton v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>270 F.3d 778, 784-85 (9th Cir.2001). That Rose subsequently moved to reopen the bankruptcy proceedings does not excuse her earlier failure to disclose; judicial estoppel ensures that debtors make a \u201c \u2018full and honest disclosure\u2019 \u201d of their assets in the original bankruptcy proceeding. <em>See id. </em>at 785 (quoting <em>In re Coastal Plains, </em>179 F.3d 197, 208 (5th Cir.1999)). Nor does Rose\u2019s claimed subjective ignorance of the disclosure requirements prevent the application of judicial estoppel. At the time she filed for bankruptcy, Rose knew the facts giving rise to her claims and her request for a right to sue letter from the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing demonstrates she knew these claims were potentially valuable. <em>See id. </em>at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b169-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
