We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The agency denied Jie\u2019s asylum application as time barred. Jie does not challenge this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Jie did not establish eligibility for withholding of removal because Jie\u2019s experiences in Indonesia did not constitute past persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1016-18. Furthermore, even if the disfavored group analysis set forth in <em>Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir. 2004) applies to Christian Indonesians seeking withholding of removal, Jie failed to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he will be persecuted if he returned to Indonesia. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s determination that Jie is not entitled to CAT relief because he has not demonstrated that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Indonesia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
