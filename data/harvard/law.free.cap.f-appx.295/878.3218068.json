After a continuing review in 2002, the ALJ terminated Hunt\u2019s SSI benefits. The ALJ determined that Hunt no longer met the criteria of Medical Listing 1.05C, her complaints of pain lacked credibility, she had the residual functional capacity to work, and she was not disabled as of June 2002. The district court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, finding that it was supported by substantial evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">We review a district court\u2019s decision affirming an ALJ\u2019s decision de novo. <em>Benton v. Barnhart, </em>331 F.3d 1030, 1035 (9th Cir.2003). We will set aside the ALJ\u2019s denial of SSI benefits \u201conly when the ALJ\u2019s findings are based on legal error or not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">The evidence in Hunt\u2019s medical record provides ample support for the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.994. First, Hunt did not consult a physician for her back pain from 1996 to 2002. Second, once Hunt sought medical treatment for her back pain in 2002 and thereafter, that treatment was far less fi\u2019equent and extensive than her treatment prior to the 1996 SSI benefit award. The ALJ made specific findings supporting his determination that Hunt\u2019s pain testimony lacked credibility, and those findings were adequately supported by Hunt\u2019s evaluating physicians. <em>See Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 345 (9th Cir.1991). The ALJ noted that Hunt had not visited a doctor for back pain from 1996 to 2002 and that several doctors found her claims of severe pain were not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">Hunt argues that there was insufficient evidence in her medical record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Hunt had the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform working tasks. Given Hunt\u2019s lack of credibility, and the medical evidence that contradicts her assessments of her own ability, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination of Hunt\u2019s RFC. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.945(a)(3), 416.946(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-18\">Finally, Hunt, who appeared pro se, contends that the ALJ erred in failing <em>sua </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number><em>sponte </em>to consider the limiting effects of her obesity. Hunt suffered from only moderate obesity and there are no indications in the record that her obesity contributed to her back pain. Given the lack of evidence connecting Hunt\u2019s obesity to any physical limitations and her own failure to allege that her obesity negatively affected her in any way, the ALJ did not err in failing to examine Hunt\u2019s obesity beyond an assessment of whether it contributed to her lower back pain. <em>See Brown v. Heckler, </em>713 F.2d 441, 443 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b905-19\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
