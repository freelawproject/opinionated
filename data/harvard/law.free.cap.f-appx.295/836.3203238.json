The case initially was assigned to Judge Reinhard, but in May 2007, while the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was under consideration, the case was reassigned to Judge Kapala. On August 21, 2007, Judge Kapala entered an order granting the defendants\u2019 motion. Almost four weeks later, Carter, by then in state prison, mailed to the district court a notice of appeal and a \u201cMotion to Reconsider.\u201d We docketed the appeal, and the district court denied the motion. Carter did not separately appeal the adverse ruling on his motion, which because of its timing is properly construed as a motion to vacate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). <em>See Talano v. Northwestern Med. Faculty Found., Inc., </em>273 F.3d 757, 762 (7th Cir.2001); <em>Hope v. United States, </em>43 F.3d 1140, 1143 (7th Cir.1994). Our jurisdiction is thus limited to the judgment on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Carter does not contend that Judge Kapala committed error in analyzing the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Instead of attacking the merits of that ruling, Carter argues that Judge Kapala should have recused himself because he presided over Carter\u2019s 1991 state trial and previously served as judge for the judicial circuit encompassing Winnebago County. A motion for recusal asserting bias or prejudice must be filed as soon as the basis for disqualification is known. <em>Tezak v. United States, </em>256 F.3d 702, 717 n. 15 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Sykes, </em>7 F.3d 1331, 1339 (7th Cir.1993). Carter, however, failed to move for recusal or object to the reassignment until he filed his post-judgment \u201cMotion to Reconsider.\u201d And even assuming, as he claims, that he did not know of the reassignment until he saw Judge Kapala\u2019s name on the summary judgment ruling, Carter did not allege that he possesses evidence of actual bias or prejudice. <em>See, e.g., Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 551, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994) (\u201cAlso not subject to deprecatory characterization as \u2018bias\u2019 or \u2018prejudice\u2019 are opinions held by judges as a result of what they learned in earlier proceedings.\u201d); <em>In re Taylor, </em>417 F.3d 649, 652 (7th Cir.2005) (\u201cThere is no rule that requires a judge to recuse himself from a case, civil or criminal, simply because he was or is involved in litigation with one of the parties.\u201d); <em>Hoffman v. Caterpillar, Inc., </em>368 F.3d 709, 718 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe factual allegations must fairly support the charge of bias or impartiality and must be specific.\u201d); <em>Tezak, </em>256 F.3d at 717 (explaining that passage of time undercut contention that judge was prejudiced on account of events from eight years earlier). Accordingly, Carter\u2019s recusal argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
