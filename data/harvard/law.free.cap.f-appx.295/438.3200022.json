Sept. 27, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the Board\u2019s decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, this Court has remained mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Maghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Petitioner advances a single ground to demonstrate purported abuse of discretion by the BIA: the Board ignored documentary evidence of changed conditions in China, specifically, a new family planning law that took effect in China on September 1, 2002, several months after the BIA\u2019s initial decision in his case became final.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record reflects that petitioner did not cite this change in Chinese law in his October 16, 2006 motion to reopen. Rather, a copy of the new law was attached to a separate motion to reopen filed on March 12, 2007, by his attorney in the name of a different client but bearing Hong\u2019s immigration docket number. Apparently relying on the docket number, the BIA considered Hong\u2019s October 16, 2006 motion and the March 12, 2007 motion together when, on September 27, 2007, it declined to reopen his case. <em>See In re Yong Fa Hong, </em>No. A78 208 218 (noting that petitioner had filed motions to reopen on October 16, 2006, and March 12, 2007, respectively). After Hong petitioned this court for review, the BIA determined <em>sua sponte </em>that the March 12, 2007 motion was not filed by Hong, and the Board modified its opinion to omit references to that second filing, though otherwise retaining verbatim the language of its September 27, 2007 denial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">We need not here decide whether Hong\u2019s petition seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial as originally filed or as amended because, in either event, we can afford him no relief. The law limits an alien to one motion to reopen to be filed within ninety days of the agency\u2019s final administrative decision, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), unless the alien demonstrates subsequent \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>country of nationality,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Because the change in Chinese law here at issue took effect on September 1, 2002, Hong\u2019s failure to cite the change in his October 16, 2006 motion to reopen precludes him from doing so now. <em>See Lin Zhong v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 123 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cConsistent with the strong prudential rationale for requiring all issues raised on appeal to have been presented below, our circuit applies an issue exhaustion doctrine to petitions for review from the BIA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Even if we were to conclude that the subsequent March 12, 2007 motion somehow exhausted this issue, we could not conclude that the BIA abused its discretion in finding that Hong failed to establish a change in circumstances in China. Petitioner draws our attention to \u201cArticle 18\u201d of a document marked \u201cunofficial translation,\u201d which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">The State shall maintain its current fertility policy encouraging late marriage and childbearing and advocating one child per couple; arrangements for a second child, if requested, being subject to law and regulation. Specific measures shall be enacted by the People\u2019s Congress or its standing committee in each province....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. at 9. This excerpt indicates that China will \u201cmaintain its current fertility policy,\u201d not that it will develop a new one. Nor does it mention forced contraception or forced abortion or other forms of persecution; it only encourages \u201clate marriage\u201d and late childbearing. Further, while discouraging second children, the language indicates that \u201carrangements\u201d may be made for a second child. Under these circumstances, the BIA\u2019s rejection of this \u201cbackground document[ ],\u201d <em>In re Yong Fa Hong, </em>No. A78 208 218, as evidence of \u201cchanged conditions\u201d in China warranting reopening cannot be deemed an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">We have considered all of Petitioner\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b465-13\">. All other issues are, therefore, waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\">. Insofar as Petitioner may be suggesting that the BIA\u2019s mistaken reliance on the March 12, 2007 motion in its original decision prejudiced him in this appeal, we note that Hong has had plenty of time and opportunities to bring any such prejudice to our attention, and has failed to do so. Petitioner never filed a reply brief after the BIA modified its opinion, nor has he sought oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
