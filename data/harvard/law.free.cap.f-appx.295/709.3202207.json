His sole issue on appeal is based upon his contention that the district court erred in failing to award him a reduction of his sentence under the \u201csafety-valve provision\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and section 5C1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Pena-Najera alleges that the district judge failed to make an \u201cindependent determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">We have carefully reviewed the sentencing record, and we conclude that the district judge did made an \u201cindependent determination.\u201d It was Pena-Naj era\u2019s burden to prove that he was entitled to the \u201csafety-valve\u201d reduction, and he failed to meet that burden. <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Cervantes, </em>519 F.3d 1254, 1258 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201che who has the burden of proof must put on <em>some evidence </em>at a sentencing hearing to allow the district court to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is eligible for the safety-valve adjustment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
