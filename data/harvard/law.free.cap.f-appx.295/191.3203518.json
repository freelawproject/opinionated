We grant review of Lopez Sanchez\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims and remand so that the BIA can first consider the particular social group claim. We deny review of the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-19\">As an initial matter, the government argues that we lack jurisdiction to review Lopez Sanchez\u2019s claims because of his California conviction for possession of marijuana. We have jurisdiction to determine whether jurisdiction exists. <em>Unuakhaulu v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 931, 935 (9th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Matsuk v. INS, </em>247 F.3d 999, 1000-01 (9th Cir.2001)). Title 8 U.S.C., Section 1252(a)(2)(C) provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by having committed a criminal offense covered in section 1 182(a)(2).\u201d Section 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) states that an alien is inadmissible if he is convicted of \u201ca violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State.\u201d However, \u201cthe jurisdiction-stripping provision in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) applies only when \u2014 and to the extent that\u2014 the agency has found the petitioner to be removable based on one of the enumerated criminal grounds.\u201d <em>Unuakhaulu, </em>416 F.3d at 936 (citing <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1253 (9th Cir.2003)). Section 1252(a)(2)(C) does not \u201c \u2018preclude[ ] judicial review of an otherwise renewable removal order where the record establishes that the individual could have been <em>but was not ordered removed </em>for having committed a covered criminal offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Alvarez-Santos, </em>332 F.3d at 1250, 1253). The IJ could have found Lopez Sanchez removable based on the marijuana conviction but did not do so. Instead, the IJ denied Lopez Sanchez\u2019s claims on the merits. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to review Lopez Sanchez\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Lopez Sanchez argues that his asylum and withholding of removal claims must be remanded so that the BIA can address in the first instance the issue of whether Peruvians with serious, chronic mental disabilities constitute \u201ca particular social group\u201d for asylum and withholding of removal purposes. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). The government argues that we should address the issue and answer it in the negative. We agree with Lopez Sanchez, and therefore remand to the BIA so that it can consider this issue in the first instance. <em>See INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam) (holding that the Ninth Circuit committed \u201cclear error\u201d by \u201cdisregarding] the agency\u2019s legally mandated role\u201d and \u201cindependently creating] potentially far reaching legal precedent\u201d); <em>Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 187, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006) (per curiam) (holding a \u201ccourt of appeals is not generally empowered to conduct a <em>de novo </em>inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry\u201d where the agency had not considered whether a particular family could constitute a particular social group) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Ucelo-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 163, 169 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]here ... the agency has yet to decide whether a group, a thing, or a situation falls within the ambit of a statutory term, the proper course is for the reviewing court to remand the matter to the agency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">We deny review of Lopez Sanchez\u2019s claim for protection under the CAT. The IJ\u2019s finding that it was not more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed is supported by substantial evidence and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 922-23 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">We deny review of all of Lopez Rocca\u2019s claims. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is \u201c \u2018based on specific, cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smolniakova v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 1037, 1045 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Zahedi v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1157,1165 (9th Cir.2000)). The IJ\u2019s decisions that Lopez Rocca failed to establish past persecution on account of a protected ground and that he lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1169 (9th Cir.2005). Thus, we deny review of Lopez Rocca\u2019s asylum and withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>removal claims. Finally, we deny review of the claim for protection under the CAT because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Lopez Rocca has not shown that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Peru. <em>See Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1216 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Petition GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b218-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
