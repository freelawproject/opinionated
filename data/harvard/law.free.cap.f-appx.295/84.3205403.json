Claiming that Melissa Gagen, the prosecutor who tried the case against him, committed misconduct amounting to a constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>violation, Myers brought a civil-rights complaint against her under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court screened the complaint, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, and dismissed it for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The district court read the complaint to allege that Gagen represented Myers, but the court\u2019s confusion is understandable. In his complaint Myers identifies Gagen only as an \u201cattorney at law\u201d and refers to her as \u201cAttorney Ga-gen.\u201d The court dismissed based on the rule that a defense lawyer, even if paid by the state, does not act under color of state law unless she conspires with state officials to violate the rights of another. <em>See Tower v. Glover, </em>467 U.S. 914, 923, 104 S.Ct. 2820, 81 L.Ed.2d 758 (1984); <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">On appeal Myers has clarified that Ga-gen\u2019s role was that of prosecutor and not defense counsel, but the clarification does not help his cause. Although prosecutors act under color of state law, they are absolutely immune from suits under \u00a7 1983 challenging conduct that is \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\u201d <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); <em>see also Redwood v. Dobson, </em>476 F.3d 462, 466 (7th Cir.2007). Because Myers\u2019s suit challenges Gagen\u2019s conduct at trial \u2014 undoubtedly part of the judicial phase of the criminal process \u2014 the dismissal of Myers\u2019s suit is</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
