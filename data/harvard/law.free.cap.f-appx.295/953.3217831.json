McCormick took a leave of absence and received short-term disability payments. When she exhausted her short-term disability benefits, McCormick was still unable to return to work and began receiving payments pursuant to the long-term disability policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) that was a benefit of her employment. She received ten weeks of payments pursuant to the Policy. When, to substantiate a request for additional benefits, she provided the administrator of the Policy (not Archstone) with medical information, the administrator determined that McCormick was not medically eligible for additional benefits. Also, while she was on leave, Archstone sold the property where McCormick had worked and terminated McCormick\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-21\">McCormick sued Archstone for violations of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cthe ERISA claim\u201d) and violations of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and the Florida Civil Rights Act (together, \u201cthe discrimination claims\u201d), alleging that Archstone discriminated against her on the basis of her pregnancy when it denied her continued disability benefits and terminated her employment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>The district court granted summary judgment to Archstone on all counts of the complaint. McCormick appeals. Arch-stone cross-appeals, complaining that a finding in the district court\u2019s order is erroneous and prejudicial to Archstone and must be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">We address McCormick\u2019s appeal first. On the ERISA claim, we find no error in the district court\u2019s finding that Archstone is not a fiduciary for purposes of the ERISA statute and, therefore, is not a proper defendant to this claim. Thus, we affirm the summary judgment granted Archstone on Count I of McCormick\u2019s complaint. On the discrimination claims, we also affirm the summary judgments granted Archstone. McCormick presented no evidence to rebut Archstone\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her employment. (R.2-81 at 16.) Neither did she present evidence that it was untrue that termination of her disability benefits was based, as the administrator explained, on her medical condition. (R.2-81 at 17.) Because we affirm the summary judgements, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s order awarding costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">With regard to Archstone\u2019s cross-appeal, there is an issue of jurisdiction. The district court granted summary judgment to Archstone. Therefore, as the prevailing party, Archstone has no standing to appeal the judgment. <em>Agripost, Inc. v. Miami-Dade County, </em>195 F.3d 1225, 1230 (11th Cir.1999). This case does not fall within the narrow exception to the rule for prevailing parties who are prejudiced by the collateral estoppel effects of a court\u2019s order. <em>Id. </em>Archstone\u2019s concern that the district court\u2019s finding that the Policy is facially discriminatory may harm it in future litigation is unwarranted. There can be no collateral estoppel effect of that finding because that determination was not critical to the judgment in this case. As the district court found, and as we hold above, even if the Policy is facially discriminatory, McCormick\u2019s claims of discrimination fail. Archstone\u2019s cross-appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; CROSS-APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
