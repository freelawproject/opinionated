A79 310 345/346 (B.I.A. Oct. 5, 2007), <em>affg </em>Nos. A79 310 345/346 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 1, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">As an initial matter, although Laca is challenging the denial of relief in \u201casylum-only\u201d proceedings, as opposed to an actual removal order, we nevertheless have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) because the denial of relief in these circumstances is the functional equivalent of a removal order. <em>See Kanacevic v. INS, </em>448 F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir.2006). When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that, even assuming that Laca suffered past persecution, conditions in Albania have fundamentally changed such that he does not have a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1). We have held that when making a changed country conditions finding with respect to a country \u201cthat is the subject of an appreciable proportion of asylum claims,\u201d the agency \u201cneed not enter specific findings premised on record evidence.\u201d <em>Hoxhallari v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 179, 187 (2d Cir.2006) (affirming the agency\u2019s finding that an applicant was ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal based on material political changes in Albania). Here, the IJ and BIA properly relied on background record evidence to find that the Democratic Party\u2019s return to power in Albania was a fundamental change sufficient to rebut any presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See id. </em>Under these circumstances, the agency properly denied Laca\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. <em>See Hoxhallari, </em>468 F.3d at 187; <em>see also Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-31\">. Gege and Dafina Laca are a married couple. Because Gege Laca was the lead asylum applicant before the agency, we refer exclusively to him in this order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
