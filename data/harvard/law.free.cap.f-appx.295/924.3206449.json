McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Pro se Plaintiff Martin Vasquez appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. We review the court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint de novo. <em>See Riddle v. Mondragon, </em>83 F.3d 1197,1201 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201ca local government may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents,\u201d <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), but will be held liable only where \u201caction pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018. Even liberally construed, Plaintiffs complaint does not claim that the alleged malicious prosecution was caused by any such official policy, nor does the complaint reasonably suggest that such a claim could be supported. Therefore, for substantially the reasons delineated by the district court, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">We advise Plaintiff that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and we remind him that, upon incurring three strikes, he will no longer be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in a civil action in federal court unless he is \u201cunder imminent danger of serious injury,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). We also remind Plaintiff of his obligation to continue making partial payments until his filing fee has been paid in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-21\">After examining Plaintiff\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
