We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">On appeal, Perkins presents two claims. He argues first that his sentence is unreasonable because the District Court clearly erred in crediting the testimony of Perkins\u2019s co-defendant and cooperating witness James Hilligus over Perkin\u2019s own testimony in determining the amount of methamphetamine for which Perkins was responsible. He also contends that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to argue that Hilligus\u2019s testimony at the <em>Fatico </em>hearing did not sufficiently establish Perkins\u2019s responsibility for more than 500 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In determining the quantity of a controlled substance, a district court has broad discretion to consider all relevant evidence, and its finding need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Blount, </em>291 F.3d 201, 214, 215 (2d Cir.2002). Credibility determinations are distinctly the province of the district court, and so are deserving of special deference. <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>315 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir.2002). On the record presented, the District Court\u2019s decision to credit Hilligus\u2019s testimony over Perkins\u2019s was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">With respect to Perkins\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), requires both (1) that counsel\u2019s performance be deficient as measured against an objective standard of reasonableness and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance be prejudicial. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>United States v. Finley, </em>245 F.3d 199, 204 (2d Cir.2001). Perkins fails to make either showing. His lawyer was vigorous in cross-examining Hilligus, and this performance and submissions to the District Court played a key role in the District Court\u2019s decision to sentence Perkins to a below-Guidelines sentence of 192 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">We have considered all of Appellants\u2019 claims and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
