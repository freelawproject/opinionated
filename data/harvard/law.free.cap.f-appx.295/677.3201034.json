He argues that the district court procedurally erred by failing to calculate the advisory guidelines range. He also contends that the sentence imposed was greater than necessary to comply with the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a), and he argues for the first time that he should be resentenced because the decisions in <em>Gall v. United States,</em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States,</em>-U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558,169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), broadened the district court\u2019s discretion in imposing a non-guidelines sentence and the 16-level enhancement for having a prior crime of violence is not empirically supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-27\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97, this court must determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound, including whether the calculation of the advisory guidelines range is correct, and whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. Review is for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 597. \u201cNot all errors in determining a defendant\u2019s guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>sentence require reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 656 (5th Cir. 2008). We may affirm where the district court imposes a non-Guidelines sentence that did not \u201cdirectly result\u201d from an error in calculating the Guidelines. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">At sentencing, the defendant argued that an eight-level enhancement should apply, and the Government argued that the PSR correctly calculated that the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 should apply. The district court considered the two guidelines ranges, rejected both of them, and permissibly exercised its discretion to impose a non-Guidelines sentence. We find no reversible procedural error. <em>See United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 396-97 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d at 656-57, 659; <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 526-27 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Given Lerma\u2019s extensive criminal record, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 90-month sentence. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349-50 (5th Cir.2008). Finally, Lerma has not established plain error with respect to his assertions that he should be resentenced based on <em>Gall </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>and because the 16-level enhancement was not empirically supported. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
