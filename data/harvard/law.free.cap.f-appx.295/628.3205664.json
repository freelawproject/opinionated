Belmares was sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines imprisonment range to a 57-month term of imprisonment and to a two-year period of supervised release. Belmares gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">Belmares contends that this case should be summarily remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). Reviewing this contention for plain error, we find nothing in the record indicating that the district court felt constrained by this court\u2019s <em>pre-Gall </em>jurisprudence. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>530 F.3d 381, 387-88 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 20, 2008) (No. OS-5988). Instead, the record reflects that the district court imposed a guidelines sentence because of the need to punish Belmares and to deter him from future criminal conduct and because the guidelines sentence satisfied the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\">Belmares contends that the district court failed to explain adequately and justify its sentence in terms of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Under the circumstances of this case, the district court\u2019s explanation for imposing a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range is adequate to satisfy this \u201ccourt that [the district judge] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-19\">Belmares argues that his within-guidelines sentence should not be presumed to be reasonable under <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006), because the 16-level enhancement provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not \u201cempirically grounded.\u201d We rejected a similar argument in <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338-39. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b655-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
