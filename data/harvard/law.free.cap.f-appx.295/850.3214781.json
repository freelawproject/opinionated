Kiesewetter attributes his words and actions to the manic phase of his bipolar disorder and contends that the Americans with Disabilities Act required Caterpillar to accommodate his conduct by tolerating it. The district court granted summary judgment to Caterpillar, finding that Kiesewetter\u2019s mental condition is not a \u201cdisability\u201d as the ADA uses that term. The district judge did not reach other questions, such as whether Kiesewetter is \u201cqualified\u201d if he cannot meet the employer\u2019s legitimate expectations about conduct toward superiors and co-workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">After the district court entered its judgment, Congress amended the ADA\u2019s definition of \u201cdisability.\u201d See \u00a7 3 of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (Sept. 25, 2008). Section 8 of this statute provides that the legislation\u2019s effective date is January 1, 2009, so it does not apply to this appeal. We use the laws and interpretations that were in force when the complained-of acts occurred. See <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">A \u201cdisability\u201d is a \u201cphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities\u201d. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(A). Bipolar disorder is a mental impairment, but the district judge concluded that the record did not create a material dispute about whether it had substantially limited any of Kiesewetter\u2019s major life activities. He contends that the condition limits sleeping and working. Effects on sleep may be granted, but the judge found that these effects are mild (i.e., not \u201csubstantial\u201d limitations) and did not bear any causal connection to Kiesewetter\u2019s difficulties at work. Kiesewetter points to a letter from his physician saying that sleep disorders <em>can </em>cause problems at work, but no evidence in this record implies that they <em>did </em>cause problems for Kiesewetter in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">As for working: We shall assume, as we have done before, that \u201cworking\u201d was a major life activity under the preamendment version of the ADA. See <em>Squibb v. Memorial Medical Center, </em>497 F.3d 775, 781 (7th Cir.2007). (The 2008 amendments specify that \u201cworking\u201d is among the covered \u201cmajor life activities\u201d.) A substantial limitation means \u201cinability to work in a broad range of jobs, rather than a specific job.\u201d <em>Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 200, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002); see also 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3). Kiesewetter contends that his bipolar disorder prevents him from working as an engineer at Caterpillar but has never tried to show that it prevents him from working at a \u201cbroad range of jobs\u201d. Bipolar disorder can be more or less severe. People with less severe manifestations of this disorder, which afflicts approximately <em>1% </em>of the population, hold many different jobs across the economy. To prevail in this suit, Kiesewetter had to show that his condition is sufficiently severe that he is unable to work in a broad range of jobs, yet sufficiently mild that he is \u201cqualified\u201d to perform his duties at Caterpillar. He has not produced evidence from which a reasonable jury could find in his favor on these subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">Kiesewetter contends on appeal that he was fired, not because of his condition, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>because of Caterpillar\u2019s misapprehensions about bipolar disorder. He did not make such an argument in the district court, however, so this contention has been forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">\n<em>NONPRECEDENTIAL DISPOSITION This case was not selected for publication in the Federal Reporter To be cited only in accordance with Fed.

Crabb, Chief Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Peter M. Jarosz, Office of the United States Attorney, Madison, WI, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Michael E. Luepke, Federal Correctional Institution, Sandstone, MN, Richard H. Parsons, Johanna M. Christiansen, Office of the Federal Public Defender, Peoria, IL, for Defendant-Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Before KENNETH F. RIPPLE, Circuit Judge, DIANE P. WOOD, Circuit Judge, JOHN DANIEL TINDER, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">After a lengthy investigation, Michael Luepke was indicted on three counts of conspiring to distribute and distributing methamphetamine under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and \u00a7 846. The day of his arrest he kicked and damaged the door of the vehicle transporting him to court, which led to an additional charge of attempting to escape from custody under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a). Luepke eventually pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of a mixture containing methamphetamine. The district court sentenced him to 240 months of imprisonment, within the guidelines range of 210 to 262 months. He appealed, and we remanded for resentencing because he was not given a meaningful opportunity to address the court before being sentenced. <em>United States v. Luepke, </em>495 F.3d 443 (7th Cir.2007). On remand, the district court sentenced Luepke to 220</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">months. Luepke has again appealed, but his appointed counsel moves to withdraw because counsel discerns no nonfrivolous basis for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Luepke did not accept our invitation to respond to his lawyer\u2019s brief, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), so we limit our review to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>United States v. Sehuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">Counsel first considers whether Luepke could challenge his guilty plea in any manner, but as counsel recognizes, he waived any such argument by not raising it in his first appeal. <em>United States v. Swanson, </em>483 F.3d 509, 515 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">Counsel next considers whether Luepke could challenge the reasonableness of his sentence. We review sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion to ensure that the guidelines range is properly calculated, that the court adequately considered the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that the sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\"><em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We presume a correctly calculated sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-64, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">Luepke\u2019s sentence was correctly calculated using the 2005 guidelines and March 2006 supplement, and is the same under the current version. The court appropriately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Luepke\u2019s history and characteristics, the circumstances of his offense, the need for deterrence, and the protection of the community. The court considered Luepke\u2019s request for a below-guidelines sentence because he took methamphetamine to alleviate his Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>concluded that his distribution of large quantities of methamphetamine to numerous people warranted a within-guidelines sentence. This was all that was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Counsel next addresses the issues that Luepke specifically wished to raise. First, counsel considers whether Luepke should have received an aceeptance-of-responsibility adjustment for pleading guilty and cooperating with the government\u2019s investigation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). A defendant is not entitled to the adjustment merely for pleading guilty. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 3; <em>United States v. Krasinski, </em>545 F.3d 546, 554-55 (7th Cir.2008). Moreover, when a defendant receives an adjustment for obstruction of justice, that \u201cordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility,\u201d though there may be \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d in which both adjustments apply. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 4; <em>Krasinski, </em>545 F.3d at 554-55. The PSR reflects, and the court found, that Luepke threatened to have an associate beaten if the associate talked to the police about him (conduct for which Luepke received an obstruction-of-justice adjustment), that he continued to distribute methamphetamine long after he became aware of the investigation into his</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">activities, and that he kicked and damaged the door of the vehicle transporting him to the courthouse the day of his arrest. Given this conduct, his plea and assistance to law enforcement do not make his case extraordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">Counsel next addresses whether the court erred in adjusting Luepke\u2019s sentence upward for possessing a weapon that Luepke did not brandish or use. But brandishing or use is not an element of weapon possession; the guideline requires only that a defendant \u201cpossessed\u201d the weapon. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3; <em>United States v. Womack, </em>496 F.3d 791, 797-98 (7th Cir. 2007). As the district court noted, Luepke does not dispute that he twice possessed a gun during a drug transaction: once when he traded guns for methamphetamine, and once when he answered the knock of a drug customer with a gun in his pocket. Those facts are all that is needed to warrant the upward adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
