Mclnnis (collectively, \u201cRelators\u201d) brought this qui tam action against United Medical Corporation (\u201cUMC\u201d), various affiliated health care companies including St. Claude Medical Center, LLC (\u201cSt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Claude\u201d), and certain UMC executives (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d), alleging violations of the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d), 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729, <em>et seq. </em>The district court granted the Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to plead fraud with particularity under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and denied Relators\u2019 motion to amend the complaint. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">St. Claude operates a hospital, St. Claude Medical Center (the \u201cHospital\u201d), in New Orleans, Louisiana. While serving as executives of St. Claude, Relators allegedly became aware of a multifaceted scheme by UMC, St. Claude, and the individual defendants to obtain illegal Medicare and Medicaid payments from the Government over a period of more than seven years. On February 12, 2003, Relators filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The complaint, and an Amended Complaint alleging an additional cause of action filed almost a year later, remained sealed while the Government considered whether to intervene. After nearly four years it decided not to do so, and on January 10, 2007, the district court ordered the complaints to be served on the Defendants. On March 15, 2007, Relators filed their Second Amended Complaint, adding another claim, striking an original relator, and dismissing claims against some original defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 21, 2007, Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to plead with the particularity required by Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which the district court granted on August 3, 2007. Relators then timely filed a combined Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment and a motion seeking leave to amend their complaint under Rule 15(a), accompanied by a proposed amendment. The district court denied this motion on October 18, 2007, and entered final judgment on November 19. Relators timely filed notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">While complaints generally need contain only a short and plain statement of the cause of action, \u201c[cjlaims brought under the FCA must comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b).\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Doe v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>343 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2003) (internal citation omitted). Rule 9(b) states that \u201c[i]n alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of a person\u2019s mind may be alleged generally.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b). Under Rule 9(b), a plaintiff must include the \u201ctime, place and contents of the false representations, as well as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what [that person] obtained thereby.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Russell v. Epic Healthcare Mgmt. Group, </em>193 F.3d 304, 308 (5th Cir.1999) (internal citation omitted) (alteration in original). This is known as the \u201cwho, what, when, where, and how of the alleged fraud.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Thompson v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., </em>125 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">A dismissal for failure to plead fraud with particularity under Rule 9(b) is treated as a dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) and is reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 901. A plaintiff must plead \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965 (internal citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend under Rule 15(a) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Stripling v. Jordan Prod. Co., </em>234 F.3d 863, 872 (5th Cir.2000). However, \u201crule 15(a) severely restricts the judge\u2019s freedom, directing that leave to amend \u2018shall be freely given when justice so requires,\u2019 \u201d <em>Dussouy v. Gulf Coast Inv. Corp., </em>660 F.2d 594, 597 (5th Cir.1981), and, therefore, leave to amend should not be denied without a substantial reason such as \u201cundue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, [or] futility of amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); <em>see also Stripling, </em>234 F.3d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">A. Dismissal of Relators\u2019 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Relators first appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their action for failure to plead with particularity as required by Rule 9(b). \u201cThe conduct to which liability attaches in [an FCA] suit consists in part of false statements or claims for payment presented to the government. Because such statements or claims are among the circumstances constituting fraud in [an FCA] suit, these must be pled with particularity under Rule 9(b).\u201d <em>Russell, </em>193 F.3d at 308 (citation omitted); <em>see also United States ex rel. Bledsoe v. Cmty. Health Sys., </em>501 F.3d 493, 505 (6th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>2007) (\u201cParticularized allegations of an actual false claim is an indispensable element of a FCA violation[.]\u201d); <em>United States ex rel. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp., </em>360 F.3d 220, 225 (1st Cir.2004) (\u201cThe [FCA] attaches liability, not to the underlying fraudulent activity or to the government\u2019s wrongful payment, but to the claim for payment.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>United States ex rel. Aflatooni v. Kitsap Physicians Serv., </em>314 F.3d 995, 997 (9th Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt seems to be a fairly obvious notion that a False Claims Act suit ought to require a false claim.\u201d); <em>United States ex rel. Clausen v. Lab. Corp. of Am,., </em>290 F.3d 1301, 1311 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201cThe submission of a claim is ... the <em>sine qua non </em>of a False Claims Act violation.\u201d). The district court concluded that Relators have made \u201cbroad claims against numerous defendants without identifying specific actions of specific individuals at specific times that would constitute fraud against the government.\u201d We agree with this characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">On appeal, Relators present arguments with respect to only four of the fourteen counts in their Second Amended Complaint. Relators first argue that their first and second counts, involving allegations that Defendants falsely reported the number of beds at the Hospital in order to qualify for a higher rate of reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid, <em>see </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.106, as well as their thirteenth count, involving allegations of a failure to \u201cmeet the medical community standards of care\u201d at the Hospital, were pled with sufficient particularity. These counts, Relators maintain, allege that Defendants made false claims in their annual cost reports and provide the \u201cwho, what, when, where, and how\u201d of these reports. The words \u201cannual cost report\u201d do not appear in these counts, however, nor do the counts contain allegations of specific false claims having been submitted in these cost reports or otherwise. Rather, these counts contain general statements such as \u201cDefendants made knowingly false representations ... at least once each year (1995-2001) in connection with the annual licensing application,\u201d \u201c[Defendants routinely submitted bills\u2014on a daily basis\u2014to Medicare for reimbursement and payment,\u201d \u201c[D]efendants knowingly made false reports in connection with a claim for payment ... for the time period January 1, 1996 to present,\u201d \u201cthe \u2018licensed beds\u2019 for [1996-2002] ... should not have been reported at the 136-bed levels and should not have been reported for licensing,\u201d and \u201c[Defendants provided false information ... regarding the quality of care ... in the course of negotiating for Medicare and Medicaid contracts and thus all claims submitted by [Defendants are considered false.\u201d These allegations do not point with specificity to the \u201cwhat, when, or where\u201d of any individual false claim, and therefore do not satisfy Rule 9(b)\u2019s particularity requirements. <em>See Clausen, </em>290 F.3d at 1312 (holding that the \u201cfailure to allege with any specificity if\u2014or when\u2014any actual improper claims were submitted to the Government is indeed fatal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Further, as the district court noted, Relators fail\u2014in all of the counts in the Second Amended Complaint\u2014to specify \u201cthe identity of the person making the misrepresentation\u201d beyond \u201cdefendants.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>193 F.3d at 308. While Relators argue that it is the identity of the corporate actor rather than the natural person that is relevant here, <em>see Bledsoe, </em>501 F.3d at 506, Relators have not pled the identity of the corporate actor with particularity: there are twenty-one corporate and six individual defendants named in the Second Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Relators also argue that count seven, in which Relators allege that Defendants failed to attempt to collect required co-payments from Medicare and Medicaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>patients, meets the requirements of Rule 9(b). Nowhere in this count, though, do Relators allege with specificity that any false claim was submitted. Instead, this count alleges that Defendants \u201croutinely failed to collect ... co-insurance payments,\u201d and that \u201cMedicaid was routinely billed for the poi\u2019tion not paid by other payers\u201d in five different states and Puerto Rico over approximately seven years. These generalized allegations do not come close to satisfying Rule 9(b). Relators, however, suggest that Rule 9(b)\u2019s requirements should be relaxed here because information about individual false claims is \u201cpeculiarly within the perpetrator\u2019s knowledge.\u201d <em>Willard v. Humana Health Plan of Texas Inc., </em>336 F.3d 375, 385 (5th Cir. 2003). We have held that under those circumstances the \u201cRule 9(b) standard is relaxed, and fraud may be pled on information and belief.\u201d <em>Russell, </em>193 F.3d at 308. Even assuming that this relaxed standard should apply here, the allegations in the Second Amended Complaint fail to meet it: Relators do not make, even on information and belief, particularized allegations of any false claim having been submitted. Pleading on information and belief does not otherwise relieve a qui tam plaintiff from the requirements of Rule 9(b). <em>See Karvelas, </em>360 F.3d at 226 (\u201c \u2018[information and belief allegations remain subject to the particularity requirements of Rule 9(b).\u201d); <em>Tuchman v. DSC Commc'ns Corp., </em>14 F.3d 1061, 1068 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cIf the facts pleaded in a complaint are peculiarly within the opposing party\u2019s knowledge, fraud pleadings may be based on information and belief. However, this luxury must not be mistaken for license to base claims of fraud on speculation and conclusory allegations.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Relators also assert that we should relax Rule 9(b)\u2019s requirements with respect to their failure-to-collect-co-insurance allegations because this scheme would have affected thousands of claims. <em>See United States ex rel. Johnson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>183 F.R.D. 204, 206 (E.D.Tex. 1998) (\u201cwhere the fraud allegedly was complex and occurred over a period of time, the requirements of Rule 9(b) are less stringently applied\u201d); <em>United States ex rel. Thompson v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., </em>20 F.Supp.2d 1017, 1049 (S.D.Tex. 1998) <em>(\u201cThompson II </em>\u201d) (holding that Rule 9(b) is satisfied where \u201c[t]he basic framework, procedures, the nature of the fraudulent scheme, and the financial arrangements and inducements among the parties and physicians that give rise to Relator\u2019s belief that fraud has occurred have been alleged with specificity\u201d). While we agree that Rule 9(b) does not require a qui tam plaintiff alleging a long-running scheme involving many false claims \u201cto list every false claim, its dates, [and] the individuals responsible,\u201d <em>Thompson II, </em>20 F.Supp.2d at 1049, the allegedly great extent and complexity of a fraudulent scheme does not excuse a failure to plead at least one false claim with the requisite specificity. As we said in <em>Russell:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">We decline to further relax Rule 9(b) in the context of <em>qui tam </em>suits. The text of the rule provides no justification for doing so. As we observed in reading Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, we are to be practical and strive for simple, direct and clear meanings. We have no license to craft judicial exceptions, and we see no reason to do so here. Furthermore, the False Claims Act grants a right of action to private citizens only if they have independently obtained knowledge of fraud. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(e)(4). With this requirement the government seeks to purchase information it might not otherwise acquire. It must decide on review of the sealed complaint whether to take the case over. A special relaxing of Rule 9(b) is a <em>qui tam </em>plaintiffs ticket to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the discovery process that the statute itself does not contemplate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">193 F.3d at 308-09. The district court did not err in dismissing the Second Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">B. Denial of Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"AFO\"> Relators also challenge the district court\u2019s denial of their combined Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment and Rule 15 motion for leave to amend. \u201cIn this Circuit, when a district court dismisses the complaint, but does not terminate the action altogether, the plaintiff may amend under Rule 15(a) with permission of the district court.\u201d <em>Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., </em>332 F.3d 854, 865 (5th Cir. 2003) (citing <em>Whitaker v. City of Houston, </em>963 F.2d 831, 835 (5th Cir.1992)). \u201cmen a district court dismisses an action and enters a final judgment, however, a plaintiff may request leave to amend only by either appealing the judgment, or seeking to alter or reopen the judgment under Rule 59 or 60.\u201d <em>Rosenzweig, </em>332 F.3d at 865 (citations omitted). Here, the district court concluded that it had dismissed the action, and Relators do not challenge this conclusion in their opening brief. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>426 F.3d 301, 304 n. 2 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cArguments raised for the first time in a reply brief ... are waived.\u201d). Regardless, Relators timely filed a Rule 59(e) motion, and, under these circumstances, the considerations for a motion under Rule 59(e) are the same as those governing a motion under Rule 15(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">Where judgment has been entered on the pleadings, a holding that the trial court should have permitted amendment necessarily implies that judgment on the pleadings was inappropriate and that therefore the motion to vacate should have been granted. Thus the disposition of the plaintiffs motion to vacate under rule 59(e) should be governed by the same considerations controlling the exercise of discretion under rule 15(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIL\"><em>Rosenzweig, </em>332 F.3d at 865 (quoting <em>Dussouy v. Gulf Coast Inv. Corp., </em>660 F.2d 594, 597 n. 1 (5th Cir.1981)). Therefore, \u201cwe review the district court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion, in light of the limited discretion of Rule 15(a).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Rosenzweig, </em>332 F.3d at 865. As noted above, a district court judge\u2019s discretion is not wide enough to permit denial of leave to amend under Rule 15(a) without a substantial reason such as undue delay, repeated failures to cure deficiencies in previous amendments, undue prejudice to the opposing party, or futility. <em>Foman, </em>371 U.S. at 183, 83 S.Ct. 227; <em>Stripling, </em>234 F.3d at 872.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">While there is a strong pull to decide cases on the merits rather than on the sufficiency of the pleadings and \u201cour cases support the premise that granting leave to amend is especially appropriate ... when the trial court has dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim,\u201d <em>Great Plains Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co., </em>313 F.3d 305, 329 (5th Cir.2002) (citation omitted), we have upheld the denial of leave to amend under similar circumstances. Here, the district court noted that the Relators \u201chave previously amended their complaint twice.\u201d In <em>Herrmann </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>Holdings Ltd. v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </em>we found no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s reasoning that \u201calthough plaintiffs should ordinarily be offered an opportunity to amend if it appears that a more carefully drafted complaint might state claims upon which relief could be granted, that course need not be followed here since plaintiffs have already twice amended their complaint.\u201d 302 F.3d 552, 566 (5th Cir. 2002) (citing <em>Jacquez v. Procunier, </em>801 F.2d 789, 793 (5th Cir.1986) (\u201cAt some point a court must decide that a plaintiff has had fair opportunity to make his case; if, after that time, a cause of action has not been established, the court should finally dismiss the suit.\u201d)). Because the plaintiffs had \u201calready filed an original complaint and two amended complaints, each alleging [the same types of claims],\u201d they had been \u201cgiven ample opportunity to plead their statutory claims.\u201d <em>Heyrmann, </em>302 F.3d at 567. In this case, all of Relators\u2019 complaints involved FCA claims, and although Relators argue that their previous amendments, which were not intended to cure deficiencies, should not be grounds for denial of leave to amend, there is no indication that the amendments at issue in <em>Herrmann </em>were so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Further, as was the case in <em>Roseyizweig, </em>Relators here failed to seek leave to amend prior to dismissal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and do not argue that their proposed amendment \u201craised any facts which were not available previous to the district court\u2019s opinion.\u201d 332 F.3d at 865. \u201cWhile leave to amend must be freely given, that generous standard is tempered by the necessary power of a district court to manage a case,\u201d <em>Shivangi v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>825 F.2d 885, 891 (5th Cir.1987), and \u201ca busy district court need not allow itself to be imposed upon by the presentation of theories seriatim,\u201d <em>Rosenzweig, </em>332 F.3d at 865 (quoting <em>Freeman, v. Cont\u2019l </em>Gin <em>Co., </em>381 F.2d 459, 469 (5th Cir.1967)). Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">For the reasons above, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b745-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
