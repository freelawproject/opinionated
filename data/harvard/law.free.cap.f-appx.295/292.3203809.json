Because Saunders has failed to satisfy the standards for the issuance of a COA, we deny his request and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-23\">On May 26, 2004, Saunders pled guilty to receipt and possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A. On November 29, 2004, the district court conducted a sentencing hearing for Saunders. After calculating a total offense level of 25, a criminal history category of I, and a resulting guideline range of 57 to 71 months, the district court imposed a 60-month sentence, to be followed by a 60-month term of supervised release. Saunders did not file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-24\">In 2007, Saunders began filing a series of post-conviction motions. The first of those motions, which alleged the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment of conviction, was construed by the district court as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed as untimely. We denied Saunders application for a COA to appeal the district court\u2019s order. <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>Saunders, </em>248 Fed.Appx. 967, 968 (10th Cir.2007) (unpublished). Saunders then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas petition challenging the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 failure to credit his pretrial release time toward his sentence. The district court denied Saunders\u2019 petition on the merits and we affirmed in an unpublished order and judgment. <em>Saunders v. United States, </em>260 Fed.Appx. 73 (10th Cir.2008). Next Saunders filed a motion in his original criminal case entitled \u201cMotion for Modification of an Imposed Term of Imprisonment 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d In that motion, Saunders again complained that his pretrial release time had not been credited toward his sentence. The district court denied the motion, and Saunders did not appeal that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Saunders\u2019 latest challenge, filed on June 6, 2008, was a \u201cMotion to Reverse and Otherwise, Set Aside Illegal Portion of Sentence.\u201d In that motion, Saunders argued that his 11-month period of pretrial release, combined with his 60-month term of imprisonment, effectively placed him at the top of the 57 to 71-month guideline range calculated by the district court, and thereby rendered the 60-month term of supervised release imposed by the district court unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court concluded that Saunders\u2019 motion, \u201cwhile not styled as such, [wa]s a successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255,\u201d and could not be filed without express authorization from this court. ROA, Vol. 1, Order at 2. The district court ultimately denied the motion, rather than transferring it to this court, because it concluded the motion \u201c[wa]s not only time-barred, but the court ha[d] twice decided th[e] very issue pertaining to [Saunders\u2019] pre-trial ... release, and the Tenth Circuit ha[d] affirmed the decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Saunders has now filed an application for COA with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">The issuance of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to Saunders\u2019 appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). A COA may be issued \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make such a showing, an applicant must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWhen the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">After reviewing Saunders\u2019 application for COA and the record on appeal, we conclude Saunders has failed to establish his entitlement to a COA. To begin with, Saunders\u2019 motion, which was filed approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>mately three and a half years after his conviction and sentence became final, was clearly untimely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f) (outlining one-year limitations period for filing \u00a7 2255 motions). Even if we were to ignore this fatal procedural problem, Saunders, whose conviction and sentence became final before <em>Booker </em>was issued, cannot rely on <em>Booker </em>because we have consistently held that <em>Booker </em>did not announce a new, retroactive rule of constitutional law. <em>E.g., Bey v. United States, </em>399 F.3d 1266, 1268-69 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The application for COA is DENIED and the matter is DISMISSED. Saunders\u2019 motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-16\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-6\">. Although Saunders contends the district court erred in recharacterizing his latest motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion, we agree with the district court\u2019s recharacterization. Further, to the extent the district court failed to notify Saunders about the recharacterization and its potential consequences, we conclude such failure was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
