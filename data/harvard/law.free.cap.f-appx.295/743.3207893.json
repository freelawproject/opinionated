Wellington, Sheriff of Mahoning County, Michael Budd and Frederick White, Deputy Sheriffs for Mahoning County, and Ma-honing County (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d) on Farah\u2019s civil rights action, filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Because the lower court did not err in partially denying Fa-rah\u2019s motion for an extension of time to conduct discovery, and because Farah failed establish that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to his claims against Defendants, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"APQ\">A. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">Farah\u2019s claims arise from events occurring on November 8, 2002, when he was being transported from the Lorain Correctional Institution (\u201cLCI\u201d) in Grafton, Ohio, the facility in which he was incarcerated, to the Mahoning County Courthouse to testify on behalf of the State of Ohio in a criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">In the summer of 2002, before being held at LCI, Farah was incarcerated in the Mahoning County Justice Center (\u201cMCJC\u201d). While imprisoned at MCJC, Farah allegedly overheard Jacob DiCarlo and Michael Kapsouris, both inmates, discussing their participation in a bank robbery and stabbing. Farah and another inmate, David McKee, subsequently agreed to testify as to DiCarlo and Kapsouris\u2019s admissions during their November 2002 Mahoning County criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-16\">Because both Farah and McKee were incarcerated at LCI at the time of trial, Judge Robert Lisotto of the Mahoning Court of Common Pleas issued judgment entries and warrants on November 5, 2002 instructing that the two men be transported from LCI to MCJC, where they would be held until they completed their testimony. Judge Lisotto\u2019s order as to Farah instructed, \u201cWe command you take Daniel Farah ... now confined in Lorain Correction Institute ... and him safely keep in the Mahoning County Justice Center so that you have him before our Common Pleas Courtroom # 2 at the Courthouse in said County, on Friday, November 8, 2002 for further court proceedings in the within case.\u201d (Defs.Supp.App., Doc. 18, Ex. 3.) Additionally, Judge Lisotto\u2019s bailiff sent a November 5, 2002 handwritten memoran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>dum to Sergeant Montero of the Mahoning County Sheriffs office, stating, \u201cDaniel Farah and David McKee are both incarcerated in Lorain Correctional: they are <em>both state witnesses </em>in Ohio vs. Kapsouris &amp; DiCarlo ... <em>If possible, </em>do not keep inmates together when transporting or when held in jail. Any questions, please call.\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>(Id. </em>at Ex. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">On November 7, 2002, officials transported both Farah and McKee from LCI to MCJC in two separate vehicles. Upon their arrival at MCJC, Farah and McKee were booked according to standard procedure, and, as directed by the bailiffs handwritten memorandum, the men were housed separately from DiCarlo, Kapsouris, and each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">On the morning of November 8, 2002, when Farah and McKee were scheduled to testify, Defendant Deputy Sheriff Frederick White was working the \u201cfloat\u201d position at MCJC. Accordingly, White was responsible for gathering inmates from the six floors of MCJC to transport them by elevator to the booking area, where they would be handcuffed or shackled before being transported to the courthouse. Typically, when a court enters a separation order for inmates due to a risk of violence, such an order will be noted on the court \u201cmovement sheet,\u201d to which the float deputy sheriff refers in gathering the inmates. In this case, however, it is undisputed that the movement sheet used by White did not indicate that Farah was a state witness or that he was to be separated from DiCarlo and Kapsouris. Moreover, although Farah asserts that he told White that he was to be kept separate from DiCarlo, there was no court-mandated separation order attached to or noted on the movement sheet for that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">White subsequently gathered all of the inmates listed on his movement sheet, including DiCarlo, and proceeded by elevator to the booking area on the ground floor. As the prisoners exited the elevator on the ground floor, DiCarlo assaulted Fa-rah from behind by striking him twice in the face. Although Farah contends that White took no action to prevent the attack or to restrain DiCarlo, White claims that he \u201cimmediately subdued DiCarlo\u201d and ensured that Farah was given the necessary medical attention for the injuries he suffered to his head, face, and mouth. Farah maintains that due to DiCarlo\u2019s assault, he required approximately 100 stitches in his mouth and can no longer taste or smell.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">B. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Seeking monetary relief, on November 23, 2003, Farah filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas for Mahoning County asserting Eighth Amendment claims of deliberate indifference to his health and safety under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Defendants as well as a personal injury claim against DiCarlo under state law. Defendants removed the case to federal court, and on June 17, 2005, after Farah failed to file a response to Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the district court dismissed all of Farah\u2019s claims without prejudice for failure to prosecute. At the time of the 2005 dismissal, Farah\u2019s third set of attorneys had withdrawn from the case, and Farah had not yet secured alternate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Farah subsequently hired a fourth attorney, and on June 16, 2006, he re-filed his complaint. Defendants answered and filed a motion for summary judgment. Farah filed a \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d the summary judgment motion as premature, or, in the alternative, to obtain an extension of time to conduct discovery and file a memorandum in opposition. Noting that the individual defendants had asserted the defense of qualified immunity, which must be resolved at the earliest possible stage in litigation, the district court denied Farah\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>motion. Granting in part and denying in part Farah\u2019s motion for an extension of time to conduct discovery and file a memorandum in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the court stayed all discovery except for that limited to the issue of qualified immunity and granted Farah an extension of time to file such a memorandum. Farah, however, never conducted discovery on the qualified immunity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">When the parties had fully briefed the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the court granted the motion with regard to Farah\u2019s section 1983 claims and dismissed without prejudice Farah\u2019s personal injury claim against DiCarlo. On April 4, 2007, Farah\u2019s attorney filed a timely notice of appeal as well as a supplemental notice of appeal. This Court dismissed Plaintiffs case for want of prosecution on June 14, 2007, at which point Farah filed an application seeking to proceed <em>in forma pawperis, </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. On July 2, 2007, we granted Fa-rah\u2019s motion to reinstate his appeal, finding that he had cured the default that led us to dismiss the appeal. We consolidated the two appeals for briefing and submission and granted Farah\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AkA\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Clay v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>501 F.3d 695, 700 (6th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">A district court\u2019s election to deny discovery to the nonmoving party before granting summary judgment, however, is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Ross v. Duggan, </em>402 F.3d 575, 581 (6th Cir.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Miami Univ., </em>294 F.3d 797, 815 (6th Cir.2002)). \u201cAn abuse of discretion exists when the reviewing court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Bush v. Rauch, </em>38 F.3d 842, 848 (6th Cir.1994). A district court abuses its discretion by either relying on clearly erroneous findings of fact, improperly applying the law, or employing an erroneous legal standard. <em>Schafer v. City of Defiance Police Dept., </em>529 F.3d 731, 736 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Accordingly, in the instant case, should we find that the district court\u2019s denial of Farah\u2019s request for additional discovery was not an abuse of discretion, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Farah, our task is to ascertain \u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement as to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). The moving party bears the burden to show the absence of any genuine issue of material fact. <em>Plant v. Morton Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>212 F.3d 929, 934 (6th Cir.2000). Once the moving party satisfies its burden, the opposing party must then go beyond its pleadings and \u201cset out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">\n<em>1. The Partial Denial of Farah\u2019s Motion for an Extension of Time to Conduct Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">Farah\u2019s primary contention on appeal is that the district court erred in ruling on Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment before providing him with an opportunity to conduct additional discovery. Our disposition of Farah\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>is governed by the summary judgment standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Under Rule 56(b), \u201c[a] party against whom relief is sought may move <em>at any time, </em>with or without supporting affidavits, for summary judgment on all or part of the claim.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(b) (emphasis added). Rule 56(f), however, entitles the court to deny a motion for summary judgment or order a continuance to enable further discovery when \u201ca party opposing the motion shows by affidavit that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition.\u201d Fed.R.CivJP. 56(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In <em>Ball v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>385 F.3d 713, 719 (6th Cir.2004), this Court affirmed the \u201cwell-established\u201d principle that the plaintiff must receive \u201ca full opportunity to conduct discovery to be able to successfully defeat a motion for summary judgment.\u201d (internal quotations omitted). The <em>Ball </em>court noted, however, that \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to deny further discovery is ... generally unreviewable unless the appellant has filed a Rule 56(f) affidavit or motion that gives the court a chance to rule on the need for additional discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 720 (internal quotations omitted). Even when a party files a Rule 56(f) request, \u201cit is not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the discovery request when the party makes only general and conclusory statements [in its affidavit] regarding the need for more discovery and does not show how an extension of time would have allowed information related to the truth or falsity of [the document] to be discovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Likewise, a district court acts well within its discretion in denying a Rule 56(f) affidavit or motion when the document \u201clacks any details or specificity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Farah\u2019s \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d or, in the alternative, request for an extension of time to conduct discovery and file a memorandum constitutes a request for relief under Rule 56(f). The district court\u2019s partial denial of Farah\u2019s request confirms that the district court acted well within its discretion. Plaintiff states, in support of his request, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">Because of the time sensitive nature of the re-filing, counsel for Plaintiff has only be[en] able to review a limited amount of information relating to this case. There are deposition transcripts that counsel has not yet been able to review, depositions that still need to be taken in this case, as well as other discoverable material that counsel needs to review before any response can be made to Defendants\u2019 motion. Additionally, since this is considered a new case, there needs to be a scheduling order issued and discovery conducted____ To re-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-9\">quire Plaintiffs current counsel to respond within the time required under the Civil Rules without following the pretrial requirements and scheduling timelines for discovery would be unconscionable unreasonable and contrary to the civil and court rules and contrary to the interest of justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">(Joint Appendix, Doc. 3 at 1-2.) This language can be characterized only as \u201cgeneral,\u201d \u201cconclusory,\u201d and \u201claekfing] any details or specificity.\u201d <em>See Ball, </em>385 F.3d at 720. The motion fails to enumerate both the additional information Farah requires to oppose summary judgment and the ways in which such information would relate to Farah\u2019s claims. Moreover, though the district court, rather than denying Farah\u2019s motion in full, allowed him additional time to gather information related to Defendants\u2019 defense of qualified immunity, it is undisputed that Farah failed to undertake such discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">Our conclusion that the district court did not abuse its discretion is further sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>ported by the time-sensitive nature of Defendants\u2019 qualified immunity defense. It is a well-established \u201cpolicy of this circuit ... to resolve immunity questions at the earliest possible stage of litigation.... \u201d <em>Dean v. Byerley, </em>354 F.3d 540, 557 (6th Cir. 2004). Because qualified immunity is a threshold issue, the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the scope of Farah\u2019s Rule 56(f) request for additional discovery to information related to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">\n<em>2. The District Court\u2019s Grant of Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Farah also challenges the district court\u2019s ruling on the merits. Although the majority of Farah\u2019s eleven-page pro se appellate brief focuses on his alleged need for additional discovery, Farah makes one direct reference to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, requesting that we \u201ctake judicial notice ... that ... summary judgment was absolutely premature and may violate [his] civil rights.\u201d (Pl.App. Br. at 5.) Further, despite his briefs ambiguous language, Farah appears to refer to the lower court\u2019s ruling, stating in his \u201cConclusion\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">In the case at bar, the Plaintiff, Daniel Farah suffered a brutal beating at the hands of Jacob DiCarlo, a beating which [sic] not have occurred but for the deliberate indifference and recklessness of Defendants Frederick White, and Ma-honing County failed to practice\u2019s [sic] their procedures who sat idly by and allowed the beating to take place despite being well aware of the imminent danger Farah was in on that elevator, (which) caused major injuries to this plaintiff, by Mahoning County playing a significant role, again causing serious injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\"><em>(Id. </em>at 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Although Farah is a pro se litigant, and we have a corresponding duty to accord him \u201cthe benefit of a liberal construction of [his] pleadings and filings,\u201d <em>Boswell v. Mayer, </em>169 F.3d 384, 387 (6th Cir.1999), \u201cpro se plaintiffs are not automatically entitled to take every case to trial ... [and] the lenient treatment generally accorded to pro se litigants has limits.\u201d <em>Pilgrim v. Littlefield, </em>92 F.3d 413, 416 (6th Cir.1996) (citations omitted) (upholding district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs complaint where pro se plaintiffs were aware of potential deficiencies in their complaint before dismissal and failed to take advantage of the opportunity to remedy those deficiencies). We conclude that Farah\u2019s complete inattention to the merits of Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion represents one such limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">When a party addresses issues in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by any effort at developed argumentation, we deem those arguments to be waived. <em>Langley v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>502 F.3d 475, 483 (6th Cir.2007) (finding that employee waived her challenge to the grant of summary judgment to defendants where counsel \u201chas not addressed the controlling issues\u201d and failed to \u201cdiscuss or cite to the district court\u2019s analysis in any detail\u201d). By failing to provide the Court with any developed argument regarding the merits of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants, Farah abandoned his appeal of that summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Even reviewing Farah\u2019s claims with the liberal construction required for pro se plaintiffs, however, he has failed to present evidence showing a genuine issue for trial. As explained in the district court\u2019s opinion, Farah has not established a genuine issue of material fact regarding Defendants\u2019 qualified immunity defense because he has not shown that he suffered a constitutional violation. <em>See Farah v. Wellington, </em>4:06 CV 1481, 2007 WL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>756687, at *5 (N.D.Ohio Mar. 8, 2007). Farah asserts that the Defendants\u2019 failure to recognize the danger he faced in being transported alongside DiCarlo violated his Eighth Amendment rights. In order to hold a prison official liable for an Eighth Amendment violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the official acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the inmate\u2019s safety. <em>See Watkins v. City of Battle Creek, </em>273 F.3d 682 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). Deliberate indifference is comprised of both an objective and a subjective component. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 835-57, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). The objective component requires that the deprivation alleged be \u201csufficiently serious,\u201d while the subjective component requires a plaintiff to establish that the government officials had a \u201csufficiently culpable state of mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834,114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Though DiCarlo\u2019s assault of Farah satisfies the objective component of the inquiry, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Farah, White did not possess the requisite subjective knowledge that Farah faced a substantial risk to his safety due to DiCarlo\u2019s presence on the elevator. Because there is no dispute that White\u2019s movement sheet had no written instructions that he should keep Farah separate from DiCarlo, White could not have been expected to take additional measures to protect Farah, and no constitutional violation occurred. Therefore, the lower court correctly granted White qualified immunity on Farah\u2019s claim. By extension, Fa-rah\u2019s failure to present facts establishing a constitutional violation also makes appropriate the lower court\u2019s dismissal of Fa-rah\u2019s claim as to Defendants Wellington, Budd, and Mahoning County.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In short, Farah has not set forth any evidence suggesting that Defendants\u2019 failure to act to protect him from DiCarlo\u2019s assault rises to the level of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d required to establish a valid claim for relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. No genuine issue of material fact exists for trial, and the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
