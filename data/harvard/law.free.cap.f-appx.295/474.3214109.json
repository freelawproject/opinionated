We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-17\">Alston challenges the District Court\u2019s findings that he violated the terms of his supervised released by (1) committing three state crimes \u2014 namely, assault with intent to cause serious physical injury in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 120.05(1); assault with intent to cause physical injury by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 120.05(2); and criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.01(2) \u2014 and (2) possessing a dangerous weapon. The District Court\u2019s findings were made pursuant to a preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (\u201cThe court may ... revoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release ... if the court ... finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d); see <em>also United States v. Meeks, </em>25 F.3d 1117, 1123 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201c[T]he government need prove the alleged supervised-release violation only by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). On appeal, \u201cwe review a district court\u2019s finding of a violation of supervised release only for an abuse of discretion and its factual findings for clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>error.\u201d <em>United States v. Carlton, </em>442 F.3d 802, 810 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">We see no error \u2014 much less abuse of discretion \u2014 in the District Court\u2019s determination that Alston violated the terms of his supervised release by stabbing one victim and cutting another, using a knife with a retractable three-and-a-half-inch, serrated blade. With respect to Alston\u2019s argument that the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he intended to cause \u201ca serious physical injury\u201d or a \u201cphysical injury ... by means of a dangerous weapon,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 12 (citing N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 120.05(1), (2)), we disagree. In light of the District Court findings \u2014 about which we see nothing clearly erroneous \u2014 that Alston \u201chad already pulled out the blade before he was shoved by [the stabbing victim],\u201d Order of Sept. 19, 2007, Docket No. 40, at 3, 2007 WL 2746901 (\u201cOrder\u201d), and that one of the wounds he inflicted \u201cwas approximately three inches deep,\u201d required \u201cseveral staples,\u201d and \u201cmissed [the victim\u2019s] kidney by mere inches,\u201d Order at 4, it was far from an abuse of discretion for the District Court to conclude that Alston intended to cause both \u201ca serious physical injury\u201d and a \u201cphysical injury\u201d using \u201ca dangerous weapon\u201d in violation of New York law. For similar reasons, we reject Alston\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s determination that he possessed a dangerous weapon with the intent to use it for an unlawful purpose. That the blade of Alston\u2019s knife had been drawn before he was shoved was adequate to support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that he intended to use the knife against the victims or against others.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Equally without merit is Alston\u2019s contention that a preponderance of the evidence showed that his actions were in self-defense. As the District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">[A]t the time the defendant [Alston] stabbed Kavulak [one of the victims of Alston\u2019s assault], the only physical force used was a shove by Kavulak. As noted, the shove only caused the defendant to move back a few feet. It did not cause the defendant to lose his balance or fall to the ground. The defendant\u2019s response in stabbing Kavulak was unreasonable and was not in response to any threat of deadly physical force to himself or others. Neither the defendant nor anyone else had been injured at that point. Only the defendant had a weapon. The defendant could not have reasonably believed that his life (or the life of another) was in danger. The evidence was also clear that the defendant had other options, most notably, he could have retreated from the escalating argument. The circumstances did not require him to use his knife in order to save himself or anyone else.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Order at 8. We see no basis to disturb the District Court\u2019s factual findings or its legal conclusion that Alston\u2019s conduct constituted a violation of the Penal Law of the State of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">We also disagree with Alston\u2019s argument that the government failed to disprove his justification defense beyond a reasonable doubt. First, as noted above, the government\u2019s burden of proof in supervised-release proceedings is preponderance of the evidence, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Meeks, </em>25 F.3d at 1123. Second, the government proved to the satisfaction of the District Court that (1) Alston \u201chad already pulled out the blade before he was shoved by [the stabbing victim],\u201d Order at 3, (2) Alston \u201chad other options [aside from stabbing and cutting the unarmed victims], most notably, he could have retreated from the escalating argument,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 8, and (3) Alston did not face \u201cany threat of deadly physical force to himself or others,\u201d <em>id. </em>This showing was sufficient to disprove by a prepon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>derance of the evidence Alston\u2019s justification defense. Although the District Court appears to have incorrectly assumed that it was Alston\u2019s burden to prove justification, the evidence so strongly precludes a justification defense that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">We also reject Alston\u2019s contention that the knife he used to stab one victim and cut another is not a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 21. Under New York law, any \u201cinstrument, article or substance, no matter how innocuous it may appear to be when used for its legitimate purpose, <em>becomes </em>a dangerous instrument when it is <em>used </em>in a manner which renders it readily capable of causing serious physical injury.\u201d <em>People v. Carter, </em>53 N.Y.2d 113, 116, 440 N.Y.S.2d 607, 423 N.E.2d 30 (1981); <em>see also People v. Owusu, </em>93 N.Y.2d 398, 401, 690 N.Y.S.2d 863, 712 N.E.2d 1228 (1999) (\u201cThe Penal Law and our jurisprudence have long recognized that how an object is used determines if it is \u2018dangerous.\u2019 \u201d). Our Court also looks to the use made of an object in order to determine whether it is a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Matthews, </em>106 F.3d 1092, 1095 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201c[Vjirtually any object ... can qualify as a dangerous weapon depending on how it is wielded in the circumstances.\u201d). Assuming for the argument that Alston\u2019s knife is nothing more than a \u201cfishing knife,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 21, the use to which he put that knife and the injuries he caused \u2014 for one victim, a three-inch puncture wound in \u201can area where vital organs are located,\u201d Order at 6, and a cut requiring eleven stitches, for another, <em>id. </em>at 7 \u2014 demonstrates that the knife, as wielded by Alston, was a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Because we see no merit in any of Alston\u2019s challenges to the determination of the District Court that he violated the terms of his supervised release, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
