Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005). On September 13, 2004, the court sentenced defendant principally to a term of 135-months\u2019 incarceration following a guilty plea to two counts of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of mixtures containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and 846, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-22\">\u201cIn the <em>post-Booker </em>era, we review sentences for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>517 F.3d 651, 660 (2d Cir.2008). This \u201cinvolves consideration of both the length of the sentence (substantive reasonableness) and the procedures used to arrive at the sentence (procedural reasonableness).\u201d <em>United States v. Canova, </em>485 F.3d 674, 679 (2d Cir.2007). Among other things, a district court \u201cmust make an individualized assessment of the appropriate sentence based on the facts presented and the factors detailed in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>F.3d 163,182 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">A review of the record leaves us uncertain as to whether the District Court fully considered the sizeable disparity between the sentences of defendant and co-defendant Jorge Perez-Campos, who appears to have played a more significant role in the conspiracy but nevertheless received a substantially shorter sentence. We remand the case to the District Court in order for the Court to consider whether resentencing the defendant is appropriate in light of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s axiom that courts should \u201cavoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). We express no opinion on the merits of the Court\u2019s reconsideration of this question or on what sentence it should impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">For the foregoing reasons, this matter is REMANDED to the District Court for proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
