He also appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of relief under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 60(b). It is not entirely clear whether the district court dismissed Carlson\u2019s aceessto-courts claim as frivolous or for failure to state a claim. We affirm on the basis of failure to state a claim. We also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Carlson\u2019s retaliation claim as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-21\">A dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 for failure to state a claim is reviewed under the same de novo standard as a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). Prisoners have a constitutional right to access the courts. <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 821, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number><em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir.1999). However, <em>\u201cBounds </em>did not create an abstract, freestanding right to a law library or legal assistance.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Instead, \u201cmeaningful access to the courts is the touchstone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To prevail on a claim of denial of access to courts, a prisoner must show actual injury. <em>Id. </em>at 349-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174; <em>see also Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Carlson\u2019s allegation that his state case was dismissed as a result of his inability to conduct research in the prison library does not set forth an actual injury for purposes of a denial-of-access-to-courts claim because the right of access to courts does not include the right to litigate all causes of action, but applies only to the opportunity to file non-frivolous challenges to convictions or conditions of confinement. <em>See Lems, </em>518 U.S. at 353 &amp; n. 3, 355, 116 S.Ct. 2174. Carlson has not identified any specific prejudice to any pending or contemplated challenges to his conviction or conditions of confinement. Because Carlson has not identified any actual injury as a result of the denial of access to the law library, he has not stated a claim for which relief can be granted, and the district court did not err in dismissing his denial-of-access-to-courts claim. <em>See Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 351,116 S.Ct. 2174.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">We review a \u00a7 1915 dismissal as frivolous for an abuse of discretion. <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997). The denial of Carlson\u2019s motion for reconsideration, construed as seeking relief under both Rule 59(e) and Rule 60(b), is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Martinez v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 769, 771 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). To the extent that Carlson argues that the defendants denied him access to the law library in retaliation for his litigious activities, conclusional assertions are insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this claim as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Carlson\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Carlson has one prior strike. <em>See Carlson v. Holton, </em>243 Fed. Appx. 49, 50 (5th Cir.2007). Carlson is cautioned that, if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b650-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
