We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing de novo, <em>Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 791-92 (9th Cir.2005), we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Our recent decisions in <em>United States v. Vidal, </em>504 F.3d 1072, 1086 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc), and <em>Navarro-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1063, 1073 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc), held respectively that accessories after the fact are covered by Cal. Vehicle Code \u00a7 10851(a), and that accessory-after-the-fact liability is not necessarily morally turpitudinous. Because \u201c[w]e have before us a record of conviction that is inconclusive\u201d as to the factual predicate for Lopez-Gutierrez\u2019s conviction, <em>see Sandoval-Lua v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 1121, 1132 (9th Cir. 2007), he has established prejudice from prior counsel\u2019s failure to contend that his conviction was not a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Mohammed, </em>400 F.3d at 793-94 (to establish prejudice from ineffective assistance, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cthe performance of counsel was so inadequate that it <em>may </em>have affected the outcome of the proceedings\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). We therefore remand with directions that the BIA grant Lopez-Gutierrez\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">We deny the Attorney General\u2019s request to strike part of the opening brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b909-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
