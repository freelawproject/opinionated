At sentencing, Slaton requested that the district court exercise its authority to impose a sentence that would run concurrent to his undischarged state court sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, but the district court refused to designate the sentence as concurrent or consecutive based on its conclusion that the Bureau of Prisons, not the court, was authorized to make the determination and that \u00a7 5G1.3 did not apply. As imposed, Slaton\u2019s sentence runs consecutive to his state court sentence by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-16\">Having reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that the district court erred in its failure to recognize its authority to impose Slaton\u2019s sentence as running concurrent to his state sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 and in its refusal to consider subparagraph (c) of \u00a7 5G1.3 in fashioning Slaton\u2019s sentence. Under \u00a7 3584, the district court may order multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times to run concurrently. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). In determining whether to impose a concurrent or consecutive sentence, the district court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), which incorporate U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. <em>See United States v. Ballard, </em>6 F.3d 1502, 1505-06 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-17\">Accordingly, we vacate Slaton\u2019s sentence and remand his case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-18\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
