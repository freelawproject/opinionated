Powell\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). The government has moved to dismiss the appeal based on an appeal waiver in Powell\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-21\">We enforce the appeal waiver, because Powell knowingly and voluntarily entered into both the plea agreement and the waiver, the arguments on appeal fall within the scope of the appeal waiver, and no miscarriage of justice would result from enforcing the waiver. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-92 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-22\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues for appeal beyond the scope of the waiver. Accordingly, we grant the government\u2019s motion and dismiss this appeal. We also grant defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on condition that counsel inform appellant about the procedures for filing petitions for rehearing and for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-24\">.
