U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1374 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). We review legal determinations <em>de novo. Li, </em>488 F.3d at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">After reviewing the record, reading the parties\u2019 briefs, and having the benefit of oral argument, we deny the petition for review because, even if Chen were permitted to reopen or to file a successive application independent of a motion to reopen, Chen\u2019s claims fail on the merits. Based on Chen\u2019s testimony and the evidence presented, we conclude that Chen has not shown a well-founded fear of future persecution. Although generally this court should remand asylum eligibility issues to the BIA, <em>see INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355-56, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002), remand is unnecessary where \u201cthe result of a remand to the [BIA] is a foregone conclusion such that remand would amount to nothing more than a mere formality.\u201d <em>Hussain v. Gonzales, </em>477 F.3d 153, 158 (4th Cir.2007), <em>quoted in Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2007) (determining that no remand was required to address on the merits petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration and stating that the petitioner\u2019s \u201carguments offered nothing more than reiteration of her assertions in her [original] motion\u201d that the BIA had already rejected).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">Here, the BIA\u2019s opinion confirms that it did not believe the evidence established a well-founded fear of future persecution. Chen\u2019s successive asylum claim arises from her violation of China\u2019s one-child family planning policy, and the BIA expressly stated that Chen \u201chas not demonstrated that she will be sterilized or otherwise subjected to coercive population control measures due to the birth of three foreign-born children.\u201d Thus, we conclude that this case falls within the rare circumstances making remand unnecessary because even if the BIA were to reopen or to consider the successive application, Chen would not be entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
