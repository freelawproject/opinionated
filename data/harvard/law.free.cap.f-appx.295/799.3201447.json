We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">From at least 1998 to 2004, Mitchell, Lofton and a number of other individuals conspired to buy and sell drugs in the Grand Rapids area. The conspiracy consisted of a largely decentralized web of transactional relationships among the conspirators, ranging from steady streams of sales to individual ad hoc purchases. Although they dabbled in other drugs, the conspirators focused on cocaine: A few of the conspirators regularly purchased large quantities of powder cocaine from outside sources, then resold it to others within the conspiracy, who in turn resold it to other dealers or end-users. Along the way, they converted (or \u201ccook[ed]\u201d) much of the powder into cocaine base (crack). JA 297, 343-44, 355-57, 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">A grand jury indicted Mitchell, Lofton and nine other coconspirators in 2003 and 2004, ultimately charging Mitchell and Lofton with conspiracy both to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute five kilograms of powder cocaine, 50 grams of crack cocaine and an unstated amount of marijuana. Mitchell and Lofton pleaded guilty to the main conspiracy count.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">After hearing a number of Mitchell\u2019s coconspirators testify at his sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Mitchell to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. After holding a separate evidentiary hearing concerning Lofton\u2019s role in the conspiracy, the court sentenced Lofton to 240 months. Mitchell and Lofton each appealed their sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Mitchell challenges the district court\u2019s (1) calculation of the quantity of drugs for which he should be held responsible and (2) enhancement for managing or supervising a conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">Mitchell argues that the district court treated a large portion of the <em>powder </em>cocaine he handled as if it were <em>crack </em>cocaine without sufficient evidence and without articulating any specific \u201cconversion ratio.\u201d Br. at 10. While it is debatable whether Mitchell raised this argument below, we assume (without deciding) that he did preserve it, as it fails on the merits in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Although the vast majority of the cocaine Mitchell sold to other coconspirators remained in powder form at the time of the transactions, the district court properly treated at least some of that powder as crack. The base-offense level for Mitchell\u2019s conspiracy charge hinged on the aggregate amounts of the various drugs attributable to his conduct, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), (c), requiring the district court to \u201capproximate the quantity of the controlled substance[s]\u201d involved in his drug-distribution activities, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 note 12. When making this calculation in the context of \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity,\u201d the guidelines require the district court to look beyond Mitchell\u2019s own actions and take account of \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance\u201d of the conspirators\u2019 operations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). And \u201cit is appropriate to convert powdered cocaine into cocaine base for sentencing purposes, if facts show that an object of the conspiracy was to convert powder to crack.\u201d <em>United States v. Bingham, </em>81 F.3d 617, 628 (6th Cir.1996). As the district court properly recognized, the conspiracy\u2019s primary objective was to make and distribute crack cocaine, making Mitchell responsible for the reasonably foreseeable amounts of crack his coconspirators made and distributed from the powder he sold them.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Mitchell does not dispute the district court\u2019s prerogative to treat powder as crack for calculation purposes. He instead argues that the court did so in a slipshod way. Relying on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Stott, </em>245 F.3d 890 (7th Cir.2001), Mitchell contends that the district court counted nearly all of the powder as crack without adequately identifying which portions of the powder that passed through his hands foreseeably became crack down the line and without determining precisely how much crack each unit of the powder he sold yielded.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">We disagree. In the first place, the district court based its determination of the amounts of powder Mitchell\u2019s customers converted to crack on adequate evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. The government\u2019s witnesses testified to the specific amounts of powder they each purchased from Mitchell. And their accounts established that Mitchell knew each buyer was transforming that powder into crack, and indeed in one instance Mitchell asked his primary supplier how well his powder performed in the crack-cooking process.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">Relying on this testimony and conservatively calculating the amounts involved in each transaction, the district court found Mitchell responsible for 4.710 kilograms of powder, most of which, it found, his customers converted to crack. Not every gram Mitchell sold, the court acknowledged, \u201cwas necessarily turned into crack,\u201d but the vast majority of it was, JA 436, and this amount easily exceeded the threshold amount (1.5 kilograms) required to place Mitchell in the then-highest base-offense bracket, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. 2D1.1(c)(1); <em>cf. Bingham, 81 F.3d </em>at 625-28. Given the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>dence the government presented and the careful analysis the district court undertook, the court\u2019s work did not amount to \u201cimpermissible speculation\u201d or \u201ccalculating] drug amounts by guesswork.\u201d <em>Stott, </em>245 F.3d at 911-12 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. Chisholm, </em>73 F.3d 304, 308 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">In the second place, the district court adequately accounted for the amount of powder lost in the cooking process. Even though Mitchell\u2019s counsel frequently failed to raise the conversion-ratio issue when cross-examining the government\u2019s witnesses, the court itself asked several of Mitchell\u2019s customers about the amount of crack yielded from the purchased powder cocaine. All but one said Mitchell\u2019s powder produced an equal weight of crack, and the one testified that ten ounces of Mitchell\u2019s powder yielded \u201c[n]ine, ten [ounces], something like that.\u201d JA 353. The court nonetheless discounted the <em>entire </em>crack quantity by 10% (from 4.710 kilograms to 4.239 kilograms) to account for any weight lost. Far from being \u201crandom\u201d and \u201carbitrary,\u201d Br. at 12, the court\u2019s ten-to-nine conversion ratio gave Mitchell the benefit of the doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Also unavailing is Mitchell\u2019s argument that the district court improperly applied a 3-level enhancement for his role as a \u201cmanager or supervisor\u201d in the conspiracy. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). To qualify for a \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement, Mitchell \u201cmust have been the ... manager[ ] or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 note 2. The \u201cparticipants\u201d he managed or supervised, importantly, need not have been convicted or even charged so long as they were \u201caware of the criminal objective\u201d and \u201cknowingly offered their assistance.\u201d <em>United States v. Anthony, </em>280 F.3d 694, 698 (6th Cir.2002). Coordinating even a single delivery of drugs via a courier suffices to constitute \u201cmanagement.\u201d <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>233 F.3d 410, 416 (6th Cir.2000); <em>cf. United States v. Rivera, </em>527 F.3d 891, 909 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Mitchell\u2019s activities fall within these requirements. Victoria Vinson, Mitchell\u2019s girlfriend, delivered drugs to others several times at Mitchell\u2019s request. Mitchell also sent others (including Lofton) to make deliveries for him and on at least one occasion arranged for buyers to pick up drugs from his own brother. In responding that he never \u201ccontrolled\u201d or \u201ccoerc[ed]\u201d anyone\u2019s assistance in his drug-trafficking endeavors, Br. at 13-14, Mitchell misapprehends the \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) standard. \u201cSuch control or authority over others [that] is required to impose the four-level enhancement under [\u00a7 ] 3Bl.l(a)\u201d \u2014 which the government sought here but the district court declined to impose \u2014 \u201cis precisely what distinguishes a leader or an organizer under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) from a manager or supervisor under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b),\u201d <em>Rivera, </em>527 F.3d at 908 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>cf. </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 note 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">Lofton argues that the district court (1) made several mistakes in calculating his drug quantities, (2) improperly credited perjured testimony, (3) failed to consider one of his arguments and (4) gave disproportionate weight to his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">In challenging the court\u2019s drug-quantity calculation, Lofton points to three alleged mistakes: it counted as crack 4.5 ounces of powder that Lofton helped another coconspirator purchase; it attributed 765.45 grams of powder to him without any support in the record; and it erred in translating Lofton\u2019s powder cocaine total into equivalent units of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Because Lofton did not preserve these objections in the district court, we review his contention only for plain error, <em>see United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 386 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc), which is fatal to his claim. As Lofton concedes, all three errors taken together made no difference to his guidelines range. That concession by itself establishes that the alleged errors were harmless. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>138 F.3d 257, 268 (6th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Hettinger, </em>242 Fed.Appx. 287, 296 (6th Cir.2007). And that concession necessarily shows that he cannot meet the requirements of plain-error review because it precludes him from showing that the alleged errors affected the outcome of the sentencing proceeding. <em>See United States v. Barnett, </em>398 F.3d 516, 526 (6th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (in establishing plain error, unlike harmless error, \u201c[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice\u201d). All Lofton offers is his own conjecture that a lower drug-quantity finding \u201ccould certainly have affected the court\u2019s decision on sentencing.\u201d Br. at 9. Perhaps. But it is just as plausible that correcting the alleged mistakes would not have affected his sentence, based as it was on the court\u2019s \u201cconservative\u201d drug-quantity estimates, which were far below those recommended by the presentence investigation report. JA 626. \u201cWhere the effect of an alleged error is so uncertain, a defendant cannot meet his burden of showing that the error actually affected his substantial rights.\u201d <em>Jones v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 373, 394-95, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Lofton next argues that the district court relied on the perjured testimony of three witnesses \u2014 Jermaine McGhee, Kengie Gates and Howard Mayfield. McGhee testified that he purchased 4.5 ounces of crack from Lofton three or more times beginning in 1997. But that was not credible, Lofton argues, because McGhee told a grand jury in 2004 that he bought only <em>powder </em>from Lofton. That grand-jury testimony is not in the record, but as McGhee explained at Lofton\u2019s sentencing, he initially purchased crack from Lofton but then switched to powder because Lofton\u2019s crack contained too much cutting agent, a story that appears consistent with the portions of McGhee\u2019s grand-jury testimony read aloud at Lofton\u2019s sentencing. Similarly, McGhee\u2019s various accounts of the amounts of <em>powder </em>he purchased from Lofton, though not identical, hardly present the kinds of \u201cclear[ ]\u201d inconsistencies that compel us to cast aside the district court\u2019s credibility assessment. <em>United States v. Roche, </em>321 F.3d 607, 611 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Lofton\u2019s attack on Gates\u2019 credibility meets the same fate. Lofton tried to impeach Gates\u2019 statement that he sold powder to Lofton in 2003 with prior plea-hearing testimony to the effect that he sold \u201cdrugs\u201d only to a single person, Lorenzo Webb, identified on a list of names given to him. JA 536-37. But the impeachment effort at sentencing lost momentum when Gates himself, after being shown a transcript of his prior testimony, observed that it was unclear (at least from the transcript) what list he had been looking at, and when he clarified that Webb was the only person to whom he had sold <em>crack. </em>On this record, the district court could have disbelieved Gates\u2019 version of events, but its decision to credit his testimony was not so obviously mistaken as to warrant displacing its judgment with our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">The same is true of Mayfield\u2019s credibility. Lofton noted that his presentence investigation report indicated that Mayfield told investigators he regularly purchased <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>crack from Lofton in the second half of 2003 (during part of which he was in custody), undercutting his testimony at Lofton\u2019s sentencing that he bought crack from Lofton in 2002. Mayfield insisted that the report was mistaken, and the prosecutor told the court that Mayfield had raised the same issue the first time he saw the report in a prior meeting with investigators. Here again, the district court did not have to believe Mayfield \u2014 indeed, it did not credit his testimony on a different issue in a prior proceeding \u2014 but Lofton has identified no clear error in crediting his testimony on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Lofton next contends that the district court committed procedural error by failing adequately to consider his argument that it should vary from the 100:1 crack-powder ratio embodied in the guidelines. As a threshold matter, Lofton passed up the most obvious opportunity to object to the inadequate attention the district court gave his argument: When given the chance at the end of the sentencing to raise any objections, Lofton\u2019s counsel neither indicated that the court had failed to address his crack-powder-disparity argument nor asked for further explanation. As a result, Lofton faces plain-error review. <em>See Vonner, </em>516 F.3d at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Lofton, to begin with, overstates the district court\u2019s obligation to address his argument in detail. District courts need not explicitly address every argument a defendant raises at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>510 F.3d 603, 608 (6th Cir.2007). They retain considerable latitude in deciding which arguments to discuss and how much explanation is necessary. So long as \u201c[t]he record makes clear that the sentencing judge listened to each argument,\u201d \u201cconsidered the supporting evidence,\u201d was \u201cfully aware\u201d of the defendant\u2019s circumstances and \u201ctook them into account\u201d in sentencing him, the sentencing court has done its duty. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">As the record reflects, the district court fulfilled its obligation to consider Lofton\u2019s argument that the 100:1 ratio should not apply in his case. After noting that it had read Lofton\u2019s sentencing memorandum in which he raised this argument, the court went on to reject it at the hearing, explaining that the 100:1 ratio reflected a policy judgment about the violence associated with crack, that the ratio had been applied to Lofton\u2019s coconspirators and that the court had been given \u201cno reason not to [apply] it here.\u201d JA 621. At the same time, the court expressly acknowledged its authority to vary from the advisory guidelines\u2019 recommended range. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Lofton next argues that in imposing his sentence, the district court gave disproportionate weight to his prior convictions. The district court calculated Lofton\u2019s criminal-history score to be 15 points, placing him in Category VI. Lofton did not object to this calculation, but he did argue that the district court should depart downward to criminal-history Category V (as the presentence report recommended) on the ground that a substantial number of Lofton\u2019s points (seven of his twelve prior-conviction points) arose from convictions for driving with a suspended (or expired) license, which Lofton said \u201cover-represent[ed] the likelihood of recidivism,\u201d JA 473. Although he concedes that the guidelines calculations in this respect were accurate, he maintains that the resulting sentence was unreasonable. While we do not generally review a district court\u2019s decision not to grant a downward departure where the district court appreciated its discretion to do so, we do assess the reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>of the resulting sentence. <em>See United States v. Heath, 525 </em>F.3d 451, 459 (6th Cir.2008). And because Lofton\u2019s 240-month sentence fell within the advisory guidelines range, it is entitled on appeal to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Duane, </em>533 F.3d 441, 453 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Lofton offers nothing meaningful to rebut that presumption. Nor does the record suggest the district court abused its discretion in determining his final sentence. The court took account of the serious nature of the drug-trafficking conspiracy and Lofton\u2019s role in it, the need for adequate punishment and the need to avoid serious sentencing disparities with other similar defendants. And with respect to Lofton\u2019s criminal history (which the district court described as \u201coutrageous,\u201d JA 611), the court noted that although a number of his prior convictions were for driving-license-related offenses, he had several other convictions that resulted in no points \u2014 to say nothing of a number of other charges that were dismissed in exchange for guilty pleas. These prior convictions, the court noted, \u201cshow a scofflaw attitude,\u201d as they reflect \u201crepeated violations of the same nature, which are the easiest ones to change.\u201d JA 613. Lofton gives us no reason to reject this conclusion or any other aspect of the district court\u2019s assessment, and in the end \u201cwe simply cannot say that [his] special circumstances are special enough that, in light of \u00a7 3553(a), they require a sentence lower than the sentence the Guidelines provide.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2470.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
