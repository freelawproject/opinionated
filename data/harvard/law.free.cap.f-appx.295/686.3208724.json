Varma unwittingly coordinated the smuggling with undercover agents from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. After extensive communicating and coordinating with the undercover agents, Varma arrived with eight illegal aliens in Houston, Texas, where he and the aliens were arrested. Varma pleaded guilty to encouraging and inducing an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States for commercial advantage and private financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(A)(iv), (a)(l)(B)(I) (2005). On appeal, Varma argues that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on his role as a leader or organizer under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (2007). Varma contends that he had no power to negotiate smuggling prices and that his role was merely that of a \u201csteerer\u201d \u2014 someone who brings together smugglers and people who want to illegally enter the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>We review the district court\u2019s sentencing decision for \u201creasonableness,\u201d applying the abuse-of-diseretion standard. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Guidelines, and we review its factual findings for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Guideline \u00a7 3B 1.1(a) provides for a four-level increase in the base offense level where \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). To qualify for an adjustment under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), the defendant must have been the organizer or leader of one or more other participants. <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In determining whether the defendant held an organizational or leadership role, relevant factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeaK\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 263 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 4). When making factual determinations concerning an increase to an offense level, the district court may rely on the information in the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) \u201cso long as the information has \u2018some minimum indicium of reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Shipley, </em>963 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Vela, </em>927 F.2d 197, 201 (5th Cir.1991)). The defendant must present rebuttal evidence to demonstrate that the information contained in the PSR is \u201c \u2018materially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>480 F.3d 309, 320 (5th Cir. 2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Carbajal, </em>290 F.3d 277, 287 (5th Cir.2002)). \u201cMere objections do not suffice as competent rebuttal evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Parker, </em>133 F.3d 322, 329 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">We hold that the district court did not err by determining that Varma was a leader or organizer of the smuggling enterprise at issue and applying the \u00a7 3B1.1 four-level sentence enhancement. The PSR indicated that Varma\u2019s smuggling enterprise was international in scope, reaching countries including, but not limited to, India, Thailand, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Curacao, Guyana, Suriname, Canada, England, and the United States. The PSR stated that Varma was the smuggling operation\u2019s \u201cSuriname-based lieutenant\u201d before 2005, when Varma shifted his base of operation to the Dominican Republic. Varma organized the individuals to be smuggled, he provided passports to undercover agents for the individuals who were to be smuggled, and he controlled the transfer of the \u201csmuggling fees.\u201d Varma ensured that his \u201ccontacts\u201d were in place at originating airports where the individuals were to be smuggled, and he arranged for airline tickets to be processed in the aliens\u2019 names. By his own admission, Var-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ma had at least one individual working directly for him (Collin Billingly, who transported Varma\u2019s alien \u201cpackages\u201d), and another individual (\u201cMukesh Last Name Unknown\u201d) met with undercover agents on Varma\u2019s behalf, acting as an intermediary and a translator.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">It was Varma\u2019s burden to rebut this evidence as \u201cmaterially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable,\u201d <em>see Washington, </em>480 F.3d at 320, but he has failed to meet that burden. Varma introduced no evidence to refute the facts in the PSR; rather, he argued that those facts were unsupported by sufficient evidence. As noted above, mere objections to the facts do not suffice as competent rebuttal evidence. <em>Parker, </em>133 F.3d at 329. Absent competent rebuttal evidence from Varma, the facts from the PSR as adopted by the district court are not clearly erroneous and support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Varma had an organizational or leadership role in the smuggling enterprise at issue. Accordingly, the district court correctly enhanced Varma\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\">. Varma also objected in the district court to the number of aliens attributed to him as this resulted in a three-level increase to his sentence. Varma does not, however, raise this objection on appeal, and therefore it is waived. See Fed. R.App. P. 28(a); <em>United States v. Jimenez, 509 </em>F.3d 682, 693 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied,</em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2924, 171 L.Ed.2d 856 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\">. Citing cases from other circuits, Varma contends that \u201csupervision of one person does not support an enhancement for a supervisor, much less a leader or organizer.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>324 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir. 2003); <em>United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.2002). However, these cases do not stand for that proposition. <em>Burgos </em>states the opposite: \u201cIt is enough to manage or supervise a single other participant.\u201d 324 F.3d at 93 (addressing the three-level enhancement for manager/supervisor). <em>Sayles </em>turns on a lack of evidence of control over anyone. 296 F.3d at 225-26, 227. The Guidelines comment itself makes clear that being an organizer or leader of one participant is sufficient. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 2. Var-ma's counsel, therefore, is reminded of her ethical obligation not to misrepresent authority to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
