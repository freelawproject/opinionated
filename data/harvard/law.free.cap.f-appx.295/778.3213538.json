He argues the district court erred in finding a three-level enhancement for his role in the offense, that the 100:1 ratio of cocaine base to powder cocaine constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, that the district court ignored the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors, and that the district court erred in finding a base offense level of 36. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b805-18\">In 2002, Garrett and nine co-defendants were indicted for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine, cocaine base, and marijuana. The jury found Garrett guilty and made a special finding that he was involved with five or more kilograms of cocaine and 50 or more grams of cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-19\">The Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) recommended a base offense level of 38. It also recommended adding one level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.2 for selling drugs within 1,000 yards of a school, and adding four levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) because Garrett was an organizer or leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-20\">At the original sentencing, the district court found Garrett had a base offense level of 38. The court increased the base offense level by one level pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) and by three levels pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) because Garrett was a manager or supervisor, but it failed to make specific findings supporting this enhancement. It determined Garrett\u2019s sentencing range to be 360 months\u2019 imprisonment to life imprisonment, and sentenced Garrett to 349 months\u2019 imprisonment after subtracting 11 months for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-21\">On appeal, this court affirmed Garrett\u2019s conviction but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Martinez, 430 F.3d </em>317, 340-41 (6th Cir.2005). We ruled that a level could not be added to Garrett\u2019s offense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.2 without a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860, and that the trial court increased Garrett\u2019s offense level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>based on higher drug quantities than were found by the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">At the 2006 resentencing, Garrett argued that a base offense level of 32 was appropriate. Garrett also asked the court to adopt a 10:1 cocaine base to cocaine ratio rather than the 100:1 ratio recommended by the 2006 Guidelines. The court found \u201cthat the drug quantities set forth in the [PSI] justify a determination of a level 36.\u201d It increased Garrett\u2019s offense level by three levels pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), again without making specific findings supporting the enhancement. It found a total offense level of 42, which resulted in a Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. It sentenced Garrett to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, which included a credit for 11 months served in state custody for a related crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">A. The District Court\u2019s Finding of a Three-Level Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">At neither sentencing did the district court articulate specific findings in support of the USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(b) enhancement. However, \u201cthe failure to specify the factual basis for applying a \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement \u2018is not grounds for vacating the sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vandeberg, </em>201 F.3d 805, 809-10 (6th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>59 F.3d 36, 39 (6th Cir.1995)). When the district court fails to make factual findings, we review de novo the decision to apply the enhancement, <em>id. </em>at 810-11 &amp; n. 2, and affirm if the enhancement is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>323 F.3d 480, 491 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">There is no question that the criminal activity involved at least five people. The record indicates that Garrett had a role in planning and orchestrating the San-dusky-based portion of the conspiracy by procuring large quantities of cocaine from Toledo and Detroit and importing it to Sandusky. Garrett brought other San-dusky-based dealers to his suppliers and ensured that those interested in joining the conspiracy were able to do so. Garrett \u201cexercised management responsibility over the property ... of [the] criminal organization.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt., n. 2. He made the decision to sell half of the cocaine in powder form and to \u201ccook\u201d the other half into cocaine base, which he did himself. Thus, the evidence supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Garrett was a manager or supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">B. Cruel and Unusual Punishment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Garrett argues the 100:1 cocaine base/cocaine ratio embodied in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (b)(1)(B)(ii) constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. This court has considered and rejected this argument. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Washington, </em>127 F.3d 510, 516 (6th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>73 F.3d 1414, 1417-18 (6th Cir. 1996). These published opinions are controlling, and we therefore reject that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">C. The 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">Garrett argues his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to address his sentencing memorandum and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. The district court considered the Guidelines\u2019 range \u2014 indeed, it sentenced below that range, considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553, explained its reasoning sufficiently to allow for appellate review, and \u201cset forth enough facts to satisfy this court that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Vowell, </em>516 F.3d 503, 510 (6th Cir.2008). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>D. The District Court\u2019s Drug-Quantity Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">A district court\u2019s drug-quantity determination is a factual finding reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Jeross, </em>521 F.3d 562, 570 (6th Cir.2008). There is no requirement that the district court\u2019s determination be exact, but a preponderance of the evidence must support the conclusion. <em>Id. </em>The district court found Garrett\u2019s base offense level was 36. Under the 2006 Guidelines, a base offense level of 36 correlates to at least 50 kilograms but less that 150 kilograms of cocaine and at least 500 grams but less than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 (2006). The district court based its drug-quantity determination at least in part on the cocaine base Garrett possessed or distributed. A preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that Garrett acquired at least 500 grams of cocaine base. Eddie Thomas testified that he sold between 20 and 40 kilograms of cocaine to Garrett, half of which Garrett cooked into cocaine base. Terrence Chapman testified that he sold Garrett between 15 and 20 kilograms of cocaine, half of which Garrett cooked into cocaine base. Shawn Gray testified that he and Garrett purchased between 50 and 60 kilograms of cocaine, half of which was cooked into cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Garrett\u2019s chief complaint is that the court\u2019s drug-quantity determination is based on witness approximations. However, \u201c \u2018[approximations are completely appropriate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jeross, </em>521 F.3d at 570 (quoting <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>227 F.3d 686, 699 (6th Cir.2000)). And the court explicitly found the testimony reliable because of its consistency. Thus, a conservative estimate based on the testimony supports the court\u2019s determination that Garrett was involved with at least 500 grams of cocaine base. <em>See Hernandez, </em>227 F.3d at 699 (holding approximations are appropriate \u201cas long as they err on the side of caution\u201d). Half of 20 kilograms\u2014 the low end of Thomas\u2019 estimation \u2014 and half of 15 kilograms \u2014 the low end of Chat-man\u2019s estimation \u2014 equals 17.5 kilograms of cocaine base. Accordingly, the court\u2019s drug-quantity determination is not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">. Although we find no error in the district court\u2019s actions, Johnson may still move the district court to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the retroactive amendment to the Guidelines that reduces penalties for crack cocaine offenses. See USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
