We DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-22\">Ramos does not dispute the BIA\u2019s determination that he is inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B). Instead, he argues that the BIA erred in reversing the immigration judge\u2019s (I J) cancellation of removal under Section 1229b(b)(l) based on the hardship that Ramos\u2019s removal would cause his nine-year-old son. This court\u2019s jurisdiction over petitions for review filed by aliens with criminal convictions is limited. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). We have jurisdiction in this case because the BIA\u2019s interpretation of Sections 1182 and 1229b(b)(l) is purely a question of law. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-23\">When Congress expresses unambiguous intent on an issue, this court gives effect to that intent when it reviews the BIA\u2019s construction of immigration statutes. <em>White v. INS, </em>75 F.3d 213, 215 (5th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)). If a statute leaves ambiguity, we defer to an agency interpretation that is based on a reasonable statutory construction but reject one that is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-24\">The Attorney General has statutory authority to cancel an order of removal and grant permanent resident status to an inadmissible or deportable alien who has been physically present in the United States for ten years if his or her removal would result in \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to a spouse, parent, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>child who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). Among the eligibility requirements for cancellation of removal, the alien must not have been convicted of certain offenses, including \u201can offense under section 1182(a)(2), 1227(a)(2), or 1227(a)(3) of this title.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(B). It is the first listed statute that is relevant here. Particularly relevant is that it contains two subsections, as we explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Section 1182(a)(2)(A) provides that, with certain exceptions, an alien who commits \u201ca crime involving moral turpitude\u201d or \u201ca violation of ... any law or regulation ... relating to a controlled substance offense\u201d is inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A). No evidence supports a finding that Ramos is inadmissible under that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The next subsection is the one that was applied here. It provides that an alien is inadmissible if he has been</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOQ\">convicted of 2 or more offenses (other than purely political offenses), regardless of whether the conviction was in a single trial or whether the offenses arose from a single scheme of misconduct and regardless of whether the offenses involved moral turpitude ... [if] the aggregate sentences to confinement were 5 years or more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(B). It is undisputed that the aggregate sentences for Ramos\u2019s convictions exceed five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The BIA concluded that Section 1182(a)(2)(B) made Ramos inadmissible due to his multiple convictions. Thus, he was ineligible for cancellation of removal under Section 1229b(b). <em>See In re Garcia-Hernandez, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 590, 594 (2003). The BIA rejected Ramos\u2019s argument that the reference in Section 1229b(b) to all of Section 1182(a)(2) was a clerical error. Ramos argued that Congress intended to refer only to the crimes described in Section 1182(a)(2)(A) because those were crimes of moral turpitude or involving controlled substances. In part, that argument is based on another statutory provision that an alien must have \u201cgood moral character\u201d in order to have cancellation of his removal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(B). However, Congress has twice amended Section 1229b(b)(l)(C) without changing the statutory reference that Ramos alleges is erroneous. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(C) (West Supp.2008). Relying in part on that apparent acceptance of the provision by Congress, the BIA interpreted Section 1229b(b) to bar the cancellation of the removal of an alien who has been convicted of multiple offenses with an aggregate sentence of five years or more under Section 1182(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">We defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of these statutes because the agency\u2019s construction of the arguably ambiguous statutory language is reasonable. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <em>see also Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 279 (5th Cir.2001) (accepting that reference to \u201ca criminal offense\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) was applicable to Section 1182(a)(2)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Accordingly, Ramos\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b759-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
