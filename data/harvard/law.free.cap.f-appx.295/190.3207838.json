He argues that the search of his laptop computer at the border violated the Fourth Amendment because it lacked reasonable suspicion. He further argues that evidence is not sufficient to support his convictions under counts I and III. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The parties are familiar with the facts. We address the law. Singh\u2019s argument that the border officer needed reasonable suspicion to search his laptop computer is squarely foreclosed by <em>United States v. Arnold, </em>533 F.3d 1003 (9th Cir. 2008). There, we held that searches of the defendant\u2019s computer hard drive at the border, like searches of other property, did not require reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Arnold </em>aside, the government had reasonable suspicion to search Singh\u2019s computer. The search of his vehicle, which he does not appeal, yielded materials that caused the border officers to suspect that Singh might be involved in on-going fraud relating to immigration documents facilitated by his use of the computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Evidence is sufficient to support Singh\u2019s convictions under counts I and III. Viewed \u201cin the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt that Singh knowingly created fraudulent resident alien cards in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a) and knowingly possessed a document-making implement or authentication feature with the intent to use the implement to make false identification documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(5). <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 641-42 (9th Cir.2002). Singh\u2019s convictions are therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b216-32\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
