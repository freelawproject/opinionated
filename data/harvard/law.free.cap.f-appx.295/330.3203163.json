On appeal, Conine argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to timely move for a mistrial after his codefendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s demonstration at trial, involving shaking a doll violently, establishes cause for his procedurally defaulted claims. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-23\">Conine\u2019s original <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition raised four ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The one at issue here is that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to contemporaneously object to and move immediately for mistrial after the doll demonstration. In his amended petition, Co-nine raised only two claims, neither of which asserted ineffective assistance of counsel. The court noted that Conine had raised only two claims of trial court error in the amended petition, and it ordered Conine to inform it whether Conine intended to abandon the four ineffective assistance claims contained in his original \u00a7 2254 petition. Conine responded that he \u201cwishe[d] to affirmatively proceed in this habeas action only with the presentation of his two trial court error claims raised in the amended petition and to abandon the four [ineffective assistance of counsel] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>claims originally presented.\u201d Conine further stated that he had reviewed the direct appeal documents and \u201cascertained that his counsel was not ineffective because he <em>did </em>file a motion to sever which would have prevented this prejudicial demonstration by codefendant\u2019s counsel, and that counsel <em>did </em>object and request a mistrial in a timely manner, therefore altering the presentation of these issues and their presentation to this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The district court found that the claims in Conine\u2019s amended \u00a7 2254 petition were timely because they related back to the claims Conine raised in his initial \u00a7 2254 petition. However, the court found that Conine\u2019s federal constitutional claims in his amended petition were procedurally barred because Conine failed to raise the claims on direct appeal in the state court. Specifically, the court determined that Co-nine faded to cite any federal cases or refer to the United States Constitution in his initial brief on direct appeal. The court denied Conine\u2019s amended petition and dismissed the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The district court construed Conine\u2019s subsequent notice of appeal as an application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), which it denied. We issued the following amended COA: \u2018Whether trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance constituted cause and prejudice, allowing appellant to proceed on his procedurally defaulted claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). A district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas claim for procedural default is also reviewed <em>de novo. Fortenberry v. Haley, </em>297 F.3d 1213, 1219 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\"><em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we show leniency to <em>pro se </em>litigants, but we will not serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel or rewrite a pleading in order to sustain an action. <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). Further, \u201ca legal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\u201cBefore a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner, the prisoner must exhaust his remedies in state court.\u201d <em>O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 842, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 1731, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999). Failure to do so may result in the claim being procedurally defaulted. <em>See Collier v. Jones, </em>910 F.2d 770, 772 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201c[Wjhen a petitioner has failed to present a claim to the state courts and under state procedural rules the claim has become procedurally defaulted, the claim will be considered procedurally defaulted in federal court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">\u201c[A] procedurally defaulted ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim can serve as cause to excuse the procedural default of another habeas claim only if the habeas petitioner can satisfy the \u2018cause <em>and </em>prejudice\u2019 standard with respect to the ineffective-assistance claim itself.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Carpenter, </em>529 U.S. 446, 451, 120 S.Ct. 1587, 1591, 146 L.Ed.2d 518 (2000) (emphasis added). In other words, \u201ca prisoner [is required] to demonstrate cause for his state-court default of <em>any </em>federal claim, and prejudice therefrom, before the federal habeas court will consider the merits of that claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The Supreme Court has noted that the one exception to that rule \u201cis the circumstance in which the habeas petitioner can demonstrate a sufficient probability that [ ] failure to review his federal claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Initially, neither party challenges the district court\u2019s finding that Conine had proeedurally defaulted the two claims he raised in his amended \u00a7 2254 petition because Conine failed to raise the federal-related claims in state court. Instead, Co-nine claims on appeal that his proeedurally defaulted claims raised in his amended petition should be excused because his trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness constitutes cause and resulting prejudice. However, construing his pro se brief liberally, Conine does not assert that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the federal-related claims in state court. Instead, he argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to timely move for a mistrial after his codefendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s doll demonstration. However, Conine affirmatively abandoned this claim in the district court, and we will not consider it in the first instance. See <em>Depree v. Thomas, </em>946 F.2d 784, 793 (11th Cir.1991) (stating that \u201can issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d); see also <em>United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997) (noting that \u201c[i]t is \u2018a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party-\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Moreover, Co-nine has abandoned on appeal any argument that cause exists based upon his trial counsel\u2019s failure to \u201cfederalize\u201d his claims in state court by his failure to raise it in his brief. <em>See Access Now, Inc., </em>385 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">It is worth noting, however, that, even if the issue of trial counsel\u2019s failure to timely file a motion for a mistrial were properly before us, Conine\u2019s argument that he has demonstrated cause such to excuse his proeedurally defaulted federal claims is meritless in light of Conine\u2019s own admissions that his trial counsel actually did file a timely motion to sever. Conine\u2019s claim further fails because whether or not his trial counsel timely moved for a mistrial does not establish cause to excuse his procedurally defaulted claims. In other words, by the argument raised in his brief, Conine has not demonstrated cause for his failure to raise his federal-related claims in state court. <em>See Edwards, </em>529 U.S. at 451, 120 S.Ct. at 1591. Further, Conine has not shown a fundamental miscarriage of justice that would permit us to consider the merits of his proeedurally defaulted claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">In light of the foregoing, the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
