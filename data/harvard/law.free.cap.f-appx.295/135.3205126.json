We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of petitioner\u2019s motions. San<em>doval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (motion to continue); <em>de Jesus Melendez v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1019, 1023 (9th Cir. 2007) (motion to remand). We review de novo due process claims. <em>Sandoval-Luna, </em>526 F.3d at 1246. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-25\">The IJ did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion to continue because the IJ had previously granted several continuances and the petitioner was not statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1247 (denial of motion to contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ue was not abuse of discretion where prior continuances were granted and alien was not immediately eligible for relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand because the petitioner did not offer any hardship evidence to establish his eligibility for cancellation of removal. <em>See INS v. Wang, </em>450 U.S. 139, 145, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981) (per curiam) (requiring applicant to show prima facie eligibility for the underlying substantive relief requested). It follows that petitioner has not established a due process violation. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cTo prevail on a due process challenge ... [a petitioner] must show error and substantial prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b161-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
