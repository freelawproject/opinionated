The district court imposed a sentence of 115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Spence argues that the district court erred by granting the government\u2019s motion in limine and precluding Silver from introducing evidence of the fact that one of the arresting officers had recently been convicted of the misdemeanor offense of driving under the influence. He argues that the officer\u2019s disregard for the law he swore to uphold showed that the officer would disrespect the oath to testify truthfully. Silver also contends that the officer\u2019s credibility was a crucial issue in his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and joint appendix and find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that the officer\u2019s DUI conviction was not relevant to his truthfulness, and therefore was not admissible to impeach the officer\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the motion in limine, and also affirm Silver\u2019s conviction for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Silver, </em>No. 4:07-cr-00025-RBS-JEB-l (E.D. Va. dated Oct. 11, 2007; entered Oct. 12, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">_</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
