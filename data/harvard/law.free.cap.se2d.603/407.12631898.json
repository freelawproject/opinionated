Jackson, and Rosewood Investments, L.L.C., (collectively \"defendants\") appeal from a 16 June 2003 order of the Cumberland County Superior Court requiring them to specifically perform the terms of a settlement agreement with Rudolph Leonard Baxley, Jr., (\"plaintiff\") and sanctioning them with attorney fees incurred by plaintiff in enforcing the agreement. Defendants, however, have not properly assigned errorto the order from which appeal is taken. The record on appeal includes only one assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   The Trial Court erred in entering the Order dated June 16, 2003 awarding relief to Plaintiff-Appellee in response to his Motion for Order to Show Cause and Motion in the Cause. (R p 00054).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Each assignment of error shall, so far as practicable, be confined to a single issue of law; and\n   <em>\n    shall state plainly, concisely and without argumentation the legal basis upon which error is assigned.\n   </em>\n   \" N.C. R. App. P. 10(c)(1) (emphasis added). Our Rules of Appellate Procedure include an appendix which illustrates the proper way to draft an assignment of error, including the following three examples of assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. The court's admission of the testimony of the witness E.F.,\n   <em>\n    on the ground that\n   </em>\n   the testimony was hearsay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. The court's denial of the defendant's motion for directed verdict at the conclusion of all the evidence,\n   <em>\n    on the ground that\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's evidence as a matter of law established his contributory negligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. The court's instructions to the jury, R., pp. 50-51, as bracketed, explaining the doctrine of last clear chance,\n   <em>\n    on the ground that\n   </em>\n   the doctrine was not correctly explained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   N.C. R. App. P. appx. C, tbl. 4, pt. B (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[T]he scope of review on appeal is confined to a consideration of those assignments of error set out in the record on appeal in accordance with . . . Rule 10.\" N.C. R. App. P. 10(a). \"Our courts have been clear to articulate that absent a specific legal basis, an assignment of error is deemed abandoned. The legal basis need not be particularly polished; it need only put the appellee and this Court on notice of the legal issues that willbe contested on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins v.
