He primarily argues on appeal that he received ineffective assistance of counsel (\"IAC\") when (1) his attorney called an alleged co-conspirator as a witness; and (2) his attorney failed to request that the jury be instructed on identification and alibi. Because we cannot decide the merits of defendant's first IAC claim based solely on the existing record, wedismiss that claim without prejudice to the filing of a motion for appropriate relief in the superior court. As to defendant's second IAC claim, we hold that defendant has failed to demonstrate prejudice from any lapse of his counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show the following. DeShawn Hendricks testified that he and defendant talked about robbing a Citgo convenience store. According to Hendricks, the plan required that defendant and Hendricks would wait behind the convenience store while Jimmy Lee Fletcher went inside and visited Marquita Henryhand, a clerk who worked there and whom Fletcher knew. Fletcher's role was to persuade Henryhand to step out of the bulletproof booth where the cash register was located and then signal defendant and Hendricks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At about 1:45 a.m. on 3 August 2001, Fletcher went to the convenience store where Henryhand was tending the register behind the store's locked, bullet-proof cubicle. While visiting with Henryhand, Fletcher also talked on his cellular telephone with defendant and Hendricks, who were waiting behind the store for Fletcher's signal. At some point during Fletcher's conversation with Hendricks, the two agreed that the signal would be for Fletcher to ask Henryhand for a hug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At about 2:00 a.m., Fletcher asked Henryhand to step out ofthe cubicle to give him a hug before he left. Approximately three seconds after Henryhand exited the cubicle, defendant and Hendricks rushed into the store. Their faces were covered and they held handguns. Defendant held his gun on Fletcher while Hendricks demanded money from Henryhand. Henryhand gave Hendricks $790 and he and defendant left the store. Henryhand locked herself and Fletcher in the store and called the police to report the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After an investigation, police charged defendant, Fletcher, and Hendricks with robbery with a dangerous weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. At defendant's first trial in June 2002, both Hendricks and Fletcher testified. A mistrial was declared on 13 June 2002 after the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At a second trial in September 2002, Hendricks again testified for the State regarding defendant's participation in the robbery. In addition, the State presented the store's surveillance videotape of the robbery and the testimony of two witnesses identifying defendant's voice on that videotape. The State also introduced defendant's cellular telephone records, reflecting numerous calls to and from Fletcher's cellular telephone during the pertinent time frame, including eight calls of brief duration between 1:45 a.m. and 2:07 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant presented three witnesses. Defendant's fathertestified that his son lived with him and was at home when the robbery occurred. Fletcher, however, corroborated fully Hendricks' testimony regarding the robbery and defendant's participation in the robbery. A third witness attacked Hendricks' credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The jury found defendant guilty of both robbery with a dangerous weapon and conspiracy to commit that offense. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences of 103 months to 133 months on the robbery charge and 34 months to 50 months on the conspiracy charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    IAC Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant first contends his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated when his attorney called Fletcher to testify. In order to prevail on an IAC claim,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [f]irst, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \"counsel\" guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ct. 2332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). As the Supreme Court explained, \"[t]his rule is consistent with the general principle that, on direct appeal, the reviewing court ordinarily limits its review to material included in `the record on appeal and the verbatim transcript of proceedings, if one is designated.'\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20S.%20Ct.%202332\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20S.E.2d%20500\">\n    557 S.E.2d at 524-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting N.C.R. App. P. 9(a)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Our examination of the record reveals that defendant's first IAC claim cannot be decided without further factual development. We cannot resolve on this record what defense counsel knew regarding Fletcher's likely testimony or whether defense counsel had a purpose or strategy in presenting Fletcher's testimony. Although defendant urges us to assume that defense counsel should have known Fletcher's testimony would be adverse to defendant, the fact that Fletcher testified in the first trial, the first trial ended in a mistrial, and the State declined to call Fletcher as a witness in the second trial could suggest the opposite. Since therecord contains no indication of the nature of Fletcher's testimony in the first trial or any other evidence regarding whether defense counsel should, through other means, have known that Fletcher would testify adversely, we cannot on direct review decide the merits of this IAC claim. Factual issues exist that must be more fully developed before a proper review of defendant's IAC claim may be undertaken. Accordingly, we dismiss this assignment of error without prejudice to defendant's asserting it in a motion for appropriate relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 167,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20S.E.2d%20500\">\n    557 S.E.2d at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]hould the reviewing court determine that IAC claims have been prematurely asserted on direct appeal, it shall dismiss those claims without prejudice to the defendant's right to reassert them during a subsequent MAR proceeding.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In a second IAC claim, defendant challenges his attorney's failure to request jury instructions on identification and the defense of alibi. Although a defendant must prove both prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test - ineffectiveness and prejudice - \"if a reviewing court can determine at the outset that there is no reasonable probability that in the absence of counsel's alleged errors the result of the proceeding would have been different, then the court need not determine whether counsel's performance was actually deficient.\"\n   <em>\n    Braswell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4753359\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/312/553/#p562\">\n    312 N.C. at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20S.E.2d%20241\">\n    324 S.E.2d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The trial court did not, therefore, err in declining to dismiss the charges against defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Judges HUNTER and ELMORE concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
