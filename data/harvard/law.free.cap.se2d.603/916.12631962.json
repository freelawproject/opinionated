On July 9, 2001, the plaintiff, Ingrid H. Cowan, placed her mother, Ruth D. Hazelwood (the decedent), in Harbor House, a residential facility that provides temporary care for very ill persons when their primary caregiver seeks respite. Harbor House is operated by the defendant, Hospice Support Care, Inc. (Hospice), \"a non-profit, non-medical volunteer hospice support corporation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The decedent was bedridden and required the assistance of two persons to move her from her bed to a bedside commode. During the decedent's first night at Harbor House, a single volunteer lifted her from the bed. When the decedent's right leg became \"caught\" in the bed, the volunteer heard a loud \"popping-cracking\" noise in the leg. That evening, and for the remainder of the decedent's week-long stay at Harbor House, the decedent received morphine for pain in her leg, but she was not provided any other medical treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cowan returned to Harbor House on July 16, 2001. After she and her mother left the facility, Cowan discovered that the decedent's leg was swollen and that she appeared to be in pain. As a result, Cowan took the decedent to a nearby hospital emergency room. The decedent was diagnosed as having a shattered right femur, which required amputation of her leg above the knee. The decedent died four days later from complications resulting from the surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cowan filed an amended motion for judgment in the circuit court against Hospice alleging wrongful death of the decedent based on claims of simple negligence, gross negligence, willful and wanton negligence, and negligent hiring and retention. Upon consent of the parties, the circuit court dismissed the simple negligence count. Hospice filed a plea in bar of charitable immunity to the counts of gross negligence and willful and wanton negligence, and a demurrer to the negligent hiring and retention count. The circuit court sustained the plea in bar and demurrer and dismissed these remaining counts with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other things, the circuit court concluded that the charitable immunity doctrine barred recovery for acts or omissions of gross negligence and willful and wanton negligence. Cowan appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Cowan argues that this Court has not applied the charitable immunity doctrine to shield a charity from liability for acts of gross negligence or willful and wanton negligence. She asserts that because gross negligence and willful and wanton negligence are different in degree and kind from simple negligence, the charitable immunity doctrine should not be defined as including immunity for those more extreme acts. Cowan also contends that the charitable immunity doctrine should not be applied to acts of gross negligence or willful and wanton negligence because, in instances of such extreme conduct, the public's interest in encouraging charitable activities is outweighed by the need to deter such acts of \"reckless and harmful behavior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response, Hospice argues that charities should be immune from liability for all degrees of negligence because the absence of\n   such immunity would discourage them from performing their beneficial activities. Hospice asserts that this Court, in its prior decisions, has discussed charitable immunity from liability for negligence without specifically limiting that immunity to claims of simple negligence. Thus, Hospice contends, because gross negligence and willful and wanton negligence are simply different degrees of negligence, charitable immunity extends to shield charities from liability for those categories of negligent conduct as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hospice also asserts that Code \u00a7 8.01-226.4, which effectively subjects hospice volunteers to liability for acts of gross negligence and willful and wanton negligence, is evidence of the General Assembly's intent to shield charities from similar liability by providing a remedy against the individuals who actually commit such acts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree with Hospice's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under the doctrine of limited immunity applied to charities in this Commonwealth, a charitable institution is immune from liability to its beneficiaries for negligence caused by acts or omissions of its servants and agents, provided that the charity has exercised due care in their selection and retention.\n   <em>\n    Straley v.

The second level, gross negligence, is a degree of negligence showing indifference to another and an utter disregard of prudence that amounts to a complete neglect of the safety of such other person.

When we consider these distinctions in the context of the charitable immunity doctrine, their differing applications to the doctrine become apparent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Acts or omissions of simple negligence may occur routinely in the performance of the activities of any charitable organization. Employees or volunteers, in carrying out their duties, may fail to understand or to adequately follow instructions of a supervisor, may exercise poor judgment, or may have a lapse in attention to an assigned task. While serious consequences may result from these deficiencies in performance, they ordinarily do not involve an extreme departure from the charity's routine actions in conducting its activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In contrast, gross negligence involves conduct that \"shocks fair-minded people,\" and willful and wanton negligence involves such recklessness that the actor is aware that his conduct probably would cause injury to another.\n   <em>\n    Etherton,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12631386\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/597/87/#p213\">\n    268 Va. at 213-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12631386\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/597/87/#p213\">\n    597 S.E.2d at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Wilby v.

Thus, unlike simple negligence, these two levels of negligence are characterized by conduct that represents an unusual and marked departure from the routine performance of a charity's activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a practical matter, a charity's performance of its mission may be thwarted by litigation directed at the charity's failure to perform its activities in accordance with standards of ordinary care. For this reason, our Commonwealth's public policy in favor of promoting the activities of charitable organizations has been employed to shield charities from liability for their acts of simple negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This rationale, however, is inapplicable to conduct involving gross negligence and willful and wanton negligence. Unlike acts or omissions giving rise to claims of simple negligence, such conduct can never be characterized as an attempt, albeit ineffectual, to carry out the mission of the charity to serve its beneficiaries. Therefore, we conclude that the public policy rationale that shields a charity from liability for acts of simple negligence does not extend to acts of gross negligence and willful and wanton negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This conclusion does not represent a departure from our often-stated preference for legislative rather than judicial action to \"abolish or relax\" the charitable immunity doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Moore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"810691\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/250/421/#p424\">\n    250 Va. at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20S.E.2d%20459\">\n    463 S.E.2d at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Roanoke Hosp.

Thus, the issue is not before us in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
