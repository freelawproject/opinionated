Judgment was entered for Eric John Luhmann (\"plaintiff\") following a jury's verdict and award of $950,000.00 for injuries he sustained in an accident that occurred at a fire scene.

Pertinent facts are presented to provide context for the remaining issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff was injured when fireman Billy Hoenig (\"Hoenig\") moved a tanker truck at the scene of a fire. The hose connecting the tanker truck to the pumper truck remained attached to both trucks. As a result, plaintiff was pinned against the tanker truck by the hose and sustained serious bodily injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff filed an action against Hoenig and Cape Carteret Volunteer Fire and Rescue Department, Inc., (\"Fire Department\") (collectively, \"defendants\") alleging their negligence caused his injuries. After plaintiff and defendants filed motions for summary judgment, the trial court found: (1) Hoenig and the Fire Department were negligent as a matter of law; (2) plaintiff was entitled to partial summary judgment on the issue of negligence; and (3) both parties' motions for summary judgment on the issue of contributory negligence were denied. At trial, the jury found plaintiff to be contributorily negligent and further found Hoenig had the last clear chance to avoid causing injury to plaintiff. The jury awarded plaintiff $950,000.00 in damages, and the trial court entered judgment thereon. Defendants appeal. Plaintiff filed cross-assignments of error with this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Our Supreme Court ruled the Fire Department waived sovereign immunity to the extent it purchased insurance.\n   <em>\n    Luhmann,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2987438\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/358/529/\">\n    358 N.C. 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20S.E.2d%20763\">\n    597 S.E.2d 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The issues on remand are whether the trial court erred by: (1) granting plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of negligence; (2) submitting the issue of last clear chance to the jury; (3) denying defendants' motion to continue and motions for a mistrial because plaintiff failed to supplement discovery; and (4) admitting certain testimony after defendants were not provided with supplemental discovery responses in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff cross-appealed and contends the trial court erred by: (1) allowing defendants to introduce evidence of signs located on the fire trucks that read, \"Keep Back 400 Feet;\" (2) submitting the issue of contributory negligence to the jury instead of comparative negligence; and (3) allowing defendants to include documents in the record on appeal that were not in the record below and were not considered by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Negligence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants contend the trial court erred in granting partial summary judgment for plaintiff on the issue of negligence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment should be granted only if \"the pleadings,depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The moving party has the burden of showing that the opposing party cannot surmount an affirmative defense which would bar the claim. Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must challenge the motion by forecasting sufficient evidence to illustrate the existence of a prima facie case for trial. However, it is improper for the trial court to consider whether the non-moving party offered evidence to support their claim when the moving party has failed to offer sufficient evidence to defeat the claim in its entirety and demonstrate that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Wilhelm v.

Specifically, defendants contend a genuine issue exists as to \"what caused plaintiff's accident,when Hoenig does not recall his vehicle moving.\" Defendants argue conflicting evidence was presented on whether Hoenig moved the tanker truck. Hoenig claimed in his deposition that he did not remember moving the tanker truck and did not know how plaintiff became pinned against the truck.

Hoenig also agreed it was not a safe procedure to back up the tanker truck while the hose remained connected to another truck. Other firemen observed the waterhose tighten and subsequently heard plaintiff make a \"grunt.\" Hoenig exited the truck and observed plaintiff lying on the ground. Defendants presented nothing to rebut this evidence, but relied on their assertion of immunity as a defense toplaintiff's claim.

Our holding should not be interpreted as ruling that the jury was required to answer the issue in the affirmative or negative, or reflect an opinion by this Court on whether the jury answered the issue properly.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9497122\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/139/500/#p511\">\n    139 N.C.

Motion to Continue and Motions for Mistrial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants argue the trial court erred by denying their motion to continue and motions for mistrial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Initially, defendants' brief states, \"Plaintiff's [sic] motions for mistrials based on plaintiff's numerous discovery violations should also have been allowed.\" We presume defendants made a typographical error in their brief and intended to object to\n   <em>\n    defendants\n   </em>\n   ' motions. Defendants cite no authority and fail to provide any argument in support of this statement. Defendants have abandoned this assignment of error and waived appellate review of this argument pursuant to Rule 26 of the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure. N.C.R. App. P. 28(b)(6) (2004). This assignment of error is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Rule 40 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides, \"A continuance may be granted only for good cause shownand upon such terms and conditions as justice may require.\" N.C.

Rule 26(e) sets forth the general provisions governing discovery and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (e)\n   <em>\n    Supplementation of responses.\n   </em>\n   - A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement his response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (1) A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement his response with respect to any question directly addressed to (i) theidentity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters, and (ii) the identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial, the subject matter on which he is expected to testify, and the substance of his testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (2) A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if he obtains information upon the basis of which (i) he knows that the response was incorrect when made, or (ii) he knows that the response though correct when made is no longer true and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (3) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the court, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to trial through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 26(e) (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, defendants' First Set of Interrogatories to plaintiff requested plaintiff list all providers who treated him as a result of the alleged incident. Plaintiff listed Carteret General Hospital, Dr. Jeffrey Moore, and Cape Carteret Physical Therapy. In defendants' Request for Production of Documents to plaintiff, defendants requested the medical records of all providers who treated plaintiff in the ten years prior to the accident and also requested the records relating to the accident. Plaintiff's reply acknowledged that certain records existed related to his treatment that he had not yet received. His response was mailed to defendants on 1 November 2000 and indicated, \"additional records will be provided upon receipt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Trial was calendered for 22 April 2002. Defendants assert the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motion tocontinue because plaintiff delivered: (1) on 3 April 2002 a report by Dr. Moore indicating plaintiff was totally disabled; (2) on 9 April 2002 physical therapy records; and (3) on 12 April 2002 videotapes of plaintiff's therapy and surgery procedures. Additionally, defendants motion for a continuance requested the court's permission to conduct an independent medical examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The trial court heard the matter on 17 April 2002, granted defendants' request, and entered the order on 19 April 2002 allowing until 22 April 2002 for defendants to obtain an independent medical evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   A thorough review of the record reveals that defendants had received plaintiff's responses to their discovery requests prior to trial and had the opportunity to understand the nature of plaintiff's injuries and his contentions regarding his inability to work. Defendants failed to depose any of the treating physicians or therapists and never obtained an independent medical evaluation after the trial court granted their motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants failed to persuade the trial court they were \"unprepared for trial\" as a result of plaintiff's supplemental responses to discovery.\n   <em>\n    Green,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8526191\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/69/292/#p294\">\n    69 N.C.

Similarly, we are not persuaded the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendants' motion for a continuance. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Plaintiff's Cross-Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff requests this Court address his arguments on cross-appeal \"[i]n the event this Court should [reverse the trialcourt].\" As we have overruled defendants' assignments of error and conclude that no error nor an abuse of discretion occurred at trial, we decline to consider plaintiff's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The trial court did not err by granting plaintiff partial summary judgment on the issue of defendants' negligence. The trial court properly submitted the issues of contributory negligence and last clear chance to the jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants' motion to continue. The trial court's rulings, orders, and judgments are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   No Error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Judges WYNN and LEVINSON concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
