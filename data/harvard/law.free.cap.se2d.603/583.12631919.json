Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By a true bill of indictment, defendant was charged with possession with intent to sell and deliver a controlled substance and sale and delivery of a controlled substance. In a separate indictment, defendant was charged with having attained habitual felon status. One of the three felonies which triggered the habitual felon indictment was a 13 February 1991 conviction in Caldwell County Superior Court for felony possession of cocaine.

The trial court denied the motion. Defendant subsequently pled guilty to the sale of cocaine and to having attained the status of an habitual felon. Pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant reserved his right to seek appellate review of the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss the habitual felon indictment. After the trial court sentenced defendant as a Class C felon to seventy-two to ninety-six months imprisonment, defendant made an oral motion for appropriate relief, again arguing that his possession of cocaine conviction could not be used as an underlying felony in the habitual felon indictment. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant contends his habitual felon indictment was invalid because one of the three convictions relied upon by the State to enhance his status to an habitual felon was for possession of cocaine, which is classified as a misdemeanor under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2090-95\">\n    N.C.
