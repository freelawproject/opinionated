(\"JPG\") and Dick Beck Professional Marketing, Inc. (\"DBP\") centered on whether the company's Operating Agreement (the \"agreement\") required appraisal of company real estate to be limited to its \"use in the `cattle business.'\" We find the clear language of the agreement required appraisal of the real estate to be based on \"gross fair market value\" without limitation, and we reverse the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On 8 January 1997, JPG and DBP, the sole members of Springfield Angus, LLC (the \"company\"), entered into the agreementand formed the company. The agreement authorizes the company, under North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 57C, \"to engage in any lawful business including the ownership and operation of a cattle business\" on a 370.5-acre tract of real estate in Franklin County (the \"property\"). Paragraph 21(b) of the agreement gives JPG the option \"to acquire DBP's interest in the Company\" prior to 31 December 2004 if JPG determines, in good faith, DBP's continued participation as a member impedes the success of the company. Paragraph 21(b) further provides, \"The purchase price of DBP's interest shall be equal to its capital account balance, adjusted for\n   <em>\n    the gross fair market value of Company assets\n   </em>\n   in accordance with the provision of paragraph 3(e). . . .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In pertinent part, paragraph 3(e) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   If the Managers [disagree] regarding the gross fair market value of the Company assets, such value shall be determined by appraisal as follows. With respect to the Company's real property, the Managers shall select two qualified appraisers, [who shall] appoint a third qualified appraiser, and\n   <em>\n    the three appraisers separately shall appraise the gross fair market value of such real estate.\n   </em>\n   The average of the two appraisals . . . closest in amount shall be binding upon the parties. . . . The Managers shall agree on appraisers to appraise the gross fair market value of the Company's cattle, equipment, and other assets. . . . For purposes hereof, a qualified appraiser shall be any entity or person who (i) regularly engages within the local market area for real estate and equipment and in the relevant market for cattle, as shall be determined reasonably and in good faith within the discretion of the Managers, in the valuation of assets of the kind and nature owned by the Company, and (ii) holds themselves out as being in such business and qualified to make such valuation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a letter dated 13 September 2002, JPG informed DBP that it was exercising its option under paragraph 21(b) to purchase DBP's interest and had chosen a \"qualified appraiser\" per the terms of paragraph 3(e). Further, JPG requested DBP select a \"qualified appraiser\" so that the two appraisers could \"select a third . . . and appraise the property as a cattle farm as required by the Operating Agreement.\" In a letter dated 27 September 2002, DBP named its \"qualified appraiser,\" stated its appraiser would \"take into account the highest and best uses of the property,\" and contended \"[t]he Operating Agreement does not require differently.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 30 September 2002, JPG filed a complaint in Wake County Superior Court requesting \"a declaratory judgment that any appraiser selected by any party as per the terms of [the agreement] . . . appraise the real property owned by the [company] only as an ongoing cattle farm. . . .\" The trial court's decision required the appraisers to conduct the appraisals\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   with due consideration given by the appraisers to those factors which form the basis of their respective qualifications, that is, the local market for real estate and the equipment associated with a cattle farming operation, as well as the relevant market area for cattle . . . so as to provide a gross fair market value of the Company's real estate for use in the \"cattle business.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 2 May 2003, DBP filed notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The sole issue on appeal is whether the agreement requires that the property be appraised as \"real estate for use in the `cattle business'\" or at its \"highest and best uses.\" Appellate review of a declaratory judgment \"'is the same as in other cases.' Thus, in a bench trial, the [trial] court's findings of fact are conclusive, while its conclusions of law are reviewable\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Teasley v.

We disagree. First, the agreement's definition of a \"qualified appraiser\" limits the parties' choice of appraisers to those with the required experience for each type of company asset but does not limit themethod used or valuation reached by such appraisers. Second, as discussed above, nothing in the agreement limits the explicit term \"gross fair market value,\" and this Court may not insert such a limitation \"under the guise of [contract] construction.\"\n   <em>\n    Corbin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8547441\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/23/21/#p25\">\n    23 N.C.
