Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Counsel appointed to represent defendant has been unable to identify any issue with sufficient merit to support a meaningful argument for relief on appeal, and asks this Court to conduct its own review of the record for possible prejudicial error. Counsel has also shown to the satisfaction of this Court that he has complied with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    18 L.

Defense counsel's brief contains a letter dated 5 May 2004 transmitting to defendant the record on appeal and transcript and advising her to \"submit the arguments themselves as quickly as possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant has not filed any written arguments on her own behalf with this Court. A reasonable time in which she could have done so has passed. In accordance with\n   <em>\n    Anders,\n   </em>\n   we have fully examined the record to determine whether any issues of arguable merit appear therefrom or whether the appeal is wholly frivolous. We have examined the record for possible prejudicial error and found none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We conclude that the appeal is wholly frivolous. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Judges WYNN and GEER concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
