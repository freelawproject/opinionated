In accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, the trial court sentenced defendant to a presumptive term of 192-240 months imprisonment. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Counsel appointed to represent defendant has been unable to identify any issue with sufficient merit to support a meaningful argument for relief on appeal, and asks that this Court conduct its own review of the record for possible prejudicial error. Counsel has also shown to the satisfaction of this Court that he has complied with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Anders v.
