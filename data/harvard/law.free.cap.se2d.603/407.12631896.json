We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rockingham Police Officer Kenny Smith (\"Officer Smith\") witnessed defendant drive through a stop sign without stopping on the evening of 6 November 2002. Officer Smith turned on his lights and followed defendant's vehicle into a driveway. After approaching the vehicle and checking defendant's license and registration, Officer Smith asked, \"Do you have anything in the vehicle that you shouldn't have?\" Defendant replied that he did not. Officer Smith asked if he could check the vehicle. Defendantconsented to the search. After defendant exited the car, he quickly reached back into the vehicle and retrieved a small, white, rock-like object from the driver's seat. Defendant immediately put the object into his mouth. A struggle ensued as Officer Smith tried to get defendant to spit out the object. Defendant swallowed the object and was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   No drugs or drug paraphernalia were found in defendant's car or on his person. At trial, Officer Smith testified that, in his opinion, the object defendant swallowed was crack cocaine. After receiving\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and signing a written waiver, defendant admitted the object he swallowed was crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant testified that he reached back into the car, not to retrieve crack cocaine, but to put his wallet on the seat, and that the object in his mouth was chewing gum. Defendant also testified that his confession given to Officer Smith was not true, and that he signed it in exchange for a lower bond and release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The jury convicted defendant of possession of cocaine and resisting a public officer. The trial court arrested judgment on resisting a public officer and sentenced defendant in the aggravated range for possession of cocaine. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The issues presented are whether the trial court erred in: (1) denying defendant's motion to dismiss because the State presented insufficient evidence; (2) denying defendant's motion to suppress the statement defendant gave to Officer Smith at the time of his arrest; and (3) allowing Officer Smith to offer his opinionthat the substance he saw defendant swallow was crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant contends the State presented no evidence, beyond defendant's purported statement to Officer Smith, that the substance he swallowed was crack cocaine. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In reviewing a motion to dismiss for insufficiency of the evidence, this Court must determine \"whether there is substantial evidence of each essential element of the offense charged and of the defendant being the perpetrator of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, after a lawful stop and a consent to search, Officer Smith saw defendant quickly retrieve a white, rock-like object from the driver's seat and place it in his mouth. InOfficer Smith's opinion, the object was crack cocaine. Two other officers testified to statements Officer Smith made to them after the incident to corroborate Officer Smith's testimony. A videotape of the arrest was admitted as illustrative evidence and showed defendant reaching back into the car. Taken together, this testimony and other evidence constitutes \"substantial independent evidence\" tending to establish the trustworthiness of defendant's extrajudicial confession that is sufficient to withstand defendant's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=337%20S.E.2d%20487\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Defendant's Statement to Officer Smith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant argues that his statement to Officer Smith was involuntary because Officer Smith offered to inform the magistrate of defendant's cooperation if defendant provided a statement.

Officer Smith's statement to purportedly induce defendant's confession did not promise relief from criminal charges. Given Officer Smith's knowledge, experience, and training in drug identification, the trial court did not err in allowing him to offer his opinion that the object defendant swallowed was crack cocaine.
