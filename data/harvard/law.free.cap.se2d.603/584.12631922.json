We find no prejudicial error at trial, but vacate and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant was charged with two counts of possession with intent to sell and deliver cocaine, two counts of sale of cocaine, and two counts of delivery of cocaine. The State's evidence tended to show that in 2002, Detective Kevin Herring (\"Detective Herring\") of the Apex Police Department worked with the Wake County Interagency Drug Task Force in its undercover operation in an open-air drug market within the Apex city limits. The task forceroutinely used confidential informants to make controlled purchases of crack cocaine. Edward Henry Dunn (\"Dunn\") became a confidential informant in April 2002 in exchange for a reduction of his pending charge of possession of cocaine to a misdemeanor charge. After the plea agreement was fulfilled, Dunn became a paid informant for the task force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On 15 May 2002, Detective Herring gave Dunn $40.00 to purchase cocaine for $20.00 in the Justice Heights community. Dunn walked down West Street and met defendant. Dunn showed defendant the $40.00 and purchased crack cocaine from him. Dunn turned over the $20.00 worth of cocaine and the extra $20.00 cash to Detective Herring. On 21 August 2002, Detective Herring and Detective J.D. Barry gave Dunn $20.00 and told Dunn to \"secure a second buy\" from someone from whom he had previously bought cocaine. Dunn walked down South Salem near Justice Heights, approached defendant, and asked him for a \"20.\" Defendant sold Dunn crack cocaine in return for $20.00. Dunn met the detectives and again turned over the cocaine he purchased from defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A jury found defendant to be guilty as charged. The trial court arrested judgment on the delivery of cocaine convictions. The trial court determined defendant to have five prior record points and sentenced him, as a prior record level III, to two consecutive terms of fourteen to seventeen months imprisonment. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant assigns error to: (1) several remarks made by thetrial judge in the presence of the jury; and (2) determining defendant had five prior record level points resulting in a prior record level of III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Right to an Impartial Judge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant argues the trial judge's comments during the cross-examination of State witnesses, Detective Herring and Dunn, violated his constitutional rights to an impartial trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A judge's broad discretionary power to supervise and control the trial \"will not be disturbed absent a manifest abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

During the cross-examination of Detective Herring, defense counselquestioned him about his working relationship with Dunn. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. And so you - you were attempting to build some trust with [Dunn], but you still never knew what his background was. I mean, I guess I ask because I'm curious as to whether -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: Sir, you ask a question, he answers the question. Nobody really cares what the attorneys think.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I'm trying to rephrase the question so he understands it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: Well make it short and in English and we'll be fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After a lunch break, defense counsel resumed his cross-examination of Detective Herring and the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. Officer Herring, I'd like to pick up where we left off if we could and I had asked you how far Mr. Dunn, informant had walk[ed] in a 30-minute period. And basically what I'd asked you was is it true that according to a report he had walked down Salem Street and then possibly taken a right on West for a short distance and then turned and ran back across Salem Street, is that correct? Is it correct that your report says at the corner of Salem Street?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: Sir, once you ask a question, don't ask another one until he answers it unless he can't find where you're talking about. Do you know what he's talking about?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant next points to comments made while defense counsel questioned Dunn. On cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to ask Dunn about offenses with which he had been charged. The prosecutor had elicited testimony from Dunn on direct examination that Dunn had become an informant to reduce a possession of cocaine charge to a misdemeanor. Defense counsel brought Dunn's attentionto this matter by stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q. Now, earlier the Assistant District Attorney was asking you what you've been charged with in the past and you relayed that you've been charged with possession of cocaine and -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: Excuse me, the question she asked what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: - the drug -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   THE COURT: Excuse me, I'm talking. She asked what he had been convicted of, not charged. Asking someone what they've been charged with is an improper question. So if you're going that way, don't go there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: May we approach, your Honor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   THE COURT: Sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (Bench conference.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE COURT: Sustained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In continued cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dunn whether he had been convicted of possessing drug paraphernalia and why he had not testified about the conviction on direct examination. After Dunn answered that he \"was just answering for recent cases,\" the following colloquy occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. Have you also been convicted of resisting -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: All of these are within the last ten years?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   THE COURT: Well, then you should phrase your question that way, shouldn't you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: I - I can't read your mind and Idon't have a copy of what you're looking at.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: So you should say in the past ten years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Later, defense counsel asked Dunn, \"How many people would you say that you informed on?\" The trial court then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: I'm sorry sir, but I don't believe that's the proper form of the question. I believe I think the proper form of the question is how many people do you say you made buys from.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: Because inform on would be just giving information and I think the evidence here has been more buys.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, ma'am, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Towards the close of his cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to ask Dunn about the details regarding one of the controlled buys on 21 August 2002. The following exchange ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q. Now when the police report says that at 8:16 you were - I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong date, withdrawn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: Would that also include withdrawing the question about the person being someone that he had previously bought from?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: That's on that date?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, ma'am. I was looking at the wrong report, I apologize.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   THE COURT: No, no, as long as I can have a clue as to where you are.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q. Now earlier you did remember who had dropped you off that day; is that correct? Earlier you testified off -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   THE COURT: When you say that day, I'm sure he knows exactly where you are, but you're jumping back and forth and I don't have a clue which day you're talking about.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, ma'am. I'm talking about August 21st.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   THE COURT: Every time you're talking about that, work that into the question for me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant argues the above comments were sarcastic, demeaning, and critical of defense counsel's performance. To support his contention, defendant relies on\n   <em>\n    State v.

An examination of these instances reveals that the trial court's actions did not indicate any opinion towards defendant's case nor any negative attitude toward defense counsel as in\n   <em>\n    Brinkley.\n   </em>\n   The record reveals the trial judge's attempt to ensure that the court, the jurors, and opposing counsel were able to follow defense counsel's questions and the testimony of witnesses.
