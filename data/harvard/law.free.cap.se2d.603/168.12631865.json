Specifically, the letter stated \"[a] review of table 30-4-5-1 Permitted Uses indicates that professional baseball clubs may only be permitted to operate in the zoning classification Public and Institutional. I am asking that you confirm this or give a reason as to why this is not correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The zoning officer responded by letter indicating that Petitioner Caudill's interpretation of the PUT was incorrect and interpreting the PUT as follows: \"Any professional sports team, including a professional baseball club, is permitted under the coliseums or stadiums designation in the line item `Auditoriums, Coliseums, or Stadiums.' Such uses are permitted in the following districts: Highway Business, Central Business, Shopping Center, Light Industrial and Public and Institutional.\" The zoning officer's letter also explained that the Baseball Clubs, Professional use listing in the PUT refers to a development standard limiting concession sales at Memorial Stadium, a limitation which only applies in the Public and Institutional (\"PI\") district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioner Caudill appealed the zoning officer's interpretation to the Greensboro Board of Adjustment and a hearing was held on the matter on 27 January 2003. At the hearing, the Board decided that Petitioner Caudill was an aggrieved party and thus had standing to pursue his appeal. The Board then voted to uphold the zoning officer's interpretation of the PUT. On 18February 2003 the Board entered a written order containing the following pertinent conclusions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (a) \"Baseball Clubs, Professional\" as a permitted use are not restricted only to Public and Institutional zoning classifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (b) When a \"Baseball Club, Professional\" is operated as a permitted use in a Public and Institutional zoning classification, it must comply with the additional developmental standards in section 30-5-2.19.5(B) of the City Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 19 March 2003, Petitioner Caudill and Petitioner Dixie Sales filed a petition for writ of certiorari in Guilford County Superior Court appealing the Board's order. On 31 March 2003, respondent Board filed a motion to dismiss and a response to the petition. On 16 April 2003, DGR moved to intervene in the matter, and this motion was allowed by consent order filed 5 May 2003. Finally, on 16 May 2003 respondent Board filed a motion to dismiss and in the alternative a motion for judgment on the record. A hearing was held on the matter and arguments were made by counsel on the issues of standing and interpretation of the PUT. On 12 June 2003, the superior court entered an order affirming the Board's decision, granting judgment on the record in favor of respondents and specifically indicating that petitioner Caudill had standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The issues presented for our review are: 1) whether either petitioner has standing to pursue this litigation and 2) whether the Board's interpretation of the PUT is correct. As we concludethat neither petitioner has standing, this Court does not have jurisdiction to reach petitioners' ordinance interpretation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, DGR argues that the superior court erred in finding that petitioners Caudill and Dixie Sales have standing to appeal the zoning interpretation and asks that this Court dismiss petitioners' appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \"Standing is a necessary prerequisite to a court's proper exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Aubin v.

At the hearing, the attorney made two arguments concerning standing. First, Caudill is the owner of property zoned CB, the zone where DGR plans to build a stadium for the professional baseball team to play. Second, that traffic congestion due to the new use would cause a devaluation of Caudill's property because of the difficulty of customers wanting to access Caudill's gas station and auto repair business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The attorney for DGR rebutted these arguments by presenting a study showing minimal impact on traffic due to the potential stadium and arguing that an increase in traffic would actually tendto benefit Petitioner Caudill's business. The attorney for DGR also presented maps of the location of the proposed stadium and Petitioner Caudill's business. Finally, the attorney for the DGR contended that the Board should not find that Caudill had standing based solely on the assertions of an attorney without any indication of adverse impact or diminution in value resulting from traffic flow changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Superior Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Petitioner Caudill asserted the following in his verified petition for certiorari to the superior court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The aforementioned violation of the Ordinance will specifically damage Petitioner Caudill. If DGR obtains a building permit for its proposed baseball stadium, the condition for the street closure will be satisfied, and a portion of West Lindsay Street will be closed. That street closure will damage Petitioner Caudill by diverting traffic away from Petitioner Caudill's businesses, the result of which will be a loss of revenue and profits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The superior court made the following reference to standing in its order granting judgment on the record in favor of respondents:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The Board's finding that Caudill had standing to appeal was not arbitrary and capricious, was not based on any error of law, and was based on competent, material and substantive evidence. To the extent this issue is jurisdictional, the Court is satisfied that Mr. Caudill has standing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the sworn testimony of Petitioner Caudill's attorney at the Board hearing and Petitioner Caudill's assertions in the verified petition are sufficient to support a finding that Petitioner Caudill is anaggrieved party with standing to pursue the ordinance interpretation claim. After a careful review of the record, briefs, and arguments of the parties, we hold that they are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, it is not enough that Petitioner Caudill owns property in the CB district.\n   <em>\n    See Kentallen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8526432\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/110/767/#p770\">\n    110 N.C.
