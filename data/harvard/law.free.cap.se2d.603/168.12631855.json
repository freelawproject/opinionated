Defendant pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to one count of robbery with a dangerous weapon. In accordance with the plea agreement the other count of robbery with a dangerous weapon was dismissed, and the trial court sentenced defendant to a presumptive term of 72-96 months imprisonment. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant's sole argument on appeal is that the trial court erred in sentencing him outside of the presumptive range withoutfinding the necessary aggravating factors. This argument is wholly without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the instant case, defendant was convicted of robbery with a dangerous weapon, a Class D felony. The trial court determined, without objection, that defendant had one prior conviction, which resulted in his being a prior record level II offender. The trial court sentenced defendant to a minimum of 72 months and a maximum of 96 months imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The minimum and maximum sentences for a particular offense is controlled by G.S. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c) and G.S. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(e). The minimum presumptive sentence for a Class D felony committed by a level II offender is anywhere from 61 months to 77 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c)(2001). Defendant was then properly sentenced to a presumptive minimum term of 72 months, which is well within the 61-77 month range of sentences set out in G.S. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(c). The corresponding maximum term for a 72 month minimum sentence is 96 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1340.17(e). Contrary to defendant's argument, the record shows that he was sentenced in the presumptive range of sentences. The trial court was, therefore, not required to make any written findings in aggravation.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Bright,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11240967\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/135/381/\">\n    135 N.C.

Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Judges CALABRIA and ELMORE concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
