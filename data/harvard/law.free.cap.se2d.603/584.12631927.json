One petition alleged that W.G.C., a juvenile, was delinquent in that he committed simple assault, indecent liberties with children, and first-degree sexual offense against one victim. The juvenile admitted to the indecent liberties charge during his arraignment, and the State dropped the other two charges. The other petition alleged second-degree sexual offense, attempted second-degree rape, and simple assault against another victim. Pursuant to this later petition, on 23 August 2001, the juvenile was adjudicated delinquent on the charges of second-degree sexual offense and attempted second-degree rape. Atthe disposition hearing on 2 October 2001, the juvenile was sentenced as a Level 2 offender to serve twelve months' probation and ordered to remain in detention pending placement. The juvenile's probation was conditioned upon cooperating with all professionals and treatment plans prescribed for him, and if out-of-home placement became necessary, to abide by all rules and regulations of the placement. By order dated 6 December 2001 he was released from detention to placement in a residential facility. This matter came for review on 30 September 2002 pursuant to a motion to extend his probation based on the fact the juvenile had not completed his prescribed treatment. Upon the juvenile's admission to the allegations in the motion and the court's finding of a factual basis for the admission, his probation was extended to 2 October 2003. His counselor had the discretion to terminate probation if the juvenile was in compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The extended probation came back for review pursuant to a 1 May 2003 motion from the Juvenile Court Counselor (JCC) alleging the juvenile had not been following the treatment plan or the rules of the residential treatment program for the past five months. The JCC's motion was supported by a report concerning a shift in the juvenile's behavior: the juvenile had behaved appropriately during the first year of his residential treatment but had taken a turn for the worse during 2002, such that at times he had to be restrained. The report documented the court's extension of the juvenile's probation on 9 December 2002, directing the delinquent to behave and take advantage of the services being offered to him. The JCC report went on to show that the juvenile's behavior had only gotten worse since the last probation extension, stating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [The juvenile] is very angry and is aware that triggers his rape fantasies and other non-compliant behaviors. [He] has been placed in Anger Management group three times without any success. [He] refuses to work the program and has to be restrained on a regular basis. [His mother] has been very cooperative during this process and has tried on numerous occasions to help her son get back on track. He is not responding to anyone at this point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since the last court hearing on 4/10/03, [he] has had a number of outbursts and has destroyed property on several occasions. He has also had an incident where he allegedly swung at a staff member while upset. [He] has improved a little with his participation in groups and completing assignments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The recommendation of the court was for the juvenile to be committed to the Office of Juvenile Justice (OJJ), a Level 3 disposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 7B-2508 (2003). These same concerns were voiced by the juvenile's treatment team in their reports from the New Hope Carolinas residential facility (New Hope) in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Pursuant to this declining behavior, and specific threats of rape to female staff at New Hope, the juvenile was discharged from the treatment facility on 5 May 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The above reports were brought to light in a probation violation hearing held on 5 May 2003. The transcriptionist of the recorded hearing noted that counsels' microphones were not working. After argument from the juvenile's counsel, the court initially found the juvenile not to be in violation of his probation. Thecourt then engaged in a lengthy discussion with the Assistant District Attorney, the juvenile's mother, the court counselor, and an unidentified male about appropriate placement for the juvenile. Then, an in-chambers conference was held involving the judge, attorneys, and court counselors. Upon further consideration, the court changed its determination and found the juvenile to be in violation of his probation. The court made oral findings pursuant to this determination. The court committed him to the OJJ for an indefinite commitment and ordered sex offender treatment. After finding that there was no appropriate placement where the juvenile could be held pending appeal, the court ordered the juvenile to training school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The juvenile now raises four issues on appeal as addressed herein: (I) that the juvenile's due process rights were violated by not being present during the off-the-record, in-chambers discussion between the judge, attorneys, and court counselors; (II) the trial court failed to consider any alternatives to the juvenile's commitment to OJJ; (III) the trial court failed to make findings of fact relating to the juvenile's remaining in custody pending this appeal; and (IV) the juvenile's due process rights in this appeal were violated by the inadequate transcript which was caused by the recording problems. For the reasons stated herein, we find the juvenile received a fair hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Due Process Rights in a Probation Violation Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The juvenile argues that his due process rights were violated during his probation violation hearing as he was not present duringa conference held in chambers and off the record. He argues that this violated his right to be present at every stage of his hearing pursuant to Article I, \u00a7 23 of the North Carolina Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Stat. \u00a7 7B-2605, as it is a conclusive determination and offers no compelling reasons for the determination. However, because this determination in no way prejudiced the disposition order finding the juvenile in violation of his probation and ordering him to the same commitment where he was to be held pending appeal, the error was without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Lineberry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9249618\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/154/246/#p250\">\n    154 N.C.
