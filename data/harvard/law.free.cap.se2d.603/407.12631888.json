(Johnson Body Shop), Lemmuel O. Johnson, Jr. (Johnson), and Matt Brown (Brown) (collectively employer defendants) failed to stop the complained of conduct, instead expressly approving and ratifyingit. Plaintiff alleged that the actions of employer defendants constituted negligent hiring, retention, and supervision. In an answer and counterclaim filed 24 January 2002, all defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff's complaint pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6). In addition, both Johnson Body Shop and Brown asserted counterclaims against plaintiff. Plaintiff replied to these counterclaims on 28 March 2002. Defendants moved for summary judgment in a motion dated 25 November 2002. In an order filed 16 January 2003, the trial court granted the motion by all defendants for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiff's complaint. The trial court further granted summary judgment in favor of Johnson Body Shop against plaintiff in the amount of $527.61 and in favor of Brown against plaintiff in the amount of $5,000.00. Plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was employed as a technician by Johnson Body Shop from 1997 until 1999 and again from January 2000 until July 2001. Plaintiff alleged that during his second tenure at Johnson Body Shop he was \"subjected to extreme and outrageous ridicule and harassment by his co-workers\" and that employer defendants did nothing to stop this ridicule and harassment. In addition, plaintiff named Johnson Body Shop, Johnson, and Brown as defendants under the theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior.\n   </em>\n   In his brief, plaintiff notes multiple events of ridicule and harassment by employee defendants, including, but not limited to, numerous practical jokes, writings, photographs, songs, poems, and signs ridiculing plaintiff. In his affidavit, plaintiff testified that thisharassment resulted in his hospitalization and treatment for major depression and suicidal ideations. Plaintiff also stated in his affidavit that he complained to both Brown and Johnson on numerous occasions about the ridicule and harassment and that both Brown and Johnson observed much of the complained of conduct firsthand. However, the harassment never ceased and Brown and Johnson never disciplined or terminated any employee defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff argues the trial court erred in finding that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to his claims. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 56(c) (2003) provides that summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence submitted by the parties presents \"no genuine issue as to any material fact and that any party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" \"A party moving for summary judgment satisfies its burden of proof (1) by showing an essential element of the opposing party's claim is nonexistent or cannot be proven, or (2) by showing through discovery that the opposing party cannot produce evidence to support an essential element of his or her claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Belcher v.

Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff first argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of employee defendants on plaintiff's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. In orderto prevail on his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), plaintiff must show (1) that defendants engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct and (2) that the conduct was intended to and did in fact cause (3) severe emotional distress.\n   <em>\n    Waddle v.

In fact, plaintiff testified in his affidavit that he \"begged and pleaded\" with employee defendants to stop harassing him. This testimony demonstrates that employee defendants were aware that the teasing and harassing were upsetting plaintiff, yet they refused to stop bothering plaintiff. This constitutes aforecast of evidence that employee defendants acted with a disregard that plaintiff would suffer emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Regarding the third element of emotional distress, plaintiff presented substantial evidence of hospitalization, treatment, medication and psychological evaluation to support his contention that he suffered severe emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff brought forth evidence regarding all three elements of an IIED claim.

Our Court therefore held that \"[a]bsent a breach of duty of care, plaintiff's suit against [the defendant] for NIED cannot be maintained\" and concluded that summary judgment was proper.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20S.E.2d%20403\">\n    567 S.E.2d at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in the case before our Court, plaintiff failed to allege and failed to present any evidence that employee defendants owed any duty to plaintiff. Accordingly, as in\n   <em>\n    Guthrie,\n   </em>\n   we conclude that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of employee defendants on plaintiff's NIED claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We note that plaintiff also argues that employer defendants are liable for IIED and NIED under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior.\n   </em>\n   An employer can be liable where \"(1) the employer expressly authorizes the employee's act; (2) the tort is committed by the employee in the scope of employment and in furtherance of the employer's business; or (3) the employer ratifies theemployee's tortious conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Denning-Boyles v.

Thus, for an employer to be liable under the theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior,\n   </em>\n   a plaintiff must show that an employer's conduct fits within one of the above categories.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 414,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=473%20S.E.2d%2038\">\n    473 S.E.2d at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the case before us, plaintiff only argues that employer defendants are liable based upon ratification of employee defendants' conduct. Regarding Brown, plaintiff presented sufficient evidence supporting his contention that Brown knew that employee defendants were ridiculing plaintiff. However, plaintiff failed to present evidence that Brown ratified the acts of employee defendants. In fact, plaintiff testified multiple times in his deposition that Brown met with employee defendants and told them to stop harassing plaintiff. Further, when asked specifically whether Brown ratified employee defendants' conduct, plaintiff testified that Brown \"didn't approve of [employee defendants] doing what they [were] doing.\" Regarding Johnson, plaintiff testified repeatedly in his deposition that he complained only to Brown and not to Johnson about the harassment. Thus, there is no evidence that Johnson was aware of the harassment and certainly no evidence that Johnson ratified the acts of employee defendants. Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of employer defendants for IIED and NIED on the theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Negligence Claim against Employer Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff also argues in his brief that employer defendantswere negligent in failing to stop the harassment by employee defendants. This argument is based on plaintiff's allegation in his complaint regarding negligent hiring, retention and supervision on behalf of employer defendants. However, plaintiff's sole assignment of error on appeal states that there were genuine issues of material fact regarding his IIED and NIED claims. Plaintiff did not include negligent hiring, retention and supervision claims in this assignment of error. Accordingly, plaintiff has failed to preserve this portion of his argument for appellate review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.R. App. P. 10(a) (stating that \"the scope of review on appeal is confined to a consideration of those assignments of error set out in the record on appeal\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Affirmed in part; reversed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Judges CALABRIA and STEELMAN concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
