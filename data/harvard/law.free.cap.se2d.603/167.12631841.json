Upon review of the trial court's findings of fact, we conclude that the trooper possessed reasonable suspicionthat criminal activity might be occurring and, therefore, affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant was charged with driving while impaired in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-138.1\">\n    N.C.

Defendant subsequently pled guilty, but reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. This Court ultimately dismissed the appeal on 4 June 2002 for failure to include in the record documentation reflecting that defendant had reserved his right to appeal pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-979(b) (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 1 August 2002, this Court allowed defendant's petition for writ of certiorari.

On 28 May 2000, at approximately 11:20 p.m., following the end of a race, a mass of cars was exiting the Lowe's Motor Speedway. The State Highway Patrol was responsible for directing traffic out of the Speedway facility in order to keep the traffic flowing. The traffic was moving along an exit road and merging into multiple lanes of traffic on a major highway. The traffic had, however, come to a halt. Trooper R. Cook, while directing traffic, observed defendant leave the exit road, drive across a ditch line, and try to enter a stopped lane of traffic on the highway. Trooper Cook approached defendant's vehicle and asked why defendant was exiting the Speedway without following the directions of the Highway Patrol troopers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court found that the purpose of the stop was for the trooper to \"mak[e] inquiry as to why [defendant] did not follow the directions[.]\" He concluded that the stop, therefore, was notillegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State argued below that no stop occurred because defendant actually came to a halt as a result of the stopped traffic. Since the trial court did not address this question and since the State does not repeat this argument on appeal, we do not reach the issue and instead assume, for the purposes of this appeal, that there was a stop within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under the Fourth Amendment, before a police officer may conduct a brief investigatory stop of a vehicle without a warrant, the officer must have a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be occurring.\n   <em>\n    State v.
