W. Lavolle met bis death, Lavolle was billed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>a head-on collision on the Knoxville and Maryville highway between his automobile and an automobile operated by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\">There is not a great deal of controversy in the proof as to the manner in which the collision occurred. There is a conflict in the testimony as to whether the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time. We do not find it necessary to deal with this conflict. If, indeed, the defendant was entirely sober, the case made out against him by the State is even worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The collision occurred on Sunday afternoon about 4 miles out from Knoxville. The weight of the proof is that there was heavy traffic in each direction. Defendant was driving from Knoxville, toward Maryville, at a speed which the State\u2019s witnesses estimate at 40 miles an hour or more. He and his companions estimate his speed as somewhat less.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The defendant approached a truck from the rear and undertook to pass it. In this effort, State\u2019s witnesses testified that defendant\u2019s car, as he turned out to the left, grazed a car driven by one Leach coming into Knoxville. After getting past Leach\u2019s car, and over on his left-hand side of the road, defendant\u2019s car collided, almost he\u00e1d-on, according to the State\u2019s proof, with the car driven by deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Proof introduced by the State shows that deceased\u2019s car was being driven at a moderate rate of speed, that it closely followed Leach\u2019s car, and that deceased was driving his car entirely on his right-hand side of the road \u2014 on defendant\u2019s left-hand side- of the road' \u2014 when the collision occurred. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">From the evidence of the State\u2019s witnesses, it is quite obvious that no driver, exercising even small care, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Rave undertaken to pass tlie trnck in front of Rim as defendant did, traffic conditions being what they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">According\u2019 to the defendant, he started to pnll to.his left to pass the trnck bnt saw deceased\u2019s car and pnlled hack. Defendant said that deceased\u2019s car was to deceased\u2019s left of the center white line when the collision occurred. This testimony of defendant, however, is not sustained by that of his own witnesses, other boys in his car. State\u2019s witnesses testify to the contrary and it is difficult to see how deceased\u2019s car passed the truck upon defendant\u2019s theory. Deceased must necessarily have been on his right of the white line to have gotten by the truck defendant tried to pass, for defendant admits the collision occurred just behind the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Criticism is made of the charge but we find nothing therein of which the defendant can complain. The court charged the law with reference to intoxicated drivers as laid down by this court in <em>Crosswy </em>v. <em>State, </em>157 Tenn., 363, 370, 8 S. W. (2d), 486, and <em>Keller </em>v. <em>State, </em>155 Tenn., 636, 290 S. W., 803, 59 A. L. R., 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Defendant relies on <em>Copeland </em>v. <em>State, </em>154 Tenn., 7, 11, 285 S. W., 565, 49 A. L. R., 605; <em>Claybrook </em>v. <em>State, </em>164 Tenn., 440, 441, 51 S. W. (2d), 499, and that line of cases. None of the fatalities in these cases was considered by the court as a probable result of the particular act of negligence. None of the acts of negligence moreover was regarded as <em>malum in se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">In the case before us, in view of the traffic on this highway, this collision was not only a probable result but almost an inevitable result of such negligence as the defendant\u2019s. Likewise we think the act of defendant in undertaking to pass this truck, turning out to his left in heavy and closely approaching opposing traffic, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>was an act <em>malum in se. </em>It was an act on a par with, firing a gun into a crowded street, or dropping a heavy object into such a street from a tall building.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We find no error in the record, and the judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
