Under the decree of the chancellor Cran\u00e9 could either give the bond or take the oath. The decree did not restrict him to either method. He complied with the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>cree by appealing in a manner provided by law and on tbe same day as tbe entry of tbe decree. Tbe clerk and master bad tbe right to accept tbe pauper\u2019s oath, wbicb was tendered witbin the time allowed and at tbe same term of conrt as tbe entry of tbe decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Crane has filed his petition for <em>certiorari </em>to this conrt and assigned errors. This petition has heretofore been granted and tbe canse set down for argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Tbe view taken by tbe Court of Appeals that a pauper oath on appeal cannot be accepted by tbe clerk and master without an order of court allowing the appeal on such oath is, we think, erroneous and unsupported by Tennessee authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Tbe result is that the decree of the Court of Appeals must be reversed, and tbe cause remanded to that court. Tbe costs in this court will be paid by Regina Krug et al., defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
