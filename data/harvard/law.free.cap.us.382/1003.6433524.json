Chandler here asks for a stay of an \u201cOrder\u201d of the Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit directing that until further order of the Council, Judge Chandler \u201ctake no action whatsoever in any case or proceeding now or hereafter pending\u201d in his court, that cases now assigned to him be assigned to other judges, and that no new actions filed be assigned to him. If this order is not stayed and if the Judicial Council has some way to enforce it, the order means that Judge Chandler is completely barred from performing any of his official duties and in effect is removed or ousted from office pending further orders of the Council. The reason given by the Council for this drastic action is that it \u201cfinds that Judge Chandler is presently unable, or unwilling, to discharge efficiently the duties of his office . . . .\u201d By refusing to stay the Council\u2019s order, the Court necessarily acts on the premise that the Council has a legal right to remove Judge Chandler from office at least temporarily. Though the Court tries to soft-pedal its refusal to stay the order by referring to it as \u201cinterlocutory in character,\u201d the stark fact which cannot be disguised is that a United States District Judge, duly appointed by the President and approved by the Senate, is with this Court\u2019s imprimatur locked out of his office pending \u201cfurther proceedings\u201d by the Judicial Council. I think the Council is completely without legal authority to issue any such order, either temporary or permanent, with or without a hearing, that no statute purports to authorize it, and that the Constitution forbids it. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>can the effect of the order be softened by asserting that Judge Chandler will be permitted to have a lawyer represent him before his fellow judges. Assuming that we have jurisdiction to stay an order from a governmental agency that has no power at all to do what this Council has done, I would stay this \u201cOrder\u201d <em>instanter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The Council states that its order was made \u201cpursuant to the power and authority vested in the Judicial Council by the Act of June 25, 1948, c. 646, \u00a7 332, 62 Stat. 902, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 332.\u201d That section so far as relevant reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">\u201cEach judicial council shall make all necessary orders for the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts within its circuit. The district judges shall promptly carry into effect all orders of the judicial council.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">There is no language whatever in this or any other Act which can by any reasonable interpretation be read as giving the Council a power to pass upon the work of district judges, declare them inefficient and strip them of their power to act as judges. The language of Congress indicates a purpose to vest the Judicial Council with limited <em>administrative </em>powers; nothing in this language, or the history behind it, indicates that a Council of Circuit Court Judges was to be vested with power to discipline district judges, and in effect remove them from office. This is clearly and simply a proceeding by circuit judges to inquire into the fitness of a district judge to hold his office and to remove him if they so desire. I do not believe Congress could, even if it wished, vest any such power in the circuit judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">One of the great advances made in the structure of government by our Constitution was its provision for an independent judiciary \u2014 for judges who could do their duty as they saw it without having to account to superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>court judges or to anyone else except the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment. Article II, \u00a7 4, of the Constitution provides that \u201cOfficers of the United States,\u201d which includes judges, \u201cshall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,\u201d and Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3, state that impeachment can be instituted only on recommendation of the House of Representatives and that trial can be held only by the Senate. To hold that judges can do what this Judicial Council has tried to do to Judge Chandler here would in my judgment violate the plan of our Constitution to preserve, as far as possible, the liberty of the people by guaranteeing that they have judges wholly independent of the Government or any of its agents with the exception of the United States Congress acting under its limited power of impeachment. We should stop in its infancy, before it has any growth at all, this idea that the United States district judges can be made accountable for their efficiency or lack of it to the judges just over them in the federal judicial system. The only way to do that is to grant this stay and I am in favor of granting it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
