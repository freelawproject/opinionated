The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide two ways of doing so. They say that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"[a] party may preserve a claim of error by informing the court ... of [1] the action the party wishes the court to take, or [2] the party's objection to the court's action and the grounds for that objection.\" Fed.

Proc. 51(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Errors \"not brought to the court's attention\" in one of these two ways are subject to review only insofar as they are \"plain.\" Rule 52(b); see\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the very least, the defendant contended, any term of imprisonment should be less than 12 months long. The judge nevertheless imposed a sentence of 12 months. The question is whether the defendant's district-court argument for a specific sentence (namely, nothing or less than 12 months) preserved his claim on appeal that the 12-month sentence was unreasonably long. We think that it did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The petitioner in this case, Gonzalo Holguin-Hernandez, was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to 60 months in prison and five years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time of his conviction, he was also serving a term of supervised release related to an earlier crime. The Government asked the court to find that petitioner had violated the conditions of that earlier term, to revoke it, and to impose an additional consecutive prison term consistent with the pertinent Sentencing Guidelines, namely, 12 to 18 months in prison. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.4(a), 7B1.3(f) (Nov. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Petitioner's counsel argued that there \"would be no reason under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7]3553 that an additional consecutive sentence would get [petitioner's] attention any better than\" the five years in prison the court had already imposed for the current trafficking offense.

We hold only that the defendant here properly preserved the claim that his 12-month sentence was unreasonably long by advocating for a shorter sentence and thereby arguing, in effect, that this shorter sentence would have proved \"sufficient,\" while a sentence of 12 months or longer would be \"greater than necessary\" to \"comply with\" the statutory purposes of punishment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Justice ALITO, with whom Justice GORSUCH joins, concurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   I agree with the Court that a defendant who requests a specific sentence during a sentencing hearing need not object to the sentence after its pronouncement in order to preserve a challenge to its substantive reasonableness (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , length) on appeal.

That question is not currently before us. Nevertheless, as we have previously explained, failing to object at all to a procedural error (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , a district court's miscalculation of the Guidelines range) will subject a procedural challenge to plain-error review.\n   <em>\n    Molina-Martinez v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , 578 U.S. ----, ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595701\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1338/#p1342\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1342-1343,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595701\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1338/#p1342\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , we do not decide what is sufficient to preserve any \"particular\" substantive-reasonableness argument.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   , at 767.

Thus, we do not suggest that a generalized argument in favor of less imprisonment will insulate\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   arguments regarding the length of a sentence from plain-error review.

Requiring a party to bring an error to the attention of the court enables the court to correct itself, obviating the need for an appeal. At the very least, the court can explain its reasoning and thus assist the appellate process. A court cannot address particular arguments or facts not brought to its attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , we do not decide whether this petitioner properly preserved his particular substantive-reasonableness arguments, namely, that he did not pose a danger to the public and that a 12-month sentence would not serve deterrence purposes. See\n   <em>\n    ante\n   </em>\n   , at 765, 766 - 767. In determining whether arguments have been preserved, courts should make a case-specific assessment\n   of how the error was \"brought to the court's attention.\" Rule 52(b) ; see also,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.
