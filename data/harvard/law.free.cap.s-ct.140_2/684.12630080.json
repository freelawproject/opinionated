Although we have discretion to decline review in other kinds of cases, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), 1257(a), we likely do not have discretion to decline review in cases within our original jurisdiction that arise between two or more States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The Constitution establishes our original jurisdiction in mandatory terms. Article III states that, \"[i]n all Cases ... in which a State shall be [a] Party, the supreme Court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   have original Jurisdiction.\" \u00a7 2, cl. 2 (emphasis added). In this circumstance, \"[w]e have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Cohens v. Virginia,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730243\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/19/264/#p404\">\n    6 Wheat. 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 404,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730243\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/19/264/#p404\">\n    5 L.Ed. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1821) (Marshall, C.J., for the Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Our original jurisdiction in suits between two States is also \"exclusive.\" \u00a7 1251(a). As I have previously explained, \"[i]f this Court does not exercise jurisdiction over a controversy between two States, then the complaining State has no judicial forum in which to seek relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Nebraska\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Colorado\n   </em>\n   , 577 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12594870,12594871\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1034/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1035,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596261,12596262,12596263,12596264,12594871\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/194/545/\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (opinion dissenting from denial of motion for leave to file complaint). Denying leave to file in a case between two or more States is thus not only textually suspect, but also inequitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court has provided scant justification for reading \"shall\" to mean \"may.\" It has invoked its \"increasing duties with the appellate docket,\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona v. New Mexico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182647\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/794/#p797\">\n    425 U.S. 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 797,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182647\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/794/#p797\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182647\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/794/#p797\">\n    48 L.Ed.2d 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976) (\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   ) (internal quotation marks omitted), and its \"structur[e] ... as an appellate tribunal,\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio v.

But the Court has failed to provide any analysis of the Constitution's text to justify our discretionary approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although I have applied this Court's precedents in the past, see\n   <em>\n    Wyoming v. Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228362\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/437/#p474\">\n    502 U.S. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474, n.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228362\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/437/#p474\">\n    112 S.Ct. 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228362\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/437/#p474\">\n    117 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (dissenting opinion), I have since come to question those decisions, see\n   <em>\n    Nebraska\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at ----, 136 S.Ct. at, 1035 (dissenting opinion). Arizona invites us to reconsider our discretionary approach, and I would do so. I respectfully dissent from the denial of leave to file a complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
