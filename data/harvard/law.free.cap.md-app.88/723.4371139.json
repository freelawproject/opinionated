Appellee, Wise-burg Community Association, Inc. (Wiseburg), is a citizens\u2019 group composed of existing residents from the general vicinity in which \u201cCoachman\u2019s Field\u201d is planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The \u201cCoachman\u2019s Field\u201d development plan (the Plan) was reviewed by the CRG<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to the Development Regulations of Baltimore County, Baltimore County Code (B.C.C.) \u00a7 26-166 <em>et seq., </em>which require an \u201capproved plan ... for all development\u201d in the County. B.C.C. \u00a7 26-201.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 30 April 1987, at a public meeting attended by representatives of Art Wood, Wiseburg, and several County agencies, the CRG ostensibly approved the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Wiseburg appealed the CRG\u2019s decision to the Board, which affirmed. Wiseburg then appealed to the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Court for Baltimore County. The circuit court (Brennan, J.) held that the CRG\u2019s approval of the Plan was \u201cconditional\u201d and as such was not authorized under the B.C.C. The circuit court remanded the matter to the Board, directing that the Board order the CRG to make a final decision regarding the Plan at a continued CRG meeting held pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Art Wood now contends that:</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">I. The circuit court erred in finding that the CRG\u2019s approval of the Plan was \u201cconditional\u201d and as such was unauthorized under B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206;</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">II. The circuit court erred in its conclusion that the CRG actually took final action to approve the Plan in a meeting that was closed to the public in violation of B.C.C. \u00a7 1-12 (the County\u2019s \u201cOpen Meeting\u201d law); and</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">III. The CRG was not required to refer the Plan to the Baltimore County Planning Board (Planning Board) pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 26-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The role of the circuit court in reviewing the Board\u2019s decision is set forth in Md.Ann.Code art. 25A, \u00a7 5(U) (1987), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board and a party to the proceeding before it may appeal to the circuit court for the county which shall have power to affirm the decision of the board, <em>or if such decision is not in accordance with law, </em>to modify or reverse such decision, with or without remanding the case for rehearing as justice may require. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">The circuit court\u2019s standard of review is thus limited to whether or not the Board\u2019s decision is \u201cin accordance with law.\u201d The Board\u2019s decision may be set aside as not in accordance with law if it is arbitrary, illegal or capricious. <em>Mortimer v. Howard Research, </em>83 Md.App. 432, 441, 575 A.2d 750 (1990). In <em>Mortimer, id., </em>this court set forth the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>proper standard for determining whether a Board decision is arbitrary, illegal or capricious:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-4\">In making a determination of whether the Board of Appeals decision is arbitrary, illegal or capricious, the reviewing court must decide whether the question before the agency was fairly debatable. <em>Howard County v. Dorsey, </em>45 Md.App. 692, 700 [416 A.2d 23] (1980), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>292 Md. 351 [438 A.2d 1339] (1982). An issue is fairly debatable if reasonable persons could have reached a different conclusion on the evidence and, if so, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. <em>Eger v. Stone, </em>253 Md. 533, 524 [253 A.2d 372] (1969). The fairly debatable test is analogous to the clearly erroneous standard under' Rule 8-131(e) and a decision is fairly debatable if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole. <em>Dorsey, </em>45 Md.App. at 701 [416 A.2d 23], quoting <em>Sedney v. Lloyd, </em>44 Md.App. 633, 637 [410 A.2d 616] (1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">This standard of review is in accord with that established by case law regarding zoning actions. <em>Miller v. Forty West Builders, </em>62 Md.App. 320, 326, 489 A.2d 76 (1985). In this\u2019 appeal, \u201cthe role of this court is essentially to repeat the task of the circuit court; that is, to be certain the circuit court did not err in its review.\u201d <em>Mortimer v. Howard Research, </em>83 Md.App. 432, 442, 575 A.2d 750 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">The B.C.C. authorizes the CRG to take any of three actions with respect to a proposed plan. First, the CRG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>may take \u201cfinal action on the plan,\u201d B.C.C. \u00a7 26 \u2014 206(b)(1), which is defined in the B.C.C. as \u201cthe approval of a plan as submitted, the approval of a plan as amended, or the disapproval of a plan ...\u201d B.C.C. \u00a7 26-168. Second, the CRG may refer the proposed plan to the Planning Board pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 26-207. B.C.C. \u00a7 26-2Q6(b)(2). Finally, the CRG may continue the meeting to a later date \u201cin order to receive additional information or to resolve any development matter raised at the initial meeting regarding the plan.\u201d B.C.C. \u00a7 26-2Q6(b)(8). The B.C.C. further provides that in the event an applicant for plan approval or any other person is required to submit additional information regarding the plan the CRG \u201cshall continue its meeting to receive such additional information.\u201d B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206(c)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">The above provisions of the B.C.C. must be interpreted in light of B.C.C. \u00a7 26-208, which describes the nature and contents of the plan on which the CRG must act. B.C.C. \u00a7 26-203(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">[t]he plan shall set forth an <em>informative, conceptual, and schematic representation </em>of the proposed development in a clear and legible manner by means of maps, graphs, charts, or other written or drawn documents so as to enable the county and all reviewing agencies an opportunity to make reasonably informed decisions regarding the development. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The language of B.C.C. \u00a7 28-203(a) makes it clear that CRG approval is merely one stage (and an early one at that) of the land development review and approval process which takes a proposed development from its planning stages to its final form. As the Board stated in its opinion on the CRG\u2019s approval of the Plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>\u201c[a]t the CRG stage, the developer need concern himself only with generalities and not specifics of his proposed development. He may be granted approval of the conceptual plans, but numerous agency permits, inspections, and approvals will follow ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Thus, the use of the term \u201cfinal action on the plan\u201d in B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206(b)(l) cannot be interpreted to mean that the plan on which the CRG acts need be in finished form, or that no additional review or more detailed information, even on subjects generally addressed in the development plan, will be necessary in subsequent stages of the development review and approval process. This court\u2019s dicta in the case of <em>Miller v. Forty West Builders, </em>62 Md.App. at 320, 489 A.2d 76, is instructive. In that case, CRG approval of a plan was challenged because the overflow from a sewerage pumping station which was to serve the proposed development was operating over capacity and would pose significant health and safety hazards. The CRG had determined that the developer must have a study done and pursuant to a public works agreement must make any necessary corrections to eliminate any overflow. This court, in sustaining the CRG\u2019s action, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">[Pjursuant to the CRG\u2019s determination, the public works agreement is the mechanism to assure that the facilities are properly improved so that the proposed subdivision poses no health or safety hazards to the existing community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The CRG\u2019s approval in <em>Miller </em>was in some sense \u201cconditioned\u201d on the developer\u2019s performance of a later study. It was not necessary, however, for the CRG to hold another meeting in order to receive the results of that study, as the CRG\u2019s approval of the plan was not contingent on the study\u2019s results. Rather, the information obtained from the study was to be utilized at a later stage of the land development review and approval process, as foreseen by the CRG when it approved the plan. Thus, if a plan does not meet the requirements of B.C.C. \u00a7 26-203, or the CRG desires additional information regarding a plan, or wants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>settle or resolve particular development matters before it acts on the plan, then it is required to continue its meeting. But if the CRG has all the information before it necessary to approve the plan \u2014 that is, the plan satisfies the requirements of B.C.C. \u00a7 26-203 \u2014 and the CRG approves the plan on the basis of that information, then the requirements of B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206 are satisfied, regardless of whether additional information regarding the proposed development may be necessary in future stages of the land development review and approval process.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">With respect to the CRG\u2019s compliance with B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206 in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the circuit court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A55\">[T]his Court agrees with [Wiseburg] that the approval was conditional and as such was an action which the CRG was not authorized to take pursuant to [B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206]. The [B.C.C.] provides in part that the CRG shall either take final action on a plan or continue the meeting in order to take additional information or resolve developmental matters. In this instance, the CRG should have continued the meeting in order to give the developers time to resolve the remaining matters stated above. The additional information was needed in order to properly grant or deny.its [the plan\u2019s] approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The \u201cremaining matters stated above\u201d refers to the circuit court\u2019s earlier statement in its Memorandum Opinion and Order that \u201c[t]he approval was conditioned upon the satisfactory resolution of several matters, including: sanitation, storm water management, planning and traffic.\u201d This statement in turn is evidently a reference to the \u201cCounty Staff comments to be addressed\u201d numbers one (1) through six (6) set out in the CRG meeting\u2019s minutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those comments are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">County staff comments to be addressed are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>1. <em>Sanitation </em>required the trash pad near Lot No. 25 be relocated and the detail revised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">2. <em>State Highway Administration </em>comments numbered 1 through 6 must be addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">3. <em>Storm Water Management </em>comments stated that a storm water management waiver had not yet been granted, and that even if a waiver is granted, water quality would have to be provided. Approval of the Plan must be conditional upon satisfying storm water management requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">4. <em>Planning </em>comments numbered 1, 3, 4 and 6 must be addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">5. <em>Traffic </em>comments numbered 1, 2, and 4 must be addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-9\">6. <em>Developers Engineering Division </em>comments required that a note be added to the Plan indicating that the 24 foot roadway will be posted with no parking signs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQo\"><em>CONCLUSION: </em>The Plan was Conditionally Approved as described above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">We note at the outset that we do not consider the fact that the CRG used the word \u201cconditionally\u201d and the phrase \u201cto be addressed\u201d in the minutes evidencing its action on the Plan to be dispositive in determining whether that action was \u201ca final action\u201d in accordance with B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206. Whether the CRG\u2019s action was authorized by the B.C.C. must be determined by the content or effect of that action rather than by the name or description given it by the CRG. <em>See e.g. Houghton v. County Commissioners of Kent County, </em>305 Md. 407, 412, 504 A.2d 1145 (1986) (quality or effect of trial court\u2019s action, rather than form of docket entry, determined whether order was appealable). <em>Cf. </em>4 C.J.S. <em>Appeal &amp; Error </em>\u00a7 94(b) (\u201cquestion whether a judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable is not determined by the name or description which the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>below gives it, but is to be decided by the appellate court on a consideration of the essence of what is done thereby\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">\u201cCounty Staff comments to be addressed\u201d numbers one, two, four, five and six in the meeting\u2019s minutes refer to written comments on the Plan submitted to the CRG by various County agencies and included in the CRG\u2019s file on the Plan pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 26-205(f)(1). Our review of the record reveals that these comments are directives to Art Wood to amend details of the Plan in specific ways.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The information contained in the comments was part of the Plan file on 30 April 1987, the date of the CRG meeting. The CRG was not waiting for or seeking any \u201cadditional information\u201d regarding these comments before approving the Plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> All that remained for the CRG to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>with regard to these agency comments was to review the amended Plan to make certain that Art Wood had indeed complied with the agencies\u2019 and the CRG\u2019s directives. Nor does the fact that further ministerial action by the CRG may have been necessary with regard to the Plan prevent the CRG\u2019s action from constituting \u201cfinal action on the plan.\u201d <em>See Clarke v. Greenwell, </em>73 Md.App. 446, 534 A.2d 1344 (1988) (finality of resolution of board of county commissioners approving zoning petition did not hinge on ministerial act of attaching changes to zoning map). Thus, contrary to Wiseburg\u2019s suggestion, the fact that technical amendments were made to the Plan after the CRG meeting to conform the Plan to the agency directives set forth in the meeting\u2019s minutes before the CRG members signed the approved Plan does not impeach the validity of the CRG\u2019s action. As noted earlier, the CRG is empowered to approve a plan <em>as amended. </em>B.C.C. \u00a7 26-168 (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The third of the \u201c[s]taff comments to be addressed\u201d refers to stormwater management requirements. This comment suggests that the CRG\u2019s approval of the Plan was indeed \u201cconditional\u201d on the provision of \u201cadditional information\u201d to the CRG regarding the grant of a waiver of such stormwater management requirements and on Art Wood\u2019s providing \u201cwater quality.\u201d Our review of the record, however, reveals that the Plan was granted a waiver of storm-water management requirements prior to the CRG\u2019s 30 April 1987 meeting, and that this fact was known to the CRG and others in attendance at the meeting.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Stormwater management requirements are set forth in B.C.C. \u00a7 14-151 <em>et seq. </em>The responsibility for review and ultimate approval of a development\u2019s <em>stormwater management plans </em>(as opposed to development plans that receive CRG review and approval) is vested elsewhere in the County government than the CRG. B.C.C. \u00a7 14-156(a). With regard to waivers of stormwater management requirements, B.C.C. \u00a7 14-155(c) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqek\">the director of the department of environmental protection and resource management or his designated representative may grant a waiver of the stormwater management requirements for individual developments, provided that the applicant submits a written request containing descriptions, drawings, calculations, and any other information necessary to evaluate the proposed waiver request</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-2\">B.C.C. \u00a7 26-203 provides with respect to stormwater management requirements only that a plan must \u201ccontain information\u201d regarding \u201cstormwater management areas,\u201d B.C.C. \u00a7 26-203(b)(18), and that this information must be sufficient to \u201cenable the county and all reviewing agencies an opportunity to make reasonably informed decisions regarding the development.\u201d B.C.C. \u00a7 26-203(a). As B.C.C. \u00a7 14-155(c) clearly requires that information be provided to the County of a nature specific enough to satisfy the standard set forth in B.C.C. \u00a7 26-203(a), the fact that Art Wood had been granted a stormwater management waiver for its proposed development was enough to enable the CRG to take final action on the Plan as submitted without the need for \u201cadditional information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\">The meeting\u2019s minutes also state that \u201ceven if a waiver is granted, water quality would have to be provided.\u201d This statement is evidently a reference to B.C.C. \u00a7 14-155(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>which provides that \u201cwater quality practices may be required for any development, even when peak stormwater requirements are waived.\u201d Again, however, enforcing these requirements is not the responsibility of the CRG, but of other County officials at different stages of the land development review and approval process. That the grant of a waiver of stormwater management requirements does not settle every issue regarding a development\u2019s stormwater management plans, or that stormwater management plans may be revised subsequent to approval by the CRG of a plan conforming to the requirements of B.C.C. \u00a7 26-203, does not hamper the CRG\u2019s ability to take final action on a plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In ruling on the CRG\u2019s action on the Plan, the Board stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">The follow-up activities after CRG approval were not to correct aspects of the [P]lan that [Wiseburg] contends had \u201cconditional approval,\u201d but were a part of the orderly sequence of functions that take a schematic and conceptual plan through a series of permits necessary in the development process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Our review of the record reveals that none of the \u201ccomments to be addressed\u201d referred to in the minutes of the CRG\u2019s 30 April 1987 meeting actually constituted \u201cadditional information\u201d that the CRG needed before approving the Plan. Therefore, no continued meeting was required pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206, and the CRG was authorized to approve the Plan by directing that the Plan be amended in accordance with the referenced agency comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">In addition to its decision that the CRG\u2019s action on the Plan was a \u201cconditional approval\u201d and therefore not a \u201cfinal action\u201d under B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206, the circuit court ruled that the CRG\u2019s action on the Plan violated B.C.C. \u00a7 1-12, which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>(a)(1) [A]ll meetings of [any legislative or administrative body of the County], at which there is a collective decision by a majority of members of the body, a collective commitment by a majority of members of the body to make a decision, or an actual vote by a majority of the members of the body upon a motion, proposed resolution, order, or ordinance, shall be open to the public;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">(2) [A]ll meetings of two (2) or more [County officials] at which there is a decision, discussion, or determination of official policy or action shall be open to the public[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMI9\">The circuit court apparently reasoned that since the CRG\u2019s \u201cconditional approval\u201d of the Plan rendered some further decision by the CRG regarding the Plan necessary, and that, since the CRG never held a public meeting regarding the Plan after 30 April 1987, this decision must have occurred at a private \u201cmeeting\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\">The action taken on April 30, 1987 by the CRG was a conditional approval. The CRG\u2019s final approval came at a later meeting, not open and advertised to the public, and therefore, was a violation of the [B.C.C.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">For the reasons stated below, we do not believe that this issue was properly before the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">It is a well-established principle that judicial review must be sought in the particular manner provided for by the legislature where the legislature has so provided.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">It is apparent that in giving the right of appeal to courts, the Legislature conferred a special statutory jurisdiction on the courts and made the exercise of that jurisdiction the only right of the court to review the local board, to the exclusion of any common law remedy. No principle is better established than that in exercising a statutory power, a court is without jurisdiction unless it complies with the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-10\"><em>Scherr v.

Any person denied the rights and privileges conferred by this section may proceed to enforce those rights and privileges by petition for mandamus supported by an affidavit showing good cause, in the circuit court of the county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Because the jurisdiction of the circuit court to review an alleged violation of the Open Meetings law was limited to that method of review conferred by B.C.C. \u00a7 l-12(f), the issue was not properly before the circuit court as presented by Wiseburg.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Wiseburg contends that, even if we disagree with the grounds for the circuit court\u2019s decision, we should still affirm on the ground that the CRG, rather than approving the Plan, was required to refer the Plan to the County Planning Board pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 26-207. Even though this question was not decided below, we decide it in order to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal. Md.Rule 8-131 (1990). <em>See Dill v. State, </em>24 Md.App. 695, 332 A.2d 690 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">As stated earlier, the CRG has three options with respect to a proposed plan at its initial meeting. It may take final action on the plan, continue its meeting, or refer the plan to the County Planning Board pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 26-207. B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206(b)(2). B.C.C. \u00a7 26-207 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">In accordance with section 26-206(b) or (d), the CRG shall refer the plan to the planning board in the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">(1) The proposed plan conflicts with the master plan; <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The master plan for Baltimore County for the years 1979-1990 designated the area that the \u201cCoachman\u2019s Field\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>development lies in. as a \u201crural and agricultural area.\u201d It states that one of its recommended goals for rural and agricultural areas is to \u201climit development in these areas essentially to agriculture and agriculturally related uses.\u201d. Wiseburg argued before the Board that as the proposed \u201cCoachman\u2019s Field\u201d development was a residential development, it could not constitute an agricultural or agriculturally related use and therefore must conflict with the master plan.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Art Wood, on the other hand, maintained that the Plan did not conflict with the master plan because it was \u201crural in nature\u201d and because there were no specific uses designated in the Plan that could give rise to a master plan conflict.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition to the arguments of counsel, our review of the record indicates that the Board heard testimony on this matter from County officials. Based on this evidence, the Board found that Wiseburg. had not met its burden of proving that the CRG\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise illegal under B.C.C. \u00a7 26-206. <em>See supra </em>n. 3. It also appears from our review of the record that the intent of the master plan, as well as ascertainment of any conflicts between the master plan and the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>development plan, was addressed by the component departments of the CRG when (prior to the filing of the Plan) they met with Art Wood in a pre-development conference pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 26-202(2). Deferring to the expertise of the Board in making such judgments, we conclude that a reasoning mind could have determined based on the evidence that the Plan did not conflict with the master plan, and that, consequently, the CRG was not required to refer the Plan to the Planning Board pursuant to B.C.C. \u00a7 26-207. We therefore reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision and remand to the circuit court for entry of an order reinstating the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED FOR ENTRY OF AN ORDER CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-12\">.

Minutes are taken at CRG meetings pursuant to BCC \u00a7 26-206(b), which requires the CRG to \u201csummarize the action taken [at the meeting], in writing, as a permanent part of the plan file.\u201d The circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>court did not elucidate what evidence, if any, its review of the CRG\u2019s action was based upon other than the meeting's minutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\">. For instance, State Highway Administration comments one through six referred to in the minutes are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">On review of the submittal of [the development plan], the State Highway Administration will require the site plan to be revised.

Wiseburg points out that the written comments of the Baltimore County Health Department on the plan, which are also included in the Plan file, recommend that CRG approval only be granted subject to nine additional soil percolation tests being conducted on the subject property, suggesting that these tests constituted additional information the CRG required before approving the Plan. The CRG, however, evidently did not follow the Health Department\u2019s recommendations, as no mention is made of the Health Department\u2019s comments in \"Staff Comments to be addressed.\u201d Nor is the CRG bound to follow the recommendations of an agency regarding a plan. B.C.C. \u00a7 26-205(f)(1) requires only that such recommendations be \"considered\u201d by the CRG. In any case, had the CRG conditioned its approval on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>nine tests being <em>conducted, </em>as opposed to their results, the CRG\u2019s approval might still have constituted \u201cfinal action on the plan\" under the B.C.C. <em>See Miller v.

James McKee, who had prepared the Plan, had been notified of the grant of the waiver request in a letter dated 28 April 1987, two days prior to the CRG meeting. And the minutes make it clear that the CRG and others in attendance at the 30 April 1987 meeting were aware of the waiver being granted, despite the suggestion of the third comment. The minutes note that at least one community resident in attendance at the meeting expressed concerns regarding \"storm water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>management being waived,\u201d and that in response to this concern Jim Grammer, a representative of Art Wood, got up near the end of the meeting and \"explained that a waiver of storm water management was granted based on a reduction in run-off resulting from this development and explained how this can occur.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\">. Although Wiseburg\u2019s Order for Appeal cited Maryland Rule B2 as the authority for its appeal of the Board\u2019s decision to the circuit court, it is in fact B.C.C. \u00a7 26-133 of the B.C.C. and Md.Code Ann. art. 25A, \u00a7 5(U) (1990) which grant a right of appeal from Board decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">. We note that the Maryland Sunshine Law, Md. State Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 10-501 <em>et seq. </em>(1984), provides support for strict application in the case <em>sub judice </em>of the principle that judicial review must be sought in the particular manner provided for by the legislature. The Maryland Sunshine Law is a \u201ctouchstone\u201d for other Open Meetings laws in the State, <em>City of College Park v. Cotter, </em>309 Md. 573, 586, 525 A.2d 1059 (1987), and the legislative policies expressed in the Maryland Sunshine Law therefore inform our interpretation of B.C.C. \u00a7 1 \u2014 12(f). Section 10-510 of the Maryland Sunshine Law provides for enforcement of its provisions, and subsection (a)(2) states that \"[tjhis section does not authorize a court to void an action of a public body because of any violation of this subtitle by another public body.\" In conjunction with the 45-day statute of limitations on the filing of petitions seeking judicial review of alleged violations of the Law, \u00a7 10-510(a)(2) and (3), this provision expresses a legislative intention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>avoid the undoing of multiple stages of the deliberative process because of a violation of the Law by one public body at an earlier stage of that process. Those aggrieved by the actions of public bodies are therefore forced to press their claims before a court as soon as possible. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Wiseburg did not directly raise by petition or mandamus the alleged violation of B.C.C. \u00a7 1-12 by the CRG to the circuit court, but instead lumped this claim together with its other claims and presented them all to the Board, which after a de novo hearing affirmed the actions of the CRG. The legislative intent expressed in the Maryland Sunshine Law is all the more reason to insist that Wiseburg have conformed its effort to have judicial review on this matter to the manner provided by the B.C.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b771-12\">. Baltimore County Charter \u00a7 523(a) defines the specific role and import of the master plan as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-13\">The master plan shall be a composite of mapped and written proposals setting forth comprehensive objectives, policies and standards to serve as a guide for the development of the county.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b772-5\">. Wiseburg has refined its argument somewhat since its appearance before the Board, and now argues that the Plan clearly conflicted with the master plan because it was not a single farm residence on' a twenty acre parcel of land. This contention is based on the statement in the master plan that \u201cit is recommended that the County consider an overlay district to the Zoning Ordinance applicable to [rural and agricultural areas] requiring that any development other than single farm residences on twenty acre parcels be subject to special Development Evaluation review ...\u201d This statement, however, does not mean that any use of land in the area other than single family farm residences on twenty acre parcels necessarily conflicts with the master plan. Rather, it is simply a recommendation to the Baltimore County Council to amend its zoning regulations, a recommendation which the Council has not implemented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">. Art Wood has also refined its argument on appeal to this court. It points out that the subject property is in a resource conservation zone dubbed \"rural-residential,\u201d and that \u201cone family detached dwellings\" are uses permitted as of right in that zone. From this it reasons that single family, residential uses such as the planned \"Coachman\u2019s Field\u201d development are equivalent to \"agriculturally related uses\u201d and are by definition consistent with the master plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
