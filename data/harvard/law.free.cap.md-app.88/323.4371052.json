We have in this term, alone, provided that review for at least three prior cases: <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Carroll County v. Zent, </em>86 Md.App. 745, 587 A.2d 1205 (1991); <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Carroll County v. Wisner </em>[No. 1140, 1990 Term, per curiam, filed May 7, 1991]; <em>Carroll County v. Brothers </em>[No. 1141, 1990 Term, per curiam, filed May 16, 1991]\u00bb. In <em>Zent, </em>we recognized that the situation there in controversy arose out of the emerging suburban character of the county. The present issue involves the problems created by the desire to dispose of urban sewage sludge by utilizing it in land application on Carroll County farms. This is alleged to be justified as an \u201cagricultural practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A facility for the storage of 13,500 tons of municipal sewage sludge was constructed on Robert Neal\u2019s farm in Carroll County. No building permit or conditional use was obtained. Thereafter, on March 13, 1989, the zoning administrator notified the appellants, Enviro-Gro Technologies, Inc. et al. (Enviro), that the facility violated the zoning ordinance and directed the stoppage of any further work or utilization of the facility absent zoning approval. An appeal was noted to the Carroll County Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">After a hearing, the BZA rendered a decision. Among its factual determinations were the following <em>findings of </em>fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8k\">[T]hat the application of sludge to agricultural lands is an accepted agricultural practice____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aay\">[T]he purpose of the pit is to hold sludge which must be taken from a waste treatment plant and stored until it can be applied to the land____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AayH\">[T]he Board finds as a fact that the purpose of the pit is not agricultural use____ [T]here is no agricultural use associated with its storage. Rather, the pit is more properly simply a link in the chain of sludge transport and eventual disposal____ The existence of the pit responds not to a constant need for fertilizer on the Neal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>farm but to a fact of urban life \u2014 sewage treatment facilities generate sludge on a 24 hour basis and it must be removed continuously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">[T]he Board finds as a fact that it [sludge] is not fertilizer____ [S]ludge does not have a controlled analysis____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2a\">[T]he sludge storage pit is not a facility for the storage of liquid or dry fertilizer. Sludge has some of the properties of fertilizer, but it is not fertilizer as such. It is sludge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8I\">Sludge causes an odor. The ... Board smelled the sludge when they visited the facility [pit]____ Many of the protestants testified about the strong odor from the property____ [T]he Board finds as a fact that the sludge in the pit does cause an odor____ [T]he Board relies upon the testimony of Martha Hinson, the section head of the sewage sludge division of the Department of the Environment____ The Board accepts her testimony and finds as a fact that there is a stronger odor from a pit than from sludge spread on the fields.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">[T]he sludge pit takes on the character of a step in the chain of sludge disposal; and the ... pit allows Enviro-Gro to meet its commitment to remove sludge from municipal facilities on a regular basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\">* sjt * * sfe Sit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-14\">[I]t is a very large facility____ [I]t is a very major facility having a constant and immediate inter-action with the surrounding neighborhood____ [T]hese are not major incidents, but demonstrate the close quarters in which the residents ... live and the immediate impact which the sludge operation has on them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAeh\">The Board finds as a fact that this is not a suitable site for such a large scale facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-19\">The BZA then concluded that the sludge pit was not an accessory agricultural use, because it was part of a sludge handling operation, and that its storage of sludge was not for an agricultural purpose as defined in the ordinance. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>also concluded that it was not qualified to be a conditional use under the provisions permitting storage of fertilizer, because the sludge was not fertilizer as contemplated by the ordinance. It further stated that, even if the sludge <em>was </em>fertilizer, its storage did not qualify as a conditional use. The BZA then affirmed the administrative action except to reverse that official\u2019s determination that a sludge pit qualifies for a conditional use consideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">On appeal to the Circuit Court for Carroll County, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">First, the sludge storage ... fails to satisfy the \u201ccustomarily incidental\u201d requirement of Art. 6, Sec. 6.4, and is not, therefore, an accessory use. Second, because the BZA found that sludge application serves an agricultural purpose and Art. 1, Sec. 4.5, restrains the outright prohibition of \u201cstructures incident to the use for agricultural purposes ... \u201d, the sludge storage pit must be viewed as a conditional use under Art. 6, Sec. 6.3(r). Lastly, the BZA\u2019s \u201cshotgun approach\u201d to decision-making was both unsatisfactory and inadequate____ [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">It then ordered a remand in order for the BZA to make the complete and specific findings it said were mandated by Art. 17, \u00a7 17.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Enviro appeals and raises two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">1. Did the Circuit Court err in finding that the storage of sewage sludge, to be used for agricultural purposes, is not a permitted use in the Agricultural District under the Carroll County Zoning Ordinance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">2. Did the Circuit Court err when it held that farm storage of sewage sludge, to be used for agricultural purposes, is not an accessory use in the Agricultural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>District under the Carroll County Zoning Ordinance? <footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Although we do not agree with some of its reasoning, we perceive no error'in the trial court\u2019s findings as to those two questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Appellees/cross-appellants, Gary Bockelmann et al. (Bockelmann), argue on cross appeal that the appellants abandoned their request for a conditional use for the purpose of maintaining a storage pit for municipal sewage sludge. They also argue that, even if the appellants had not abandoned that application, the trial court erred in ruling that the BZA\u2019s findings were insufficient to justify the denial of the conditional use application. We find it unnecessary to address these two issues.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">Did the Circuit Court err in <em>finding </em>that the storage of sewage sludge, to be used for agricultural purposes, is not a <em>permitted or accessory </em>use in the Agricultural District under the Carroll County Zoning Ordinance?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">It is undeniable that the process of sewage treatment by which sludge is created is not an agricultural process. While it can be argued that not all land applications of sludge are for agricultural purposes, it appears that land application of sludge on Robert Neal\u2019s property is, at least in part, for an agricultural purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">The issue before the BZA and the trial court was to determine at which point, during the process from one extreme to the other, sludge lost its identity as a sewage by-product needing disposal and gained a new identity as an element of an agricultural use. That issue was a matter of fact.2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The BZA, in essence, determined that sludge retained its character as a sewage by-product until it was applied to fields for agricultural purposes; and that storage pits as such, and the Enviro pit in particular, served the primary purpose of responding to the continuous need for sludge removal from sewerage systems rather than the need for agricultural applications. Thus, the BZA found that the sludge storage at issue was <em>not yet </em>a permitted or accessory agricultural use. The trial court\u2019s opinion, although somewhat unclear, did affirm that part of the BZA\u2019s opinion, albeit upon different reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">We said in <em>Harford County v. McDonough, 74 </em>Md.App. 119, 122, 536 A.2d 724 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">The order of an administrative agency, such as a county zoning board, must be upheld on review if it is not premised upon an error of law and if the agency\u2019s conclusions on questions of fact or on mixed questions of law and fact are supported by substantial evidence presented to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs v. Holbrook, </em>314 Md. 210, 218, 550 A.2d 664 (1988), referring to the standards for special exception grants outlined in <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981), said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqKe\">The <em>Schultz </em>test accords with the general standard for judicial review of the ruling of an administrative agency, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>which we have defined as \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached; this need not and must not be either judicial fact-finding or a substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment.\u201d <em>Supervisor of Assess. v. Ely, </em>272 Md. 77, 84 [321 A.2d 166] (1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">Therefore, due deference must be given to the right of an administrative agency, such as the Cecil County Board of Appeals, to draw reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances presented before it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Additionally, the Court of Appeals said in respect to the treatment of factual inferences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201cThe heart of the fact finding process often is the drawing of inferences from the facts. The administrative agency is the one to whom is committed the drawing of whatever inferences reasonably are to be drawn from the factual evidence. \u2018The Court may not substitute its judgment on the question whether the inference drawn is the right one or whether a different inference would be better supported. The test is reasonableness, not rightness.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\"><em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 218, 550 A.2d 664 (quoting <em>Snowden v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 443, 448, 168 A.2d 390 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">We shall now examine the factual record, as contained in the extract, to determine if the BZA\u2019s factual findings are sufficiently supported, keeping in mind that \u201cif the evidence makes the issue ... fairly debatable, the matter is one for the Board\u2019s decision, and should not be second-guessed by an appellate court.\u201d <em>Holbrook, </em>314 Md. at 218, 550 A.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">The BZA\u2019s findings primarily relate to the sewage sludge pit being part of the sewage disposal process, not an agricultural practice. Mr. Pepperman, the appellant\u2019s project manager, testified that land application of sludge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>served an agricultural purpose. In reference to sludge management, however, he testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">Sludge is produced by ... municipal agencies. They enter into contracts with us ... to take their sludge from the waste water treatment plant and manage it in an environmentally sound manner, which we do through land application or other processes that we offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">* He * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">We have a proprietary process that heat dries sludge and creates a marketable product for use in the fertilizer industry____<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">* s\u00bb! sjt Hs :}: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">It means that it is utilized in the preparation of fertilizer blends, commercial fertilization blends.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Mr. Pepperman also testified that in emergency situations, sludge which was originally to be applied elsewhere was to be delivered to the Neal farm. Thus, an inference could be made that the primary compelling factor for the storage at the Neal pit was Enviro\u2019s need for storage, not Neal\u2019s need for sludge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For example, he stated at one point that the pit would be utilized \u201c[w]hen the weather or field conditions are such that we cannot go on to agricultural application sites of any of our locations.\u201d At another point, he was asked, \u201cNow ... it would be a fair statement, would it not, to say that you are going to put sludge in the storage pit on the Neal farm if weather conditions don\u2019t permit application on farms other than the Neal farm?\u201d He responded, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d He also testified that Enviro was under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>contract to take and remove a certain amount of sludge from sewerage plants equalling the plants\u2019 daily production. Mr. Pepperman also testified that Enviro\u2019s business was \u201c[t]he management of the sludge,\u201d and that the land application of the sludge was paid for by Enviro. There was no evidence that Enviro was involved in any agricultural business.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In letters to the county, Enviro, referring to an emergency situation and the county\u2019s stop work order, responded: \u201cEnviro-Gro has entered into contracts with municipalities which require Enviro-Gro to acquire storage facilities to be used when rain and frozen ground prevent application of manure/sludge to the Neal Farm ... Enviro-Gro requires the storage space immediately to fulfill outstanding contracts [with sewerage plants].\u201d George Wilson, another witness for appellants, testified on cross-examination that septic systems and sludge processes at issue in the case at bar were both \u201cparts of systems designed to process our waste waters.\u201d He was asked: \u201cWell, you would conclude then that a sludge storage pit is, in fact, part of our sewage treatment system?\u201d He responded affirmatively. He also responded that he agreed generally with a publication which stated, \u201csludge storage facilities and their use should be considered as a part of sewage treatment, posing engineering and monitoring problems that vary greatly.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Additionally, the evidence was uncontradicted that Enviro pays $100 per month for the right to maintain the Neal storage facility, and the Neals considered the pit to be Enviro\u2019s property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">It was, thus, fairly debatable that the pit was part of Enviro\u2019s operation. Enviro was involved in sewage treatment, not in the business of agriculture. Additionally, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>apparent that inspections of sludge storage pits are conducted by the Department of the Environment, Hazardous and Solid Waste Management Administration,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> not by the Maryland State Department of Agriculture. While certainly not conclusive, this is an indication that the State primarily considered the pit (and probably land application as well) as part of a sewerage system.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Additionally, it appears that a distinction is made between the process involved with sewage disposal and farm-generated manure disposal. From the testimony, it appears that agriculturally generated manure is regulated through a separate program, the \u201cAgricultural Waste Management Practices Approval,\u201d which involves the Soil Conservation Service\u2019s extension agents under a separate program partially financed through \u201ca federal state agricultural pollution maintenance program.\u201d This process was further described by Mr. Chicca as an \u201cagricultural approval program,\u201d which contrasts with the wealth of evidence establishing that sludge pits, generally, and the Neal pit, specifically, involved sewage treatment approval programs. Mr. Chicca also testified that, generally, farm-generated manure handling does not require a permit, in contrast with sludge handling, which does.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Mr. Chicca and Ms. Hyson also testified that land application is only one of several methods of sludge disposal; <em>i.e., </em>it is not purely an agricultural land application process.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>The standard of review used in zoning matters is that \u201cthe action of a zoning board will not be reversed on appeal if there is \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 in the record to support the board\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Zent, </em>86 Md.App. at 752, 587 A.2d 1205 (quoting <em>Neuman v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>23 Md.App. 13, 325 A.2d 146 (1974)). <em>See also People\u2019s Counsel v. Mangione, </em>85 Md.App. 738, 584 A.2d 1318 (1990). As we said in <em>Mangione, </em>when reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling, we apply a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard to its findings of fact and apply an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard to its application of the law to the facts. In zoning cases, the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard has been described as akin to, if not identical with, the \u201cfairly debatable\u201d rule. <em>Largo Civic Ass\u2019n v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>21 Md.App. 76, 318 A.2d 834 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The BZA found that the sludge from sewerage plants stored in the pit was still a part of the sewage treatment process, not yet sufficiently identified with agriculture to be considered a permitted/incidental or accessory agriculture practice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While there , was evidence both supporting and negating the findings of the BZA and the trial court\u2019s findings, that evidence which we have discussed was sufficient to make the BZA\u2019s decision correct. To the extent that the trial court disagreed with the BZA\u2019s finding that the sludge storage in question here was a stage of sewage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>disposal prior to its transmutation to agricultural use, it erred.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The Court of Appeals, in a case involving a denial of a use permit, stated: \u201cIt is a clearly established rule in the law of zoning that a court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Zoning Board.\u201d <em>Dorsey Enterprises v. Shpak, </em>219 Md. 16, 23, 147 A.2d 853 (1959). <em>See also Largo Civil Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>21 Md.App. 76, 318 A.2d 834. We, in discussing the law relative to rezoning, have stated that the courts may not substitute their judgment for that of the legislative agency, if the issue is rendered fairly debatable. <em>Anne Arundel County v. Maryland Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>32 Md.App. 437, 440, 361 A.2d 134 (1976). <em>See also Tennison v. Shomette, </em>38 Md.App. 1, 5, 379 A.2d 187 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>282 Md. 739 (1978); <em>Fitzgerald v. Montgomery County, </em>37 Md.App. 148, 153, 376 A.2d 1125, <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 737 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 854, 99 S.Ct. 164, 58 L.Ed.2d 160 (1978) (\u201c[jQt is fundamental that court review of actions taken by the zoning authority is narrow and restricted in scope.\u201d) The basic reason for the \u201cfairly debatable\u201d rule is that zoning matters are, first of all, legislative functions and, absent arbitrary and capricious actions, are presumptively correct if based upon substantial evidence; even if substantial evidence to the contrary exists. The zoning agency, in this case, the BZA, not the court, is considered to be the expert in the assessment of the evidence. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Meininger, </em>264 Md. 148, 154, 285 A.2d 649 (1972); <em>Brouillett v. Eudowood Shopping Plaza, Inc., </em>249 Md. 606, 241 A.2d 404 (1968); <em>B.P. Oil, Inc. v. County Bd. of Appeals, </em>42 Md.App. 576, 577, 401 A.2d 1054 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>The BZA, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>had to determine at what stage, in the evolutionary process of the transformation of human waste to agricultural product, the transformation was completed. Obviously, it is not an agricultural product at the time of its initial appearance. It concededly requires extensive treatment before it can even be considered for agricultural application. When being so considered, the sludge\u2019s constituent elements, such as metals, bacteria, nutrients, chemicals, etc., must be measured. Then its ultimate agricultural application is permitted, prohibited, and/or regulated based on its composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">Even when it finally is rendered as sludge, it does not automatically assume an agricultural identity, as much of the sludge so produced is apparently unsuitable for agricultural purposes due to its content or for other reasons. Some is further processed for ultimate inclusion as a constituent element of fertilizer; some is incinerated; and some is dumped in landfills. Even when the land application disposal method is utilized, the sludge may be applied either as an agricultural practice <em>or </em>as a <em>sludge disposal </em>practice. When used in mine reclamation, it would be part of the mining process, not an agricultural practice, even though it was used as a nutrient.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The BZA, as we perceive its findings and conclusions, determined that the actual application of approved sludge to farms, when applied <em>as a soil nutrient, </em>was an agricultural application. That finding, as we see it, did not negate its other finding that sludge storage pits, generally, and this pit, specifically, were part of a sewerage system. The two findings, given the necessity for determining a point where the character of sludge changes, were not in conflict, and the trial court\u2019s ruling to the contrary was error. We thus hold that, under the facts of this case, the BZA\u2019s finding that the storage pit was not incident to an agricultural practice was supported by substantial evidence; its decision was fairly debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The trial court, as we have said, erroneously rejected the BZA\u2019s findings; it, nevertheless, found that the storage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>sewage, generally, was neither a permitted nor accessory use under the Carroll County ordinance. Thus, albeit for different reasons than advanced by the BZA,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it found that the storage pit was not permitted. The BZA\u2019s finding that the storage pit was not a part of an agricultural function was supported by the evidence. Thus, although we disagree with the trial court\u2019s reasons, we affirm its ultimate decision on the two issues raised by appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">[W]here the record in a case adequately demonstrates that the decision of the trial court was correct, although on a ground not relied upon by the trial court and perhaps not even raised by the parties, an appellate court will affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 502, 403 A.2d 1221, <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1021, 100 S.Ct. 680, 62 L.Ed.2d 654 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The Conditional Use Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Appellants inform us in their reply brief of the enactment of a new zoning ordinance that would, if applicable, prohibit the conditional use at issue. They cite several cases in support of their assertion that the new ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>should not apply.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">W\u00e9 have reviewed <em>Maryland Board of Pharmacy v. Sav-A-Lot, </em>270 Md. 103, 311 A.2d 242 (1973); <em>Feinberg v. Southland Corp., </em>268 Md. 141, 301 A.2d 6 (1973); and <em>Mayor of Baltimore v. Poe, </em>224 Md. 428, 168 A.2d 193 (1961), all of which are cited in the appellants\u2019 reply brief as authority for the proposition that zoning is concerned with uses, not ownership. The appellants argue that these cases forbid the enactment of the new zoning ordinance which prohibits sewage sludge storage pits except on the grounds of sewerage facilities, because the ordinance conflicts with the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">There can be no question but that the legislative body intended to vitiate the trial court\u2019s findings. A legislative body\u2019s desire to negate a court\u2019s decision is not an unusual desire, and when that decision is properly negated, is legal and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Enviro ignores the language of the new ordinance, which describes the \u201cuse\u201d of sewage sludge storage, not its ownership. Enviro also disregards the BZA\u2019s finding that the use of sewage sludge storage pits was part of a sewerage system, and not an agricultural use. We have held that the BZA\u2019s findings were supported by sufficient evidence so as to make them fairly debatable. Most of the BZA\u2019s findings were based on use, not ownership. It held that the use of the pits served a sewage treatment purpose. We see no inherent validity problem with the interim ordinance and, further, note that its \u201ccomments\u201d as to the BZA\u2019s findings in the case at bar are more akin to our holding than to the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>In a case remarkably similar to the case at bar, the Court of Appeals dealt with a change in a zoning ordinance that occurred while the case was pending, but before the completion of appellate review.

We applied the <em>Yorkdale </em>rule, stating that \u201c[a]ppellee did not acquire vested or substantive rights by obtaining C.R.G. approval of the subdivision plan,\u201d although we ultimately held that the particular language of the new statute foreclosed its application to that project. <em>Miller, </em>62 Md.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>330, 489 A.2d 76. <em>In Teays v.

We first stated that the trial court\u2019s decision had been correct when made, but then reversed and remanded based upon the concepts enunciated in <em>Adler </em>and <em>Yorkdale. See Grant v.

As Judge Pollitt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>formerly of this Court, opined in a <em>nisi prius </em>decision during his trial court years, \u201cthe government can legislate faster than the petitioner can litigate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Accordingly, we hold that: 1) the trial court did not err when it held that the storage of sewage sludge was not a permitted or accessory use under the then-extant Carroll County zoning ordinance, although our affirmance is for different reasons than expressed by the trial court, <em>i.e., </em>the decision of the BZA, being fairly debatable, was correct; 2) the new zoning ordinance adopted since the decision of the BZA and the circuit court\u2019s decision applies, and thus the sewage sludge storage pit at issue does not now qualify for conditional use consideration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CARROLL COUNTY FOR THE ENTRY OF AN ORDER AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS; APPELLEE\u2019S MOTIONS TO DISMISS AND MOTIONS FOR SANCTIONS ARE DENIED; APPELLANT SHALL PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\">. We shall not address the BZA\u2019s findings on the conditional use issue, for reasons which will become apparent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b360-9\">2. Enviro appeals the circuit court\u2019s decision. For different reasons, the BZA had also held that the pit was not a permitted or accessory use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b360-10\">. The trial court agreed with the appellant that the issues it was reviewing were legal, not factual matters; it was, to a large extent, incorrect. For example, whether agricultural uses are, or are not, permitted is a matter of statutory interpretation; <em>i.e., </em>a matter of law. Whether a new process is, or is not, an agricultural utilization or at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>what point in a process it transmutes, however, is a matter of fact. The major portion of the case at bar involved factual determinations as to what was or was not agricultural, not an application of the law to a concededly agricultural utilization. In <em>Kassab v. Burkhardt, </em>34 Md.App. 699, 368 A.2d 1064 (1977), it was conceded that a certain utility did not exist, and that the ordinance required its existence prior to the grant of a special exception. The BZA interpreted the ordinance to mean something different; it was, thus, a matter of law. <em>Harford County v. McDonough, </em>74 Md.App. 119, 536 A.2d 724 (1988), involved the conceded abandonment of a non-conforming use for the requisite period. The zoning administrator nevertheless concluded that it was not abandoned pursuant to the terms of the ordinance; it was, again, a matter of law. The primary issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is not whether agricultural practices are permitted, but if and at what point a practice becomes agricultural. That is a factual determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\">4. The sludge to be stored in the pit at issue was not heat dried and thus was not intended for that type of use in the \u201cfertilizer industry.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\">. Although the sludge, once placed in the pit, was used only on Robert Neal\u2019s property, the evidence showed that, because of the inability to spread sludge during inclement weather, sludge that was destined elsewhere was placed in the pit when it could not be delivered to its intended destination. The pit\u2019s capacity was 13,500 tons. The total that could be applied at the Neal property was 14,000 tons per year. Thus the filling of the pit just once a year would completely satisfy the application capacity of the Neal land for which permits existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">. He also agreed, as did other witnesses, with the statement that \"part of sewage treatment is the agricultural usage of sludge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\">. While zoning ordinances normally are concerned with usage, not ownership, ownership may be relevant evidence to the use of property, especially when the \"owner\u201d is conducting a specific business such as sewage sludge disposal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b365-6\">. According to one of Enviro\u2019s witnesses, Mr. Chicca, the County Health Office (a State office) also has an inspection function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. Mr. Chicca, however, also identified the process as agricultural. At one point he testified, \"we believe that the primary responsibility falls on the sludge generators, okay to store, but we can certainly understand in an agronomic program the benefits to be derived by storage on the farm____ So you know you can make arguments one way or the other.\u201d If arguments can be made one way or the other, they can be considered to be fairly debatable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\">. Mr. Chicca testified that of \u201cseveral thousand animal waste storage facilities ... possibly a dozen [require permits],\u201d and that all activities involving sludge that occur off the premises of a sewerage facility require permits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b366-5\">. We discuss herein that evidence before the BZA which primarily supported its decisions. We have, of course, reviewed all the evidence. We are mainly concerned with the sufficiency of that evidence which renders the BZA\u2019s conclusion fairly debatable. In <em>Terranova v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>81 Md.App. 1, 566 A.2d 497 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>319 Md. 484, 573 A.2d 808 (1990), we emphasized a portion of our opinion in <em>Comm'r v. Cason, </em>34 Md.App. 487, 368 A.2d 1067, <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 728 (1977): \"If there was evidence of the fact in the record before the agency, no matter how conflicting, or how questionable the credibility of the source of the evidence, the court has no power <em>to substitute its assessment of credibility for that made by the agency, and by doing so, reject the fact.\" Terranova, </em>81 Md.App. at 12, 566 A.2d 497. (Emphasis in original.) We concluded in <em>Terranova, </em>at 13, 566 A.2d 497, that \"[t]he weighing of the evidence and the assessment of witness credibility is for the finder of fact, not the reviewing court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b367-5\">. Appellants, in their reply brief, correctly state that \u201d[t]he Court found that the farm storage of sludge is an agricultural use.\u201d The court\u2019s ruling conflicted with the BZA's finding that storage was not an agricultural use, though some land applications might be. As we have held that the BZA\u2019s findings were appropriate, and the court\u2019s finding to the contrary was in error, appellants\u2019 reply argument is inapplicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b369-8\">. As we have stated, we construe the BZA\u2019s finding to be: (1) that the land application of sludge for farming purposes is an agricultural use, and (2) that sludge storage and the storage facility, at issue here, under the facts of this case, were part of a sewerage system. These two findings are not necessarily contradictory, and both are supported by substantial evidence before the BZA. The trial court erred when it based its opinion on the BZA\u2019s finding that the application of sludge on farms served an agricultural purpose and stated that the Carroll County ordinance prohibited the prohibition of sludge storage facilities. In so finding, the trial court missed the point of the BZA\u2019s decision; <em>i.e., </em>that the sludge, when it is applied to farm fields for agricultural purposes, is an agricultural use; but that the <em>storage </em>of sludge, which is not yet being utilized in agriculture, serves the purpose of sewage disposal. The BZA\u2019s finding, that sludge stored in storage containments is often later used for non-agricultural purposes, is supported by substantial evidence. We also note that this pit belonged to Enviro, and the land upon which it was placed was rented by Enviro from Neal. If Enviro\u2019s argument to the BZA were accepted, these pits could be placed virtually anywhere in Carroll County as permitted uses, without being subject to any county approval process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. Appellees have filed motions to dismiss the entire appeal on ground of mootness created by the enactment of the new ordinance. They also argue that the use has been abandoned and thus cannot be a nonconforming use under the new ordinance. Appellants respond that the use has not been abandoned but its utilization was stayed because of this litigation. Except for the bald assertion in appellee\u2019s motion, the record is completely devoid of any evidence of abandonment. For obvious reasons, we shall deny appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[15]\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\">15. <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">.
