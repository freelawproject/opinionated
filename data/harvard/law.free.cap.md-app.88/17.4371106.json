He was sentenced to three years for battery, three years for possession of a deadly weapon, to run concurrently with the battery conviction, and three years for racial assault; the racial assault sentence to run consecutively to the other two sentences. On appeal, he raises the single contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the racial assault conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the evidence was sufficient and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 470A(b)(3) (Supp.1990) provides that a \u201cperson may not ... [hjarass or commit a crime upon a person ... because of that person\u2019s race____\u201d The test to be used in determining the sufficiency of the evidence is \u201cwhether the evidence shows directly or supports a rational inference of the facts to be proved, from which the trier of fact could fairly be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 535-36, 573 A.2d 831, 834 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The conviction challenged here arises from facts so disturbing as to be shocking. A ten year old black girl, while doing an errand for her mother, was called \u201cblack nigger,\u201d \u201cmonkey\u201d and \u201cchocolate mousse\u201d by a group of white boys and girls. She was then pushed and hit by one of the white boys. She ran home and told her mother and stepfather what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">The young girl and her parents went back to the scene of the name-calling and found, hidden in a stairwell, some of the- white boys who had threatened her. After the girl began kicking the boys, her stepfather pulled her up the stairs and away from the' boys. By this time, a crowd of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>people, all white, had gathered. As the girl and her parents started to run home, one of the white boys ran up the steps holding his head and someone yelled, \u201c[t]hat nigger stabbed my nephew in the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Appellant then came toward the stepfather with a knife. Someone in the crowd handed appellant a stick with nails protruding from the end and said, \u201cHit that nigger. Get that nigger.\u201d Appellant put the knife away and began repeatedly swinging the stick, wounding the young black girl on her leg. As appellant swung the stick, the crowd screamed \u201cget the black nigger\u201d and threw bottles and other items at the stepfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">After being chased by the crowd which was calling after them, \u201cniggers\u201d and \u201ccatch him\u201d, the young girl and her parents reached their home. They immediately called the police. When the police officers arrived at the house, it was surrounded by what the police described as \u201calmost like a lynch mob,\u201d numbering 80 to 100 people yelling, \u201cyou better lock the nigger up. If you don\u2019t we\u2019ll take care of it ourself. We will burn them out.\u201d The girl showed the police her wound and identified appellant, in the crowd outside, as the person who hit her. Appellant then ran up the steps of her house and told a police officer, \u201cYou better lock me up now or I\u2019ll take care of the nigger myself.\u201d Appellant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">He was subsequently convicted of battery as to the young girl and possession of a deadly weapon and racial assault as to her stepfather. He does not challenge the battery or possession of a deadly weapon convictions, but does claim that there was insufficient evidence to support the racial assault conviction. Indeed, appellant claims that he \u201cdid nothing which would indicate that his actions were motivated by ... race.\u201d This argument utterly fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">First, there is in fact direct evidence that appellant\u2019s actions were motivated by race. A police officer testified that immediately before appellant\u2019s arrest he told the offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>cer \u201c[y]ou better lock me up or I\u2019ll take care of the nigger myself.\u201d Thus, appellant\u2019s own testimony provides evidence that his attack \u201cwas not the result of any mistake or accident\u201d but rather was \u201cmotivated by racial prejudice.\u201d <em>Nelson v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 109, 121-22, 245 A.2d 606, 613 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Secondly, motive can be inferred not just from words but also from acts and conduct, <em>see Cardin v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 200, 213, 533 A.2d 928, 934 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>312 Md. 126, 538 A.2d 777, <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 827, 109 S.Ct. 78, 102 L.Ed.2d 55 (1988), and here appellant\u2019s conduct overwhelmingly demonstrates his actions were motivated by racial animus. He approached the stepfather with a knife, and attacked him with a nail protruding stick which was handed to appellant by someone in the crowd who instructed him to, \u201chit that nigger\u201d and \u201cget that nigger.\u201d Further, appellant was among the 80 to 100 person \u201clynch mob\u201d who followed this family home and screamed that the police, \u201cbetter lock the \u2018nigger\u2019 up or they were going to burn him out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Appellant\u2019s claim, that just because \u201csome people within the crowd were screaming racial slurs\u201d this \u201ccannot be imputed\u201d to him, misses the point. This evidence was not offered \u201cto charge defendant with responsibility for the crowd\u2019s actions and words, but to show his own state of mind.\u201d <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>525 F.2d 710, 713 (1st Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 945, 96 S.Ct. 1414, 47 L.Ed.2d 351 (1976). Evidence of the crowd\u2019s words and actions demonstrate appellant\u2019s own state of mind, because for a considerable period of time he was in the crowd, not as an observer, but as an active participant. <em>See Griffin, </em>525 F.2d at 713 (\u201cevidence of what the crowd had been doing and shouting indicates what, in action and words, defendant was responding to, clarifying if need be, his own words and motives\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In sum, there is absolutely no merit to appellant\u2019s claim that he \u201cdid nothing which would indicate his actions were motivated by ... race.\u201d Rather, there was clearly sufficient evidence to support the racial assault conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-11\">. No claim is made that the racial assault statute is unconstitutional. <em>Compare In re R.A.V., </em>464 N.W.2d 507 (Minn.1991), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 2795, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(6/11/91) (constitutionality of cross-burning statute upheld).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
