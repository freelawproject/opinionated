In his petition he charged that he was convicted because of perjury and conspiracy. The writ was denied, and he appeals here.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">His brief, filed here, is an argument to show that the facts of the case were insufficient to support a conviction; and the point is made that four of his witnesses were not summoned in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The evidence in a criminal case cannot be reviewed in a habeas corpus proceeding. <em>Blundon v. Warden of the Md. House of Correction, </em>190 Md. 740, 60 A. 2d 524. The petition does not allege that he issued summons for his four witnesses; nor what they would have stated had they testified; nor that he applied to the court for a continuance, so that he could have his witnesses summoned; <em>Walker v. Warden of the Md. Penitentiary, </em>190 Md. 729, 60 A. 2d 523; nor any facts- showing that the State\u2019s officers used testimony known to be perjured, or participated in any conspiracy to defraud petitioner of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
