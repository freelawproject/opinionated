Miller now confined in the Spring Grove State Hospital. According to a letter received from the superintendent of Spring Grove State Hospital, as a result of a trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore City where the petitioner here plead \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity,\u201d a judgment was entered \u201cthat, the prisoner be committed to Spring Grove State Hospital for Insane, there to be confined until he shall have recovered his reason and be discharged by due course of law.\u201d Code 1939, Article 59, section 7. In the brief filed in this court, the petitioner questions the sufficiency of the evidence in his trial in the Criminal Court. As it does not appear that the petitioner here is \u201cdetained for or confined as the result of a prosecution for a criminal offense\u201d this Court has no jurisdiction on appeal and the application must be denied.
