Petitioner is imprisoned under sentence of two and one-half years for \u201cstorehouse breaking\u201d [presumably \u201cstatutory burglary\u201d, art. 27, sec. 34], receiving stolen goods and larceny. He alleges that the commitment does not mention by what authority it was issued, and therefore is invalid and illegal; and that testimony was illegal, \u201chaving been given by a man of unsound mind\u201d, a former inmate of a home for the insane for four years, and \u201cthis information was known by the State\u2019s Attorney but still he failed to disclose it to the Court, and on that man\u2019s testimony alone\u201d petitioner was illegally deprived of his liberty. No copy of either the indictment or the commitment was filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>with the petition, but the petition shows indictment, conviction and sentence and therefore shows lawful imprisonment. There are no allegations or supporting affidavits as to facts showing actual mental incapacity of the witness and knowledge and concealment of such incapacity by the State\u2019s Attorney. Petitioner\u2019s allegations are bare assertions as to matters not possibly within his own knowledge. Non-disclosure of the witness\u2019s previous confinement in a mental institution falls far short of fraudulent suppression of evidence or use of perjured testimony by State\u2019s officers. The questions of guilt or innocence and the weight or sufficiency of the evidence cannot be retried on habeas corpus. <em>Rountree v. Wright, </em>189 Md. 292, 55 A. 2d 847, 848. The petition, therefore, does not allege \u201cfacts sufficient, if true, to probably show\u201d that petitioner is illegally detained. The petition, therefore, might properly have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The record does not contain a statement by the judge, \u201csetting forth the grounds of the application, the questions involved, and the reasons of the Court for the action taken\u201d, required by art. 42, sec. 3B, Code, 1947 Supplement. Ordinarily it might be necessary to remand the case so that such a statement might be supplied. However, as the petition on its face shows no. sufficient ground for issuing the writ, and might properly have been dismissed, we think it unnecessary to remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
