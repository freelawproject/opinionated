Warden of Maryland House of Correction, </em>190 Md. 717, 60 A. 2d 179, just decided. The application was dated May 23rd, filed in the lower court May 31st and received in this court June 3d.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The Act of 1947 took effect June 1, 1947. As this application was filed in the lower court, where an. appeal should be entered, before the Act of 1947 took\u2019 effect, no leave to appeal was necessary. The application will therefore be treated as an appeal under the Act of 1945, c. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"Ake\">Petitioner is imprisoned under sentence of eighteen months for jobbery. He alleges that \u201che did not get a fair trial\u201d, he was not guilty, and there was \u201cno direct proof\u201d. The questions of guilt .or innocence and the sufficiency of the evidence cannot be retried on habeas corpus. <em>Olewiler v. Brady, </em>185 Md. 341, 344, 44 A. 2d 807; <em>Bernard v.
