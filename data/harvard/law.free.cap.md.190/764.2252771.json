The application was denied for the reasons that considered either as an application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number><em>certiorari </em>or as an application for habeas corpus, no grounds are stated justifying issuance of either writ. This order was manifestly correct. The question of guilt or innocence and the weight or sufficiency of the evidence cannot be retried on habeas corpus. <em>Rountree v.
