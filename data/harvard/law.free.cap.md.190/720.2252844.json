He had been on parole for some other offense. He alleges that he was not guilty, he told his court-appointed counsel he was going to plead not guilty, counsel told him it would do no good b\u00e9cause of- the stolen whisky found at his house, counsel told the judge he pleaded guilty, the judge asked him \u201cif he understood the crime\u201d, he said \u201cNo\u201d; he \u201cdon\u2019t see how he could be guilty of larceny when no one saw him take anything\u201d, there was \u201cno evidence at all to prove that he was guilty of the crime\u201d.
