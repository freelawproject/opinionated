He says that this could not have happened because his accuser was drunk at the time. If the sentence was too severe, his redress is through the executive authorities. He could have obtained a trial <em>de novo </em>by appeal to the Circuit Court. Article 52, sec. 13; <em>Green v. State, </em>113 Md. 154, 77 A. 677. The questions of guilt or innocence and the sufficiency of the evidence cannot be retried on habeas corpus. <em>Olewiler v. Brady, </em>185 Md. 341, 344, 44 A. 2d 807; <em>Bernard v.
