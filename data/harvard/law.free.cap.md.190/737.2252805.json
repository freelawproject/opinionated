He claims that there was not sufficient evidence to convict him, that his wife testified that he broke her arm while the certificate from the doctor showed that her arm was not broken. Assault being a common-law offense and a misdemeanor the sentence is in the discretion of the court, according to the circumstances of the case. If the sentence was too severe redress may be sought through the executive authorities. <em>Hooper v. Warden, </em>190 Md. 723, 60 A. 2d 183, just decided. There are no docket entries or record to show lack of an indictment .to support petitioner\u2019s contentions. <em>Rountree v. Warden, </em>189 Md. 292, 55 A. 2d 847. There is no showing of denial of fundamental rights. The questions of guilt or innocence and the sufficiency of the evidence cannot be retried on habeas corpus. <em>Olewiler v. Brady, </em>185 Md. 341, 344, 44 A. 2d 807; <em>Bernard v. Warden, </em>187 Md. 273, 49 A. 2d 737; <em>Copeland v.
