Petitioner is imprisoned under sentence of two years for embezzlement. Art. 27 sec. 140. He alleges that \u201cthe commitment is faulty and illegal\u201d, because he \u201cwas found guilty of larceny of the third count\u201d, and there was \u201cno indictment for larceny in the third count\u201d. The third count of the indictment charges embezzlement and larceny in the language of art. 27, sec. 140, which \u201cmakes the offense of embezzlement larceny\u201d. <em>Crouse v. State, </em>163 Md. 431, 433, 163 A. 699. Consequently he is lawfully imprisoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">He also alleges that he \u201cwas brought to trial without his rights of a preliminary hearing and was therefore denied the right to prepare his defense properly.\u201d No facts alleged show any denial of hearing or of opportunity to prepare his defense. The record shows commitment filed December 22, 1947; appearance of counsel appointed by the court December 23, 1947; presentment December 24, 1947; indictment, <em>\u201ceepi </em>on bail\u201d, December 29, 1947; arraignment, plea of guilty of third count, judgment, January 6, 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">The record does not contain a statement by the judge, \u201csetting forth the grounds of the application, the questions involved, and the reasons of the Court for the action taken\u201d, required by art. 42, sec. 3B, Code, 1947 Supplement. Ordinarily it might be necessary to remand the case so that such a statement might be supplied. However, as the record before us shows that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>petitioner is lawfully imprisoned, the reason for the court\u2019s action is apparent and it is unnecessary to remand the case. <em>State of Maryland ex rel.
