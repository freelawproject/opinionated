After appellant requested a jury trial, the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Frederick County, Maryland. Appellant then elected to be tried by the court and was subsequently convicted of failure to obey a traffic control device and driving while under the influence of alcohol per se, with the remaining counts merged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant was sentenced to one year for driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>under the influence of alcohol per se, with all but ten days suspended, to be followed by two years supervised probation upon release.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Appellant timely appealed and presents the following question for our review: Was the evidence insufficient to support [appellant\u2019s] conviction for failure to obey a traffic control device?</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">For the following reasons, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">On March 12, 2009, at approximately 8:00 a.m., Deputy Daniel Schlosser, of the Frederick County Sheriffs Office, was on patrol on Route 26 near Waterside Drive in Frederick County, Maryland, when he observed appellant driving a vehicle. Deputy Schlosser observed appellant \u201c[sjwerving in and out of his lane.\u201d Route 26 at this location is a three-lane highway, and appellant was driving in the middle lane. Deputy Schlosser saw appellant swerve into both adjacent lanes \u201c[s]everal times.\u201d At one point, appellant swerved into another lane that was then occupied by another vehicle. As a result, that vehicle was forced to \u201cslow down and pull onto the shoulder.\u201d Deputy Schlosser then stopped appellant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">After approaching appellant\u2019s vehicle, Deputy Schlosser \u201cdetected alcohol on [appellant\u2019s] breath and [his] person.\u201d Appellant\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and his movements were \u201csluggish and clumsy.\u201d Appellant admitted that he had consumed four beers earlier that evening, and appellant\u2019s speech was \u201c[spurred, thick, [and] slow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Appellant was ordered out of the vehicle, and Deputy Schlosser administered several field sobriety tests, including the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, the walk-and-turn test, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>and the one-leg-stand test. Deputy Schlosser testified, over defense objection, that appellant\u2019s \u201ceyes showed lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation.\u201d Deputy Schlosser further testified that appellant exhibited six out of the six possible clues from the nystagmus test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Appellant also could not maintain his balance during the walk-and-turn test, and \u201c[sjtepped off line several times.\u201d Appellant exhibited five clues out of a possible eight during this field sobriety test. Appellant also swayed during the one-leg-stand test, and exhibited two clues out of four in that test. Deputy Schlosser testified over objection that he believed appellant was under the influence of alcohol. Deputy Schlosser placed appellant under arrest and read appellant the DR-15 advice of rights form regarding an intoximeter test. Appellant agreed to submit to a breath test and Deputy Schlosser transported appellant to police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Deputy Donald Linares, of the Frederick County Sheriffs Office, testified that he was a certified intoximeter operator. Deputy Linares saw that there was nothing present in appellant\u2019s mouth, and then waited twenty minutes before administering the test. After explaining the procedures used to test the intoximeter, Deputy Linares testified that the result of appellant\u2019s breath test was \u201c.15 grams of alcohol for 210 meters of breath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Appellant testified at trial and maintained that he was not swerving prior to being pulled over. He also claimed that he was stopped on Route 26, at a point before the road expanded to three lanes, for failing to stop at a stop sign. Appellant also testified that he signed the form agreeing to a breath test because \u201ceverybody tells me to sign it so I can leave. So of course I\u2019m gonna sign whatever they put in my face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention in this Court is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for failure to obey a traffic control device under Maryland Code (1977, 2009 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 21-201(a) of the Transportation Article (\u201cT.A.\u201d), on the grounds that the marks on the road designating the lanes of traffic are not \u201ctraffic control devices\u201d as defined by T.A. \u00a7 11-167. Additionally, appellant suggests that, whereas T.A. \u00a7 21-309 criminalizes swerving from lane to lane and T.A. \u00a7 11-168\u2019s definition of a \u201ctraffic control signal\u201d does not include lane markings, \u201cthe term \u2018traffic control device\u2019 does not refer to the markings on the roadway that designate the lanes themselves.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The State responds that the plain language of T.A. \u00a7 11-167 makes clear that \u201cmarkings\u201d refers to the lane designations on a roadway. The State also contends that T.A. \u00a7 21-309, which prohibits swerving from lane to lane, is \u201ccomplementary, and not irreconcilable\u201d with T.A. \u00a7 21-201(a), which prohibits the failure to obey a traffic control device. The State also asserts that, although all \u201ctraffic control signals\u201d are \u201ctraffic control devices,\u201d not all \u201ctraffic control devices\u201d are \u201ctraffic control signals.\u201d We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence following an action tried without a jury, Maryland Rule 8-131(c) provides: When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Further, following a bench trial, the test for sufficiency of the evidence is whether that evidence, if believed, directly or inferentially permits the court to be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant\u2019s guilt. <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533-34, 823 A.2d 664 (2003); <em>accord State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323 (1998). In considering the legal sufficiency of the evidence following a non-jury trial, the appellate court must determine whether \u201cafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 479, 649 A.2d 336 (1994) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (emphasis in original) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The Court of Appeals also has explained that, \u201c[w]hen the trial court\u2019s order involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 375, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005) (quoting <em>Nesbit v. GEICO, </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879 (2004)) (quotations omitted). In addition, this Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">An assessment of the legal sufficiency of the evidence is not an evidentiary issue but a substantive issue, with respect to which an appellate court makes its own independent judgment, as a matter of law. This is an area wherein the reviewing court is not at all deferential to the trial court. It makes the same determination on the same basis as does the trial court. In assessing legal sufficiency, we will look only at that which was formally received in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\"><em>Polk v. State, </em>183 Md.App. 299, 306, 961 A.2d 603 (2008); <em>accord Burlas v. State, </em>185 Md.App. 559, 568, 971 A.2d 937, <em>cert. denied, </em>410 Md. 166, 978 A.2d 245 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">T.A. \u00a7 21-201(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">(a) <em>Obedience required. </em>\u2014 (1) Subject to the exceptions granted in this title to the driver of an emergency vehicle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the driver of any vehicle, unless otherwise directed by a police officer, shall obey the instructions of any traffic control device applicable to the vehicle and placed in accordance with the Maryland Vehicle Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">(2) The driver of a vehicle approaching an intersection controlled by a traffic control device may not drive across private property or leave the roadway for the purpose of avoiding the instructions of a traffic control device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">A \u201ctraffic control device\u201d is defined under T.A. \u00a7 11-167, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">\u201cTraffic control device\u201d means any sign, signal, marking, or device that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">(1) Is not inconsistent with the Maryland Vehicle Law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">(2) Is placed by authority of an authorized public body or official to regulate, warn, or guide traffic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Both parties agree that the issue with respect to the instant case is the meaning of the term \u201cmarking.\u201d Appellant contends that \u201cthe term \u2018marking\u2019 does not include the marks on the road that designate the lanes themselves.\u201d The State responds that \u201cthe lane designation marks on a roadway are \u2018markings,\u2019 as they are placed on the roadway to regulate and guide traffic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">Because this issue is a question of statutory interpretation, we begin with the principles that guide our analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">We have stated the controlling principles of statutory construction so often that only the briefest exposition is necessary. Our predominant mission is to ascertain and implement the legislative intent, which is to be derived, if possible, from the language of the statute (or Rule) itself. If the language is clear and unambiguous, our search for legislative intent ends and we apply the language as written and in a commonsense manner. We do not add words or ignore those that are there. If there is any ambiguity, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>may then seek to fathom the legislative intent by looking at legislative history and applying the most relevant of the various canons that courts have created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"><em>Downes v. Downes, </em>388 Md. 561, 571, 880 A.2d 343 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The Court of Appeals has stated: \u201cOrdinary and popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of terminology within legislation.\u201d <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484 (2004). Consequently, in order to determine the plain meaning of \u201cmarking,\u201d \u201c[w]e may consult a dictionary to discern the generally understood meaning of a word.\u201d <em>Hackley v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 1, 14, 866 A.2d 906, <em>aff'd, </em>389 Md. 387, 885 A.2d 816 (2005). A dictionary definition of \u201cmarking\u201d is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">1: the act, process, or an instance of making, placing, or assigning a mark ... 2 a: a mark made ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 1383 (3d ed. 1986) (examples omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The same dictionary defines the noun \u201cmark\u201d in a myriad of ways. <em>Id. </em>at 1382-83. Pertinent to our discussion, a \u201cmark\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">b: something placed or set up to serve as a guide or to indicate position: as (1): a conspicuous object of known position serving as a guide for travelers &lt;a ~ for pilots &gt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">(2) : something (as a line, notch, or fixed object) designed to record position ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">In addition, the verb \u201cmark\u201d can mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-14\">1 a (1): to fix or trace the bounds or limits of: locate the boundaries of \u2014 usu. used with <em>out </em>... b: to set apart by or as if by a mark or boundary \u2014 usu. used with <em>off </em>...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 1383 (examples omitted). To \u201cmark\u201d may also be defined as \u201c[2 b] (2): to indicate, express, or show by a mark or symbol ... [2] d: to serve as an indication of the position or course of &lt;a sign <em>~ing </em>the city limits ... &gt;.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(examples omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Given these standard definitions, we are persuaded that a \u201cmarking\u201d under T.A. \u00a7 11-167 is a making or placing of \u201cmarks.\u201d \u201cMarks\u201d can be symbols, objects, or lines placed in a manner to designate boundaries and to serve as guides for, among others, travelers and drivers on roadways. Accordingly, we conclude that the lane designation marks on a roadway, such as Route 26 in Frederick County, Maryland, are \u201cmarkings,\u201d and therefore, \u201ctraffic control devices\u201d under T.A. \u00a7 11-167. Appellant\u2019s failure to obey these markings, <em>ie., </em>traffic control devices, was a violation of T.A. \u00a7 21-201(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Furthermore, even though the statute is unambiguous, our conclusion is supported by looking to legislative intent. As the Court of Appeals has explained: \u201cIn statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u2018to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 404, 978 A.2d 736 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Our research suggests that a version of the term \u201ctraffic control devices\u201d was added to the Maryland Code in approximately 1943 as part of the revision and reenactment of Article 66)6 on \u201cMotor Vehicles.\u201d <em>See Folck v. Anthony, </em>228 Md. 73, 78, 178 A.2d 413 (1962) (noting that Chapter 1007 of the Acts of 1943 made an overall revision to the motor vehicle laws, based on recommendations of the Commission on the Revision of State Motor Vehicle Laws). However, there is little in the legislative history, beyond plain language, suggesting the meaning of the phrase \u201cmarkings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Turning then to a consideration of the entire statutory scheme, we conclude that our understanding of the plain language of \u201cmarking\u201d and \u201ctraffic control devices\u201d is consistent with the overall legislative purpose of the transportation laws. <em>See Ray, </em>410 Md. at 405, 978 A.2d 736 (\u201cWhen the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the \u2018purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body,\u2019 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">According to T.A. \u00a7 25-104, the State Highway Administration (\u201cSHA\u201d) is required to adopt a manual for a uniform system of traffic control devices that \u201cshall correlate with and, as far as possible, conform to the system set forth in the most recent edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways.\u201d The Federal Highway Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation publishes that uniform manual, known as the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (2009) <em>(\u201cMUTCD\u201d)</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>The Introduction to the federal MUTCD provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Traffic control devices shall be defined as all signs, signals, <em>markings, </em>and other devices used to regulate, warn, or guide traffic, placed on, over, or adjacent to a street, highway, pedestrian facility, bikeway, or private road open to public travel (see definition in Section 1A.13) by authority of a public agency or official having jurisdiction, or, in the case of a private road, by authority of the private owner or private official having jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\"><em>Id. </em>at I-1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The website for the federal MUTCD also provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-9\">Pavement markings are a very important part of the communication system for road users along our Nation\u2019s highways and roads. Can you imagine traveling on a freeway, major highway, or city street without the information that pavement markings provide? Pavement markings help you correctly position your vehicle, guide you through the many different situations you encounter, indicate where passing is allowed, and warn you of upcoming conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-10\">In many cases, pavement markings supplement and enhance the messages of other traffic control devices such as traffic signs and signals. Sometimes pavement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>markings are the only effective way of providing positive guidance or communicating certain regulations or other messages. Because markings are located on the roadway directly in line with the travel path, they can be more prominently visible than other devices and you don\u2019t have to take your eyes off the road to view them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\">Pavement markings communicate their messages to you through a uniform system of colors, patterns, widths, symbols, and words. Uniformity of these features throughout the Nation, as required by the MUTCD, makes it possible for you to instantly recognize the meaning of the markings in any given situation and quickly react to them, enabling you to travel safely and efficiently along the roadway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_N\">MUTCD: Learn About Pavement Markings, http://mutcd. fhwa.dot.gov/kno-tutintro.html (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">In Maryland, the SHA provides a link to its version of the MUTCD (\u201cMdMUTCD\u201d), under the Business Standards and Specifications section of the SHA website, where links are provided to Design Manuals, Standards and Publications of the SHA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Part 3 of the MdMUTCD generally covers \u201cMarkings,\u201d and Section 3A.01 specifically provides the following functions and limitations of markings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">Markings on highways have important functions in providing guidance and information for the road user. Major marking types include pavement and curb markings, object markers, delineators, colored pavements, barricades, channelizing devices and islands. In some cases, markings are used to supplement other traffic control devices such as signs, signals and other markings. In other instances, markings are used alone to effectively convey regulations, guidance, or warnings in ways not obtainable by the use of other devices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">Markings have limitations. Visibility of the markings can be limited by snow, debris, and water on or adjacent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>markings. Marking durability is affected by material characteristics, traffic volumes, weather, and location. However, under most highway conditions, markings provide important information while allowing minimal diversion of attention from the roadway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">MdMUTCD \u00a7 3A.01 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Part 3 also includes provisions for the type of materials and colors used to create pavement markings. <em>See </em>MdMUTCD \u00a7 3A.03 (\u201cPavement and curb markings are commonly placed using paints or thermoplastics; however, other suitable marking materials, including raised pavement markers and colored pavements, are also used.\u201d); MdMUTCD \u00a7 3A.04 (\u201cMarkings shall be yellow, white, red, or blue. The colors for markings shall conform to the standard highway colors. Black in conjunction with one of the above colors shall be a usable color.\u201d). Further, a number of figures in the MdMUTCD clearly demonstrate that the colored markings placed on the pavement of streets and highways are \u201cmarkings\u201d as contemplated by the manual. <em>See, e.g., </em>MdMUTCD at 3B-6, Figure 3B-3. Examples of Three-Lane, Two-Way Marking Applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">In addition to Part 3 of the MdMUTCD, generally covering \u201cmarkings,\u201d there are numerous other marking provisions throughout the MdMUTCD dedicated to, <em>inter alia, </em>such areas as: (1) Highway Traffic Signals, <em>see, e.g., </em>MdMUTCD \u00a7 4D.01 (Traffic Control Signal Features); (2) Traffic Control Devices for Low-Volume Roads, <em>see, e.g., </em>MdMUTCD \u00a7 5E (Markings); (3) Temporary Traffic Control Zone Devices, <em>see, e.g., </em>MdMUTCD \u00a7 6F.71 (Pavement Markings);

or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">(3) When the center lane is allocated exclusively to traffic moving in the same direction that the vehicle is going and the allocation is designated by a traffic control device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">(d) <em>Obedience to traffic control devices. </em>\u2014 The driver of a vehicle shall obey the directions of each traffic control device that directs specified traffic to use a designated lane or that designates those lanes to be used by traffic moving in a particular direction, regardless of the center of the roadway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">(e) <em>Lane changing devices </em>\u2014 In <em>general. </em>\u2014 The driver of a vehicle shall obey the directions of each traffic control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>device that prohibits changing lanes on sections of a roadway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">(f) <em>Lane changing devices </em>\u2014 Trucks, <em>truck tractors, trailers, or buses. </em>\u2014 On a roadway that has two or more lanes for traffic moving in the same direction, the driver of any truck, truck tractor, trailer, or bus shall obey the directions of each traffic control device that requires the vehicle to be driven in a certain lane.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">(g) <em>Two-way left turn lanes </em>\u2014 In <em>general. </em>\u2014 On a roadway along which a two-way left turn lane has been provided through traffic control devices, vehicles may not enter that lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into the roadway or when preparing for or making a U-turn, and may enter only if the lane is clear of an opposing movement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">(h) <em>Two-way left turn lanes </em>\u2014 Distance <em>driven in making left turn. </em>\u2014 A vehicle shall be driven within a lane described under subsection (g) of this section the shortest distance practicable prior to making a left turn or U-turn or after making a left turn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">(i) <em>Two-way left turn lanes </em>\u2014 Left <em>turns made only from within certain lanes. </em>\u2014 On roadways along which a two-way left turn lane has been placed, left turns shall be made only from within such lane.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Certainly, there are references throughout T.A. \u00a7 21-309 to traffic control devices and it appears that appellant could have additionally been charged with violating T.A. \u00a7 21-309(b), based on the fact that his swerving forced another vehicle onto the shoulder of the roadway. <em>Compare Rowe v. State, </em>363 Md. 424, 430 n. 3, 441, 769 A.2d 879 (2001) (concluding that, in a case where the petitioner\u2019s vehicle was the only traffic in the area, a momentary lane crossing did not support a traffic stop for suspicion of violating T.A. \u00a7 21-309(b)), <em>with Dowdy v. State, </em>144 Md.App. 325, 330, 798 A.2d 1 (2002) (distinguishing <em>Dowdy, </em>where vehicle veered back and forth between lanes on a four-lane highway, from <em>Rowe </em>and stating that \u201c[t]his erratic driving created a potential danger to anyone who may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>been proceeding lawfully in the passing lane\u201d) <em>and Edwards v. State, </em>143 Md.App. 155, 171, 792 A.2d 1197 (2002) (upholding traffic stop and distinguishing <em>Rowe </em>because in <em>Edwards </em>the driver briefly veered into an opposing lane of traffic). Appellant arguably could have also been charged with violating T.A. \u00a7 21-309(d), for failure to obey the directions of each traffic control device that directs specified traffic to use a designated lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">But, even though there are two statutes that could apply to appellant\u2019s conduct in this case, the Court of Appeals has explained that \u201c[t]wo statutory provisions concerning the same subject matter are considered to be <em>in pari materia </em>and must be interpreted accordingly.\u201d <em>Chen v. State, </em>370 Md. 99, 106, 803 A.2d 518 (2002). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiM\">the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to effectuate the intent of the legislature. We presume that the legislature intends its enactments \u201cto operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law.\u201d Thus, when two statutes appear to apply to the same situation, this Court will attempt to give effect to both statutes to the extent that they are reconcilable. Nevertheless, \u201cif two statutes contain an irreconcilable conflict, the statute whose relevant substantive provisions were enacted most recently may impliedly repeal any conflicting provision of the earlier statute.\u201d We have stated, however, that \u201c[rjepeal by implication is not favored, and is carried no farther than is required to gratify the legislative intent manifested in the later act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGt\"><em>State v. Ghajari, </em>346 Md. 101, 115, 695 A.2d 143 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We discern no reason to repeal T.A. \u00a7 21-201(a) by implication based on the fact that appellant could also have been charged with violating certain provisions of T.A. \u00a7 21-309. Indeed, \u201c[i]t is well-settled that the determination of which criminal charges, if any, to bring is a matter of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d <em>Beverly v. State, </em>349 Md. 106, 121, 707 A.2d 91 (1998); <em>see also Evans v. State, </em>396 Md. 256, 298, 914 A.2d 25, <em>cert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 835, 128 S.Ct. 65, 169 L.Ed.2d 53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>(2007) (\u201cState\u2019s Attorneys retain the broad discretion ... in determining which cases to prosecute, which offenses to charge, and how to prosecute the cases they bring.\u201d). Further, we agree with the State that \u201cthe two statutes are, in fact, complementary, and not irreconcilable. Indeed, while [T.A.] \u00a7 21-309, specifically proscribes the behavior of unsafe lane changes, it is completely consistent with [T.A.] \u00a7 21-201(a)(1) that requires drivers to obey any traffic control devices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contention will not require significant discussion. Appellant suggests that interpreting T.A. \u00a7 11-167 (Traffic control device), depends on a reading of T.A. \u00a7 11-168 (Traffic control signal). The latter statute provides that a \u201c[t]raffic control signal\u201d is \u201cany traffic control device, whether manually, electrically, or mechanically operated, by which traffic alternately is directed to stop and permitted to proceed.\u201d T.A. \u00a7 11-168. Clearly, the meaning of traffic control devices is not limited to that of traffic control signals. Traffic control signals are simply a subset of traffic control devises. As previously stated, pavement markings designating lanes of travel constitute \u201ctraffic control devices.\u201d Because appellant was seen swerving from lane to lane \u201c[several times,\u201d the evidence was more than sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for failure to obey a traffic control device pursuant to T.A. \u00a7 21-201(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY AFFIRMED.
