(Jackson Hewitt). On February 4, 2009, appellant filed a Complaint against appellee alleging violations of the Credit Services Businesses Act (CSBA), Md.Code (2005 Rep. Vol., 2007 Supp.), Commercial Law, C.L. \u00a7 14-1901 <em>et seq. </em>and the Consumer Protection Act, C.L. \u00a7 13-301 <em>et seq. </em>Appellee moved to dismiss appellant\u2019s claims, which the circuit court granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant noted a timely appeal to this Court and presents one question for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">Did the circuit court err in dismissing appellant\u2019s claims on the grounds that the CSBA does not apply to appellee?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">For the reasons that follow, we answer appellant\u2019s question in the negative. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Appellant\u2019s Complaint alleged that, on February 6, 2007, appellee prepared her 2006 Federal Income Tax Return. At that time, appellee assisted appellant in acquiring a Refund Anticipation Loan (RAL) from a lender, Santa Barbara Bank &amp; Trust (SBBT) in anticipation of her income tax refund. Appellant asserted that she \u201cindirectly paid\u201d appellee for arranging the RAL \u201cin that the credit that [appellee] obtained for her included in its principal amount the cost of obtaining this extension of credit.\u201d She further alleged that appellee included in \u201cits principal amount fees charged by [appellee] for the preparation and filing of her federal income tax return.\u201d Appellant elected to use part of her RAL to pay appellee\u2019s tax preparation fee of $284.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Appellant alleged that appellee failed to obtain the required license from the Commissioner of Financial Regulation of the Department of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation (the Commissioner) pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 14-902, failed to obtain a surety bond pursuant to Section 14-1908 and failed to provide her with numerous \u201cdocuments and disclosures\u201d required by Sections 14-1904, 14-1905 and 14-1906.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Appellee filed a Motion to Dismiss on the grounds that its actions in providing appellant with the RAL did not fall within the purview of the CSBA because she failed to establish that she was a \u201cconsumer\u201d within the meaning of the CSBA and that she did not pay anything of value to appellee in exchange for receiving credit services.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">On June 18, 2009, the circuit court held a hearing on appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. On June 23, 2009, the circuit court filed a Memorandum Opinion and Order dismissing appellant\u2019s claims. Based upon appellant\u2019s Complaint, the circuit court determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">[Appellant\u2019s] RAL application says that she expected a federal tax refund of $2,323, that she has requested a RAL from SBBT, and that the estimated amount of her loan disbursement is $1,950.97, net of loan and fees and the $284 tax preparation fee owed to [appellee]. The loan agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>[appellant] entered into with SBBT is clear that it is for a loan in anticipation of her federal tax refund. In addition to [appellee\u2019s] tax preparation fee of $284, [appellant] agreed to pay SBBT a handling fee of $29.95 and prepaid finance charges of $58.08.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The circuit court initially examined appellant\u2019s claim under the CSBA and found that the definition of a \u201ccredit service business\u201d in \u00a7 14-1901(e) and \u201cconsumer\u201d in \u00a7 14-1901(c) were ambiguous; thus, it looked to the legislative history of the CSBA, which was enacted on May 14, 1987 as 1987 Md. Laws, ch. 469. The trial court examined the Fiscal and Policy Note, along with numerous documents in the bill file, and concluded that the General Assembly sought to regulate credit repair agencies by enacting the CSBA. Thus, the circuit court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">It is manifest that the reason why the General Assembly passed the CSBA was to protect unsuspecting Marylanders from credit repair agencies who offered to \u2018fix\u2019 their credit rating, or to obtain loans for the credit impaired customer, in exchange for a fee. The CSBA simply was neither intended nor designed to cover firms engaged in the business of selling goods or services to their customers, when such goods or services are not aimed at improving one\u2019s credit rating. Nor was it intended to cover the extension of credit by a third-party, not privy to the primary transaction, which is ancillary to the customer\u2019s purchase of the goods or services provided by the merchant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">[Appellant] is [sic] this case neither had a contract with [appellee] in return for credit services nor a contract for the extension of credit. The documents appended to her complaint make it clear that her contract in this regard was with SBBT and that the fee she paid for the extension of credit was paid by her to SBBT. The only fee [appellant] was obligated to pay to [appellee] was the $284.00 she agreed to pay for the preparation of her income tax returns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Count I will be dismissed for failure to state a claim. Additionally, because relief under count II is dependent upon a cognizable claim under Count I, it will be dismissed as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Thereafter, appellant noted an appeal to this Court. Additional facts shall be supplied <em>infra </em>as warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The Court of Appeals recently reiterated the standard of review of a grant of a motion to dismiss a plaintiffs Complaint for failure to state a claim in <em>RRC Northeast, LLC v. BAA Md., Inc., </em>413 Md. 638, 643, 994 A.2d 430 (2010).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">Considering a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, a court must assume the truth of, and view in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, all well-pleaded facts and allegations contained in the complaint, as well as all inferences that may reasonably be drawn from them, and order dismissal only if the allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford relief to the plaintiff, <em>i.e., </em>the allegations do not state a cause of action for which relief may be granted. <em>Lloyd v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>397 Md. 108, 121-22, 916 A.2d 257, 264-65 (2007); <em>Sprenger v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>400 Md. 1, 21, 926 A.2d 238, 249-50 (2007); <em>Pendleton v. Slate, </em>398 Md. 447, 458-60, 921 A.2d 196, 203-04 (2007); <em>Converge Servs. Group, LLC v. Curran, </em>383 Md. 462, 475, 860 A.2d 871, 878-79 (2004); <em>Fioretti v. Maryland Stale Bd. of Dental Exam\u2019rs, </em>351 Md. 66, 71-72, 716 A.2d 258, 261 (1998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\"> In addition, we review the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of the CSBA <em>de novo. Herlson v. RTS Residential Block 5, LLC, 191 </em>Md.App. 719, 730, 993 A.2d 699 (2010) (\u201cwe review the Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute <em>de novo.\u201d) </em>(quoting <em>Gleneagles, Inc. v. Hanks, </em>385 Md. 492, 496, 869 A.2d 852 (2005)). Thus, we are tasked with determining whether the circuit court erroneously interpreted the CSBA to pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>elude appellant\u2019s claims against appellee, based upon the facts as pleaded by appellant in her Complaint, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Appellant contends that the CSBA applies to \u201cloan arrangers\u201d such as appellee, based upon a reading of the plain language of the statute. Specifically, appellant posits that appellee falls within the plain language of the statutory definition of a \u201ccredit services business\u201d and she falls within the definition of a \u201cconsumer\u201d under C.L. \u00a7 14-1901. Alternatively, she argues that, if there is any ambiguity that requires an examination of the legislative history, the legislative history reveals that the General Assembly intended to target businesses like appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Appellee counters that the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and Jackson Hewitt falls outside its purview. In addition, appellee claims that the legislative history confirms that the General Assembly did not intend for the statute to apply to Jackson Hewitt. Finally, appellee points out that, in May 2010, the General Assembly enacted a statute that specifically targets tax preparation businesses engaged in facilitating RALs, which undermines appellant\u2019s interpretation of the CSBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">For the reasons that follow, we agree with appellee. The plain meaning of the language supports appellee\u2019s position and we think the legislative history undergirding the enactment of CSBA and subsequent amendments indicates that the General Assembly did not contemplate the statute\u2019s application to businesses such as Jackson Hewitt. The enactment of 2010 Md. Laws, ch. 730 further supports our interpretation of the CSBA. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\n<em>The Plain Language of the CSBA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Initially, appellant contends that the language of the CSBA plainly applies to \u201cloan arrangers\u201d such as appellee. The CSBA seeks to regulate \u201ccredit services businesses\u201d by imposing licensing requirements, implementing disclosure require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ments, providing for an administrative review process for complaints and providing monetary and criminal penalties for violations. Section 14-1901 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">(c) Consumer. \u2014 \u201cConsumer\u201d means any individual who is solicited to purchase or who purchases for personal, family, or household purposes the services of a credit services business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">(e) Credit services business.'\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">(1) \u201cCredit services business\u201d means any person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others, sells, provides, or performs, or represents that such person can or will sell, provide, or perform, any of the following services in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">(i) Improving a consumer\u2019s credit record, history, or rating or establishing a new credit file or record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-9\">(ii) <em>Obtaining an extension of credit for a consumer; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">(iii) Providing advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to either subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-11\">(2) \u201cCredit services business\u201d includes a person who sells or attempts to sell written materials containing information that the person represents will enable a consumer to establish a new credit file or record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-12\">(3) \u201cCredit services business\u201d does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-13\">(i) Any person authorized to make loans or extensions of credit under the laws of this State or the United States who is actively engaged in the business of making loans or other extensions of credit to residents of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">(ii) Any bank, trust company, savings bank, or savings and loan association whose deposits or accounts are eligible for insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any credit union organized and chartered under the laws of this State or the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>(ni) Any nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">(iv) Any person licensed as a real estate broker by this State where the person is acting within the course and scope of that license;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">(v) Any person licensed as a mortgage lender by this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">(vi) An individual admitted to the Bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland when the individual renders services within the course and scope of practice by the individual as a lawyer and does not engage in the credit services business on a regular and continuing basis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">(vii) Any broker-dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission where the broker-dealer is acting within the course and scope of that regulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">(viii) Any consumer reporting agency as defined in the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 168\u20141681t) or in \u00a7 14-1201(e) of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">(ix) An individual licensed by the Maryland Board of Public Accountancy when the individual renders services within the course and scope of practice by the individual as a certified public accountant and does not engage in the credit services business on a regular and continuing basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">Appellant argues that the statute defines a \u201ccredit services business\u201d as any business that, in exchange for a fee on behalf of others, promises to (1) improve a \u201cconsumer\u2019s credit record, history, or rating or establishing a new credit file or record,\u201d obtain \u201can extension of credit for a consumer\u201d <em>or </em>(3) provide \u201cadvice or assistance to a consumer\u201d regarding improving credit or obtaining an extension of credit. Because the provision is written in the disjunctive, according to appellant, it is therefore plain that appellee, who obtains extensions of credit on behalf of its customers through RALs, falls within the purview of the CSBA and no further construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>statute is necessary. In addition, appellant points out that C.L. \u00a7 14-1901(e)(3) provides a list of exemptions from the category of \u201ccredit services business\u201d and appellee, as a tax preparer who also facilitates RALs, does not fall within any of the enumerated exemptions. Thus, according to appellant, the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">With regard to the issue generated in the trial court as to whether appellant is a \u201cconsumer\u201d under the plain language of the statute, appellant maintains that the statute in no way suggests that a \u201cconsumer\u201d is a person who pays the credit services business <em>directly. </em>C.L. \u00a7 14-1901(c) provides that a consumer is \u201cany individual who is solicited to purchase or who purchases for personal, family, or household purposes the services of a credit services business.\u201d According to appellant, to imply that the statute requires her to pay appellee <em>directly </em>would impermissibly add terms to the statute and narrow its applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In addition, appellant points to another provision of the statute, \u00a7 14-1906(a), which sets forth requirements for the contract between the credit services business and the consumers. Section 14-1906 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">(a) Requirements. \u2014 Every contract between a consumer and a credit services business for the purchase of the services of the credit services business shall be in writing, dated, signed by the consumer, and shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">(1) A conspicuous statement in size equal to at least 10-point bold type, in immediate proximity to the space reserved for the signature of the consumer as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">\u201cYou, the buyer, may cancel this contract at any time prior to midnight of the third business day after the date of the transaction. See the attached notice of cancellation form for an explanation of this right.\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">(2) The terms and conditions of payment, including the total of all payments to be made by the consumer, whether to the credit services business <em>or to some other person;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Appellant contends that this language is an indication that the General Assembly expressly contemplated that a consum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>er falling within the ambit of the statute would make payments to third parties. Appellant adds that, if the General Assembly had intended to limit the class of consumers to which the statute applied to those who paid the credit services business directly, it would have included language to that effect. In support of this contention, appellant directs our attention to a similar Ohio statute, which was construed in <em>Snook v. Ford Motor Co., 142 </em>Ohio App.3d 212, 755 N.E.2d 380, 383 (2001), wherein the Ohio Credit Services Organization Act formerly explicitly required payment to flow directly from the consumer to the credit services organization. A credit services organization was originally defined in the Ohio statute as \u201cany person that charges or receives, <em>directly from the buyer, </em>money or other valuable consideration easily convertible into money, and that sells, provides, or performs, or represents that the person can or will sell, provide, or perform, any of the following services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7 4712.01(C)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">In 1999, the Ohio legislature amended the statute and Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 4712.01(C)(1) (LexisNexis 2010) now provides: \u201c \u2018Credit services organization\u2019 means any person that, in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration readily convertible into money for the following services, sells, provides, or performs, or represents that the person can or will sell, provide, or perform, one or more of the following services----\u201d Appellant argues that if the General Assembly intended to impose such a specific requirement, it would have included language similar to the language originally included in the Ohio statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Similarly, appellant directs our attention to the Federal Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1679a(3)(A) defines a \u201ccredit repair organization\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails to sell, provide, or perform (or represent that such person can or will sell, provide, or perform) any service, in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration, for the express or implied purpose of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>(i) improving any consumer\u2019s credit record, credit history, or credit rating; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">(ii) providing advice or assistance to any consumer with regard to any activity or service described in clause (i).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AON\">Appellant points out that the CROA \u201ccontains the exact same \u2018in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration\u2019 \u201d language that the CSBA contains and cites several unreported trial court rulings interpreting the CROA and holding that a consumer need not pay the credit repair organization directly in order to fall within the CROA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The Commissioner of Financial Regulation (the Commissioner) and The Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland have together filed a Brief of <em>Amici Curiae </em>and add to appellant\u2019s plain language argument that there is no language in the statute that suggests that the CSBA is targeted at regulating the activities of \u201ctraditional credit repair services.\u201d Instead, <em>amici </em>argue that C.L. \u00a7 14-1901(e) applies to credit services businesses who either obtain an extension of credit for a consumer or who provide assistance in obtaining an extension of credit. Section 14-1901 (f) defines an extension of credit as \u201cthe right to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its payment, offered or granted primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u201d <em>Amici </em>contend that, \u201cwhen a consumer obtains an RAL, it is an extension of credit within the meaning of the statute because the consumer incurs a debt for which payment is deferred and the debt is \u2018primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Appellee counters that a reading of the plain language of the CSBA supports its contention that the CSBA does not apply in this case. Appellee argues that appellant did not purchase any services from Jackson Hewitt with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the RAL and that it was undisputed that she did not make any payments to appellee, precluding a finding that she is a \u201cconsumer\u201d within the meaning of the CSBA. Appellee explains that the only services that appellant purchased from Jackson Hewitt were tax preparation services, \u201cthe charge for which was not dependent upon her application for a RAL.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Appellee contends that appellant\u2019s interpretation of the CSBA attempts to insert language not present in the statute to re-define a \u201cconsumer\u201d as a person who purchases the services of a credit services business \u201cor <em>who applies for a loan from a lender who, in turn, purchases the services of a third party.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Appellee posits that, reading the CSBA as a whole, it is plain that the General Assembly did not contemplate its application to businesses such as Jackson Hewitt, facilitating RALs. Appellee points out that C.L. \u00a7 14-1902(1) contemplates payment for credit services to come directly from the consumer. Section 14-1902(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">A credit services business, its employees, and independent contractors who sell or attempt to sell the services of a credit services business shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">(1) Receive any money or other valuable consideration <em>from the consumer, </em>unless the credit services business has secured from the Commissioner a license under Title 11, Subtitle 3 of the Financial Institutions Article;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Appellee, like appellant, also directs us to C.L. \u00a7 14-1906(a)(2), which outlines contract requirements between the credit services business and the consumer and provides: \u201cThe terms and conditions of payment, including the total of all payments <em>to be made by the consumer, </em>whether to the credit services business or to some other person.\u201d (Emphasis added). Appellee contends that SBBT \u201cpurchased\u201d its RAL services, not appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">With regard to the definition of \u201ccredit services business,\u201d appellee posits that appellant\u2019s argument also requires \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>writing\u201d the statute to define a credit services business as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-4\">any person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others, sells, provides, or performs, or represents that such person can or will sell, provide or perform, any of the following services in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration <em>regardless of the </em>source....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">But, appellee argues, the words \u201cin return\u201d are present in the statute because the General Assembly contemplated the giving by one party of something of value in exchange for another thing of value from the other party and we cannot read the statute so as to render those words meaningless. Further, appellee contends, the words \u201cregardless of the source\u201d do not appear in the definition of a credit services business, suggesting that the General Assembly contemplated the source of payment to be the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Finally, appellee directs our attention to two unreported state trial court orders from trial courts in Missouri and Ohio in which the trial courts ruled that similar statutes in those states did not apply to appellee. These rulings, along with the ruling of the trial court in the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellee maintains, are consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois in <em>Midstate Siding and Window Co., Inc. v. Rogers, </em>204 Ill.2d 314, 273 Ill.Dec. 816, 789 N.E.2d 1248 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">In <em>Midstate, </em>the Court was tasked with determining whether Midstate, a home improvement company, was a \u201ccredit services organization\u201d under the Illinois Credit Services Act. Midstate contracted with the Rogers to install windows and siding on the Rogers\u2019 home. <em>Id., </em>273 Ill.Dec. 816, 789 N.E.2d at 1250-51. The Rogers, however, could not afford the full price of the windows and siding; thus, Midstate offered to assist the Rogers in obtaining financing. <em>Id. </em>The Rogers filled out a credit application that Midstate forwarded to a lending institution, which in turn, agreed to provide a home equity loan to the Rogers. <em>Id. </em>Midstate argued that the assistance with financing was a \u201cgratuitous service.\u201d <em>Id., </em>273 Ill.Dec. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>816, 789 N.E.2d at 1251. The Illinois Credit Organizations Act provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">\u201c(a) \u2018Buyer\u2019 means an individual who is solicited to purchase or who purchases the services of a credit services organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">(d) \u2018Credit Services Organization\u2019 means a person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others and in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration, provides, or represents that the person can or will provide, any of the following services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">(i) improving a buyer\u2019s credit record, history, or rating[;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">(ii) obtaining an extension of credit for a buyer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">(iii) providing advice or assistance to a buyer with regard to either subsection (i) or (ii).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\"><em>Id., </em>273 Ill.Dec. 816, 789 N.E.2d at 1253 (quoting 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 605/3(a), (d) (West 1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The Court held that the Act did not apply to Midstate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">Looking to the definition of a \u201c[b]uyer\u201d and the definition of a \u201c[c]redit [sjervices [organization,\u201d it is clear that the Credit Services Act regulates transactions involving the payment of money or other valuable consideration <em>in return </em>for the services of the credit services organization. In turn, the services of the credit services organization are \u201cimproving a buyer\u2019s credit record, history, or rating\u201d; \u201cobtaining an extension of credit for a buyer\u201d; or \u201cproviding advice or assistance to a buyer\u201d with regard to \u201cimproving a buyer\u2019s credit record, history, or rating\u201d or with regard to \u201cobtaining an extension of credit\u201d for the buyer. 815 ILCS 605/3 (West 1996). Thus, the Credit Services Act requires payment for credit services, not simply payment for other goods or services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">The Court further concluded that \u201cthe contract at issue does not provide for payment of money ... in return for credit services provided by Midstate. Instead the agreed consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ation is for payment of windows and siding....\u201d <em>Id., </em>273 Ill.Dec. 816, 789 N.E.2d at 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Finally, appellee asserts that, in considering the statute and all its provisions as a whole, it is \u201ceminently clear\u201d that the General Assembly intended that it apply to \u201ctraditional credit repair organizations\u201d and not those who prepare tax returns and facilitate RALs. Appellee insists that the \u201cduties\u201d outlined in the statute \u201cmake no sense\u201d when applied to businesses such as itself. Specifically, appellee points to \u00a7 14-1902(6) which provides that credit services businesses may not \u201cLc]harge or receive any money or other valuable consideration prior to full and complete performance of the services that the credit services business has agreed to perform for or on behalf of the consumer.\u201d Appellee points out that the documents attached to appellant\u2019s complaint make clear that appellee did not charge or collect funds from appellant, who purchased an RAL from SBBT. By contrast, appellee argues, this provision is \u201centirely logical\u201d when applied to a credit repair organization that promises to perform services to improve a credit rating or assist with obtaining credit that a consumer might not otherwise be able to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Similarly, appellee argues that C.L. \u00a7 14-1902(2), which provides that a credit services business may not \u201c[r]eceive any money or other valuable consideration solely for referral of the consumer to a retail seller or to any other credit grantor who will or may extend credit to the consumer, if the credit extended to the consumer is substantially the same terms as those available to the general public,\u201d logically applies to prevent a credit repair agency from taking money \u201cfrom an unwitting customer\u201d simply for referring that consumer to a creditor whom the consumer could have contacted on his or her own.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Likewise, appellee points out that the provisions in C.L. \u00a7 14-1902(3) are inapplicable to RAL transactions. Section 14-1902(3) provides that a credit services business shall not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">[m]ake, or assist or advise any consumer to make, any statement or other representation that is false or mislead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ing, or which by the exercise of reasonable care should be known to be false or misleading, to a consumer reporting agency, government agency, or person to whom the consumer applies or intends to apply for an extension of credit, regarding a consumer\u2019s creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, or true identity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Appellee explains that it made no statements regarding \u201ca buyer\u2019s credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity or true identity\u201d in arranging the RAL. On the other hand, appellee points out, the provision would certainly apply in the context of a credit repair agency\u2019s promise or solicitation regarding the improvement of a buyer\u2019s credit rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Next, appellee points to the disclosure requirements contained in C.L. \u00a7 14-1905, which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">(a) In general. \u2014 The information statement required under \u00a7 14-1904 of this subtitle shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">(1) An accurate statement of the consumer\u2019s right to review any file on the consumer maintained by any consumer reporting agency, and the right of the consumer to receive a copy of a consumer report containing all information in that file as provided under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681g) and under \u00a7 14-1206 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">(2) A statement that a copy of the consumer report containing all information in the consumer\u2019s file will be furnished free of charge by the consumer reporting agency if requested by the consumer within 30 days of receiving a notice of a denial of credit as provided under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681j) and under \u00a7 14-1209 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">(3) A statement that a nominal charge not to exceed $5 may be imposed on the consumer by the consumer reporting agency for a copy of the consumer report containing all the information in the consumer\u2019s file, if the consumer has not been denied credit within 30 days from receipt of the consumer\u2019s request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>(4) A complete and accurate statement of the consumer\u2019s right to dispute the completeness or accuracy of any item on the consumer contained in any file that is maintained by any consumer reporting agency, as provided under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681i) and under \u00a7 14-1208 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">(5) A complete and detailed description of the services to be performed by the credit services business for or on behalf of the consumer, and the total amount the consumer will have to pay for the services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">(6) A statement that accurately reported information may not be permanently removed from the file of a consumer reporting agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">(b) Additional requirements of licenses. \u2014 A credit services business required to obtain a license pursuant to \u00a7 14-1902 of this subtitle shall include in the information statement required under \u00a7 14-1904 of this subtitle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">(1) A statement of the consumer\u2019s right to file a complaint pursuant to \u00a7 14-1911 of this subtitle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">(2) The address of the Commissioner where such complaints should be filed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">(3) A statement that a bond exists and the consumer\u2019s right to proceed against the bond under the circumstances and in the manner set forth in \u00a7 14-1910 of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj\">Appellee contends that the foregoing disclosures apply in the context of a transaction through which a consumer is attempting to \u201cshore up\u201d his or her credit score and speak to what credit reporting agencies can or cannot do, but none of the disclosures are applicable to RAL transactions. According to appellee, \u201cproviding such information would likely confuse an RAL applicant or, worse yet, cause that applicant to believe that [appellee] thinks their credit needs improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">Appellee also maintains that neither C.L. 14-1906(a)(3) nor 14-1906(b) has any application to an RAL. Section 14-1906(a)(3) pertains to the required disclosures that must be present in the consumer contract and provides that the following must appear therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>A complete and detailed description of the services to be performed and the results to be achieved by the credit services business for or on behalf of the consumer, including all guarantees and all promises of full or partial refunds and a list of the adverse information appearing on the consumer\u2019s credit report that the credit services business expects to have modified and the estimated date by which each modification will occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Appellee asserts that \u201cthis provision has no meaning with regard to Jackson Hewitt\u201d because it has \u201cno control over any financial institution\u2019s decision regarding refunding payments made from a consumer to the institution.\u201d Moreover, appellee avers, Jackson Hewitt does not provide the \u201ctypes of credit services contemplated by the provision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Similarly, appellee alleges that the \u201cnotice of cancellation\u201d provision of C.L. \u00a7 14\u20141906(b), which provides, in pertinent part, that the contract must advise the consumer that he or she \u201cmay cancel this contract, without any penalty or obligation, at any time prior to midnight of the third business day after the date the contract is signed.... \u201d Appellee states that an RAL is usually paid within forty-eight hours of the application; thus, a \u201cthree-day right of cancellation is nonsensical in the context of the purchase of a RAL.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Appellee postulates that, if we were to accept appellant\u2019s interpretation of the CSBA, \u201cit would result in liability for numerous retailers operating in Maryland that facilitate credit applications on behalf of financial institutions because retailers often offer assistance to customers with applications for credit offered by third-party banks in exchange for compensation from banks.\u201d This, appellee contends, was clearly not the General Assembly\u2019s intent to reach so many businesses whose primary function is to sell a good or service.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Appellant\u2019s rejoinder is that, simply because some portions of the statute may be inapplicable to appellee, does not render the entire statute inapplicable. In addition, she adds, <em>Mid-state, supra, </em>is distinct from the case <em>sub judice </em>because Midstate, unlike appellee, gratuitously arranged for financing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>for its customers, unlike appellee who, appellant baldly asserts, relies upon RALs as \u201cthe most profitable aspect of its business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We have been unable to locate any case construing the Maryland CSBA. The parties, however, have cited the decision of the Fourth Circuit in <em>H &amp; R Block Eastern Enters. v. Raskin, </em>591 F.3d 718 (4th Cir.2010) for various propositions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lest there be any doubt, we make clear that the Fourth Circuit did not make <em>any </em>determinations on the merits of the question of whether H <em>&amp; </em>R Block, nor any party in appellee\u2019s business, could be considered a \u201ccredit services business\u201d under the CSBA. The Fourth Circuit vacated the ruling of the District Court, which granted partial summary judgment on the grounds that portions of the CSBA were preempted by the National Bank Act (NBA). The Court explained that the trial court erred in assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the CSBA applied to H &amp; R Block because, \u201c[t]o conclude that the NBA preempts certain of the CSBA\u2019s provisions, as applied to Block, without first assessing whether the CSBA actually applies to Block, amounts to \u2018seeking out conflicts ... where none clearly exists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 723 (quoting <em>College Loan Corp. v. SLM Corp., </em>396 F.3d 588, 598 (4th Cir.2005)). The Court expressed no opinion whatsoever on the merits of whether H &amp; R Block, who engaged in similar transactions with RALs, was a \u201ccredit services business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Finally, immediately preceding oral argument in the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant submitted to this Court the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, <em>Harper v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., </em>227 W.Va. 142, 706 S.E.2d 63 (2010). The certified questions presented to the West Virginia appellate court were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Does a tax preparer who receives compensation either directly from the borrower or in the form of payments from the lending bank, for helping a borrower obtain a refund anticipation loan meet the statutory definition of a credit services organization under [the credit services statute]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">Do the borrowers in a refund anticipation loan transaction meet the definition of a buyer [consumer] under [the credit services statute]?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, in <em>Harper, </em>concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">[w]hen we read the plain and unambiguous terms of \u00a7 46A-6C-2(a), we find that the first reformulated certified question is easily answered ... [T]he broad sweeping language contained in the statute leads us to no other possible conclusion. Accordingly, we find that a tax preparer who receives compensation, either directly from the borrower or in the form of payments from the lending bank, for helping a borrower obtain a RAL meets the statutory definition of a credit services organization under W. Va.Code \u00a7 46A-6C-2(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">Positing that \u201cthe operative provisions of the credit services acts of West Virginia and Maryland are virtually identical,\u201d appellant asserts that the court\u2019s ruling amounts to a rejection of the following: \u201cthat consumers have no claim because the operative RAL agreement is between Jackson Hewitt and the lending bank; that a direct payment from the consumer to Jackson Hewitt is required; that the [West Virginia] statute is intended to apply only to credit repair companies; that a parade of horribles would ensue if the [West Virginia] statute were found to apply to Jackson Hewitt\u2019s RAL business; and, that RAL borrowers are not \u201cconsumers\u201d [\u201cbuyers\u201d under the W. Va. terminology] as defined by the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">Appellants further rely on the <em>Harper </em>Court\u2019s conclusion that, \u201cbased upon the broad language of the [West Virginia] statute ... plaintiffs likewise qualify as \u2018buyers\u2019 under [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>West Virginia statute] because they purchased, whether indirectly or directly, the services of a credit services organization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Refuting appellant\u2019s claim that the <em>Harper </em>decision is a rejection of the aforementioned bases on which the circuit court relied in the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellees rejoin that the <em>Harper </em>Court simply disregarded the numerous references in W. VA. CODE \u00a7 46A-6C-6(a)(1), \u00a7 46A-6C-2(a)(2) and \u00a7 46A-6C-2(a)(3) to \u201cconduct <em>on behalf of </em>or <em>for </em>\u201d a consumer and wrongly, according to appellees, determined that the West Virginia legislature could have expressly provided that only \u201cthose who receive direct consumer payments be covered by the CSOA.\u201d Given that W. VA. CODE \u00a7 46A-6C-3(1) and (2) prohibits a credit services organization from \u201c[c]harg[ing] a buyer or receiv[ing] <em>from a buyer </em>money or other valuable consideration before completing\u201d credit services or solely for referring a buyer to a retail seller of credit, it is unclear, appellees maintain, \u201chow the Court could have reached this decision.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Appellees also point out that, unlike the legislative history available in Maryland, the West Virginia Court was also hampered by the lack of any dispositive legislative history. Moreover, appellees contend, the <em>Harper </em>Court, given the decision as a whole, did not address their arguments regarding the absurd results that would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Appellees\u2019 second rejoinder is that, contrary to appellant\u2019s argument that the <em>Harper </em>Court relied on the \u201cplain and unambiguous terms\u201d of the credit services organization act to reach its decision, the Court, in footnote 12, expressly \u201cencourages the West Virginia legislature to amend the provisions of [the credit services organization act] <em>to provide a clarification of the CSOA </em>\u201d regarding whether it should apply to entities like <em>Jackson Hewitt. Harper, id. </em>at 72, n. 12 (emphasis supplied by appellee). If, as appellant argues, the West Virginia credit services organization act were unambiguous, appellees maintain that \u201cthere would be no need for the Legislature to clarify it to avoid the absurd results that the West Virginia Supreme Court undoubtedly recognizes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Finally, appellees point out that the Court, in <em>Harper, </em>in contrast to the circuit court, did not have the benefit of the legislative history of West Virginia\u2019s Corresponding Credit Services Organization Act. That, from the legislative history, the Maryland General Assembly intended that the CSBA apply only to the practices of unscrupulous businesses that, in exchange for a fee paid by the consumer, the companies would agree to assist such consumers with obtaining credit, improve credit records or offer advice on credit issues, is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">This is a case of first impression in Maryland. In interpreting a statute, \u201c[o]ur predominant mission is to ascertain and implement the legislative intent, which is to be derived, if possible, from the language of the statute (or Rule) itself.\u201d <em>Downes v. Downes, </em>388 Md. 561, 571, 880 A.2d 343 (2005) (citations omitted). If the language is unambiguous, we do not ordinarily look beyond the language of the statute. <em>Opert v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Bd., </em>403 Md. 587, 593, 943 A.2d 1229 (2008) (citations omitted). When examining the language of a statute, we must consider its meaning in context by evaluating the statute as a whole. <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>309 Md. 505, 514, 525 A.2d 628 (1987); <em>In re Stephen K., </em>289 Md. 294, 298, 424 A.2d 153 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">While appellant\u2019s argument regarding the definition of \u201ccredit services business,\u201d based upon the disjunctive wording of Section 14-1901(e) has appeal, it overlooks the language recognized by the <em>Midstate </em>Court that contemplates that a consumer would pay the credit services business for improving the consumer\u2019s credit record, obtaining an extension of credit or providing advice or assistance in that regard. Like the Illinois statute, the CSBA defines a credit services business as \u201cany person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others, sells, provides, or performs, or represents that such person can or will sell, provide, or perform, any of the following services <em>in return </em>for the payment of money or other valuable consideration.... \u201d C.L. \u00a7 14-1901(e)(1). The words \u201cin return\u201d suggest that the business to which the statute applies will receive payment from the consumer for the credit services, here, the extension of credit. Like Midstate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>appellee sells a service \u2014 income tax preparation \u2014 and that is the only service that appellant paid appellee to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Although we believe that the plain meaning of the language resolves the issue before this Court, we may look to the legislative history. The Court of Appeals has opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">\u201cIn the interest of completeness, however, we may look at the purpose of the statute and compare the result obtained by use of its plain language with that which results when the purpose of the statute is taken into account.\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993). <em>See also Robey v. State, </em>397 Md. 449, 454, 918 A.2d 499, 502 (2007); <em>Stanley v. Slate, </em>390 Md. 175, 185, 887 A.2d 1078, 1084 (2005). In other words, the resort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to seek contradiction of the plain meaning of the statute. <em>Robey, </em>397 Md. at 454, 918 A.2d at 502; <em>Stanley, </em>390 Md. at 185, 887 A.2d at 1084. In such instances, we may find useful the context of a statute, the overall statutory scheme, and archival legislative history of relevant enactments. <em>Robey, </em>397 Md. at 454, 918 A.2d at 502.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-7\"><em>Kramer v. Liberty Prop. Trust, </em>408 Md. 1, 19, 968 A.2d 120 (2009) (quoting <em>Smith v. State, </em>399 Md. 565, 578-79, 924 A.2d 1175 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\n<em>The Legislative History of the CSBA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">The CSBA was enacted through the passage of House Bill 472 in 1987. The Statement of Purpose in 1987 Laws of Md., ch. 469 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">FOR the purpose of providing certain protections to the consumers of credit services business; requiring credit services businesses to provide certain information to customers; establishing certain requirements for contracts between credit services businesses and consumers; requiring a surety bond or trust account in certain circumstances; defining certain terms; providing certain civil and criminal penalties; providing administrative remedies; providing certain limitation periods; making provisions of this Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>severable; and generally relating to the regulation of credit services businesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Although the Statement of Purpose does not shed light on what the General Assembly considered to be a \u201ccredit services business,\u201d additional documents in the bill file make clear that the General Assembly enacted the CSBA in response to concerns about predatory practices and misleading advertising of \u201ccredit repair organizations.\u201d In a House of Delegates Floor Report on House Bill 472, the \u201cBackground\u201d section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">Proponents claim that some credit services businesses, or <em>\u2018credit repair agencies\u2019 </em>have engaged in unfair and deceptive practices. They claim that the agencies frequently cannot deliver the services offered, or the services offered are such that they can be performed by the customer with little effort. According to the commissioner of consumer credit, there are at least six credit <em>repair agencies </em>operating in this state. The agencies are subject to the consumer protection act, but are not otherwise regulated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">This confirms that, in enacting the CSBA, the General Assembly intended to target \u201ccredit repair agencies.\u201d In other words, the legislature sought to regulate those in the business of claiming to offer services to improve a consumer\u2019s credit or otherwise extending credit in exchange for a fee paid by consumers. As we see it, this language denotes an intent, on the part of the legislature, to regulate companies in the business of improving or extending credit, particularly those that over promise and mislead consumers<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and not companies, such as appellee, who are in the business of tax preparation and offer to send business to a third party for a loan, without receiving a fee from the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Appellee also directs our attention to documents contained in the bill file for House Bill 1242, which was enacted by 1990 Md. Laws, ch. 669 and increased penalties for violations of the CSBA. The Statement of Purpose in 1990 Md. Laws, ch. 669 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">FOR the purpose of making any credit services business who willfully fails to comply with certain requirements liable for a monetary award in a certain amount; increasing a certain penalty; and generally relating to the Maryland Credit Services Business Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The 1990 enactment provided for \u201ca monetary award equal to 3 times the total amount collected from the consumer, as ordered by the Commissioner\u201d in C.L. \u00a7 14-1912(a)(2) and added the possibility of imprisonment as a penalty for a violation in C.L \u00a7 14-1915(a). In the House Economic Matters Committee\u2019s \u201cBill Analysis\u201d of House Bill 1242, similar evidence of legislative intent to regulate \u201ccredit repair businesses\u201d is evident. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">The Maryland Credit Services Businesses Act was enacted in 1987 and <em>regulates persons who provide credit repair services. </em>Currently, a violation of the Act is a misdemeanor with a fine of up to $5,000. Current civil penalties include compensation for actual damages and punitive damages allowed by the court, and attorney [ sic] fees and court costs in any successful action under the Act. According to the Commissioner of Consumer Credit, the additional civil and criminal penalties are necessary to insure broader compliance with the Act. The Commissioner\u2019s Office reports that several <em>credit repair businesses] </em>have operated in the state in violation of the bonding and trust account provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">(Emphasis added). Identical language is found in a Floor Report on House Bill 1242. We think these are all indications that the General Assembly understood its original 1987 enactment of the CSBA to be for the purpose of regulating credit repair agencies who take fees from consumers to improve or extend credit, or to give advice or assistance in such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\n<em>The 2001 and 2002 Amendments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Appellant and <em>amici </em>maintain that our reading of the legislative history should not so narrowly apply the CSBA and, specifically, we should accord to the amendments made in 2001 and 2002, an intent by the General Assembly, to regulate transactions involving third-party lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">In 2001, the General Assembly enacted Senate Bill 882,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which amended C.L. \u00a7 14-1902, by adding to the list of prohibitions for credit services businesses, an eighth item: credit services business may not \u201csubject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, assist a consumer to obtain an extension of <em>unsecured closed end credit </em>at a rate of interest which, except for federal preemption of State law, would be prohibited under Title 12, Subtitle 1, 3 or 10 of this Article.\u201d 2001 Md. Laws, ch.630. It also created a new subsection. Subsection (b) defined a \u201cpayment instrument\u201d as a \u201ccheck or a draft ordering a person to pay money\u201d and a \u201cmoney order.\u201d It also provided that \u201can extension of unsecured closed end credit includes an extension of credit for which a payment instrument is held to ensure payment.\u201d 2001 Md. Laws, ch. 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The newly created subsection (b) also provided for the establishment of a Shorf&gt;-Term Small Consumer Loan Study Commission, made up of various legislators and representatives of the credit industry and consumer advocates, for the purpose of determining \u201cthe need for short-term, small consumer loans,\u201d to \u201cidentify the reasons why traditional lenders may not be fully meeting the need for short-term, small consumer loans in the State,\u201d to \u201cevaluate alternatives to help meet the need for short-term small consumer loans\u201d and to report to the General Assembly and make a recommendation and proposal for legislation if necessary. 2001 Md. Laws, ch. 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\"><em>Amici </em>cites a letter in the bill file for Senate Bill 882 from then Assistant Attorney General Robert A. Zarnoch, now a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>judge on this Court, dated March 19, 2001. In his letter, Judge Zarnoch, writing in his capacity as Counsel to the General Assembly, explained that he wrote in response to a request for advice as to whether the proposed legislation \u201cis preempted by or in conflict with federal law.\u201d He concluded that, in his view, the legislation \u201cis not preempted by or in conflict with federal laws regulating national banks and federal savings and loan associations.\u201d In describing the purpose of the legislation, Judge Zarnoch wrote: \u201cThe legislation is primarily aimed at \u2018payday loans\u2019 and particularly, third party arrangements that some federally-insured depository institutions, such as national banks and federal savings and loan associations, have entered into with local agents (usually a check cashing business) to broker such loans.\u201d (Footnote omitted). The letter went on to conclude that, in his opinion, regulating third-party facilitators, such as those involved in \u201cpay day loans,\u201d did not conflict with and was not preempted by federal law. <em>Amici </em>state that \u201cthis letter, which was considered contemporaneously by legislators who enacted the 2001 amendment to the CSBA, highlights the well-understood application of the Act to arrangers of consumer credit unrelated to credit repair services.\u201d <em>Amici </em>also points to other forms of testimony in the bill file that echo a consistent understanding of the bill and the application of the CSBA to \u201carrangers\u201d of loans through third-party lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The following year, the General Assembly once again amended Section 14-1902 through House Bill 1193. The Statement of Purpose was amended to provide</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avq\">FOR the purpose of prohibiting a credit services business, its employees, and certain independent contractors from assisting a consumer to obtain an extension of credit at a rate of interest which, except for federal preemption of State law, would be prohibited under certain provisions of law governing credit regulation....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Section 14-1902 was thus amended to remove subsection (b) in its entirety and instead, Section 14-1902 was amended to provide that a \u201ccredit services business, its employees, and independent contractors who sell or attempt to sell the ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>vices of a credit services business shall not ... (8) Assist a consumer to obtain an extension of credit at a rate of interest which, except for federal preemption of State law, would be prohibited under Title 12 of this article.\u201d 2002 Laws of Md. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\"><em>Amici </em>assert that, after the enactment of the 2001 amendment, the General Assembly failed to achieve its legislative purpose of regulating payday lending completely; thus, the General Assembly passed House Bill 1193, enacted as 2002 Md. Laws, ch. 561. <em>Amici </em>cites, in support of this contention, the Senate Finance Committee Summary of House Bill 1193, which provides: \u201cThis Bill expands the prohibition that was enacted last year which applies to extensions of <em>unsecured </em>closed end credit. Accordingly, this Bill applies to <em>any </em>extension of credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\"><em>Amici </em>also cite written testimony of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation in support of House Bill 1193, in which the Commissioner opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">[House Bill 1193] would attempt to prohibit payday loans being offered in Maryland by third party agents of lenders. Last year the General Assembly passed SB 882 which attempted to achieve this result. Amendments to that bill resulted in its failure in fact to prevent payday lending as intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">During the interim, a payday lender who is the agent of a third party lender has begun doing substantial business in Maryland. This bill would prohibit the activities now being conducted by that agent and should achieve the results the legislature intended last year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Appellant and <em>amici </em>contend that the foregoing is evidence that the General Assembly was fully aware that the CSBA applied to businesses that assist consumers in obtaining credit, no matter what the purpose or intent of that loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">While these amendments and the legislative history surrounding their enactment indicate that the General Assembly intended to regulate credit services businesses who use third-party lenders with higher interest rates than permitted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Maryland law, we are not persuaded that the amendments or the legislative history indicate that the General Assembly ever contemplated regulating a business engaged in income tax return preparation that acts as a facilitator to permit a customer to pay a third party for a RAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\n<em>The Commission\u2019s Advisory Notice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Appellant and <em>amici </em>contend that two Advisory Notices issued by the Commissioner of Financial Regulation support their contention that the CSBA has always applied to tax preparers who facilitate RALs. On January 24, 2005, the Commissioner issued an Advisory Notice providing the following warning to tax preparers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">This tax season, you are reminded that if you are assisting Maryland consumers to obtain short term loans, whether secured by the consumers\u2019 anticipated tax refund or not and you receive compensation in return, you are in fact, operating as a credit services business as defined in Commercial Law Article, \u00a7 14 \u2014 1901(b), Maryland Annotated Code. Anyone who offer [sic] these short term loans, refund anticipation loans (\u201cRALs\u201d), through a third party, must be licensed as a credit services business....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Then, on May 15, 2008, the Commissioner issued the following Advisory Notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">... The purpose of this Advisory is to clarify the applicability of the Act to certain parties in light of applicable federal law (the National Bank Act and the Home Owner\u2019s Loan Act) and relevant case law interpreting those statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">The act Applies to all businesses (except those specifically excluded from coverage under the law) that assist consumers in obtaining extensions of credit. The Commissioner has interpreted this law to include businesses that assist consumers in obtaining loans from federally insured national banks or thrifts. The Commissioner has also interpreted the Act to apply to tax preparers who are compensated in any matter (either by the consumer or the lender) to assist consumers in obtaining RALs from third-party lenders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Consistent with the foregoing, the Commissioner hereby exercises her enforcement discretion and concludes that the interest rate prohibition set forth in \u00a7 14-1902(8) of the Act will not be enforced against third-party agents of national banks or federally-chartered thrifts, when such agents are properly registered and regulated as electronic refund originators that assist consumers in obtaining RALs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">All other provisions of the Act continue to be applicable to, and will be enforced against tax preparers which facilitate RALs, even when such businesses act as agents of national banks or federally-chartered thrifts....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Appellant and <em>amici </em>claim that the foregoing constitute \u201cunequivocal public pronouncements confirming the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute\u201d and that, pursuant to <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455 (1997), we should defer to the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the CSBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In <em>Marriott, </em>the Court of Appeals addressed when an agency\u2019s construction of a statute is entitled to deference. \u201cThe consistent and long-standing construction given to a statute by the agency charged with administering it is entitled to great deference ... as the agency is likely to have expertise and practical experience with the statute\u2019s subject matter.\u201d 346 Md. at 445, 697 A.2d 455 (internal citation omitted). The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">The weight given an agency\u2019s construction of a statute depends on several factors \u2014 the duration and consistency of the administrative practice, the degree to which the agency\u2019s construction was made known to the public, and the degree to which the Legislature was aware of the administrative construction when it reenacted the relevant statutory language. <em>Magan v. Medical Mutual, </em>331 Md. 535, 546, 629 A.2d 626, 632 (1993). Other important considerations include \u201cthe extent to which the agency engaged in a process of reasoned elaboration in formulating its interpretation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>and \u201cthe nature of the process through which the agency arrived at its interpretation,\u201d with greater weight placed on those agency interpretations that are the product of adversarial proceedings or formal rules promulgation. <em>Balto. Gas &amp; Elec. [Co. v. Public Service Commission </em>], 305 Md. [145] at 161-62, 501 A.2d [1307] at 1315 [ 1986) ]. An administrative agency\u2019s construction of the statute is not entitled to deference, however, when it conflicts with the unambiguous statutory language. <em>Falik v. Prince George\u2019s Hosp., </em>322 Md. 409, 416, 588 A.2d 324, 327 (1991). See generally 2A SINGER, supra, \u00a7 45.12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 445-46, 697 A.2d 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\"><em>Amici </em>posit that the General Assembly has been aware, \u201cat least since the 2001 session, that the Commissioner interprets the CSBA to require the licensing of entities that assist consumers in obtaining short term extensions of credit, whether they be payday loans or some other similar loan product.\u201d Thus, despite the fact that the interpretation is not the result of formal rule-making or an adversarial proceeding, the Commissioner\u2019s issuance of advisories and legislative testimony are entitled to deference because they have the \u201challmarks of reasoned elaboration.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Appellee counters that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation has been inconsistent, it was not made contemporaneously with the enactment of the CSBA, it does not disclose the process by which the Commissioner interpreted the statute and it contains no cogent discussion or reasoned elaboration as to why the Commissioner so interpreted the statute in its two Advisory Notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Initially, we must address appellee\u2019s assertion that the Commissioner has taken inconsistent positions. The basis for appellee\u2019s claim is that, despite the position stated in both Advisory Notices, the Commissioner took an inconsistent position in litigation of an action for declaratory judgment brought by H &amp; R Block, which we discussed in <em>Raskin, supra. </em>Appellee contends that the Commissioner stated, in the course of that litigation, that it held a meeting for the purpose of determining <em>whether </em>H &amp; R Block is, in fact, subject to the CSBA for its involvement in RAL facilitation. To the extent that this position is inconsistent, we do not perceive it to be the kind of inconsistent position calling for less deference contemplated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Marriott, supra. </em>Notwithstanding that fact, we agree with appellee that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation is not entitled to great deference in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We reject the assertion of appellant and <em>amici </em>that the General Assembly has been aware of the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the CSBA as applying to those involved with facilitating RALs since 2001. We think it plain that the <em>only </em>\u201cloan arrangers\u201d contemplated in the legislative history cited were pay day lenders. Thus, at the earliest, the Commissioner\u2019s position with regard to RALs was first publicly stated in 2005 with its first Advisory Notice. The Advisory Notices, we are persuaded, fail to disclose the methods that the Commissioner employed in interpreting the CSBA to apply to tax preparers involved with RALs. It is undisputed that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>interpretation was not reached through any kind of adversarial process. Moreover, the interpretation, in our view, contradicts the plain language of the statute. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in failing to accord great deference to the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\n<em>The Recent Enactment of 2010 Md. Laws, ch. 730 Supports The Construction Herein of the CSBA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Notably, with regard to the claim that the General Assembly was aware of the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute in its Advisory Notices, during the 2010 Session, the General Assembly enacted 2010 Md. Laws, ch. 730, which created a new subtitle in Section 14 of the Commercial Law Article specifically aimed at regulating tax preparers involved in facilitating RALs to be codified as C.L. \u00a7 14-3801, 14-3802, 14-3803, 14-3804, 14-3805, 14-3806 and 14-3807. 2010 Md. Laws, ch. 730. The Statement of Purpose provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">FOR the purpose of prohibiting certain persons from soliciting the execution of, processing, receiving, or accepting an application or agreement for a refund anticipation loan or refund anticipation check or facilitating the making of a refund anticipation loan or refund anticipation check under certain circumstances; requiring a facilitator of a refund anticipation loan or refund anticipation check to display a certain schedule of fees in a certain manner; requiring the schedule to contain certain information and disclosures; prohibiting a facilitator from charging certain fees; requiring a facilitator to make certain written and oral disclosures to certain consumers at a certain time and in a certain manner; requiring the annual percentage rate for a refund anticipation loan to be calculated using certain guidelines; prohibiting a facilitator from taking certain actions relating to a refund anticipation loan or refund anticipation check; providing that, under certain circumstances, a certain provision of this Act does not prohibit a charge or fee from being imposed by a facilitator; providing that a violation of this Act is an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Maryland Consumer Protection Act and is subject to certain enforcement and penalty provisions; establishing certain additional penalties for a willful failure to comply with this Act; defining certain terms; and generally relating to refund anticipation loans and refund anticipation checks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">C.L. \u00a7 14-3806(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">Subsection (a)(2) of this section<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> does not prohibit a charge or fee, <em>including a fee for tax return preparation, </em>that is imposed by a facilitator on all of its customers if the same charge or fee, in the same amount, is imposed on customers who do not receive refund anticipation loans, refund anticipation checks, or other tax-related financial products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Pellucidly, the above section expresses the legislature\u2019s approbation for the charging of a fee by the facilitator, and, in doing so, specifically sanctions \u201ca fee for tax\u201d preparation, so long as the facilitator (in this case the tax preparer), charges a fee in the same amount that other customers, who do not receive refund anticipation loans, refund anticipation checks, or other tax related financial products, must pay. C.L. \u00a7 14-3806(b) is clearly an attempt on the part of the legislature to clarify appellee\u2019s right to charge a fee for the tax return preparation service it renders, provided that the fee it receives from the customer does not exceed that which is charged to customers who do not receive refund anticipation loans, refund anticipation checks, or other tax related financial products. In the absence of evidence that the facilitator received payment in excess of that charged for preparing the consumer\u2019s tax return, such payment is not in violation of the clarifying legislation, <em>i.e., </em>C.L. \u00a7 14-3806(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The Fiscal and Policy Note expressly acknowledges the Commissioner\u2019s Advisory Notice in the \u201cCurrent Law/Background\u201d section: \u201cOn May 15, 2008, the Commissioner of Financial Regulation issued an advisory notice on the application of the Maryland Credit Services Business Act (MCSBA) to tax preparers that facilitate refund anticipation loans.... \u201d Although not expressly rejecting the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation, it appears that the General Assembly\u2019s decision to create the new provisions was prompted by the Commissioner\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the CSBA because it enacted provisions that expressly define refund anticipation loans and the roles that facilitators of those loans play, provide for disclosures to the consumer, prohibit specific acts relating to fees and misrepresentations and provide that a violation is an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, subject to the MCPA\u2019s civil and criminal penalty provisions. While this enactment does not provide the basis for our construction of the CSBA, we believe it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>further supports our interpretation of the General Assembly\u2019s intent with regard to the CSBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-12\">. This case was initially filed as a class action, but appellant did not file a Motion for Class Certification. The circuit court explained, in its Memorandum Opinion and Order dismissing appellant's claims, that it would initially make a determination about whether appellant could present a claim against appellee prior to making any determination about class determination for the sake of judicial economy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">. We note that \"[Counsel would be well served when relying on foreign unreported decisions, to refer the court to a local rule of the decision\u2019s jurisdiction of origin that would permit its citation in that jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Holloman v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>162 Md.App. 332, 342 n. 5, 873 A.2d 1261 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\">. Appellee argues that the Fourth Circuit somehow expressed doubt as to whether H &amp; R Block, a company offering similar RAL in addition to tax preparation services, qualified as a \"credit services business\u201d under the CSBA. Appellant relies upon the District Court's ruling as to whether some of the provisions of the CSBA were preempted by the National Bank Act, which the Fourth Circuit vacated in <em>Raskin, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b134-9\">. This is also supported by multiple newspaper articles in the bill file decrying the practices of credit repair agencies that improperly lead consumers to believe that they can offer a \"quick fix\u201d to credit problems and rehabilitate poor credit records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\">. Senate Bill 882 was cross-filed as House Bill 973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">. <em>Amici </em>argue that the reasoning of the Office of the Attorney General also supports its interpretation of the CSBA, citing 79 Op. Atty. Gen. 98 (1994). In that opinion, the Attorney General addressed a question posed by the Deputy Secretary of Licensing &amp; Regulation as to \"whether a home improvement contractor is required to obtain an installment loan license as a prerequisite to offering its customers financing for home improvement projects\u201d and \"whether there are circumstances under which a home improvement contractor might need a mortgage lender's license if the offered financing is secured by a lien on the homeowner\u2019s residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98. We agree with appellee that, because the Attorney General was addressing a substantially different set of facts and interpretation of the CSBA was not the issue in the opinion, the Attorney General's comment that, if a contractor receives compensation for a referral of a secured or unsecured loan, it would be required to obtain a license as a \"credit services business\u201d under the CSBA is not compelling or entitled to significant weight. Moreover, the very next sentence of the opinion provides that \"[t]he typical direct financing transaction, however, does not involve any compensation to the Contractor for referring the customer to the financing entity,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>indicating that the application of the CSBA was not the focus of the opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b144-8\">. Subsection (a)(2) states that \u201cA facilitator may not: (2) Charge any fee to a consumer or require any other consideration for making or facilitating a refund anticipation loan or refund anticipation check other than the fee imposed by the creditor or other person that provides the refund anticipation loan or refund anticipation check.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b144-9\">. We recognize that we may not divine the legislative intent undergirding the enactment of the CSBA through hindsight, <em>i.e., </em>factoring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>enactment of the clarifying legislation into our analysis. Accordingly, our determination of what constitutes a \"credit services business\u201d under the CSBA devolves upon the plain meaning of the language of the statute as well as the legislative history as explicated, <em>supra. </em>In light of the uncertainty as to whether tax preparers involved in RALs were intended to be covered by \u00a7 14-1901 of the CSBA, we find consonant with our determination, the fact that the legislature deemed it propitious to enact C.L. \u00a7 14-3806(b). In <em>Harper v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc., supra, </em>the recent decision of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals heavily relied upon by appellant and amici regarding the pivotal issue of whether <em>indirect </em>payments to a tax preparer were violative of the West Virginia statute, the Court reasoned that the West Virginia legislature <em>could have </em>expressly provided that only \u201cthose who receive direct consumer payments be covered by the CSOA.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Court, having rendered a cursory disposition of the issue, obviously concerned that the statute needed clarification \u2014 notwithstanding its unequivocal decision, \u201cencouraged\u201d the West Virginia legislature to provide a clarification of the CSOA to explicate the application, <em>vel non, </em>of the CSOA to entities like Jackson Hewitt. The clarification enacted by the Maryland legislature, C.L. \u00a7 14-3806(b), directly addresses both direct <em>and indirect </em>payments to the tax preparer by simply prohibiting tax preparers from charging fees to their clients who obtain RALs that do not exceed fees charged to clients who do not obtain RALs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
