The Circuit Court for Montgomery County accepted the plea and, pursuant to the plea agreement, sentenced appellee to five years\u2019 incarceration, with all but time served suspended, and one year of unsupervised probation. On December 22, 2009, appellee filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis. After a hearing on April 13, 2010, the circuit court entered an opinion and order granting appellee\u2019s petition on May 25, 2010. On June 15, 2010, the State, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>appellant, filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s May 25, 2010 order and opinion, which the court denied. The State filed a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The State presents one question for review by this Court, which we have rephrased and divided into two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">1. Did the circuit court err in holding that appellee did not waive his right to file a petition for writ of error coram nobis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">2. Did the circuit court err in concluding that appellee\u2019s guilty plea did not comply with Maryland Rule 4-242?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">For the reasons set forth herein, we shall answer the first question in the affirmative and accordingly, shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court. Because we determine that appellee waived his right to file a petition for writ of error coram nobis, we will not reach the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Appellee\u2019s guilty plea to the charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon arose from his actions on February 8, 2008, when several men, including appellee, approached Marvin Giovanni Flores in Seek Lane Park in Silver Spring, Maryland. One of the men pointed a knife at Flores, another man grabbed Flores\u2019 arm, and they demanded Flores\u2019 Northface jacket. When Flores took off his jacket to give to them, he dropped his black Motorola Razor cell phone, which the men also took.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">After a lookout was placed, the Maryland National Park and Planning Commission police stopped three men, including appellee. The police found Flores\u2019 Northface jacket laying on the ground next to the three men. When searched, appellee had a kitchen type knife with a brown handle on his person. One of the other men had a black Motorola Razor cell phone in his jacket pocket. Subsequently, at a show-up, Flores identified appellee as \u201cthe individual who had the knife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">On July 22, 2008, after accepting appellee\u2019s guilty plea, the circuit court sentenced appellee pursuant to the plea agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ment to five years\u2019 incarceration, suspending all but time served, and placing appellee on one year of unsupervised probation. Appellee did not file an application for leave to appeal his conviction or sentence pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-302(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">On December 22, 2009, appellee filed a petition for writ of error coram nobis. Appellee explained in the petition that he \u201crecently pled guilty to the federal offense of unauthorized reentry into the United States after deportation.\u201d He asserted that he was seeking a writ of error coram nobis because, with his state conviction, he faced \u201csignificant collateral consequences,\u201d namely, the state conviction would increase his potential federal sentence from a guideline range of 0-6 months imprisonment to 46-57 months imprisonment and from a maximum of two years to 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Appellee alleged that, at the plea hearing, the circuit court \u201cfailed to adequately inform\u201d him of the \u201cnature of the charge,\u201d because, according to appellee, the court did not refer to the elements of the charge, \u201cdid not describe the nature of the charge in any other manner, did not ask [appellee] if he understood the nature of the charge, and did not ask [appellee] or his attorney whether they had discussed the nature of the charge.\u201d Appellee also alleged that the court \u201cfailed to inform [him] of the maximum possible penalty to which he was exposed as a result of the guilty plea.\u201d Based on these grounds, appellee concluded that his guilty plea was involuntary and requested the court to vacate his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">On April 9, 2010, the State filed a response to appellee\u2019s petition. The State asserted that appellee waived his right to coram nobis relief because he had been advised that he could seek leave to appeal from the judgment of his conviction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>sentence, but he did not file for leave to appeal. Even if appellee had not waived his right to coram nobis relief, the State contended that appellee\u2019s claim that his plea was involuntary lacked merit, because (1) the circuit court may \u201cassume that [defense] counsel had discussed the elements or essential nature of the crime\u201d with appellee; and (2) appellee was informed of the maximum sentence he could have received under the plea agreement and such \u201cadvice was sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">\u25a0 On April 13, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing on appellee\u2019s petition and received testimony from Estaban Gergely, Esq., the attorney who represented appellee at the plea hearing. On May 25, 2010, the court entered an opinion and order granting appellee\u2019s petition for writ of error coram nobis, because appellee\u2019s \u201cplea hearing did not comport with due process and the requirements of M[aryland] Rule 4-242(c), thus rendering his plea invalid.\u201d The court also concluded that, although appellee \u201cwas advised of his right to file leave to appeal\u201d and \u201cdid not exercise that right,\u201d he did not waive his right to challenge his conviction and sentence because his plea was not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">On June 15, 2010, the State filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s opinion and order granting the petition. On July 7, 2010, the court entered an order denying the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The State filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court on June 23, 2010. Additional facts will be set forth below as necessary to resolve the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">At the July 22, 2008 plea hearing, during the voir dire examination, Gergely asked appellee whether he understood that (1) he was pleading guilty to robbery with a dangerous weapon; (2) the proposed plea agreement gave appellee a sentence of five years, with all but time served suspended; (3) if the judge accepted the plea agreement, appellee would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>released to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detain-er; (4) no other agreements existed as part of this plea negotiation and decision for him to admit guilt in this case; and (5) appellee did not have an obligation to plead guilty in this case. Appellee answered that he understood all of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Gergely then advised appellee of the constitutional and statutory rights that he was giving up by entering a plea of guilty, as well as the possible consequences of his plea. Appellee indicated that he understood those rights and consequences. Appellee also agreed that, \u201c[k]nowing [his] rights to have a trial, and the possible consequences of entering a guilty plea,\u201d it was \u201cstill [his] decision to enter a plea of guilty to robbery with a dangerous weapon.\u201d After confirming that appellee understood Gergely, who was communicating with him in Spanish through an interpreter, the trial court found that \u201c[t]he plea [wa]s being entered voluntarily with full awareness of the potential consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The State then presented the statement of facts and Gergely made no modifications. The trial court concluded that there was \u201ca sufficient factual [basis] to find [appellee] guilty of robbery with a dangerous weapon\u201d and sentenced appellee, pursuant to the plea agreement, as previously indicated. The court then stated to Gergely: \u201cAdvise him of his rights, counsel, too. Sir. You have some additional rights that your lawyer is now going to advise you of.\u201d Gergely spoke to appellee off the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">After speaking with Gergely, appellee signed and dated a form titled \u201cNotice to the Defendant.\u201d The form stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">Now that you have been sentenced, the Court would like to advise you of certain rights which are available to you concerning your conviction and sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">2. If you have entered a plea of guilty you do not have the right to appeal but may apply for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>judgment entered by this Court. If you choose to do so, you must file an application with the Clerk of the Circuit Court within thirty (30) days from this date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">4. If you have been sentenced to a total, of more than two (2) years imprisonment, you have the right to file a written request with the Court that your sentence be reviewed by a panel of three (3) Judges of this Court. You must file a request for panel review in this Court within thirty (30) days from this date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">5. You also have the right to file with the Court a written request that I modify, reduce or strike your sentence. This request must be filed within ninety (90) days from this date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">I, the above named defendant, hereby acknowledge receipt of a copy of this document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">(Emphasis added). The completed form was filed the same day, July 22, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">At the April 13, 2010 hearing on appellee\u2019s petition for writ of error coram nobis, the circuit court heard testimony from Gergely, who explained that he spoke English and Spanish fluently and, throughout his representation of appellee, he spoke to appellee in Spanish and they \u201cunderstood each other perfectly well.\u201d Gergely testified that, as part of his \u201cpractice,\u201d he informed appellee about the plea process, which included an explanation of (1) appellee\u2019s option to have a bench trial or jury trial, (2) the State\u2019s burden to prove its case, (3) \u201cthe possible consequences\u201d of entering a guilty plea, and (4) the \u201csentencing guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">Gergely also testified that he did not remember exactly what he said to appellee regarding \u201cthe appeal process when there is a guilty plea,\u201d but that it was his \u201chabit\u201d to discuss the Notice to the Defendant form with his clients. The State introduced the Notice to the Defendant form, which was already in the record, and examined Gergely about the form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUh\">[THE STATE:] Did you discuss this document with your client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>[GERGELY:] Yes. Well, I can tell you based on habit. I mean, I don\u2019t have a recollection of discussing it with him but if he\u2019s a Spanish speaker, I heard what you said about it being off the record. So if it was off the record, I, I might have done it myself in Spanish by translating it to him, or I might have done it [sic] English and had the interpreter translate. Obviously, if it\u2019s on the record then I do it in English and the interpreter translates ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">I always read the form to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">[THE STATE:] Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">[GERGELY:] So either I read it to him in Spanish or I read it to him in English and the interpreter translated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">[THE STATE:] When you go over this form with your client, do you tell him the types of things that he could raise on appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">[GERGELY]: I mean, 1 read directly from the document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAH\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Gergely then indicated that there was never \u201ca time in [his] representation\u201d of appellee that he \u201cfelt that [appellee] did not understand what ... [he] and [appellee] were discussing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">During the cross-examination of Gergely, Gergely confirmed that \u201ceither I would have translated the [Notice to the Defendant] form to [appellee] or I would have ... recited it in English and the interpreter would have read it.\u201d Gergely asserted that \u201cI would assume I would have gone over ... the four limited rights of appeal [with appellee] after [appellee] pled guilty,\u201d but he did not give a written form to appellee about the \u201cfour limited grounds for appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">In its opinion and order entered on May 25, 2010, the trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-12\">On the day of the Plea, the Court asked Mr. Gergely to advise [appellee] of his additional rights after sentencing. [Appellee] was given a document titled, \u201cNotice to [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Defendant\u201d. Mr. Gergely testified at the <em>Coram Nobis </em>hearing that it is his normal practice to either personally read the advice of rights form to his Spanish speaking clients or to have the interpreter translate the form to the client as he reads it in English. In this instance, the transcript does not reflect which method he employed. However, the transcript indicates that there was a discussion off the record after the Court directed Mr. Gergely to advise [appellee] of his additional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">As a result of Mr. Gergely\u2019s testimony and [appellee]\u2019s signature on the \u201cNotice to [the] Defendant\u201d form, the Court finds that [appellee] was advised of his right to file leave to appeal. [Appellee] did not exercise that right. When a plea is valid, if a Defendant fails to seek leave to appeal, he waives his right to challenge his conviction and sentence. In this instance, however, [appellee]\u2019s plea was not valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The State challenges the circuit court\u2019s grant of appellee\u2019s petition for writ of error coram nobis by arguing that appellee waived any claim for coram nobis relief. According to the State, the court properly found that appellee \u201c Vas advised of his right to file leave to appeal\u2019 and \u2018did not exercise that right.\u2019 \u201d The State asserts that the court, however, \u201cdeclined to apply waiver\u201d because the court concluded that \u2018Vaiver applies \u2018[w]hen a plea is valid[\u2019] and ... [appellee]\u2019s plea Vas not valid.\u2019 \u201d (First alteration in original). The State contends that there is \u201cno authority for the circuit court\u2019s novel finding in this regard,\u201d and, in fact, \u201capplicable case authority is to the contrary.\u201d The State concludes that \u201cthere is no requirement that a guilty plea, or claim of court error, be valid for there to be a waiver of any challenge thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Appellee responds that the circuit court \u201ccorrectly held that [appellee] did not waive his right to challenge his conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>and sentence.\u201d Appellee claims that the State has not established that he was \u201cspecifically advised of his appellate rights,\u201d because he was never advised, \u201con the open record,\u201d of his right to file an application for leave, the \u201climited grounds\u201d on which he could have appealed, including his right to appeal the voluntariness of his plea, and the time limit of 30 days during which he should have filed the application for leave to appeal. Appellee further contends that, for a defendant to have waived his right to file a coram nobis petition, the defendant must have been advised prior to the court\u2019s acceptance of his guilty plea \u201cthat by pleading guilty he [wa]s giving up his appellate rights except under four limited grounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In discussing whether appellee waived his right to seek coram nobis relief, we will address (1) whether the circuit court was clearly erroneous in its factual finding that appellee was informed of his appeal rights, and (2) whether the advice provided to appellee regarding his appeal rights was sufficient for appellee to have intelligently and knowingly waived his right to seek coram nobis relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Circuit Court\u2019s Factual Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">For questions of fact, an appellate court \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c). We have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">[I]f, considering the evidence produced at trial in a light most favorable to the prevailing party ..., there is evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination, it will not be disturbed on appeal. Moreover, if there is any competent, material evidence to support the factual findings below, we cannot hold those findings to be clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiZ\"><em>Beck v. Beck, </em>112 Md.App. 197, 202-03, 684 A.2d 878 (1996), (ellipsis in original) (emphasis added) (quotations and altera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>tion in original omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>345 Md. 456, 693 A.2d 354 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the circuit court made a factual finding that appellee \u201cwas advised of his right to file leave to appeal.\u201d In its May 25, 2010 opinion and order, the court explained that its factual finding was based on the transcript from the plea hearing, the \u201cNotice to the Defendant\u201d form, and Gergely\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The transcript from the plea hearing showed that after appellee was sentenced, the trial court asked Gergely to advise appellee of his additional rights, and the court informed appellee that he had \u201csome additional rights that [Gergely would] now ... advise [him] of.\u201d A discussion then took place between Gergely and appellee off the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, appellee signed and dated the \u201cNotice to the Defendant\u201d form, which was filed the same day. The \u201cNotice to the Defendant\u201d form described the three methods available to appellee to seek review of his conviction and sentence: (1) an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals; (2) a written request for his sentence to be reviewed by a panel of three judges of the circuit court; and (3) a written request that the sentencing judge modify, reduce, or strike his sentence. Regarding his appeal rights, the notice advised appellant that, if he entered a plea of guilty, \u201cyou do not have the right to appeal but may apply for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from a final judgment entered by this Court. If you choose to do so, you must file an application with the Clerk of the Circuit Court within thirty (30) days from this date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Regarding the \u201cNotice to the Defendant\u201d form, Gergely testified that, based on his habit, he either read the form to appellee in Spanish or read it to him in English and had the interpreter translate the form. He stated: \u201cI always read the form to the defendant.\u201d Gergely confirmed that he \u201cread directly from the document,\u201d and he never felt that appellee did not understand what was being explained to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>We conclude that the evidence presented supported the circuit court\u2019s factual finding that appellee was informed of his right to apply for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence to the Court of Special Appeals and the time limit for exercising that right. Gergely\u2019s testimony about his habit of advising his clients about their appeal rights after a guilty plea and sentence \u201c[wa]s relevant to prove that [his] conduct\u201d at appellee\u2019s plea hearing \u201cwas in conformity with [Gergely\u2019s] habit or routine practice.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-406. Furthermore, the court found that Gergely\u2019s testimony regarding his habit and practice was credible, and we \u201cgive due regard\u201d to the court \u201cto judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-181(c). Lastly, the \u201cNotice to the Defendant\u201d form, which Gergely read to appellee, informed appellee of his right to apply for leave to appeal his conviction and sentence, and the time period within which such right must be exercised; and appellee acknowledged receipt of the form with his signature. Accordingly, the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in finding that appellee \u201cwas advised of his right to file leave to appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Sufficiency and Timing of Advice Regarding Appeal Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">In its opinion, the circuit court concluded that, although appellee was properly advised of his right to apply for leave to appeal and did not exercise that right, he did not waive his right to challenge his conviction and sentence, because waiver occurs only when a plea is valid. As the State correctly points out, \u201cthere [is] no authority for the circuit court\u2019s novel finding ..., and the circuit court stated none.\u201d Furthermore, the circuit court\u2019s conclusion is contrary to the concept of waiver. When a defendant waives his right to apply for leave to appeal, he waives his right to challenge the validity of his guilty plea, which includes his right to a substantive review of his challenge. If waiver was determined by first looking at whether a plea was valid or not, the concept of waiver would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>be eviscerated, because the merits of the challenge would be reviewed every time whether or not a waiver occurred. In other words, whether a waiver occurred is a separate inquiry from whether a plea was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Appellee advances two main arguments to support his claim that he did not waive his right to seek coram nobis relief: (1) the \u201cNotice to the Defendant\u201d form was insufficient to advise him of his appeal rights because it \u201cdid not inform [him] of the four limited grounds on appeal,\u201d and (2) the \u201cNotice to the Defendant\u201d form was signed after appellee entered his guilty plea, thus he \u201cwas not informed of his appellate rights before entering the plea.\u201d We will address these arguments separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Was it necessary for appellee to have been advised of the \u201cfour limited grounds on appeal\u201d in order for him to have waived his right to file for coram nobis relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">In <em>Holmes v. State, </em>401 Md. 429, 932 A.2d 698 (2007), the Court of Appeals recognized that \u201cordinary concepts of waiver apply to coram nobis petitions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 932 A.2d 698. Quoting <em>Shok v. State, </em>361 Md. 52, 79, 760 A.2d 647 (2000), the Court in <em>Holmes </em>stated that the \u201csame body of law concerning waiver and final litigation of an issue ... applicable under the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act, Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 [Cum.] Supp.), Art. 27 \u00a7\u00a7 645A(b) through (d), shall be applicable to a coram nobis proceeding challenging a criminal conviction.\u201d 401 Md. at 440, 932 A.2d 698 (quotations omitted). The sections of the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act cited by the Court were recodified without substantial change in Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-106 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cC.P.\u201d). <em>See Holmes, </em>401 Md. at 454 n. 8, 932 A.2d 698. C.P. \u00a7 7-106(b)(1)(i)(4) provides that \u201can allegation of error is waived when a petitioner could have made but intelligently and knowingly failed to make the allegation ... in an application for leave to appeal a conviction based on a guilty plea.\u201d If a petitioner \u201ccould have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>made an allegation of error ... but did not make [the] allegation,\u201d \u201ca rebuttable presumption\u201d exists \u201cthat the petitioner intelligently and knowingly failed to make the allegation.\u201d C.P. \u00a7 7-106(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-5\">[I]f an individual who pleads guilty, having been informed of his right to file an application for leave to appeal from his conviction and sentence, does not file such an application for leave to appeal, a rebuttable presumption arises that he has waived the right to challenge his conviction in a subsequent coram nobis proceeding. Because [the appellant] did not rebut the presumption of waiver, nor demonstrate \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to excuse his failure to file an application for leave to appeal, his right to challenge his conviction and sentence through a writ of error coram nobis petition was waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-6\"><em>Holmes, </em>401 Md. at 445-46, 932 A.2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">If the defendant does not rebut the presumption of waiver or \u201cdemonstrate \u2018special circumstances\u2019 to excuse his failure to file an application for leave to appeal, his right to challenge his conviction and sentence through a writ of error coram nobis petition\u201d has been waived. <em>Id. </em>at 446, 932 A.2d 698. In other words, unless a defendant can rebut the presumption or show that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exist, the standard for waiver under <em>Holmes </em>is whether the defendant \u201cwas informed of, and understood, his right to file an application for leave to appeal, and did not file an application for leave to appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474-75, 932 A.2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">Since <em>Holmes, </em>this Court has applied the principles of waiver articulated therein in two cases, <em>Gross v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 320, 973 A.2d 895 (2009), and <em>Miller v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 658, 11 A.3d 340 (2010). In <em>Gross, </em>we held that \u201cthe information given to [the appellant] in this case on the date the plea was accepted and later at the time of sentencing was not sufficient to constitute a waiver of his right to later file a petition for <em>coram nobis </em>relief.\u201d 186 Md.App. at 331, 973 A.2d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Prior to the acceptance of his plea, the appellant in <em>Gross </em>was advised by the trial court that \u201cby entering a plea of guilty you\u2019re giving up your right to a direct appeal of this case but you will have a right to ask for leave to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328-29, 973 A.2d 895 (emphasis omitted). On a later date, after the appellant had been sentenced, the court advised the appellant as follows: \u201cYou have 30 days to appeal this sentence, 30 days to ask for a three judge panel, and 90 days to file a motion for reconsideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). The appellant never filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 973 A.2d 895. Six years after he was sentenced, the appellant filed a petition seeking a writ of error coram nobis. <em>Id. </em>at 323, 973 A.2d 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">In holding that the information given to the appellant was not sufficient to constitute a waiver, this Court, speaking through Judge James P. Salmon, reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">Technically, appellant did not have a right to appeal \u201chis sentence\u201d as he was told on the date sentence was imposed. He had a right to file a[n] [application] seeking leave to appeal the conviction and sentence. <em>Holmes, </em>401 Md. at 445-46 [932 A.2d 698]. Moreover, at no point was he told that he had thirty days to file a[n] [application] for leave to appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 331, 973 A.2d 895 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">This Court concluded by emphasizing \u201cthe importance of telling any defendant who pleads guilty that he or she has \u2018thirty days from the date of sentencing to file a[n] [application] asking the Maryland Court of Special Appeals for leave to appeal the sentence and the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>If such advisement is given and (1) the defendant does not file such application within 30 days and (2) no \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exist, <em>\u201ccoram nobis </em>relief will be deemed waived.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">In <em>Miller, </em>on June 1, 1999, the appellant pled guilty to the charge of possessing 448 grams of cocaine with the intent to distribute. 196 Md.App. at 660, 11 A.3d 340. The circuit court accepted the appellant\u2019s plea and sentenced him the same day to five years\u2019 imprisonment without the possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>parole. <em>Id. </em>At the end of the guilty plea and sentencing proceeding, the circuit court advised the appellant of his appeal rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">THE COURT: You have 80 days from today\u2019s date, Mr. Miller, to petition a higher court, called the Court of Special Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">And if your application for appeal is granted, you have ten days to ask our court reporter to type out the proceeding of this plea. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">THE [APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">THE COURT: And you have 30 days to ask a three-judge panel composed of three judges other than myself to review your sentence. They may increase your sentence, decrease it or maintain it as is....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">Lastly, you have the right to ask me as the sentencing judge to reconsider your sentence. I cannot increase your sentence. I could not, in my opinion, decrease it because I am bound by law to impose a five-year mandatory sentence, or I can leave it the same. Do you understand your rights? And your request is to be made in 90 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">THE [APPELLANT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 683, 11 A.3d 340 (ellipsis in original). The appellant did not file an application for leave to appeal to this Court within 80 days after sentence was imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 660, 11 A.3d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">On June 18, 2009, the appellant filed a Petition for Writ of Error Coram Nobis. <em>Id. </em>at 661, 11 A.3d 340. In his petition, he contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that he did not \u201cknowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently\u201d enter his guilty plea because, relying on <em>Durbin v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 442, 468 A.2d 145 (1983), \u201che was not advised, prior to acceptance of his plea, that by pleading guilty he was foregoing his right to direct appeal, and was thus limited to filing an application for leave to appeal, on four limited grounds.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 661, 680, 11 A.3d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>In an opinion authored by Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr., this Court acknowledged that the Court of Appeals in <em>Holmes </em>\u201cwas very clear with respect to the foreclosing effect of a failure to apply for leave to appeal on a subsequent coram nobis claim,\u201d in that a rebuttable presumption of waiver arises where \u201c \u2018an individual who pleads guilty, having been informed of his right to file an application for leave to appeal from his conviction and sentence, does not file such an application for leave to appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683-84, 11 A.3d 340 (emphasis omitted). We noted that the appellant in <em>Miller </em>\u201chad reason to be fully aware of <em>Durbin </em>..., which had been on the books for 16 years,\u201d and yet did not apply for leave to appeal on that basis. Id. at 683, 11 A.3d 340. Thus the appellant did not allege any \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to excuse his failure to file an application for leave to appeal. Id. at 684, 11 A.3d 340. Because the appellant had been informed <em>of his </em>appeal rights and failed to apply for leave to appeal within the 30 day time period, this Court concluded that the appellant\u2019s right to seek coram nobis relief on the <em>Durbin </em>issue \u201cwas conclusively waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683-84, 11 A.3d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">In none of the cases that we have discussed, <em>Holmes, Gross, </em>and <em>Miller, </em>was there the requirement that the defendant be informed after sentencing of his \u201cfour limited grounds\u201d for appeal in order for the defendant to be found to have waived his right to seek coram nobis relief. Appellant in the instant case has not cited any authority for such proposition, nor have we found any. Therefore, we hold that the advice of appellate rights that must be given to a defendant after sentencing in order to support a finding of a waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to later file a petition for coram nobis relief does not include informing the defendant of the \u201cfour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>limited grounds\u201d upon which to apply for leave to appeal to this Court can be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">As was stated in <em>Holmes, </em>and expounded upon in <em>Gross, </em>a defendant who pleads guilty only has to be told that he or she has 30 days from the date of sentencing to file an application seeking leave to appeal the sentence and conviction to the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See Holmes, </em>401 Md. at 445-46, 932 A.2d 698; <em>Gross, </em>186 Md.App. at 331, 973 A.2d 895; <em>Miller, </em>196 Md.App. at 683-84, 11 A.3d 340. Accordingly, the advice of appeal rights given to appellee in the case <em>sub judice </em>was sufficient to support a finding of a waiver of his right to petition for coram nobis relief. Because he did not file an application for leave to appeal to this Court within 30 days after the date of sentencing, appellee waived his right to file a petition for coram nobis relief challenging his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We also conclude that appellee did not demonstrate any \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d to excuse his failure to file an application for leave to appeal. <em>See Holmes, </em>401 Md. at 446, 932 A.2d 698. In his petition for writ of error coram nobis, appellee argued that his guilty plea was \u201cinvoluntary\u201d because he had not been informed of the \u201celements of the charge, ... the nature of the charge[,] ... [or] of the maximum possible penalty to which he was exposed as a result of the guilty plea.\u201d He further claimed that the trial court never asked him whether he understood the nature of the charge or whether his attorney had discussed the nature of the charge with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">As in <em>Miller, </em>appellee \u201chad reason to be fully aware\u201d of the claims of error in his petition during the time period in which he could have applied for leave to appeal. <em>See </em>196 Md.App. at 683, 11 A.3d 340. The defects claimed by appellee \u2014 that he was not informed of the elements of, the nature of, or the maximum possible penalty of the charge \u2014 all arose from Maryland case law or a Maryland Rule that existed prior to appellee\u2019s plea hearing in 2008. At that time, Maryland Rule 4-242(c) provided that \u201c[t]he court may accept a plea of guilty only after it determines ... that [ ] the defendant is pleading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.\u201d Regarding the \u201cnature of the charge,\u201d in <em>Abrams v. State, </em>176 Md.App. 600, 933 A.2d 887 (2007), this Court stated that \u201cthe trial judge must either (1) explain to the defendant on the record the nature of the charge and the elements of the crime, or (2) obtain on the record a representation by defense counsel that the defendant has been \u2018properly informed of the nature and elements of the charge to which he [or she] is pleading guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 933 A.2d 887. Regarding the \u201cconsequences of the plea,\u201d in <em>Bryant v. State, </em>47 Md.App. 551, 424 A.2d 1115 (1981), this Court held that \u201cthe court, before accepting a plea of guilty, is required to inform the defendant of the maximum sentence he may receive as a consequence thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556-57, 424 A.2d 1115. Thus appellee had reason to be aware of the errors claimed in his petition at the time that he entered his guilty plea and had the opportunity to challenge such errors prior to the expiration of the timeframe in which appellee could have filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court. Therefore, any challenge to the voluntariness of appellee\u2019s guilty plea based on the errors set forth in appellee\u2019s petition for coram nobis relief were \u201cconclusively waived.\u201d <em>See Miller, </em>196 Md.App. at 683, 11 A.3d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Was it necessary for appellee to be advised of his appeal rights before entering his guilty plea in order for him to have waived his right to file for coram nobis relief?</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Appellee argues that he did not waive his right to file for coram nobis relief because \u201che was not informed of his appellate rights before entering the plea.\u201d Specifically, appellee relies on <em>Holmes, </em>to argue that, \u201ca rebuttable presumption that one has waived his right to file a coram nobis petition only arises if <em>before accepting the guilty plea, </em>the defendant has been advised, on the open record, that by pleading guilty he is giving up his appellate rights except under four limited grounds.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>In <em>Holmes, </em>at the plea hearing prior to the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the appellant\u2019s guilty plea, the appellant\u2019s counsel advised the appellant of the \u201cfour grounds\u201d from which the appellant could apply for leave to appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\">If the higher court should grant that permission, it could only hear an appeal on four grounds. One ground would be whether or not this court had the power to hear this case. The second ground would be whether the sentence given to you by the judge was a legal sentence. The third ground would be whether you have been adequately represented by your attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">The final ground would be whether the plea was entered into freely and voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em>Holmes, </em>401 Md. at 435, 932 A.2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">After the completion of the voir dire in <em>Holmes, </em>the trial court found the appellant\u2019s \u201cplea was entered knowingly and voluntarily, heard the statement of facts from the State\u2019s Attorney, accepted [the appellant\u2019s] guilty plea, and sentenced [the appellant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the appellant\u2019s counsel advised the appellant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">of his right to file an application for leave to appeal his conviction and that such an application must be filed in writing and within thirty days:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">Let me advise each of you your rights at this time. Gentlemen, you each have your right to ask for permission to make an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland. If you want to ask for that permission, you have to do it in writing within thirty days from today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 437, 932 A.2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">Although the appellant in <em>Holmes </em>was informed of the \u201cfour grounds\u201d from which he could apply for leave to appeal before the acceptance of his guilty plea, the Court did not hold that such advisement was required in order to find waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Whether appellee was advised of his appeal rights prior to the entry of a guilty plea goes to the voluntariness of the plea, and not to the issue of waiver. In <em>Miller, </em>the appellant argued that the failure of the trial court to advise him of his appeal rights <em>before </em>the court accepted his guilty plea rendered his guilty plea involuntary. 196 Md.App. at 680, 11 A.3d 340. Although we saw no merit in this contention, we did refer to dicta in <em>Durbin </em>where we said that the \u201cbetter practice\u201d would be to advise a defendant that the right to appeal no longer existed, because \u201c[t]he non-availability of that former statutory right [to appeal], and its replacement by the discretionary application for leave to appeal is a consequence of a guilty plea of which we think a defendant should be informed when deciding whether to plead guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted) (quoting <em>Durbin, </em>56 Md.App. at 449, 468 A.2d 145). In other words, a defendant\u2019s knowledge of his or her appeal rights prior to entering his guilty plea affects, if at all, the issue of whether a guilty plea was voluntarily entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">As was stated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Holmes, </em>the rebuttable presumption of a waiver of the right to challenge a conviction in a subsequent coram nobis proceeding starts with advising the defendant of his or her right to file an application for leave to appeal \u201cfrom his conviction and sentence.\u201d 401 Md. at 445-46, 932 A.2d 698. Such advice must be given after the guilty plea is accepted and the sentence is imposed, because the right to bring any challenge to the conviction and/or sentence in the appellate court does not accrue until that time. <em>See Chmurny v. State, </em>392 Md. 159, 167, 896 A.2d 354 (2006); <em>accord Johnson v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 172, 201-02, 788 A.2d 678 (\u201cIn a criminal case, a final judgment is not rendered until the court has entered a verdict and a sentence. In a criminal case, a final judgment consists of a verdict and either the pronouncement of sentence or the suspension of its imposition or execution.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 180, 798 A.2d 552 (2002). Similarly, we have said that the defendant must be told that the 30 day time period for filing an application for leave to appeal begins on the date of sentencing. <em>See Gross, </em>186 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Md.App. at 331, 973 A.2d 895. To advise a defendant of such time limit prior to the sentencing date, which may be days or months later, is not consistent with the concept of waiver, which is based in part on a failure to exercise a right when one has a right to exercise that right. Therefore, we conclude that the failure to inform a defendant of his or her appeal rights prior to the entry of a guilty plea has no effect on whether the defendant waived the right to file a petition for coram nobis relief challenging the conviction and sentence arising out of a guilty plea. Accordingly, our conclusion in the instant case that appellee waived his right to file a petition for a writ of error coram nobis stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Because appellee waived his right to challenge his conviction and sentence in a petition for writ of error coram nobis, we need not address whether his guilty plea conformed with due process and Maryland Rule 4-242.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; APPELLEE TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">.
