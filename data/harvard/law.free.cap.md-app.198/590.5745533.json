On February 11, 2009, the court entered judgment foreclosing the right of redemption. Appellant, Joseph Voltolina, moved to reopen the judgment on October 13, 2009. The trial court heard arguments on the motion to reopen and denied it by order entered March 4, 2010. Appellant noted this timely appeal on March 17, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Appellant presented two questions for our review, which we have consolidated and rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">Did the trial court err when it held that it had jurisdiction over the tax sale foreclosure and that there was no constructive fraud and denied appellant\u2019s petition to reopen judgment foreclosing his right of redemption?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we answer no and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">At all relevant times, appellant was the Property\u2019s sole owner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant is a member of the International Longshoreman\u2019s Association and is \u201cemployed as a \u2018Checker\u2019 when work is available in the Baltimore ports.\u201d According to appellant\u2019s affidavit, the Property has been his residence all his life, and at the time of these proceedings he lived there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>with his father, who was seventy-four years old during (some portion of) the proceedings and who appellant averred \u201cdoes generally retire to sleep in the early evening hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">On May 14, 2007, the Baltimore City Director of Finance sold a Tax Sale Certificate for the Property to an entity known as City TSC Holdings, LLC, which subsequently assigned the Certificate to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On January 10, 2008, appellee filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to foreclose rights of redemption under Maryland Code (1986, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 14-832 <em>et seq. </em>of the Tax-Property Article (\u201cTP\u201d or \u201cProperty Tax Article\u201d). The complaint named as defendants appellant, appellant\u2019s late grandmother, Anna Tamburo, appellant\u2019s late mother, Rosanna Voltolina, \u201cUnknown Owners Of Property Known As 1250 Hull Street,\u201d and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">On January 28, 2008, the clerk of the court for Baltimore City signed and issued a \u201cnotice to interested parties,\u201d pursuant to Maryland Rule 14-502(b)(3) and at the behest of appellee. Under the case caption, the document states that the object of the proceeding is to secure the foreclosure of all rights of redemption in Property, which had been sold by the Collector of Taxes for Baltimore City and the State of Maryland to appellee. The notice states the complaint alleges, \u201camong other things, that the amount necessary for redemption have not been paid, although more than six (6) months from the date of sale have expired.\u201d The document then describes the Property and provides this warning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">If you or the entity that you represent has a recorded interests, claim, lien or judgment regarding the property or its owner, you and our client are hereby notified of the filing of this Complaint and are warned to redeem the property or file an answer to the Complaint on or before the latest of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">a) The expiration date of the period described in the summons or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">b) Date specified in the Order of Publication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>c) 33 days after the mailing of said Order of Publication[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Continuing, the notice warns the reader that \u201c[fjailure to redeem the property or answer the Complaint may result in a Final Judgment Foreclosing all Rights of Redemption in and as to the property and vesting in the Plaintiff a title, free and clear of all encumbrances.\u201d The notice then adds that, \u201c[t]he above notwithstanding ... a person with a legal interest in the property may redeem at any time until the right of redemption has been finally foreclosed by the actual issuance of a Judgment Foreclosing the Right of Redemption by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Appellee then began a series of attempts to serve appellant with a summons and via substitute process. On February 15, 2008, a process server hired by appellee visited the Property at 10:17 p.m. There was no response to his knocking, so he left a note with his name and telephone number, along with a request that appellant call him. On February 16, 2008, a Baltimore City Sheriff posted a copy of the notice to interested parties at the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">On February 20, 2008, appellee sent appellant an envelope containing a summons and copies of the tax sale certificate, complaint, and initial order of publication. The envelope went by certified mail with restricted delivery and was returned to appellee, unclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">On February 26, 2008, at an undisclosed time, the process server again visited the Property and, after there was no response to his knocking, left another note for appellant with the server\u2019s contact information and a request that appellant call. The process server visited the Property once more, sometime on March 19, 2008, with the same outcome. On April 2, 2008, the process server sent a letter to appellant via regular mail, requesting that appellant contact him. On an unspecified date and time, the server called appellant\u2019s tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>phone number at the Property but was unable to speak with appellant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">On June 5, 2008, appellee again sent certified mailings with the same contents as above. One was addressed to appellant with restricted delivery, and two were addressed, respectively, to Rosanna Voltolina and \u201cunknown tenant or occupant,\u201d without restricted delivery. All three were returned unclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The court issued an order of publication on December 10, 2008.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the case caption at the top, the order states that \u201cthe object of this proceeding is to secure the foreclosure of all rights of redemption in the following property described below in the State of Maryland, sold by the Collector of Taxes for Baltimore City and the State of Maryland to the Plaintiff in this proceeding[.]\u201d The order describes the Property and then continues: \u201cThe Complaint states, among other things, that the amounts necessary for redemption have not been paid although more than six (6) months and a day from the date of sale has expired.\u201d The order then directs appellant to insert a copy of it \u201cin some newspaper having a general circulation in Baltimore City once a week for three (3) successive weeks on or before the 9th day of January, 2009[.]\u201d The order warns \u201call persons interested in the property to appear in this Court by the 8th day of February, 2009 and redeem the property described above and answer the complaint the Complaint or thereafter a Final Judgment will be entered foreclosing all rights of redemption in the property, and vesting in the Plaintiff a title, free and clear of all encumbrances.\u201d The order bears the signature of a judge of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On November 24, 2008, appellee moved for voluntary limited dismissal of Anna Tamburo and the Property\u2019s \u201cUnknown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Owners.\u201d Pursuant to Rule 1-321, appellee mailed copies of its motion to each party via regular mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">In the meantime, beginning December 12, 2008, appellee published the Order of Publication once per week for three successive weeks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 16, 2008, appellee sent copies of the Order of Publication to appellant and \u201cunknown owners\u201d at the Property via certified mail, but they also returned unclaimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The court granted appellee\u2019s motion for limited dismissal on January 13, 2009. According to appellant, the court clerk\u2019s notice of the order of limited dismissal was the first notice that he received, having arrived via regular mail on an unspecified date in \u201cthe latter part of January 2009.\u201d The document bore the case caption \u201cProperty Homes, LLC v. ANNA TAMBURO, ET AL.\u201d and recited the court\u2019s order that \u201cthe Defendants, Anna Tamburo and Unknown Owners of the Property: 1250 Hull St, Baltimore, MD 21230, The Unknown Owner\u2019s Heirs, Devisees, And Personal Representatives and Their or Any of Their Heirs, Devisees, Executors, Administrators, Grantees, Assigns, Or Successors In Right, Title And Interest, hereby are DISMISSED.\u201d Upon receiving the clerk\u2019s copy of the order, appellant avers that he sought counsel but \u201chad a difficult time obtaining representation.\u201d One attorney he consulted \u201cgave him the informal advice that the case had been dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">On February 3, 2009, appellee filed an affidavit of compliance pursuant to TP \u00a7 14-883(a-l), describing its foregoing attempts to serve appellant. The affidavit of compliance includes an affidavit of due diligence sworn by the process server\u2019s custodian of records and explaining the attempts made to serve appellant in person, as described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">On February 11, 2009, the circuit court entered judgment foreclosing all rights of redemption of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Appellant avers that sometime after the court\u2019s February 11, 2009, judgment of foreclosure, he received notice to appear for a status conference scheduled for April 29, 2009.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This spurred a second attempt to retain counsel, but according to appellant, \u201cthe contact he made indicated that he did not handle tax sale foreclosure cases.\u201d That \u201ccontact\u201d advised him to attend the status conference, with or without counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">On June 15, 2009, the Baltimore City Director of Finance deeded the Property to appellee, who recorded the deed on August 11, 2009. On August 19, 2009, appellee mailed to appellant a notice to vacate, required by TP \u00a7 14-836(b)(7), and on August 21, 2009, the circuit court issued appellee a writ of possession of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">At some point after the April, 2009, status conference, the Legal Aid Bureau referred appellant to his first retained counsel. On October 13, 2009, appellant\u2019s counsel entered his appearance in this matter and moved to reopen the judgment under TP \u00a7 14-845(a), alleging lack of personal jurisdiction and constructive fraud in the proceedings for failure of notice and due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">The court heard and denied appellant\u2019s motion to reopen judgment on February 18, 2010. Appellant noted this timely appeal on March 17, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Under TP \u00a7 14-804, \u201c[a]ll unpaid taxes on real property shall be, until paid, liens on the real property in respect to which they are imposed from the date they became or become payable!,]\u201d and \u00a7 14-808 empowers the tax collector to sell that property to satisfy its lien (within the applicable limitations period). Certain interested parties retain a right to satisfy the lien and redeem the property, but a tax sale purchaser may foreclose those rights after satisfying certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>requirements, which the Court of Appeals condensed in <em>Scheve v. Shudder, Inc., </em>328 Md. 363, 370-71, 614 A.2d 582 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afm\">In summary, the statute requires that: (1) the purchaser must file a complaint that conforms with [TP] \u00a7 14-835(a) within two years following the sale; (2) the purchaser must attach the certificate of sale (\u00a7 14-835(b)); (3) the purchaser must attach an affidavit of title search (\u00a7 14-838); (4) the court must issue process and public notice under \u00a7\u00a7 14-839 and 14-840, setting out the time after which the right of redemption will be foreclosed. Thereafter, <em>assuming that due process requirements have been met, </em>the circuit court may enter a final order under \u00a7 14-844.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">A final order under TP \u00a7 14-844 can only be reopened \u201con the ground of lack of jurisdiction or fraud in the conduct of the proceedings to foreclose,\u201d and, if within one year of the judgment date, \u201con the ground of constructive fraud in the conduct of the proceedings.\u201d TP \u00a7 14-845.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Failure of procedural due process deprives the court of jurisdiction and so gives grounds to reopen the judgment under TP 14-845. <em>See CSR, Ltd. v. Taylor, </em>411 Md. 457, 475-76, 983 A.2d 492 (2009). \u201cAn elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice[.J\u201d <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. </em>652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950), <em>accord Griffin v. Bierman, </em>403 Md. 186, 197, 941 A.2d 475 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">However, \u201c[ijt is well settled that due process of law is not violated in application because the interested party did not receive actual notice.\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>403 Md. at 206, 941 A.2d 475. \u201cThe constitutionality of a particular notice mechanism is not to be judged by its actual success \u2014 whether an individual or group is in fact notified \u2014 but turns instead on whether the chosen method is \u2018reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u2019 \u201d L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 10-15 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>732-33 (2d ed.1988) (quoting <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. 652), <em>quoted in Golden Sands Club Condominium, Inc. v. Waller, </em>313 Md. 484, 500, 545 A.2d 1332 (1988). \u201c[D]ue process merely assures reasonable procedural protections, appropriate to the fair determination of the particular issues presented in a given case.... Therefore, the asserted denial of due process is to be tested by an appraisal of the totality of the facts in a given case.\u201d <em>In re Maria P., </em>393 Md. 661, 675, 904 A.2d 432 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The court may also reopen its judgment for constructive fraud, which has, since <em>Jannenga v. Johnson, </em>243 Md. 1, 220 A.2d 89 (1966), been found where a complainant fails to comply with applicable notice requirements. <em>Canaj, Inc. v. Baker &amp; Div. Phase III, </em>391 Md. 374, 423, 893 A.2d 1067 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">We review a decision under TP \u00a7 14-845 using the same standard applied to decisions under C.J. \u00a7 6-408 and Rule 2-535(b). <em>Canaj, </em>391 Md. at 401, 893 A.2d 1067. Therefore, we will not overturn the ruling unless it appears from the record that the trial court erred as a matter of law or abused its discretion in denying the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">As an initial matter, appellee argues that any dispute over sufficiency of service is immaterial because appellant received actual notice of the proceedings, and that it was only his lack of diligence in retaining counsel that deprived him of an opportunity to be heard. While there is no dispute here that the order of limited dismissal spurred appellee to at least inquire about representation in the proceedings, we are persuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that a non-attorney receiving such a limited order of dismissal could easily misinterpret its contents and receipt to mean that the case against him or her had been dismissed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore must determine whether notice was otherwise satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>A. <em>Notice in Tax Sale Foreclosures</em></p>\n<p id=\"Afy\">Before we take up appellant\u2019s points of error, it behooves us to work through the scattershot notice provisions of the Property Tax Article and the Maryland Rules. The briefest version of their rather incestuous origins is as follows: constitutional due process begat Rules 2-121 and 2-122, which were modified and enacted through TP \u00a7 14-836, 14-839, and 14-840, which begat Rule 14-502 and 14-503, which imposes further modifications while also mandating service \u201cin accordance with\u201d Rules 2-121 and 2-122, depending on the circumstances. Not surprisingly, the scheme\u2019s circular construction causes inherent tension that threatens to tear it apart at the canonic seams.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">We see signs of trouble ahead as soon as we search for the proper form and contents of substitute service. When we do, we find practically identical notice content requirements in three different places. First, Rule 2-122(c) requires the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">The notice shall be signed by the clerk and shall include the caption of the case; describe the substance of the complaint and the relief sought; inform the defendant of the latest date by which the response is to be filed; warn the defendant that failure to file the response within the time allowed may result in a judgment by default or the granting of the relief sought; and contain any other information required by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Similarly, Rule 14-502(b)(3) requires</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">... notice setting forth (A) the substance of the complaint and the relief sought, (B) a description of the property in substantially the same form as the description appearing on the collector\u2019s tax records, (C) the time within which a defendant must file an answer to the complaint or redeem the property, and (D) a statement that failure to answer or redeem the property within the time allowed may result in a judgment foreclosing the right of redemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Finally, we have TP 14-840, which applies the same contents requirements to the court\u2019s order of publication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">The property shall be described in the order of publication as the property is described on the collector\u2019s certificate of tax sale. The order of publication shall warn any person that has or claims to have an interest in the property to answer the complaint or to redeem the property on or before the date named in the order of publication and in case of failure to appear, answer, or redeem the property a judgment will be entered that forecloses all rights of redemption in the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Importantly, we see from these passages that an order of publication under TP 14-840 satisfies the content requirements of both Rules 14-502(b)(3) and 2-122(c) \"with only two exceptions: Rule 2-122 specifically requires a case caption, and a Rule 14-840 order of publication is signed by a judge rather than the court clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The Maryland Code and Rules also set forth parallel manners of substitute service. First, an order that adopts the contents suggested by TP \u00a7 14-840 \u2014 as in this case \u2014 requires the complainant to insert notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the relevant county \u2014 here, it was Baltimore City \u2014 once a week for 3 successive weeks.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Second, the complainant must \u201ccause a copy of the order of publication to be mailed by first-class mail or certified mail, postage pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>paid,\u201d to each defendant\u2019s last known address.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> TP \u00a7 14-839(a)(4). Third, notice must be posted in a conspicuous place at the property. Rule 14-503(c); TP \u00a7 14 \u2014 836(b)(6) (\u201cFurther notice of the proceeding shall be required by posting of the property in accordance with applicable Maryland Rules of Procedure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Turning to Rule 2-122, we find parallel means of substitute service. Under that rule, notice must be mailed to appellant\u2019s last known address, 2-122(a), and <em>either </em>published in a newspaper for a time period identical to that above, 2-122(a)(2), <em>or </em>posted at the property, 2-122(a)(3).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Finally, the two strands enact similar time limits. So long as the complainant satisfies the court\u2019s prompt order of publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>cation<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the time for mailing notice under TP \u00a7 14-839(a)(4) and posting under Rule 14-503(c), then it will have fulfilled Rule 2-122(b)\u2019s requirement that service be effected \u201cat least 30 days before the date by which a response to the complaint is to be filed.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Despite the fact that the forgoing provisions are generally consistent in their required content, as well as in their time and manner of service, they contain certain conflicts that lie at the heart of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">B. <em>Substitute Service in Tax Sale Foreclosures</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Appellant first argues that the court\u2019s judgment of foreclosure should have been reopened because appellee failed to comply with the affidavit and order provisions of Rule 2-122. As to jurisdiction, it is established as a matter of law that such an affidavit is not required by due process and thus is unnecessary for the court to exercise jurisdiction. <em>Jannenga, </em>243 Md. at 4, 220 A.2d 89 (citing <em>Hauver v. Dorsey, </em>228 Md. 499, 180 A.2d 475 (1962)) (\u201cthe mere failure to file an affidavit or other evidence of compliance with the requirements of [former] Maryland Rule 105 is not a jurisdictional defect such as would void a decree setting aside an owner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>rights of redemption.\u201d). Nor is there any authority or reason to hold that service lacking only an <em>order </em>would violate due process or deprive the court of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, appellant can prevail only if appellee\u2019s failure to file an affidavit or obtain a court order for substitute service worked a constructive fraud on him. For the reasons that follow, we hold that, because appellee filed an affidavit showing that reasonable and good faith efforts to serve appellant at his last known address failed, and because appellee posted, mailed, and published notice pursuant to the default notice provisions of TP \u00a7\u00a7 14-836, 14-839, 14-840, and Rule !4-503(c), appellant was served \u201cin accordance with Rule 2-122\u201d and thus he was not constructively defrauded.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Rule 14-503 provides that, if the complaint includes defendants whose whereabouts are unknown, then the \u201cthe notice filed in accordance with Rule 14\u2014502(b)(3), after being issued and signed by the clerk, shall be served in accordance with Rule 2-122.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Turning to Rule 2-122(a), however, we are instructed that \u201cthe court may order\u201d substitute service thereunder \u201cwhen the plaintiff has shown by affidavit that the whereabouts of the defendant are unknown and that reasonable efforts have been made in good faith to locate the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The problem with the construction of these provisions defies simple explanation, but we shall do our best to explain them and why they lead to our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">First, Rule 14-503 presupposes that the defendant\u2019s whereabouts are either known or unknown to the complainant, but then directs the complainant to follow a rule that is conditioned upon filing an affidavit and obtaining an order of court to establish that presupposed fact. It is possible that the superseding and mandatory substitute notice provisions of the Property Tax Article, if properly effected, obviate the need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>an affidavit or order under Rules 14-503 and 2-122.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We need not resolve that issue, however, because appellee\u2019s affidavit of compliance showed that reasonable and good faith efforts to serve appellant personally had failed and \u2014 as explained more fully, below \u2014 that his whereabouts were thus unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">We have concluded that appellee filed an affidavit sufficient for purposes of Rule 2-122. We still must ask whether appellee fully complied with 14-503(b) by serving appellant \u201cin accordance with Rule 2-122.\u201d We earlier stated that due process and jurisdiction do not strictly require an order of substitute process, but our present concern is constructive fraud, and we are convinced that there was none for two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>reasons. First, appellee filed a sufficient affidavit and so it only failed to <em>request </em>an order under Rule 2-122, an order that would have been proper because appellant\u2019s whereabouts were unknown and \u2014 as we hold, below \u2014 reasonable good faith efforts to serve his last known address had failed. Furthermore, had the order issued, it merely would have called for substitute service that was not only mandatory under TP \u00a7\u00a7 14-836, 14-839, 14-840, and Rule 14-503(c) but actually effected by appellee.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Lacking only an immaterial order, appellee met all the time, content, and manner requirements of Rule 2-122 and thus served appellant \u201cin accordance with Rule 2-122,\u201d as required by Rule 14\u2014503(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">G. <em>Knowledge, Whereabouts, and Reasonable and Good Faith Efforts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Regardless of whether appellee needed an affidavit or order of court, appellant argues that substitute service pursuant to Rules 14-503(b) and 2-122 was improper \u2014 and thus violated due process or amounted to constructive fraud\u2014 because appellee had actual knowledge of his correct residential address.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument for the simple reason that a complainant\u2019s knowledge of even a \u201ccorrect\u201d residential address does not necessarily mean that the defendant\u2019s \u201cwhereabouts\u201d are known. These concepts are prone to misunder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>standing because the nature of constructive knowledge makes \u201cknowledge\u201d of a specific fact \u2014 such as \u201cwhereabouts\u201d \u2014 dependent on the party\u2019s general knowledge of the circumstances. <em>St. George Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church v. Aggarwal, </em>326 Md. 90, 100-04, 603 A.2d 484 (1992); <em>see </em>note 9, above. Thus, discovery of a defendant\u2019s address will initially mean that the defendant\u2019s \u201cwhereabouts\u201d are known, but when reasonable and good faith attempts to serve process at that address fail \u2014 and if no other facts provide constructive knowledge of a reasonable way to serve the defendant \u2014 then the only valid conclusion can be that the defendant\u2019s \u201cwhereabouts\u201d revert to being unknown.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Were that not so, then a party who knows of a correct address could never proceed with substituted process pursuant to Rule 2-122 in any reasonable manner. <em>See Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 313-14, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950) (\u201cA construction of the Due Process Clause which would place impossible or impractical obstacles in the way could not be justified.\u201d). In addition to the general scheme of Rules 2-121 and 2-122, which provides substitute service as\u2014 obviously \u2014 an <em>alternative </em>to personal service, our logic is bolstered by the fact that Rule 2-122(a) refers to the \u201clast known address\u201d of a defendant whose \u201cwhereabouts are unknown,\u201d implying that failure of service can distinguish an \u201caddress\u201d from \u201cwhereabouts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In sum, we hold that while a \u201ccorrect\u201d or otherwise \u201cvalid\u201d address initially gives a complaining party constructive knowledge of a defendant\u2019s \u201cwhereabouts,\u201d failure of reasonable and good faith efforts to serve process at that address nullifies that constructive knowledge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>We conclude our discussion with the only remaining part of appellant\u2019s argument, which is that appellee\u2019s efforts to personally serve appellant were not reasonable and made in good faith. Appellee presented affidavits that its agents attempted to serve appellant by personal delivery on several occasions and, when those efforts failed, by telephone, mail, and written note. Appellant has presented no authority holding that similar actions are inadequate, and we are not convinced by his argument that the law required anything more of appellee. <em>See St. George Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church v. Aggarwal, </em>83 Md.App. 599, 612, 576 A.2d 224 (1990), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>326 Md. 90, 603 A.2d 484 (1992) (\u201cWe hold that the notice provisions of the statute are constitutional whether actual service is made, so long as substantial adherence to the statute\u2019s requirements are met.\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

Per the explicit language and construction of TP \u00a7 14-839(a), the \"last known address\u201d is that found 1) in any records examined as part of the title examination, 2) the tax rolls of the collector who made the sale, as to the property described in the complaint; or 3) any other address that is known to the plaintiff or the attorney filing the complaint. A complainant need not consult any other sources to discover the defendant\u2019s address, unless those three sources create constructive knowledge of a \"correct\u201d address. <em>Id.; St. George Antiochian Orthodox Christian Church v. Aggarwal, </em>326 Md. 90, 100-04, 603 A.2d 484 (1992) (where information revealed by a search pursuant to TP \u00a7 14-839 made it highly probable that the complainant could obtain the defendant\u2019s correct address with a \"minimum of effort,\u201d the correct address was \u201cknown\u201d to the complainant within the meaning of TP \u00a7 14-839(a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b625-12\">. Rule 2-122(a)(1) also allows \u2014 in addition to mailing and in the alternative to publication and posting at the property \u2014 \"the posting of the notice by the sheriff at the courthouse door or on a bulletin board within its immediate vicinityf.]\u201d Because all tax sede foreclosure cases require posting at the property, per Rule 14-503(c), we need not consider the operation of this alternative provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">We also note that, in addition to some satisfactory combination of mailed, posted, and published notice, Rule 2-122(a) provides that the court \"may order any other means of notice that it deems appropriate in the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">.

Similarly, the time set forth in 14-839(a)(6)(iii) is, by its terms, compliant with Rule 2-122(b). (Subpart 14-839(a)(6)(i) is not relevant because Rule 2-122 does not contemplate actual notice.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">.

Property Tax Article \u00a7 14-839 states the legislature\u2019s position on its supremacy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">(b) <em>Notice to defendants </em>\u2014 Declared <em>reasonable and sufficient. </em>\u2014 The provisions of this section as to notice to persons who may have an interest in property sold for nonpayment of taxes, coupled with the order of publication and the other publicity and notices as ordinarily accompanies the sale of such property, as well as the knowledge of the taxes and the consequences for nonpayment of the taxes is declared:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">(1) to be reasonable and sufficient under all of the circumstances involved, and necessary in light of the compelling need for the prompt collection of taxes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">(2) to supersede any other requirement in other cases or civil causes generally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">We also note that \u00a7 14-840 declares, in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">When the order of publication is issued and published, any person that has any right, title, interest, claim, lien, or equity of redemption in the property is bound by the judgment of the court that may be passed in the case as if the person were personally served with process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">It appears, however, that this last declaration is unconstitutional under <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 318, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (U.S.1950) (\"Where the names and post-office addresses of those affected by a proceeding are at hand, the reasons disappear for resort to means less likely than the mails to apprise them of its pendency.\u201d). <em>See also Griffin, </em>403 Md. at 210, 941 A.2d 475 (the holding in <em>Sanchez v. James, </em>209 Md. 266, 270, 120 A.2d 836 (1956), that \"the Legislature may validly provide that persons having an interest in real properly sold at a tax sale shall be given notice by publication, and that personal service of process in such proceedings is unnecessary\u201d is \"clearly no longer good law and probably was incorrect at the time it was decided.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">. Wc note that Rule 14-503(b) specifically states that the complainant must serve the notice filed under Rule 14-502(b)(3), issued and signed by the clerk, which in a strict sense is not the order of publication. We are convinced, however, that the order of publication in this case suffices, as it included not only the content required by Rule 2-122(c), but the description of the property as required by Rule 14\u2014502(b)(3). And while the order of publication was not signed by the clerk, it was signed by a judge. If we are to construe these rules, per Rule l-201(a), \"to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay,\u201d then Rule 14-503(b) is satisfied by service of a valid order of publication under TP \u00a7 14-840. We also point out that the various notices in this case were effected within the time limits of Rule 2-122, but that is not a strictly necessary result of the default Property Tax Article provisions and Rule 14-503(c); for that to be so, the court must adopt the suggested language of TP \u00a7 14-840 and add a clause ordering prompt publication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b630-6\">. We do not need to determine how knowledge is affected by evasion of service as opposed to the mere failure of good faith efforts. <em>See </em>Rule 2-121(b) and (c). For obvious reasons, appellant has not argued that he evaded service and that appellee should have proceeded under Rule 2-121(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">. Although we do not reach this issue, failure to locate an address pursuant to the limited search provisions of \u00a7 14-839(a)(1) would also render a party's whereabouts unknown for purposes of Rule 14\u2014503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b631-5\">. Appellant attacked appellee\u2019s service of process in a piecemeal fashion, which is a natural strategy given the complex structure of any notice scheme. Therefore, our final note is that, regardless of whether appellee violated some particular provision of the rules or code giving rise to constructive fraud, and regardless of whether the actual notice he received was inadequate, appellant received due process under the totality of the circumstances. Appellee reasonably and in good faith attempted personal service at appellant\u2019s residence and also published, posted, and mailed notice of the proceedings, and appellant was charged by legislative decree with \"knowledge of the taxes and the consequences for nonpayment of the taxes.\u201d <em>See </em>TP \u00a7 14-839(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
