Under the precepts of either Maryland Family Law Article 5-1027(c), or Estates and Trusts Article l-206(a), is a child who is <em>conceived during the marriage </em>but after the separation of a husband and wife, and who is <em>bom after their divorce, </em>considered to be \u201cborn out of wedlock\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">A) If so, was the Judge required by the Family Law statutes to order blood tests without a \u201cbest interests analysis\u201d so as to determine the child\u2019s biological paternity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">B) If a blood test is not mandatory, then did the Judge err in determining that the Appellant had not demonstrated by the preponderance of the evidence that it was in [Gracelyn\u2019s] best interest to have genetic/blood testing done to determine the identity of her biological father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">2. Did the trial court err by placing significant import on an Affidavit of Paternity, purportedly signed by the Appellee\u2019s former husband, that was a) never produced at trial, and which, b) if completed and signed as claimed by the Appellee, would have demonstrated that the signers were guilty of perjury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">3. Did the Court\u2019s denial of the Appellant\u2019s request for blood testing also result in a denial of his due process rights to establish his parenthood, which is a basic human right and liberty guaranteed by the Constitution?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">We will dispose of the appeal on the first issue. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the request for genetic testing was governed by the paternity provisions in the Family Law Article, which required the court to order such testing upon Mr. Corbett\u2019s request. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Mr. and Ms. Mulligan were married on March 26, 1999. They had two sons and one daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The Mulligans separated in April 2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the separation, Ms. Mulligan entered into a relationship with Mr. Corbett, and she became pregnant. Her relationship with Mr. Corbett ended before the child was born, and Ms. Mulligan reconciled with Mr. Mulligan. Gracelyn, the child conceived while Mr. and Ms. Mulligan were married, but separated, was born on January 25, 2010. Although Mr. and Ms. Mulligan were living together at the time of Gracelyn\u2019s birth, they were no longer married; they were divorced on September 25, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On February 25, 2010, Mr. Corbett filed a Complaint for Paternity, Child Support and Visitation Schedule. He asserted that it was in Gracelyn\u2019s best interests \u201cto know for certain who her father is, both for purposes of involvement and bonding as well as for future medical needs.\u201d He alleged that it would be in Gracelyn\u2019s best interests to develop a relationship with him, her actual father. He asked the court to hold a hearing to determine whether DNA testing should be ordered \u201cto determine the parentage of the child,\u201d to establish a visitation schedule, and to determine appropriate child support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">On March 29, 2010, Ms. Mulligan filed a Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim. She maintained that Gracelyn was \u201cthe legal child of Thomas Mulligan\u201d pursuant to Md. Code (2001 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 1-206 of the Estates and Trusts Article (\u201cE.T.\u201d), and she lived with her parents and siblings in Frederick, Maryland. Ms. Mulligan alleged that Mr. Corbett, who lived in Pennsylvania, had not had any contact with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Gracelyn, he had not demonstrated \u201cgood cause of sufficient persuasive force to overcome the statutory presumption\u201d that Mr. Mulligan was the legal father, and the court \u201cshould not require a blood test to determine \u2018paternity\u2019 of a child living with her legal father in a stable home environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">On April 9, 2010, Mr. Corbett filed his response to Ms. Mulligan\u2019s motion to dismiss. He alleged that Mr. and Ms. Mulligan were separated when Gracelyn was conceived, and they were divorced when Gracelyn was born. Because Gracelyn was not born during an intact marriage, Mr. Corbett asserted that E.T. \u00a7 1-206 did not apply, but rather, the applicable statutory provision was Md.Code (2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-1029(b) of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d), which requires that \u201cblood or genetic tests\u201d be ordered upon request. Although he acknowledged that he had not had contact with Gracelyn, Mr. Corbett asserted that there was a court order that barred him from contacting Ms. Mulligan. He stated that he had requested visits with Gracelyn, through his attorney, but Ms. Mulligan had rebuffed all his requests. On April 15, 2010, the circuit court denied Ms. Mulligan\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The court held a hearing on May 13, 2010. Mr. Mulligan testified that he and Ms. Mulligan separated in April 2009, but she returned in September of that year. Mr. Mulligan actively participated in preparing for Gracelyn\u2019s birth. He paid for and attended all of Ms. Mulligan\u2019s prenatal appointments, and he had \u201cpretty much delivered the baby\u201d with the assistance of a midwife. After Gracelyn was born, he continued to pay her medical bills, as well as paying for diapers, clothing, and \u201ceverything she\u2019s needed.\u201d He participated in daily care, and he obtained a second job to pay expenses because Ms. Mulligan was not working outside the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Mr. Mulligan also testified regarding the bond between Gracelyn and her siblings and the family activities they participated in together. He described his children as \u201cthrilled\u201d to have Gracelyn in their family, stating that his sons were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>protective of Gracelyn and his daughter acted \u201clike a little mom sometimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Regarding the issue of paternity of Gracelyn, Mr. Mulligan recognized the possibility that Mr. Corbett was the biological father.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Mulligan encouraged Ms. Mulligan to contact Mr. Corbett on the day Gracelyn was born because Mr. Corbett \u201cha[d] a right to be there.\u201d He told Ms. Mulligan, however, that if Mr. Corbett was unwilling to sign the birth certif\u00edcate, he \u201cwould love to be the baby\u2019s father.\u201d Although Mr. and Ms. Mulligan were not married, Mr. Mulligan testified that they were engaged and planned to marry as soon as time permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">On cross-examination, counsel for Mr. Corbett pressed Mr. Mulligan regarding his past financial troubles and criminal history. Mr. Mulligan admitted that his home had been in foreclosure, but he testified that he had filed for bankruptcy, and the home was no longer in foreclosure. On two previous occasions, 1992 and 2006, Mr. Mulligan had been found guilty of theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Ms. Mulligan testified that in August 2009, because she was pregnant, she resigned her teaching position and moved with her three children to live with Mr. Corbett in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. Mr. Corbett paid for the rent and utilities, but he told Ms. Mulligan that she needed to sign up for food stamps to provide groceries for herself and her children because \u201cit was too hard for him to do it all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">On September 3, 2009, Mr. Corbett became frustrated with Ms. Mulligan\u2019s children, and he told her that \u201che couldn\u2019t stand it anymore,\u201d and \u201che wanted out.\u201d Ms. Mulligan told him that she would go away for the weekend to \u201cgive him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>some time to think about it.\u201d On Friday, September 4, 2009, Mr. Corbett sent Ms. Mulligan a text message asking her to move out of his house by the following Monday.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Ms. Mulligan, who was pregnant and had three children, was unable to move all her things out in that short time frame. Mr. Corbett subsequently left her a phone message that if she did not get her things out of the house, he would put them out on the curb.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Ms. Mulligan subsequently moved out of Mr. Corbett\u2019s home and back to Maryland. She testified that she sent Mr. Corbett an update on the baby after every doctor\u2019s appointment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mr. Corbett had asked if he could be present when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Gracelyn was born, but Ms. Mulligan testified that would not be possible because it would be \u201ctoo hard\u201d given the nature of their relationship. She testified that Mr. Corbett was \u201cantagonistic,\u201d and he had harassed her, prompting her to file harassment charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Ms. Mulligan called Mr. Corbett on the night Gracelyn was born. Mr. Corbett was \u201cvery angry\u201d and told her that she was \u201cvery inconsiderate for not ... letting him be there.\u201d When he asked who was present when Gracelyn was born, she responded that Mr. Mulligan had been there. Mr. Corbett was upset and appalled. Mr. Corbett was also upset because visiting hours were almost over, and he would not be able to see Gracelyn until the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The next morning, Ms. Mulligan called Mr. Corbett to remind him to bring his identification so that he would be able to sign the Affidavit of Parentage for the birth certificate as Gracelyn\u2019s father. Mr. Corbett stated that he would talk about that when he got there. When he arrived at the hospital, he refused to sign the affidavit, stating that he would have \u201cto support [Gracelyn] for 18 years of her life.\u201d He became \u201cvery ugly,\u201d stating that her last name was not Mulligan, and bringing up again that she did not allow him to be there for the child\u2019s birth. The argument became heated, and Ms. Mulligan threatened to call security. Mr. Corbett left and did not contact her again or give her any money or anything else to provide for the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Ms. Mulligan testified that, when the baby was born, she was covered under Mr. Mulligan\u2019s health insurance. She testified that Mr. Mulligan helped to take care of Gracelyn, changing her, bathing her, and feeding her. Ms. Mulligan wanted to marry Mr. Mulligan again, but they could not afford to get married.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Ms. Mulligan also testified about Mr. Corbett\u2019s interactions with her other children. Mr. Corbett never played with the children while she was living with him, he refused to watch television with them, and he was \u201cvery, very harsh with them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">On cross-examination, Mr. Corbett\u2019s attorney confronted Ms. Mulligan with the complaint for absolute divorce that she filed on May 6, 2009. He asked whether she swore in the complaint that she had lived separate and apart from Mr. Mulligan, without engaging in sexual intercourse, since April 4, 2008. After her counsel objected, Ms. Mulligan asserted her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Ms. Mulligan testified that Mr. Mulligan was Gracelyn\u2019s legal father, he acted as her father, and he was the person that Gracelyn knew as her father. Although she was not sure that Mr. Corbett was Gracelyn\u2019s biological father, she believed that he was. Nonetheless, she refused to subject Gracelyn to DNA or blood testing as requested by Mr. Corbett to prove paternity because she did not believe that it was in Gracelyn\u2019s best interests. She stated that her other children felt threatened by Mr. Corbett, that Mr. Corbett did not know how to respond to a child, and that given the angry and tense relationship she had with Mr. Corbett, she did not think that they could share responsibility for Gracelyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Mr. Donald King, Ms. Mulligan\u2019s 79-year-old father, testified regarding the efforts he made to assist his pregnant daughter move out of Mr. Corbett\u2019s home in the 72-hour time frame that Mr. Corbett imposed. He also described Gracelyn\u2019s home environment, stating that she and Mr. Mulligan had \u201cbonded beautifully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Mr. Corbett testified next. He had known Ms. Mulligan \u201cpretty much all [hisj life,\u201d and they began dating in March 2009. They were trying to have a baby. When Ms. Mulligan learned she was pregnant, Mr. Corbett \u201cwas thrilled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">In August 2009, Mr. Corbett and his cousin loaded Ms. Mulligan\u2019s belongings in a truck to move her and her children into his home in Pennsylvania. While Ms. Mulligan and her children lived with Mr. Corbett, he paid rent, utilities, Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Mulligan\u2019s car payment, and general upkeep of the house. Mr. Corbett disagreed with the manner in which Ms. Mulligan disciplined her children. He acknowledged that he had threatened to strike them. He explained that the children put holes in the walls of the house, and he eventually asked that she leave. When Ms. Mulligan moved out of the house, Mr. Corbett contributed $140 toward the cost of the moving truck and gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Mr. Corbett testified that he experienced a great deal of frustration when he attempted to get information about Ms. Mulligan\u2019s pregnancy after she moved out of his home. Specifically, he noted that he was unable to get information regarding her birthing plans or confirmation that Gracelyn would be taking his last name. He denied harassing, threatening, or cursing at Ms. Mulligan. In response to Ms. Mulligan\u2019s testimony regarding his inability to interact with children, Mr. Corbett testified that he had excellent relationships with his nieces and nephews.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Regarding his visit to Ms. Mulligan and Gracelyn in the hospital, Mr. Corbett testified that he had been frustrated that he was not able to visit Gracelyn until the day after she was born. He stated, however, that he was comfortable holding her, and that he loved her. Both of his parents had accompanied him to the visit, and they took turns holding her and taking pictures and videos.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Mr. Corbett stated that he did not sign the Affidavit of Paternity because he \u201cneeded to be 100 percent sure.\u201d He explained that he \u201cwasn\u2019t being treated as the father. I wasn\u2019t there for the birth. The child was not named after me.... I felt that I wasn\u2019t going to risk 18 years of my life [on] a child that I\u2019m not being treated as a father.\u201d Mr. Corbett acknowledged that he was not \u201c100 percent\u201d sure that he was Gracelyn\u2019s father, and he had requested DNA testing at the hospital. Ms. Mulligan refused because it was too expensive. Mr. Corbett denied threatening Ms. Mulligan at the hospital, and he stated that he was holding Gracelyn when Ms. Mulligan threatened to call security. His attorney had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>advised Mm to initiate discussions regarding visitation the week after Gracelyn was born, but he did not do so because he was afraid that Ms. Mulligan would bring more charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">At the conclusion of the testimony, counsel for Mr. Corbett argued that, if the child was born out of wedlock, the court, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 5-1029, had \u201cno authority to do anything other than order DNA tests.\u201d Counsel further argued that, even if the court were not required to order DNA testing, it was in Gracelyn\u2019s best interests that the test be ordered. He asserted that Gracelyn\u2019s current home was not stable, stating that Mr. and Ms. Mulligan had a \u201chistory of breaking up\u201d and financial problems. He explained that Gracelyn would benefit from Mr. Corbett\u2019s child support payments, as well as knowing the identity of her biological father for medical reasons. Counsel argued that Gracelyn was not yet old enough to have forged strong bonds with her siblings or Mr. Mulligan, and there was no risk of emotional harm to Gracelyn by proving that Mr. Corbett was her biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Counsel for Ms. Mulligan argued that the Estates and Trusts Article makes clear that Mr. Mulligan is the legal father of Gracelyn. He asserted that Mr. Mulligan signed an Affidavit of Paternity acknowledging Gracelyn as his child. Because Gracelyn had a legal father, the court was not required to order paternity tests, but rather, the court needed to make a decision based on the best interests of the child. Counsel argued that it was in Gracelyn\u2019s best interests not to have a paternity test and potentially disturb the strong bond that Gracelyn had with Mr. Mulligan, particularly given Mr. Corbett\u2019s prior acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The court issued its decision from the bench. The court ruled that paternity testing was mandated only where paternity was void. In this case, paternity was not void because, pursuant to E.T. \u00a7 1-206, there was a rebuttable presumption that Gracelyn was the legitimate child of Mr. Mulligan because she was conceived during the Mulligan\u2019s marriage. The court stated that the Family Law Article was not \u201cintended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>disestablish [ ] paternity where paternity is statutorily established.\u201d The court determined that, pursuant to E.T. \u00a7 1-206, analysis of the best interests of the child was the standard to determine whether to order genetic testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Applying the best interests standard, the court found that it was not in Gracelyn\u2019s best interests to have a paternity test, noting that she was in an intact family that provided stability, \u201cshe [wa]s well cared for, well loved, [and] well nourished,\u201d both physically and emotionally. Mr. Corbett, on the other hand, had a very limited relationship with Gracelyn, he had kicked Ms. Mulligan out of his home while she was pregnant, and he had a weak relationship with Ms. Mulligan\u2019s other children, whom he threatened with a belt. Moreover, he had not paid for prenatal visits or any of Gracelyn\u2019s needs after her birth. The judge stated that, after observing Mr. Corbett\u2019s demeanor and testimony in court, she believed that the proceedings were \u201ca control thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">On May 26, 2010, the court issued its order, denying Mr. Corbett\u2019s request for paternity testing and ordering that Mr. Mulligan was the legal father of Gracelyn. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The standard of appellate review for an action tried without a jury is set forth in Maryland Rule 8-131 (c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">\u201c \u2018The appellate court must consider evidence produced at the trial in a light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Friedman v. Hannan, </em>412 Md. 328, 335, 987 A.2d 60 (2010) (quoting <em>Ryan v. Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 392, 347 A.2d 834 (1975)). \u201c \u2018If there is any competent evidence to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>factual findings below, those findings cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335-36, 987 A.2d 60 (quoting <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>383 Md. 176, 202, 857 A.2d 1109 (2004)). The deference given to the trial court\u2019s factual findings, however, does not apply to legal conclusions. <em>Clancy v. King, </em>405 Md. 541, 554, 954 A.2d 1092 (2008). Instead, we \u201c \u2018must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>White v. Pines Community Improvement Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>403 Md. 13, 31, 939 A.2d 165 (2008) (quoting <em>YIVO Institute for Jewish Research v. Zaleski, </em>386 Md. 654, 662, 874 A.2d 411 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Mr. Corbett\u2019s first, and ultimately dispositive, contention is that the trial court erred in denying his request for DNA testing to determine paternity of Gracelyn. He argues that the court was required to order a paternity test upon his request, and it erred in considering the best interests of Gracelyn in determining whether to order a paternity test. He further argues that, even if the best interests of the child was the proper analysis for determining whether to order a paternity test, the court \u201cerred in determining that he had not demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it was in Gracelyn\u2019s best interests to have genetic/blood testing to determine the identity of her biological father.\u201d Mr. Corbett asserts that it is in Gracelyn\u2019s best interests to \u201cdetermine for certain who her biological father really is,\u201d he \u201cis willing and able to provide financial support\u201d for her, and he has constantly voiced his desire to build a relationship with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Ms. Mulligan contends that, because Gracelyn was conceived during the Mulligans\u2019 marriage, Mr. Mulligan is presumed to be Gracelyn\u2019s father. She argues that, although blood testing is mandatory on request when there is no legal father, if there is a presumed legal father, testing to rebut the presumption of paternity should be ordered only upon a showing of good cause that it is in the child\u2019s best interests to conduct such tests. Ms. Mulligan contends that the trial court properly applied the best interests test and determined that it was not in Gracelyn\u2019s best interests for a paternity test to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>ordered. She asserts that Mr. Mulligan is better suited to be a father to Gracelyn, noting that he provided health insurance during her pregnancy and for Gracelyn\u2019s birth, attended prenatal doctor\u2019s appointments, and \u201cprovided child support for his other children when the family was separated.\u201d In contrast, Mr. Corbett did not pay for Ms. Mulligan\u2019s prenatal visits or Gracelyn\u2019s health care, he did not attend any prenatal doctor\u2019s visits, and he did not even support Ms. Mulligan while they were living together, instead asking her to apply for food stamps. Moreover, Ms. Mulligan asserts that Mr. Corbett was unable to bond with her other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The first step of the analysis requires us to determine which of two statutory provisions applies to this case. There are \u201ctwo viable methods or proceedings for establishing paternity,\u201d one found in the Estates and Trusts Article and the other in Family Law Article. <em>Kamp v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>410 Md. 645, 655, 980 A.2d 448 (2009). The question regarding which of these two statutory schemes is applicable in this case is a legal determination, which we review <em>de novo. Evans v. Wilson, </em>382 Md. 614, 623, 856 A.2d 679 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Mr. Corbett argues that, because Gracelyn was born after the Mulligans were divorced, she was born out of wedlock, and therefore, the applicable paternity provisions are those in the Family Law Article, specifically F.L. \u00a7 5-1002 and F.L. \u00a7 5-1029(b). Section 5-1002 sets forth the purpose of the paternity provisions in the Family Law Article as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 The General Assembly finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">(1) this State has a duty to improve the deprived social and economic status of children born out of wedlock; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">(2) the policies and procedures in this subtitle are socially necessary and desirable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">(b) <em>Purpose. </em>\u2014 The purpose of this subtitle is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">(1) to promote the general welfare and best interests of children born out of wedlock by securing for them, as nearly as practicable, the same rights to support, care, and education as children born in wedlock;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>(2) to impose on the mothers and fathers of children born out of wedlock the basic obligations and responsibilities of parenthood; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">(3) to simplify the procedures for determining paternity, custody, guardianship, and responsibility for the support of children born out of wedlock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">(c) <em>Establishment of paternity. </em>\u2014 Nothing in this subtitle may be construed to limit the right of a putative father to file a complaint to establish his paternity of a child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Section 5-1029(b) applies to requests for paternity tests in an action governed by the Family Law Article. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\"><em>In general. </em>\u2014 On the motion of the Administration, a party to the proceeding, or on its own motion, the court shall order the mother, child, and alleged father to submit to blood or genetic tests to determine whether the alleged father can be excluded as being the father of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Pursuant to this statute, a trial court has no discretion regarding whether to order a blood test; genetic testing is mandatory if requested by a party. <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 626-27, 856 A.2d 679; <em>Langston v. Riffe, </em>359 Md. 396, 428-29, 754 A.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Ms. Mulligan maintains that the paternity provisions in the Estates and Trusts Article are applicable here. Specifically, she relies on E.T. \u00a7 l-206(a), which sets forth a presumption of legitimacy for a child born or conceived during a marriage. Section l-206(a) provides: \u201cA child born or conceived during a marriage is presumed to be the legitimate child of both spouses.\u201d Ms. Mulligan argues that, because Gracelyn was conceived while she was married to Mr. Mulligan, he is the presumed father, and it is only when \u201cthere is no presumptive father that the Family Law scheme is applicable.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>In the Estates and Trusts Article, unlike F.L. \u00a7 5-1029(b), there is no provision for mandatory genetic testing. Rather, the Court of Appeals has held that a motion for genetic testing under the Estates and Trusts Article is comparable to a request for a physical examination under Maryland Rule 2-423, \u201cwhich the court has discretion to grant for good cause.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 628, 856 A.2d 679.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In determining whether there is good cause to order genetic testing to determine paternity, the court \u201c \u2018must\u2019 consider the husband and wife\u2019s privacy interest along with petitioner\u2019s interest in a relationship with the child,\u201d and it \u201cmay consider \u2018the best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Turner v. Whisted, </em>327 Md. 106, 114, 116, 607 A.2d 935 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The issue of which statutory scheme is applicable here is critical to assess the propriety of the court\u2019s order below. If, as Ms. Mulligan argues, the Estates and Trusts Article applies, then the circuit court properly considered the best interests of Gracelyn in determining whether to order the requested genetic testing to rebut the presumption that Mr. Mulligan was the father. If, however, the Family Law Article provisions apply, then the court was required to order testing without a consideration of Gracelyn\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The Maryland appellate courts have addressed the choice of statutory provisions on several occasions, primarily in the context of a child born during a marriage. In <em>Turner, </em>327 Md. at 109-10, 607 A.2d 935, two men claimed to be the father of a child: (1) Turner, who had a sexual relationship with the mother, who subsequently became pregnant; and (2) the man she married before she gave birth. After the child\u2019s mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>and her husband separated, and Turner and the mother reconciled and then broke up again, Turner filed a complaint for visitation and a motion for a blood test to establish his paternity. <em>Id. </em>at 110, 607 A.2d 935. The Court of Appeals held that the Estates and Trust Article was the appropriate statutory provision to establish paternity when a child was born during a marriage. <em>Id. </em>at 113, 607 A.2d 935. The Court explained that, \u201cwhere a child is presumed \u2018legitimate\u2019 and \u2018where two men each acknowledge paternity\u2019 of that child, the procedure for considering the issue of paternity under the Estates and Trusts Article is preferable because it presents the \u2018more satisfactory\u2019 and \u2018less traumatic\u2019 means of establishing paternity.\u201d <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 628, 856 A.2d 679 (quoting <em>Turner, </em>327 Md. at 113, 607 A.2d 935). The Court referenced the trial court\u2019s discretion under the Estates and Trusts Article, allowing the court to weigh the interests of the parties and the best interests of the child in determining whether to grant or deny genetic testing. <em>Turner, </em>327 Md. at 116, 607 A.2d 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">This Court revisited the issue in <em>Stubbs v. Colandrea, </em>154 Md.App. 673, 675, 841 A.2d 361 (2004), where Mr. Stubbs sought blood tests to establish paternity and obtain visitation of a child born to, and conceived by, Ms. Colandrea while she was married to Mr. Colandrea. The Court noted that the pertinent facts were similar to <em>Turner, i.e., </em>a man attempting to obtain a blood test to establish paternity of a child born during a marriage of the mother and husband, which supported the trial court\u2019s action in assessing whether ordering the tests was in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>Id. </em>at 679-80, 841 A.2d 361.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The Court noted, however, that subsequent to <em>Turner, </em>the General Assembly had enacted changes to the Family Law Article. <em>Id. </em>at 680, 841 A.2d 361. In particular, the Court addressed the impact of the addition of F.L. \u00a7 5-1002(c), which states: \u201cNothing in this subtitle may be construed to limit the right of a putative father to file a complaint to establish his paternity of a child.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Writing for this Court, Judge Rodowsky engaged in a thorough analysis of the legislative history of F.L. \u00a7 5-1002(c), noting that the purpose of the statute was to \u201c \u2018clarify[ ] that a putative father may file a paternity action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 841 A.2d 361 (quoting 1997 Md. Laws, Chap. 609 at 3333). Judge Rodowsky determined that the General Assembly enacted \u00a7 5-1002(c) in response to federal legislation that required states, as a condition to continuing to receive federal assistance, to have laws in effect regarding paternity proceedings, including genetic testing, to increase the effectiveness of the child support enforcement programs. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 841 A.2d 361. The Court concluded that \u201cthe federal impetus for Section 5-1002(c) was aimed at providing \u2018fathers of children born out of wedlock\u2019 an avenue for establishing their paternity for the purpose of \u2018honoring their support obligations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 635, 856 A.2d 679 (quoting <em>Stubbs, </em>154 Md.App. at 688, 841 A.2d 361).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The Court held, however, that F.L. \u00a7 5-1002(c) applied only to a \u201cputative father,\u201d which is defined as \u201cthe alleged biological father of a child born out of wedlock.\u201d <em>Stubbs, </em>154 Md.App. at 688, 841 A.2d 361 (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 623 (7th ed.1999)). Because the child in that case was not born out of wedlock, Stubbs was not a putative father covered by the statute. <em>Id. </em>Noting that the child was supported by her mother and presumed father, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">Nothing in the text of FL \u00a7 5-1002(c), or in its Maryland or federal legislative histories, indicates that the General Assembly intended to alter the <em>Turner v. Whisted </em>test for determining whether a blood test should be ordered under the circumstances presented here, or that the Federal Government intended to require, under the circumstances presented here, a mandatory blood test similar to that provided by FL \u00a7 5-1029.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The Court of Appeals echoed this analysis in <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 635-36, 856 A.2d 679. In that case, Evans claimed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>be the biological father of a child conceived and born when the child\u2019s mother was married to another man. <em>Id. </em>at 617-18, 856 A.2d 679. Evans filed a complaint to determine paternity, requesting that the court order the parties to submit to genetic testing. <em>Id. </em>at 621, 856 A.2d 679. The circuit court denied the request, finding that the mother\u2019s husband was the presumed father because the child was born while the mother was married to him, and that Evans had to demonstrate that a paternity test would be in the best interests of the child, which Evans did not do. <em>Id. </em>The Court addressed Evans\u2019 argument that the 1997 addition of \u00a7 5-1002(c) expanded a putative father\u2019s rights, giving a putative father an absolute right to demand genetic testing. <em>Id. </em>at 629, 856 A.2d 679. The Court construed \u00a7 5-1002(c) as \u201cprohibit[ing] any construction of the statute that would limit the right of a \u2018putative father\u2019 to file an action to \u2018establish paternity of a child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 856 A.2d 679 (quoting <em>Stubbs, </em>154 Md.App. at 680, 841 A.2d 361). The Court held, however, consistent with the holding in <em>Stubbs, </em>that the General Assembly enacted F.L. \u00a7 5-1002(c) \u201cto ensure the protection and support of children <em>bom out of </em>wedlock,\u201d and because Evans was suing to establish paternity of a child born during a marriage, the statute did not apply to him. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 856 A.2d 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">[Considering the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard represents the best policy for evaluating when a child born during a marriage can be ordered to undergo paternity testing. If the mandatory blood or genetic testing under Section 5-1029 could be invoked every time an individual seeks to establish paternity of a child born during a marriage, the consequences to intact families could be devastating. Without regard to the child\u2019s best interests, courts would be forced to order genetic tests of every child whose paternity is merely questioned. This would be the case even if the child is well cared for and could assert that he or she does not want his or her life to be disturbed. We do not believe that, in enacting the \u201cPaternity Proceedings\u201d of the Family Law Article, the legislature intended such an effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 636, 856 A.2d 679. The Court held that Turner \u201cremain[ed] the controlling precedent for cases such as this, where two men (one the husband of the mother and the other a stranger to the marriage) acknowledge the paternity of a child born during a marriage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In two more recent cases, this Court and the Court of Appeals have applied the best interests of the child analysis to determine whether genetic testing should be ordered for a child born during a marriage. In both <em>Kamp, </em>410 Md. at 665-66, 980 A.2d 448, and <em>Ashley v. Mattingly, </em>176 Md.App. 38, 39-40, 55, 932 A.2d 757 (2007), the issue was whether genetic testing should be ordered upon the request of the father, after divorce, for the purpose of avoiding child support. In both cases, the trial court determined that, because the children were born during the parents\u2019 marriage, the best interests analysis pursuant to E.T. \u00a7 1-206(a) applied. <em>Kamp, </em>410 Md. at 665-66, 980 A.2d 448; <em>Ashley, </em>176 Md.App. at 39-40, 55, 932 A.2d 757.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The present case is distinguishable from the above cases because here the child was not born during a marriage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Gracelyn was conceived while Mr. and Ms. Mulligan were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>married, albeit separated, but she was born after they were divorced.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">There certainly are policy reasons to support the trial court\u2019s application of the best interests analysis to a child born out of wedlock under the circumstances of this case. A purpose of the Family Law Article paternity provisions is \u201cto promote the general welfare and best interests of children born out of wedlock by securing for them, as nearly as practicable, the same rights to support, care, and education as children born in wedlock.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 5-1002(b)(1). Here, Gracelyn is being provided with support and care by Mr. Mulligan, who is presumed to be her father. <em>See </em>E.T. \u00a7 l-206(a) (\u201cA child born or conceived during a marriage is presumed to be the legitimate child of both spouses\u201d); F.L. \u00a7 5-1027(c)(1) (\u201cThere is a rebuttable presumption that the child is the legitimate child of the man to whom its mother was married at the time of conception.\u201d). Thus, with the exception of the fact that Gracelyn was born out of wedlock, her situation is similar to that described in <em>Turner; </em>Gracelyn \u201cis presumed legitimate\u201d and \u201ctwo men each acknowledge paternity.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>327 Md. at 113, 116, 607 A.2d 935. Under these circumstances, an argument can be made that the best interests analysis under the Estates and Trusts Article, which permits a balancing of the competing interests, is the appropriate way to establish paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The General Assembly, however, has provided that a \u201cputative father\u201d of a child born out of wedlock has the right to bring a paternity action under the Family Law Article. <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 5-1002(c) (\u201cNothing in this subtitle may be construed to limit the right of a putative father to file a complaint to establish his paternity of a child.\u201d). Indeed, the Court of Appeals has explained that \u201cSection 5-1002(c) was aimed at providing \u2018fathers of children born out of wedlock\u2019 an avenue for establishing their paternity for the purpose of \u2018honoring their support obligations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 635 n. 6, 856 A.2d 679 (quoting <em>Stubbs, </em>154 Md.App. at 688, 841 A.2d 361). It stated that \u00a7 5-1002(c) \u201cprohibits any construction of the statute that would limit the right of a \u2018putative father\u2019 to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>an action to \u2018establish paternity of a child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 856 A.2d 679 (quoting <em>Stubbs, </em>154 Md.App. at 680, 841 A.2d 361). More recently, the Court has stated that \u201c[w]hen the child is \u2018born out of wedlock,\u2019 \u201d the Family Law paternity provisions apply. <em>Kamp, </em>410 Md. at 656, 980 A.2d 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Thus, because Gracelyn was born out of wedlock, the Family Law Article was the proper statutory provision to address Mr. Corbett\u2019s request for genetic testing to determine Gracelyn\u2019s paternity. Pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 5-1029, which provides that the court \u201cshall order\u201d genetic tests upon a motion by a party, the court was required to order genetic testing after Mr. Corbett requested it. If the results establish that Mr. Corbett is Gracelyn\u2019s father, the court should consider Gracelyn\u2019s best interests with respect to Mr. Corbett\u2019s request for visitation. <em>See Meyr v. Meyr, </em>195 Md.App. 524, 545, 7 A.3d 125 (2010) (\u201cMaryland law charges trial judges with the authority to make decisions regarding visitation upon a determination of the children\u2019s best interest.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

There was some dispute about the actual date that the Mulligans separated. Mr. Mulligan testified that they separated in April 2009.
