Davies, appellant, was convicted of felony theft, embezzlement, and unauthorized use of a credit card. The circuit court sentenced Davies to five years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but eighteen months suspended. Davies noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">On appeal, Davies presented six questions for review, including the following three, which we have renumbered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">[1] Did admission of an out-of-court written statement that certain credit-card charges were \u201cunauthorized\u201d (which unidentified declarants prepared at the request of the State for use in the prosecution) violate the hearsay rule and the Confrontation Clause?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">[2] Did the court erroneously quash a defense subpoena for evidence of bias and motive regarding the State\u2019s key witnesses on the grounds that the State, which did not obtain this evidence, allegedly provided in discovery the evidence that it had obtained?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">[3] Did the court erroneously exclude evidence and prevent cross-examination regarding the bias and motive of the State\u2019s key witnesses to discredit Mr. Davies and to falsely accuse him of unauthorized credit card use [where the evidence would show that] he had previously accused them of financial irregularities and mismanagement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">We answer the first question in the affirmative, and we will reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment. Because the second question is likely to arise again in the event of a new trial, we will address it, and answer in the affirmative. The third question has not been adequately preserved for our review, but can be pursued by Davies at the time of new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Immanuel Church has approximately 4000 members and eight pastors. Located in Montgomery County, Maryland, it has annual revenues of approximately $8 million. In March 2007, the Church hired John Davies to manage its finance department. The Church\u2019s finance department has several employees who \u201chandle receivables, payables, payroll, [and] various other duties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The finance department administered the Church\u2019s credit card accounts, including one with Capital One VISA. If Church employees wanted to make a purchase using the Capital One card, they were supposed to submit request forms (sometimes referred to as \u201cauthorized user documents\u201d) for the finance department\u2019s approval, and then sign out the credit card. After making a purchase, the employees were expected to return the card to the finance department with the receipt for the purchase. A finance department staff member was then supposed to enter the authorization information into the Church\u2019s computer accounting system.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In July 2008, Davies resigned from his position as finance manager. Pastor Guy Carey \u2014 who oversaw the finance department and was a member of the Church\u2019s executive team\u2014 assumed the duties of the finance manager, and began reviewing the credit card statements for the Capital One account. Upon reviewing these statements, Pastor Carey noticed charges which he questioned. According to Pastor Carey, he also became aware for the first time that Davies had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>added to the list of persons authorized by Capital One to use the Church\u2019s credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The Church reported to the Montgomery County Police Department that Davies had made unauthorized credit card purchases. The police requested that the Church prepare a spreadsheet summarizing which of the charges on the Capital One account were unauthorized. In response, the Church gave the police a spreadsheet \u201cprepared by the finance department and others,\u201d which was comprised of six columns labeled: \u201cDate,\u201d \u201cVendor,\u201d \u201cDescription,\u201d \u201cCharge amount,\u201d \u201cPayments,\u201d and \u201cEmployee Dishonesty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Pastor Carey said that the Church took the following steps to compile the spreadsheet. The Church obtained credit card statements from Capital One for the period of February 2008 to September 2008. The chart\u2019s \u201cDate,\u201d \u201cVendor,\u201d \u201cCharge amount,\u201d and \u201cPayments\u201d columns were copied directly from the Capital One statements. Church staff reviewed each of the charges listed on the statements to determine which of the charges were not supported by proper documentation in the Church\u2019s records of approved credit card purchases. In order to do so, Church staff reviewed various finance department records to determine whether the required authorized user documents existed for each of the purchases. If the forms could not be found, Church staff listed the dollar amount of the purchase in the \u201cEmployee Dishonesty\u201d column. Church staff also attempted to learn the purpose for each of the charges by calling the vendor at which the credit card was used and/or by referring to the Church\u2019s own records. If Church staff could find information regarding the purpose for the charge, that information was listed in the \u201cDescription\u201d column. For instance, one entry in the Description column indicated that, on March 24, 2008, there was a charge of $227.00 for \u201c3rd Party Collection J. Dav,\u201d and the corresponding amount $227.00 appears in the column under Employee Dishonesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Based on the information provided to them by the Church, the police obtained and executed a search warrant at Davies\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>home. Police recovered evidence of items that had been purchased or paid for with the Church\u2019s Capital One VISA. The evidence that was seized included life insurance documents, car insurance documents, a bill from a plumber who had performed work on Davies\u2019s home, and bottles of mail-order acne medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Prior to trial, Davies served the Church with a subpoena to produce, among other information, the \u201c[f|orms or other documents reflecting requests for permission to use, or approval of the use of, the Church Credit Cards.\u201d Davies also served a subpoena upon the Church\u2019s outside accountant commanding the accountant to produce, among other documents, the Church\u2019s 2006 and 2007 financial statements, its correspondence \"with Davies, and reports made to the accountant by Davies during his tenure. The State successfully moved to quash the subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The State used the Church\u2019s spreadsheet described above to create two charts that were offered as exhibits at trial. The first chart, which was admitted into evidence over Davies\u2019s objection as State\u2019s Exhibit 3, is a 6-page document that contains the same information as the spreadsheet, but the label of the \u201cEmployee Dishonesty\u201d column had been changed to \u201cUnauthorized Charges.\u201d The second chart, which was admitted into evidence over Davies\u2019s objection as State\u2019s Exhibit 4, is a one-page summary, derived from State\u2019s Exhibit 3, listing the subtotal of unauthorized charges for each statement period.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Davies moved in limine to exclude State\u2019s Exhibits 3 and 4. The circuit court reserved ruling on the motion. At trial, the State elicited testimony from Pastor Carey to lay a foundation for the introduction of the charts. Pastor Carey explained that unidentified persons at the Church gathered the information shown in the \u201cDescription\u201d and \u201cUnauthorized Charges\u201d columns in State\u2019s Exhibit 3. During this direct examination, the testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">[The State]: Okay. Now, this column here, \u201cdescription,\u201d what is in that column?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>[Pastor Carey]: Description was entered by staff is, if they were able to determine something in either a phone call to a vendor or from direct records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection. Move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll sustain the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">[The State]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">BY [The State]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">Q. The information in the \u201cdescription\u201d column that is\u2014 phrase it this way. Where the church was able to confirm what the purposes of charges that were on the initial credit card statement, were you able to find out, this is a legitimate charge, basically. Did the church then make a notation in this \u201cdescription\u201d column as to why that was a legitimate charge about, that appeared on the credit card statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">[Pastor Carey]: There were two functions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">THE COURT: Overruled....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">[Pastor Carey]: There were two functions actually occurring in the description, and with the reconciliation. In that none of these items had been posted properly to the financial records of the church, there was also an attempt to distinguish what expenses, if they were approved, they related to; and if they were unapproved, what they might have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">[The State]: Okay. All right. Then the last column here of \u201cunauthorized charges,\u201d how was it decided if an entry was made in that unauthorized column?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-14\">[Pastor Carey]: All of the records that we have that would indicate approval to purchase with credit card would require approved purchase request, and approved credit card use request. Those records were consulted to determine whether or not the paperwork existed for approval. If the paperwork existed for approval, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>searched. If an item was not there, then the vendor was contacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">[The State]: Okay. All right. And\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">[Defense Counsel:] Objection. Move to strike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">BY [The State]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">Q. And where you were not able to find any records supporting the payment, it was then put, listed in the unauthorized charge [column], is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">[Pastor Carey]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Over Davies\u2019s repeated objection, the circuit court admitted State\u2019s Exhibits 3 and 4. In addition, the court admitted, without objection by Davies, the monthly credit card statements which the Church had used to complete portions of the charts. No authorization forms were introduced by the State. Nor did the staff members who were said to have conducted the searches for authorization forms testify regarding their inability to locate authorization forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">Two Church pastors testified at trial that Capital One had told them that its records reflected there were three approved users of the credit card: Davies, and two other Church employees \u2014 Pastor Charles Schmitt and Terry Golden. Pastor Carey testified that, during the investigation of credit card charges, the Church distinguished Davies\u2019s usage of the card from the other two approved users by a review of \u201csignatures and merchant receipts and/or from the authorized user documents that [the Church retains] when it authorizes a purchase.\u201d No such documents were offered in evidence, however. Pastor Carey said that these documents \u201cweren\u2019t requested\u201d by the police when the Church submitted its report. Davies was never given the opportunity to review the referenced documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Davies sought to introduce into evidence as Defense Exhibit 7 a report he had authored as the finance manager shortly before his termination. In the report, Davies made numerous criticisms of the management of the Church\u2019s finances by its leadership, including Pastor Carey. Davies alleged in his report that the Church administration had improperly concealed a $340,828 discrepancy in its 2006 financial statements. The circuit court excluded this evidence, and sustained objections to Davies\u2019s attempt to elicit testimony concerning allegations of the Church\u2019s financial mismanagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Summary Exhibits</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The decision to admit evidence is ordinarily left to the circuit court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>Bern-Shaw Limited Partnership v. Baltimore, </em>377 Md. 277, 291, 833 A.2d 502 (2003). Nevertheless, if the circuit court\u2019s \u201cruling involves a pure legal question, we generally review the [ ] court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo.\u201d Id. Accord Hall v. UMMS, </em>398 Md. 67, 82-83, 919 A.2d 1177 (2007); <em>J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Park &amp; Planning, </em>368 Md. 71, 92-93, 792 A.2d 288 (2002). Statutory interpretation and the admission of hearsay are legal questions subject to <em>de novo </em>review. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Bernadyn v. State, </em>390 Md. 1, 7-8, 887 A.2d 602 (2005) (citation omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">We review rulings on the admissibility of evidence ordinarily on an abuse of discretion standard. Review of the admissibility of evidence which is hearsay is different. Hearsay, under our rules, <em>must </em>be excluded as evidence at trial, unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay rule excluding such evidence or is \u201cpermitted by applicable constitutional provisions or statutes.\u201d Md. Rule 5-802. Thus, a circuit court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. Whether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Similarly, in a criminal trial, the court has no discretion to admit \u201ctestimonial evidence\u201d that would violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights under the Confrontation Clause. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) (\u201cWhere testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d). As we noted in <em>Snowden v. Slate, </em>156 Md.App. 139, 143 n. 4, 846 A.2d 36 (2004), <em>aff'd, </em>385 Md. 64, 867 A.2d 314 (2005): \u201cWe ... apply the <em>da novo </em>standard of review to the issue of whether the Confrontation Clause was violated----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In the present case, the circuit court admitted State\u2019s Exhibits 3 and 4 pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-1006, which permits, upon certain conditions, a summary of the contents of voluminous documents to be admitted into evidence in lieu of the voluminous documents. Pertinent to this case, the documents which are summarized must themselves be \u201cotherwise admissible.\u201d Here, because of (1) the investigators\u2019 commentary added to State\u2019s Exhibit 3 under Description, and (2) the exhibit\u2019s representation of the investigators\u2019 conclusions as to which charges were \u201cunauthorized,\u201d State\u2019s Exhibit 3 did not satisfy the requirement of Rule 5-1006 that it summarize only \u201cwritings, recordings, or photographs, otherwise admissible.\u201d State\u2019s Exhibit 4 was a summary derived from State\u2019s Exhibit 3, and was, therefore, not admissible because State\u2019s Exhibit 3 was not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Rule 5-1006 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs, otherwise admissible, which cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form of a chart, calculation, or other summary. The party intending to use such a summary must give timely notice to all parties of the intention to use the summary and shall make the summary and the originals or duplicates from which the summary is compiled available for inspection and copying by other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>parties-at a reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be produced in court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Rule 5-1006 is derived from Federal Rule of Evidence (\u201cFRE\u201d) 1006.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Like FRE 1006, Maryland Rule 5-1006 does not require that the summarized writings, recordings, or photographs themselves be introduced into evidence even though the underlying documents must nevertheless be \u201cotherwise admissible.\u201d <em>Milton Co. v. Bentley Place, </em>121 Md.App. 100, 121, 708 A.2d 1047 (1998) (for purposes of admitting a summary under Rule 5-1006, \u201cthe original ... records were not required\u201d), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>354 Md. 264, 729 A.2d 981 (1999). <em>See United States v. Bakker, </em>925 F.2d 728, 736 (4th Cir.1991) (FRE 1006 \u201cdoes not require that the original voluminous material be introduced into evidence\u201d). Further, under either rule, the party seeking to introduce the summary is required to make the underlying documents available for inspection and copying by the other party at a \u201creasonable time and place.\u201d <em>Mattvidi v. NationsBank, </em>100 Md.App. 71, 88-89, 639 A.2d 228 (1994) (summary properly admitted into evidence where underlying records were \u201cprovided to appellants four months prior to trial\u201d). In contrast to FRE 1006, Maryland Rule 5-1006 includes a requirement that the summary itself also be made available for \u201cinspection and copying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Professor McLain describes the notice requirements of Rule 5-1006 as follows in 6A Lynn McLain, Maryland Evidence \u00a7 1006:1(a) (2d ed. 2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">The proponent must give notice of his or her intent to use summary evidence, so as to allow the opponent to be prepared to evaluate its accuracy. The opposing party must be afforded an adequate opportunity to inspect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>underlying writings at \u201ca reasonable time and place.\u201d The judge may require their production in court (a result that should be avoided if production in court is too impractical).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">(Footnotes omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Davies objected at trial that (a) part of the information which had been summarized in State\u2019s Exhibit 3 was inadmissible hearsay; and (b) even if the exhibits had been properly limited to summarizing writings that were otherwise admissible, the State failed to make the underlying documents \u201cavailable for inspection and copying\u201d as required by Rule 5-1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Davies\u2019s first contention challenges whether the information in the summary chart meets the requirement of Rule 5-1006 that the summary be comprised exclusively of information contained in documents which are \u201cotherwise admissible.\u201d As noted above, State\u2019s Exhibit 3 is comprised of four components: (1) information copied from the Capital One statements; (2) information and mental impressions obtained from Church staff members who reviewed the Church\u2019s authorized user documents and receipts to determine whether the charges were unauthorized; (3) information and mental impressions obtained from Church staff members who made phone calls to vendors listed on the statements and reviewed records in order to complete the \u201cDescription\u201d column; and (4) a conclusion made by some unspecified person or persons as to whether each charge was or was not unauthorized. The first component was admitted into evidence. But the remaining components were not, either by way of supporting documents or testimony. And, even if the investigations had been documented in some manner \u2014 as to which there was no evidence \u2014 it is likely that such documents would have been hearsay or double hearsay, and not \u201cotherwise admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The Capital One statements were subpoenaed by Davies himself, and were authenticated and admitted into evidence as business records. But the 130 or so authorized user documents that were apparently found to exist among the financial records of the Church were not offered into evidence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>produced in court, or otherwise made available to Davies for inspection and copying. With proper foundation testimony, they may have been admissible as business records pursuant to Rule 5-803(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Further, Rule 5-803(b)(7) provides that the <em>absence </em>of a business record may be used to prove \u201cthe nonoccurrence or nonexistence of the matter, if the matter was a kind about which a memorandum, report, record, or data compilation was regularly made and preserved.\u201d <em>See </em>McLain, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 1006:1(c). Accordingly, it might have been possible for appropriate persons with personal knowledge to have testified that, in the language of Rule 5-803(b)(7), \u201ca diligent search [had] disclosed that [an authorization form for a questioned charge or charges] is not included in the\u201d business records of the Church that had been kept in accordance with Rule 5-803(b)(6). But there was no such testimony offered in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In addition to failing to satisfy the \u201cotherwise admissible\u201d prerequisite of Rule 5-1006, the State never made the underlying documents which were purportedly summarized in the charts available to Davies \u201cfor inspection and copying,\u201d as is expressly required by the rule. At trial, the State explained that, \u201cas soon as we received any document\u201d from the Church, the document was turned over to Davies as part of the prosecutor\u2019s open file discovery policy. The State, however, apparently neither requested nor received from the Church the authorized user documents, receipts, or other pertinent documents that the Church had used to create the spreadsheet. Davies attempted to subpoena these documents himself. On the State\u2019s motion, however, the circuit court quashed Davies\u2019s subpoena in which he requested these documents, despite the mandate of Rule 5-1006 that the party seeking to introduce a summary \u201cshall make the summary and the originals or duplicates from which the summary is compiled available for inspection and copying by other parties at a reasonable time and place.\u201d <em>Cf. Hutchinson v. State, </em>36 Md.App. 58, 62-63, 373 A.2d 50 (1977) (recognizing that, in a case where the circuit court allowed testimony summarizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the contents of a defendant-prisoner\u2019s administrative file, which was not in evidence, the defendant \u201cor his counsel had the right, of course, to examine the file\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Davies\u2019s complaint about being denied the opportunity to inspect the underlying documentation is not a mere technicality. A genuine concern about the reliability of the Church\u2019s credit card records was raised during the testimony of one Church employee who was called as a witness by the State. After testifying that she was in charge of accounts payable at the Church, the witness described the procedures that are theoretically supposed to be followed by persons who use the Church\u2019s credit cards. But she then acknowledged that the procedures were not always followed and that the Church\u2019s credit card records were \u201cincomplete\u201d and \u201cinaccurate.\u201d The following testimony was elicited during the State\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">Q [By the State] Okay. And again, were any of those cards, was anyone authorized to make personal purchases on those cards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">A [By the Church employee responsible for accounts payable] No. But we did have a, some purchases that people made without my okay, or my boss okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">Q Okay. And when you were attempting to reconcile the account, you would then note whether or not it was an authorized charge, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">A Yes. I would send out e-mails because just, even before John [Davies] came, there was a problem with the credit cards. A lot of people knew the numbers, and they would even make purchases\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">Q I\u2019m going to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-11\">A \u2014without getting the card\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-12\">Q Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-13\">A \u2014from me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-14\">Q [By Defense Counsel] Ma\u2019am, I think you testified that there were problems with, at the church with people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>using the credit card without authorization, and not sending you the right form, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-4\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">Q Okay. And that happened before John Davies was at the church?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">Q Okay. I think you testified about some of the procedures that you did to do the reconciliations for the credit cards, and the authorizations.

In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), the Court explained the standard for determining whether an error was harmless in a criminal case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYr\">We conclude that when an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Here, State\u2019s Exhibits 3 and 4 were the only source of information presented to the jury that purported to set forth which charges were unauthorized. We are not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the exhibits did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict. Consequently, we reverse the judgments entered by the circuit court, and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Because the following issues are likely to arise in the event of a retrial, we will address them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Document Subpoena</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">Davies contends that the circuit court erred in quashing his subpoena of the records of the Church\u2019s accounting firm (\u201cthe Reumont firm\u201d). Davies argues that the court should not have quashed his subpoena for the production of the following documents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u2022 Documents relating to work the Reumont firm performed in connection with any audit or investigation of alleged thefts by John Davies and/or Collin Booth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">\u2022 Copies of [the Church\u2019s] financial statements for 2006 and 2007 \u2014 the years that Mr. Davies worked on the preparation of the financial statements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">\u2022 Reports prepared by the firm for [the Church] during Mr. Davies\u2019[s] tenure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u2022 Correspondence (including reports or memoranda) the Reumont firm sent to or received from John Davies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The State moved to quash the subpoena on grounds that it would result in \u201cundue burden or expense\u201d under Rule 4-266(c). Davies filed an opposition in which he argued that the requested documents were \u201crelevant to the bias and motivations of [the Church\u2019s] witnesses.\u201d Prior to trial, the circuit court, relying upon the State\u2019s assurance that it had already submitted to Davies all the documents it had available to it, quashed the subpoena. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">All right, well, the representation is that the documents that [the State has] available to [it] have been submitted in discovery, so at this juncture, we\u2019re ready for trial. I\u2019ll grant the motion [to quash].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">The right to compulsory process under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights includes the right to subpoena admissible evidence. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>345 Md. 437, 450, 693 A.2d 344 (1997). \u201cAll facts tending to prove bias, prejudice, improper motivation, or interest are proper subjects for impeachment of a witness.\u201d McLain, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 607:2(a). In <em>Martin v. State, </em>364 Md. 692, 698, 775 A.2d 385 (2001), the Court of Appeals explained that a criminal defendant\u2019s right to impeach a witness concerning possible interest, bias, or motive to lie has its roots in both the federal constitution, and Maryland Declaration of Rights. Davies\u2019s ability to impeach the witnesses against him by offering evidence to show that he had criticized the witnesses was unduly limited by the court\u2019s quashing of the subpoena. The circuit court abused its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>tion in denying Davies access to these documents which relate to the Church\u2019s potential motive to make criminal accusations against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Cross-examination</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Davies also contends that the circuit court erred in limiting his cross examination of the Church\u2019s witnesses relative to their potential motives for making accusations against him. Davies attempted to elicit testimony regarding discrepancies in the Church\u2019s bookkeeping, and sought to introduce as Defense Exhibit 7 a report he authored as finance manager in which he criticized the Church\u2019s financial management. On appeal, Davies argues that this evidence was admissible to impeach the Church\u2019s witnesses by demonstrating their bias or motive to fabricate the criminal charges against him. When we review the trial transcript, however, it is not clear to us that Davies made clear to the trial court the argument made on appeal. Consequently, we decline to address this issue further. <em>See </em>Rule 8-131(a). Upon retrial, Davies will have another opportunity to offer evidence that might show that the witnesses against him had a motive to make false accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.
