On April 28, 2007, a pit bull escaped from a pen that was located in the backyard of a residential property in Towson, Maryland. In an alley adjacent to the backyard of the property, the pit bull seriously injured ten-year-old Dominic Solesky. The property from which the dog escaped was owned by Dorothy M. Tracey, appellee, and rented to Thomas C. O\u2019Halloran and Erin Cesky, the owners of the pit bull that attacked the child. On March 24, 2008, the child\u2019s parents \u2014 Anthony K. Solesky and Irene Solesky (\u201cthe Soleskys\u201d), appellants \u2014 filed a complaint against the dog\u2019s owners and the landlord, seeking money damages in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The claims against the dog\u2019s owners were discharged in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"AUz\">The claims against the landlord included counts alleging negligence and strict liability. During discovery, the Soleskys moved for sanctions against the landlord for not attending a deposition due to poor health, and for spoliation of evidence. The circuit court denied both of these motions, and the case proceeded to a jury trial. At the close of the Soleskys\u2019 case, the landlord moved for judgment, and the circuit court granted judgment in her favor, ruling there was insufficient evidence that the landlord (a) was on notice of the vicious nature of the dog, or (b) retained control over the tenants\u2019 use of the leased premises. The Soleskys appealed, and contend that the circuit court erred (1) in denying them sanctions, and (2) in granting the motion for judgment in favor of Tracey.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In our view, the evidence, when considered in a light most favorable to the Soleskys, was sufficient to survive a motion for judgment. Accordingly, we will vacate the circuit court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>entry of judgment in favor of the landlord, and remand the case to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Because this appeal arises from the circuit court\u2019s granting of a motion for judgment at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case in a jury trial, our task is to determine \u201cwhether, as a matter of law, the evidence produced during [the Soleskys\u2019] case, viewed in a light most favorable to [them], is legally sufficient to permit a trier of fact to find that the elements\u201d of a cause of action have been proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Driggs Corp. v. Md. Aviation, </em>348 Md. 389, 402, 704 A.2d 433 (1998); Md. Rule 2-519(b). As Chief Judge Krauser observed for this Court in <em>Moore v. Myers, </em>161 Md.App. 349, 363, 868 A.2d 954 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">\u201cMaryland has adopted a very restrictive rule about granting [motions for judgment] in negligence actions.\u201d <em>Banks v. Iron Hustler Corp., </em>59 Md.App. 408, 423, 475 A.2d 1243 (1984). Indeed, it \u201chas gone almost as far as any jurisdiction that we know of in holding that meager evidence of negligence is sufficient to carry the case to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fowler v. Smith, </em>240 Md. 240, 246, 213 A.2d 549 (1965)). \u201cThe rule has been stated as requiring submission if there be any evidence, however slight, legally sufficient as tending to prove negligence, and the weight and value of such evidence will be left to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\"><em>Accord Plitt v.

State, </em>348 Md. 104, 112, 702 A.2d 741 (1997) (\u201cCircumstantial evidence is in no manner intrinsically inferior to direct evidence.... In a given case, circumstantial evidence may be more persuasive than direct evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>We set forth the following facts, and discussion, in accordance with this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On December 26, 2005, Tracey entered into an agreement to lease the residential property she owned at 208 Burke Avenue (also known as \u201c208 East Burke Avenue\u201d) to O\u2019Halloran and Cesky for one year. Tracey had used the services of a Long &amp; Foster real estate agent to find tenants for the property. The lease agreement included a provision stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">The following pet(s) may be kept on the premises: <em>American Bulldog Terrier. </em>Tenant agrees to arrange for and pay the costs of having the carpets/flooring professionally cleaned, deodorized and treated for fleas, ticks and other vermin at the termination of occupancy, should the above consent be given. Paid receipts for such cleaning and treatment must be provided to Landlord. Tenant further agrees to assume all liability and to be responsible for any damage caused by said pet(s) such as, but not limited to damage to carpets, sub flooring and wood floors, screens, glass and frames and landscaping. Tenant must comply with any pet ordinances enacted by the local authorities, homeowners or condominium associations. Tenant shall not keep the pet on the premises if the pet is or becomes vicious or threatening, bites or attacks any person or other pet, or otherwise is or becomes a nuisance. Tenant assumes full liability for the results of any actions of pet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-7\">With the exception of properties located in Montgomery County, if Tenant permits or harbors a pet on the premises without: 1) permission of Landlord, and 2) payment of the required pet deposit, tenant shall be in violation of the lease. If tenant violates the \u201cno pets\u201d provision of the lease, tenant agrees to pay, as additional rent, $200 per month per animal for each month violation exists, in addition to any damages, physical or otherwise, which in the opinion of Landlord were caused by the unauthorized animal on the premises. Landlord also reserves the right to require removal of the animal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>from the premises, and require additional security deposit to be held for balance of the tenancy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The dwelling known as 208 Burke Avenue comprises the western half of a duplex structure, the other half of which is not owned by Tracey. The main entrance to the property faces south, along Burke Avenue. The backyard of the property contains an unfenced grass plot, and a parking pad. A paved alley abuts the backyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">On December 31, 2006, the initial lease term for 208 Burke Avenue expired. Tracey\u2019s daughter, Rose M. Schisler, drafted a new lease agreement, dated January 22, 2007, to re-let the property to O\u2019Halloran and Cesky. On January 23, 2007, Tracey and Schisler visited 208 Burke Avenue in order to inspect the property and review the proposed new lease with O\u2019Halloran and Cesky. They parked in the alley behind the property. Schisler saw that O\u2019Halloran and Cesky kept two pit bulls on the property, one male and one female. Schisler observed in the backyard what she described as a \u201cvery tall, kind of cube-shaped\u201d pen. A photograph of the pen shows that it is approximately five feet long, five feet wide, and four feet high. It is made of chain-link fencing, and has an open top. Aside from the pen, the backyard of Tracey\u2019s property is unenclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">On the day of the inspection, Tracey, O\u2019Halloran, and Cesky signed the lease agreement Schisler had drafted. Schisler signed the agreement as a witness, and was identified in Paragraph 15 of the lease as the \u201cProperty Manager.\u201d With respect to the dogs, the renewal lease included the following paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">11. Pets: The Lessee is allowed to keep pets that are agreed upon by Lessee and Lessor: 2 pit bull dogs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">13. The Lessee will be civically [sicl and financially responsible for their pets. Should their pet(s) harm anyone, it is the Lessee\u2019s financial responsibility to pay for the damage. The Lessor is in NO Way responsible.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The renewal lease did not contain the additional pet language which was in the Long &amp; Foster lease agreement for the initial lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Approximately three months later, on April 28, 2007, ten-year-old Dominic Solesky was playing with three of his friends in the alley which runs behind Tracey\u2019s property. On the opposite side of the alley are the backyards of houses fronting on Ridge Avenue. Dominic lived at 249 Ridge Avenue with his parents (the Soleskys) and his brother. Dominic and his friends were playing a game in which they would hide, then shoot at one another with foam darts from toy guns. While Dominic was hiding, he heard his friend Scotty scream. Dominic ran to the alley, where he saw Scotty\u2019s toy \u201cgun [lying] in the middle of the alley with a little bit of blood next to it.\u201d Scotty had been bitten by the tenants\u2019 male pit bull, which had escaped from the pen. By the time Dominic reached the alley, O\u2019Halloran had placed the dog back in its pen.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Dominic walked toward the toy gun Scotty had dropped in the alley. As he did so, he heard the sound of a fence rattling. He turned around to see the pit bull that had bitten Scotty \u201ckicking off\u2019 the female pit <em>bull </em>\u2014 ie., standing on the female dog\u2019s back \u2014 in an attempt to climb over the side of the pen and escape. Dominic started running away as the male pit bull escaped the pen. The pit bull overtook Dominic, jumped on his back, and pulled him to the ground. The pit bull bit Dominic\u2019s face, arm, and leg, and \u201cstarted dragging [him] around the alley.\u201d O\u2019Halloran eventually pulled the dog off Dominic. By that time, Dominic was in the alley behind 225 Ridge Avenue, and the occupant of that residence called 911 for help. As a result of the attack, Dominic suffered injuries to his face, left arm, nose, and chest, and a torn femoral artery in his left leg, which required extensive surgery and physical therapy. He spent 17 days in Johns Hopkins Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The Soleskys filed a complaint in circuit court, asserting claims against Tracey sounding in negligence and strict liabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During discovery, the Soleskys noted the deposition of Tracey for March 19, 2009. On March 9, 2009, Tracey\u2019s counsel informed the Soleskys via letter that Tracey was unable to attend the deposition, and offered that Schisler be deposed in her place. At the time, Tracey was 89 years old. Tracey\u2019s counsel provided the Soleskys with two letters from Tracey\u2019s primary care physician stating that Tracey had \u201ccardiac problems and can not tolerate undue stress,\u201d and that the \u201cstress of deposition questioning and court proceedings may exacerbate her medical conditions and may be detrimental to her health.\u201d Counsel for the Soleskys agreed to depose Schisler, and indicated that the Soleskys would renew their request to depose Tracey if Sehisler\u2019s answers were deemed insufficient. Tracey\u2019s counsel did not move for a protective order to prevent Tracey from being deposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">After taking Schisler\u2019s deposition, the Soleskys moved to compel Tracey\u2019s attendance at a deposition, or, in the alternative, moved the court to sanction Tracey by entering a default judgment for her failure to attend the deposition scheduled for March 19, 2009. The court denied the Soleskys\u2019 motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">Considering the medical evidence and advice that the 89 year old Ms. Tracey is unable to appear at a deposition, the granting of this motion would be improvident. Perhaps the movant will utilize the Maryland Rules to find another avenue to obtain information from and about Ms. Tracey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Because Tracey produced almost no documents, the Soleskys also moved for sanctions for Tracey\u2019s alleged spoliation of documents. Counsel for Tracey opposed the motion and explained that, if there ever were any further documents, they had been lost. At an unspecified point in time, Tracey had stopped living on her own, and had moved into her daughter\u2019s home. Schisler testified in her deposition that the movers had lost many of her mother\u2019s things during the move, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>her leasing files. In addition, Schisler testified that she herself had taken photographs of 208 Burke Avenue, but that the digital camera on which these photographs were taken was broken, and she had thrown it away. Schisler\u2019s deposition included the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">Q. [Soleskys\u2019 Counsel] Does your mother maintain a file of leases on properties that she\u2019s ever owned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">A. [Schisler] She did, but again, as I said earlier in the deposition, most of her files were lost in the move.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">Q. How were the files maintained when she lived in her former home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">Q. Did she have a file cabinet of any sort?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">A. She did have a file cabinet----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">Q. ... Did you take photographs of the pen that Mr. O\u2019Halloran had built in the back of the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-11\">A. I don\u2019t know if I did or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-12\">Q. What\u2019s the status of accessing those photographs today, Miss Schisler?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">A. Nil to none.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-14\">Q. Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-15\">A. Because I don\u2019t know where they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-16\">Q. You said your digital camera was broken. Your camera might be broken, but what might be stored in the memory card might well still be there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-17\">A. But once the camera was broken, I threw it away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-18\">The Soleskys moved for the court to enter an order of default against Tracey, or, in the alternative, instruct the jury that it should infer that the destroyed evidence was unfavorable to her defense. The circuit court denied the Soleskys\u2019 motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-19\">What the movant attempts to do is to equate the absence of records held by the landlord, and absence of correspondence, etc. with a failure to preserve which the movant sees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>as equating to an intent to destroy evidence. This is not a permissible inference under the circumstances recited concerning the activities of the 89 year old not[-]all[-]that|_-]well Landlord....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">This is a terrifying and tragic case where a child was severely injured by a pit-bull. However, there is simply no evidence that the Landlord kept prior leases which were thrown away or pictures or anything else which were discarded in connection with this law case or the incident of the attack. [Spoliation of] evidence has to have a nexus [and that] is not evident from the information presented by the movant in support of the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The case proceeded to a three day jury trial. In addition to presenting evidence, as outlined above, regarding the renewal of the dog owners\u2019 lease, the Soleskys elicited testimony from neighbors who described the aggressive nature of the dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Lisa Luntz was a neighbor who lived at 206 Burke Avenue during the years 2000 to 2009. She testified about her experiences with the dog which she described as the male pit bull that attacked Dominic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">Q. [Soleskys\u2019 counsel] And when you were living there\u2014 when you were living there, did you see the dogs in the pen at your neighbor\u2019s home [208 Burke Avenue]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-9\">A. [Luntz] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-10\">Q. And how often did you see the dogs in the pen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-11\">A. When they were living at that home, I\u2019d say almost daily unless maybe they were \u2014 maybe it was a lot of rain or something. Maybe we wouldn\u2019t on that day, but pretty often.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-12\">Q. And how did you feel about the dogs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-13\">[Tracey\u2019s counsel] Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-14\">THE COURT: Rephrase that, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-15\">Q. [Soleskys\u2019 counsel] How would the dogs act when they were in the pen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-16\">A. In terms of when both the male and female came along because originally there was just the female, so when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>male and female were together, originally when the male was a puppy, there was definitely barking, but I certainly didn\u2019t feel threatened or they didn\u2019t appear too aggressive. However, as soon as the male dog was getting older and bigger, that\u2019s when we noticed frequent barking and jumping you know \u2014 remember, this time our daughter is about a year and a half, and we were definitely concerned at that point because anybody that walked out of our home or to our home from the back would experience that aggression from the dogs, particularly the male dog, so unnerving to say the least.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">Q. Did you change your behavior because of the dogs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">A. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">Q. What\u2019d you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">A. We had to start going out our front door, using that as our entrance and exit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">THE COURT: Pardon me. You got to go slower. I didn\u2019t hear your answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">A. I\u2019m sorry. We had to use our front door as our main entrance and exit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-11\">Q. [Soleskys\u2019 counsel] And did you ever see a top or a covering put on the pen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-12\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-13\">Q. Do you know, I guess, roughly when you noticed the male dog being aggressive in the timeline of things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-14\">[Tracey\u2019s counsel] I would object to the conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-15\">THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-16\">A. I can only imagine the dog was a few months old, and he was certainly bigger than a puppy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-17\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-18\">Michelle Bowers lived at 225 Ridge Avenue at the time the pit bull mauled Dominic. She came to Dominic\u2019s aid, and dialed 9-1-1 after the attack. She testified about witnessing the pit bull\u2019s aggressive behavior prior to the day of the attack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Q. [Soleskys\u2019 Counsel] And how did you know who \u2014 how did you know where the pit bull was kept that attacked Dominic?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">A. [Bowers] Because I walk my dog in the alley, and I had walked past multiple times, and the dog has actually tried to jump the fence before and get to us, but the owner of the dog came to the window, did whatever command he did to tell the dog to get down. The dog got down, but needless to say, I stopped walking my dog in the alley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">Q. Your dog, Daisy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">A. My dog is Daisy, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">Q. And how often before Dominic was attacked had you walked past the pit bulls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">A. I mean, what do you mean? I assume before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">Q. How many times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">A. Oh, well, it only took that once with the dog outside for me to not walk the dog back there anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">Q. What did the dog do when you and Daisy walked past him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">A. A lot of growling, barking, and ultimately the dog had stood on the back of the female and was teeter tottering on top with his belly on top of the top of the fence. So all it would have taken is one extra little push, and that dog would have been over.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">At the conclusion of the Soleskys\u2019 case, Tracey moved for judgment pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-519. In granting Tracey\u2019s motion, the circuit court described the evidence presented to it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-16\">So here I am having heard a couple days of testimony, a number of witnesses. The Plaintiff is asking that this Court continue this case on the theory of negligence on the part of Miss Tracey and admittance [sic] indicating she\u2019s primarily negligent for failing to maintain the property in a safe condition and strict liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>So before I get to that, I want to make sure that the parties and the record is clear as to what I see as the evidence at this point in time. Irene Solesky, the very lovely mother, loving mother of Dominic, her testimony was very compelling as to what happened to her son, and I felt pain for her. I\u2019m a father of four kids.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">It is noteworthy that she didn\u2019t even know of the existence of the dogs and never saw the pen. So vis-a-vis liability, her testimony wasn\u2019t helpful at all to his Court. Lisa Luntz, next door neighbor basically, someone moved in in 2007 \u2014 I think she was [i]n error, probably was of '06\u2014 but that\u2019s neither here nor there, eventually [the tenant] had a male pit bull of [sic] puppies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">She saw the dogs in the pen almost daily. Certainly the male was barking. Sometimes the female was barking. They were jumping in the pen. Anyone who walked by would experience their aggressiveness. That\u2019s her language, that\u2019s what they said, and she was concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">She noted no top to the pen, no cover, and she noted that the male after growing past puppyhood became more and more aggressive in her words. She never saw the dog get out of the pen, never saw the dog bite anybody. That\u2019s the testimony from Miss Luntz.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">Michelle Bowers, formerly Mayer, lives off some next door \u2014 I think the other side of 208 \u2014 she watched the owner of the dog on a terrible day involved dragging away. She\u2019s the one who called the police, made the 911 call. She saw the dog one time, maybe twice jumping up and down and was fearful as a result of that and stopped walking her dog past this pen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The court explained its basis for granting judgment in favor of Tracey as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">No provision of the lease gave the landlord control over any portion of the rental premises. Thus the appellees had no duty to inspect the premises, no duty to inspect the premises. That\u2019s significant to this Court. Then [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>case law goes] into the question of knowledge, and this is something that has bothered the Court because I acknowledge how hamstrung [the Soleskys\u2019 counsel] must have felt and his clients that Mrs. Tracey never testified, couldn\u2019t testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">[The court] did not compel her to testify for health reasons and whatever, 89 years old. And I\u2019m sympathetic to [the Soleskys\u2019 counsel\u2019s] argument that he couldn\u2019t get to her knowledge because he couldn\u2019t get to depose her, but there\u2019s lots of ways, as counsel knows, to show knowledge on the part of somebody even without the language of the person. Language can be imputed to people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">So what I was looking for is what knowledge could be imputed inferentially to Mrs. Tracey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">Mrs. Tracey knew that there were two pit bulls, knew that there were two pit bulls. This Court cannot take that knowledge and stretch it out into knowledge that they were vicious. The cases are clear that the knowledge that somebody\u2019s keeping a pit bull acknowledged in the lease seen by her and her daughter does not ipso facto turn it into the knowledge of a vicious animal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">Everybody goes to the act that the animal does like everybody and works backwards and says look how vicious the animal is. This Court can\u2019t do that. I have to look at what the facts and circumstances were in front of Miss Tracey and look prospectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">I can\u2019t look at the conduct of the animal at the time he regrettably attacked Dominic and infer or assume that she knew he was vicious by the fact that there was a pen and by the fact that there [were] two dogs. I can\u2019t do it. I won\u2019t do it. And therefore, I do not feel that there is any evidence from which the jury could find as a fact that these animals were vicious or that Mrs. Tracey had a duty by virtue of some control over the leased premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">I. Denial of Motions for Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The Soleskys argue that the circuit court erred in not sanctioning Tracey for faffing to appear at a deposition, and for her alleged spoliation of evidence. According to the Soleskys, the court\u2019s action deprived them of evidence that may have helped establish Tracey\u2019s knowledge of the danger posed by the pit bull.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The Soleskys sought to depose Tracey on March 19, 2009. Prior to the scheduled date, Tracey\u2019s counsel informed the Soleskys that Tracey would be unable to appear. Tracey\u2019s physician provided two letters explaining that Tracey had \u201ccardiac problems and can not tolerate undue stress.\u201d Counsel for the Soleskys agreed to depose Tracey\u2019s daughter \u2014 who had drafted the lease agreement, had accompanied her mother during the January 2007 inspection of the premises, and had witnessed the signing of the pertinent lease agreement \u2014 in her mother\u2019s stead. But the Soleskys \u201creserve[d] the right to later depose Mrs. Tracey if questions cannot or will not be answered [by the daughter].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The Soleskys subsequently moved to compel Tracey\u2019s attendance at a deposition, and, in the alternative, asked that the court enter a default judgment against her. In denying the Soleskys\u2019 requests, the court found that Tracey\u2019s advanced age and uncontroverted medical problems were sufficient to excuse her from testifying at the deposition, and, subsequently, at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The circuit court has \u201cgreat discretion\u201d in deciding whether to impose discovery sanctions under Md. Rule 2-433. <em>See Rodriguez v. Clarke, </em>400 Md. 39, 56-57, 926 A.2d 736 (2007). We perceive no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision to neither compel Tracey\u2019s attendance nor sanction her, where her non-attendance was due to health issues explained to the Soleskys in advance of the scheduled deposition date.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>In addition, the Soleskys moved for sanctions for alleged spoliation of documents, including photographs, relating to Tracey\u2019s leasing of 208 Burke Avenue. In their motion, the Soleskys argued that Tracey had failed to provide such documents as \u201cthe lease file for the Subject Property, any records of payments, tenant or neighbor complaints and correspondence between\u201d Tracey and her tenants, and between Tracey and her real estate agent. The Soleskys further alleged that Tracey\u2019s daughter had destroyed the photographs which she had taken during the January 2007 inspection of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The circuit court has the discretion to sanction a party for spoliation of evidence. <em>Klupt v. Krongard, </em>126 Md.App. 179, 197-98, 728 A.2d 727 (1999). In <em>Klupt, </em>this Court stated the test to be applied by the circuit court in determining whether the spoliation of evidence warrants a sanction. The threshold inquiry, <em>id. </em>at 199, 728 A.2d 727, is whether there was \u201c[a]n act of destruction\u201d of discoverable evidence on the part of the accused party. By necessity, this inquiry begins after the movant shows that the evidence actually existed in the first place. Here, however, the circuit court noted that there was no evidence that <em>relevant </em>documents or pictures existed. Because the court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the Soleskys\u2019 motion did not support a conclusion that unproduced documents having material relevance to this case had ever been in existence, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to sanction Tracey for allegedly destroying evidence. <em>Cf. Cost v. State, </em>417 Md. 360, 369-71, 10 A.3d 184 (2010) (noting that the destruction of evidence may give rise to a permissible inference that the evidence would have been unfavorable to the destroying party, and that a jury instruction on the issue may be appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">II. The Landlord\u2019s Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">A prima facie case of negligence, in general, requires proof of the following elements: \u201c \u2018(1) that the defendant was under a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury, (2) that the defendant breached the duty, (3) that the plaintiff suffered actual injury or loss, and (4) that the loss or injury proximate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ly resulted from the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shields v. Wagman, </em>350 Md. 666, 672, 714 A.2d 881 (1998) (quoting <em>BG &amp; E v. Flippo, </em>348 Md. 680, 700, 705 A.2d 1144 (1998)). At issue in this appeal is whether the first element is met\u2014 whether a jury could rationally conclude that Tracey had a duty to take reasonable actions to protect persons from the tenants\u2019 pit bulls which Tracey expressly authorized the tenants to maintain on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The Maryland cases that have held landlords liable for injuries caused by an occupant\u2019s dog have imposed a duty upon the landlord based upon two conditions: (1) the landlord\u2019s awareness of the presence of a dog that has exhibited viciousness; and (2) some opportunity for the landlord to exert control over the presence of the dog. <em>Matthews v. Amberwood, </em>351 Md. 544, 570, 719 A.2d 119 (1998) (\u201cwhere a landlord retained control over the matter of animals in the tenant\u2019s apartment [by virtue of a \u2018no pets\u2019 clause in the lease], coupled with the knowledge of past vicious behavior by the animal, the extremely dangerous nature of pit bull dogs, and the foreseeability of harm to persons and property in the apartment complex, the jury was justified in finding that the landlord had a duty to the plaintiffs and that the duty was breached\u201d); <em>Shields, supra, </em>350 Md. at 690, 714 A.2d 881 (\u201ca landlord of commercial property may be held hable for injuries sustained in the common area and caused by a pit bull kept on the leased premises by one of the tenants where the landlord has knowledge of the potential danger in the common area and the ability to rid the premises of that danger by refusing to re-let the premises\u201d). <em>See generally </em>Danny R. Veilleux, <em>Landlord\u2019s Liability to Third Person for Injury Resulting from Attack on Leased Premises by Dangerous or Vicious Animal Kept by Tenant, </em>87 A.L.R.4th 1004, 1012 (1991) (\u201cThe general rule regarding the liability of a landlord to a third person for an attack by a tenant\u2019s animal on the leased premises appears to be that the landlord is not liable unless the landlord had knowledge of the animal\u2019s presence and its dangerous tendencies, and had control of the premises or otherwise had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ability to eliminate the danger by having the animal removed or confined.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In <em>Shields, supra, </em>350 Md. at 670, 714 A.2d 881, a tenant who rented space within a strip mall kept a pit bull named \u201cTrouble\u201d on the leased premises. After the tenant\u2019s lease agreement expired, the landlord permitted the tenant to occupy the premises on a month-to-month basis. Another tenant informed the strip mall\u2019s manager of Trouble\u2019s \u201cviciousness and the possible threat [which] Trouble\u2019s presence posed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 714 A.2d 881. Trouble subsequently escaped from the tenant\u2019s leased space, and bit one of the strip mail\u2019s customers on the leg. While that customer\u2019s suit against the strip mail\u2019s owner was being litigated in circuit court, Trouble bit another person, who also sued the owner of the strip mall, alleging negligence and strict liability. Both attacks by the pit bull occurred in the parking lot of the strip mall. On motions for judgment, the circuit court granted a judgment in favor of the landlord as to each of the two victims\u2019 claims. In a consolidated appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s judgments, noting that the injuries occurred in a \u201ccommon area,\u201d and the owner \u201chad knowledge of the potential danger\u201d as well as \u201cthe ability to rid the premises of that danger by refusing to re-let the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668-69, 714 A.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In <em>Shields, </em>the \u201ccritical factor\u201d of control was present because the landlord could have refused to re-let to the tenant unless the tenant took reasonable steps to ensure that Trouble did not present a danger to others. The Court of Appeals explained, <em>id. </em>at 682, 714 A.2d 881: \u201cAs each month went by, the premises were in effect re-let to [the tenant]. Thus, each time, the [landlord] had the opportunity to refuse to re-let the premises, thereby abating the danger posed by Trouble\u2019s presence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In addition, there was legally sufficient evidence of the landlord\u2019s knowledge of the danger in <em>Shields </em>because: (1) \u201c[t]here was ample indication that [the landlord] was aware of Trouble\u2019s presence at the strip mall\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]here was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>evidence that Trouble was vicious\u201d; and (3) \u201c[t]here was evidence that [the landlord] knew that Trouble was vicious\u201d because the landlord \u201cmade frequent visits to the premises,\u201d and, \u201cgiven the testimony of the other witnesses ... that they had often seen Trouble act viciously, a jury could conclude that [the landlord] also had the opportunity to observe Trouble\u2019s viciousness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687-89, 714 A.2d 881.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Soon after <em>Shields </em>was decided, the Court of Appeals had another occasion to consider a landlord\u2019s liability for injuries inflicted by an occupant\u2019s pit bull in <em>Matthews v. Amberwood, </em>351 Md. 544, 719 A.2d 119. In <em>Matthews, </em>a tenant allowed her boyfriend\u2019s pit bull, named \u201cRampage,\u201d to stay in her apartment, despite a clause in her lease agreement which stated that she was \u201c[n]ot to have any pets on the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549, 719 A.2d 119. Several of the landlord\u2019s employees reported to the landlord\u2019s manager \u201cdangerous encounters involving the dog,\u201d which they described as \u201cvicious.\u201d Rampage subsequently mauled a sixteen-month-old child to death while inside the tenant\u2019s apartment. The child\u2019s parents filed suit, asserting various legal theories, including negligence on the part of the landlord. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the parents on the negligence claim, and the trial court denied the landlord\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 719 A.2d 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In affirming the circuit court\u2019s judgment in favor of the child\u2019s parents against the landlord, the Court of Appeals stated, <em>id. </em>at 557, 719 A.2d 119: \u201c[T]he principle that the landlord may have a duty with regard to matters within his control extends beyond common areas; it may be applicable to conditions in the leased premises.\u201d The Court ruled that the landlord retained control over the dangerous condition <em>(i.e., </em>the presence of Rampage) \u201cby virtue of the \u2018no pets\u2019 clause in the lease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558, 719 A.2d 119. The Court stated that the landlord could have exerted control over the presence of the pit bull by enforcing the \u201cno pets\u201d clause: \u201cThe lease plainly stated that breach of the \u2018no pets\u2019 clause was a \u2018default of the lease.\u2019 Such a default would enable that landlord to bring a breach of lease action to terminate the tenancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The landlord was on notice that the tenant was keeping Rampage in the apartment in violation of the no pets clause, and further knew of \u201cdangerous incidents\u201d involving Rampage. Despite having knowledge of this dangerous condition on the leased premises, the landlord took no action to abate the danger, either by suing the tenant or threatening to sue if the tenant did not \u201cget rid of the aggressive animal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The Court observed that the possibility of someone being attacked by Rampage \u201cwas entirely foreseeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561, 719 A.2d 119. In support of its conclusion that an attack by Rampage was foreseeable, the Court noted that the \u201cextreme dangerousness of this breed ... is well recognized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained, <em>id. </em>at 561-63, 719 A.2d 119:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">Thus, the foreseeability of harm in the present case was clear. The extreme dangerousness of this breed, as it has evolved today, is well recognized. \u201cPit bulls as a breed are known to be extremely aggressive and have been bred as attack animals.\u201d <em>Giaculli v. Bright, </em>584 So.2d 187, 189 (Fla.App.1991). Indeed, it has been judicially noted that pit bull dogs \u201cbite to kill without signal\u201d <em>(Starkey v. Township of Chester, </em>628 F.Supp. 196, 197 (E.D.Pa.1986)), are selectively bred to have very powerful jaws, high insensitivity to pain, extreme aggressiveness, a natural tendency to refuse to terminate an attack, and a greater propensity to bite humans than other breeds. The \u201cPit Bull\u2019s massive canine jaws can crush a victim with up to two thousand pounds (2,000) of pressure per square inch \u2014 three times that of a German Shepard or Doberman Pinscher.\u201d <em>State v. Peters, </em>534 So.2d 760, 764 (Fla.App.1988), <em>review denied, </em>542 So.2d 1334 (Fla.1989). <em>See also Hearn v.

Amberwood Associates, Ltd., </em>351 Md. [at 561, 719 A.2d 119].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Notwithstanding the <em>Matthews </em>Court\u2019s judicial notice of the \u201cextreme dangerousness of this breed\u201d known as pit bulls, <em>id. </em>at 561, 719 A.2d 119, this Court, in <em>Ward v. Hartley, </em>168 Md.App. 209, 220 n. 7, 895 A.2d 1111, <em>cert. denied, </em>394 Md. 310, 905 A.2d 844 (2006), rejected the notion that a victim of a dog attack could establish a <em>prima facie </em>showing of dangerous propensity by simply proving that the attacking dog was a pit bull. In contrast to <em>Shields </em>and <em>Matthews, </em>we affirmed a summary judgment in favor of a landlord in <em>Ward, </em>where \u201c[n]o provision of the lease gave the landlord control over any portion of the rental premises.\u201d 168 Md.App. at 217, 895 A.2d 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In <em>Wan'd, </em>a tenant\u2019s pit bull bit a cab driver on the premises of the tenant\u2019s rental home. The cab driver filed suit against the landlord, alleging negligence and strict liability. The circuit court granted the landlord\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and this Court affirmed. In addition to the lack of evidence that the landlord retained control over the maintenance of pets on the premises, there was also no evidence whatsoever that the landlord knew that this particular dog was aggressive. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 895 A.2d 1111. Notwithstanding the absence of any evidence of express knowledge on the part of the landlord, the plaintiff in the <em>Ward </em>case asked this Court to adopt a rule providing that mere proof that the biting dog is a \u201cpit bull\u201d \u2014 even in the absence of any other evidence of a history of aggressive behavior on the part of the dog' \u2014 satisfies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the plaintiffs evidentiary burden of producing <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a dangerous condition. Writing for this Court, Judge Salmon explained, <em>id. </em>at 220 n. 7, 895 A.2d 1111, that the plaintiff must do more than simply show that the attacking dog was a pit bull:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">The [plaintiff] invites us \u201cto establish an evidentiary rule that harboring a \u2018dog commonly known as a pit bull\u2019 is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of ownership of a vicious dog.\u201d We decline that invitation. First, it would be improper to do so because the appellees had no duty to inspect and discover Sammy\u2019s presence. Moreover, it is far from clear from this record that Sammy was \u201ca pit bull dog.\u201d His owners described him as part pit bull and part chow. But, even if we were to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Sammy was pure pit bull, it is very doubtful, as a factual matter, that all pit bulls (dogs) are dangerous. Under such circumstances, it would be highly improper to impose, by judicial fiat, a principle that everyone should know that \u201cfact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Ward, </em>therefore, established that, despite the widespread knowledge of the tendency of many pit bulls to be <em>vicious </em>\u2014 see <em>Matthews, </em>351 Md. at 561, 719 A.2d 119, discussed above \u2014 in order to hold a landlord liable for injuries inflicted by a tenant\u2019s dog, it is not enough to prove that the tenant was permitted to keep a pit bull on or about the leased premises. Rather, there must be some evidence (1) of the dangerous propensities of the particular dog at issue, (2) that the landlord had notice that the tenant\u2019s dog posed a potential danger to humans, and (3) that the landlord had some right of control over the tenant\u2019s maintenance of the dog. This is true whether the attacking dog is a pit bull or a Shih Tzu.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The Soleskys contend that, in contrast to the <em>Ward </em>case, their evidence did more than simply prove that the offending dog was a pit bull. They assert that Tracey, as the owner of property where a dangerous pit bull was housed, owed Dominic a duty because she and her daughter, who acted as her agent at the time of lease renewal: (a) had actual knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>that her tenant was keeping two pit bulls in a small pen in the backyard of the premises; (b) personally inspected the property when the pit bulls were present and most likely observed the aggressiveness of the dogs, assuming the truth of the neighbors\u2019 testimony that anybody who came near the dogs \u201cwould experience that aggression from the dogs, particularly the male dog, so unnerving to say the least\u201d; (c) given the \u201cdangerous propensities of the breed,\u201d as noted in <em>Matthews, </em>should have foreseen that the presence of the pit bulls at that location posed a danger to passersby and children playing in the alley adjacent to the premises; (d) could have exercised control to abate the danger at the time of lease renewal; (e) rather than exerting control to abate the danger, expressly authorized the tenants to keep the pit bulls on the premises in an inadequate containment pen; and (f) in recognition of the danger presented by the tenants\u2019 aggressive dogs, added a clause to the renewal lease indemnifying the landlord against liability arising from injuries inflicted by the dogs. Tracey, on the other hand, contends that she owed no duty because (a) there was no evidence that she had prior knowledge that the particular pit bull that injured Dominic was prone to violence; and (b) in any event, she did not have the authority to remove the pit bull from the premises to prevent the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">A. Knowledge</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">As noted above, in order for a landlord to have any duty relative to a dangerous animal on the premises, there must be some evidence that the landlord knew of the dangerous condition created by the presence of the animal. Here, Tracey\u2019s knowledge of the presence of the pit bulls is established by the fact that both of the lease agreements she entered into with O\u2019Halloran and Cesky specifically allowed pit bulls to be kept on the premises. Moreover, the Soleskys elicited testimony that Tracey and her daughter inspected the premises on January 23, 2007, and the landlord saw the two pit bulls that were kept on the property. Tracey and her daughter also saw that there was a modest containment pen in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the backyard. Tracey\u2019s daughter described what she saw during the inspection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">Q. [Soleskys\u2019 Counsel] Had you ever seen the chain link pen that Mr. O\u2019Halloran had built in the backyard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">A. [Schisler] Yeah. I think it was there the day we did this <em>[ie., </em>the inspection].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">Q. So that when you signed [the January 23, 2007, lease agreement], you clearly knew that he had two dogs because you wrote that in the document, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">A.

It was a very tall, kind of cube-shaped fence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-15\">Q. Was it the type of fencing that would allow a dog to run?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-16\">A. Not a whole lot, no....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-17\">Q. Okay. How did you know that there were two pit bulls in the property when you prepared the contract, Exhibit 2 to the deposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-18\">A. I don\u2019t know how I kn[e]w that. I just kn[e]w that. I guess my mother must have told me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-19\">Although Tracey does not dispute having knowledge that her tenants maintained two pit bulls on the property, she asserts that there was no evidence from which the jury could have found that she knew these particular pit bulls posed a potential threat of harming anyone. Tracey is correct that there is no direct evidence in the record that she or her daughter personally observed the aggressive tendencies of these particular pit bulls. But, as the Maryland appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>courts have explained many times, circumstantial evidence may satisfy a party\u2019s burden of production. <em>See, e.g., Todd v. Weikle, </em>36 Md.App. 663, 670, 376 A.2d 104 (1977) (\u201cA familiar Maryland rule is that a defendant\u2019s negligence may be shown by either direct or circumstantial evidence and may be inferred from all of the facts of the case.\u201d). And several of the Maryland cases imposing liability for dog attacks have relied upon circumstantial evidence of knowledge of the dog\u2019s potential for inflicting injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In <em>Shields, </em>350 Md. at 684-85, 714 A.2d 881, the landlord \u201cstrenuously argued\u201d that there was no evidence that he had prior knowledge of the vicious tendencies of the tenant\u2019s pit bull (Trouble). The Court of Appeals could not point to any direct evidence of the landlord\u2019s notice of vicious behavior by the pit bull prior to its first attack, but nevertheless held: \u201cAlthough there was no evidence that Trouble had bitten anyone prior to [customer Shields], there was sufficient evidence upon which a jury could find that [the landlord] knew or should have known of Trouble\u2019s presence and viciousness and that Trouble posed a threat to those in the common area prior to the Shields attack.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 714 A.2d 881. The Court noted that a jury could have rationally found that the landlord had knowledge of the viciousness of the pit bull based upon the circumstantial evidence that (a) the landlord often visited the premises, (b) the pit bull was present on the premises, (c) the landlord had talked to the tenant about the pit bull and had told the tenant not to keep the dog there; and (d) <em>other witnesses </em>testified about the pit bull\u2019s frequent exhibitions of aggressive behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 687-89, 714 A.2d 881. The Court held that, \u201cgiven the testimony of other witnesses that Trouble was always present and that they had often seen Trouble act viciously, a jury could conclude that [the landlord] also had the opportunity to observe Trouble\u2019s viciousness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 714 A.2d 881. (Emphasis added.) The same is true of the evidence in the record in the present case regarding the landlord\u2019s knowledge. <em>See also Matthews, </em>351 Md. at 568, 719 A.2d 119, wherein the Court of Appeals quoted favorably from cases from other jurisdictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>which have determined that knowledge of the dangerous condition can be imputed to the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Furthermore, \u201cMaryland does not subscribe to the one bite rule,\u201d <em>Shields, supra, </em>350 Md. at 686, 714 A.2d 881, and a plaintiff is not required to prove that the particular pit bull had actually bitten someone prior to the subject attack in order to recover. <em>Id. </em>In support of this point, the <em>Shields </em>court cited two cases describing the duty of an owner of a vicious animal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\"><em>Bachman v.

But the owner\u2019s knowledge of the dog\u2019s vicious propensity need only be such as to put him on his guard, and to require him as an ordinary prudent person to anticipate the act or conduct of the dog resulting in the injury for which the owner is sought to be held liable.\u201d); <em>Twigg v. Ryland, </em>62 Md. 380, 385-86 (1884) (requiring only that the owner or keeper of a vicious animal have \u201cknowledge of [a vicious animal\u2019s] disposition to commit such injuries\u201d and not that the owner \u201chas seen the animal attack mankind\u201d);</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Several Maryland cases involving dog attacks have pointed to circumstantial evidence of knowledge of a dog\u2019s vicious propensity as sufficient evidence to take the case to the jury. In <em>Herbert v. Ziegler, </em>216 Md. 212, 214, 139 A.2d 699 (1958), a Dalmatian dog caused a horse to throw its rider when the dog \u201ccame running at [the horse\u2019s] legs, growling and barking.\u201d Recognizing that, \u201c[t]o hold liable the owner of a domestic animal that has caused injury, the claimant must show that the owner knew, or by the exercise of ordinary and reasonable care should have known, of the inclination or propensity of the animal to do the particular mischief that was the cause of the harm,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 216, 139 A.2d 699, the Court of Appeals consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ered whether there was sufficient evidence of such knowledge. The sole evidence of knowledge identified by the Court was a comment made by a young stable boy immediately after the incident when he was asked what had happened. The stable boy \u201creplied: \u2018Poppy [the dog] scared Chubby [the horse] again.\u201d Writing for the Court, Judge Hall Hammond wrote, <em>id. </em>at 217, 139 A.2d 699:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-4\">From [the stable boy\u2019s] remark that \u201cPoppy scared Chubby again\u201d, the jury could have found that whenever [the dog] ran at [the horse] as he did on the day of the accident, the otherwise gentle horse became frightened and shied or bolted. The use of the word \u201cagain\u201d clearly permitted the inference that one or more similar occurrences had happened before.... The statement showed the knowledge of [the stable boy] as to the propensities of Chubby and his knowledge was the knowledge of [the dog\u2019s owner], his master, since [the stable boy] acquired it from his handling of Chubby, a part of the duties assigned to him by his master.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">This Court has said that if a plaintiff produces any testimony and any inference of fact fairly deducible therefrom of sufficient probative force to enable an ordinary, intelligent mind to draw a rational conclusion therefrom in support of his right to recover, the case must go to the jury. We think that an ordinary, intelligent mind could rationally find from the evidence that [the stable boy] was [the dog and horse owner\u2019s] agent and acted in the course of his employment in renting the horse, Chubby, to [the rider who was thrown]; that [the stable boy] had knowledge of the propensity of Chubby to be frightened by Poppy; that the accident occurred as a result of the repetition of this propensity; and that the knowledge of [the stable boy who was the owner\u2019s] agent, of the propensities of Chubby was legally imputable to [the owner]. Therefore, we find no error in the action of the trial court in submitting the case to the jury and in permitting the verdict to stand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">A single post-incident comment was also the focus of this Court\u2019s review of the sufficiency of the evidence of a dog <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>owner\u2019s knowledge of the dog\u2019s propensity for aggressive behavior in <em>Mazur v. Scavone, </em>37 Md.App. 695, 378 A.2d 1355 (1977). After a German shepherd dog bit the face of a ten-year-old neighbor girl who was invited inside because she was selling Girl Scout cookies, an adult daughter of the dog\u2019s owners drove the child and the child\u2019s mother to the hospital. In the ensuing litigation, the dog\u2019s owners moved for summary judgment, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to show that they \u201cknew, or by the exercise of ordinary and reasonable care should have known, of the inclination or propensity of the animal to do the particular mischief that caused the harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 697, 378 A.2d 1355. In opposition to the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs filed their sworn answer to an interrogatory in which they stated, <em>id. </em>at 698, 378 A.2d 1355:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">\u201cThe Defendant\u2019s daughter stated in the Plaintiffs car on the way to the hospital that the dog got excited and nervous around strangers and that they would have to get rid of the dog now because he had previously jumped others.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In addition, the plaintiffs filed an affidavit of the child\u2019s mother, in which the mother swore, <em>id. </em>at 700, 378 A.2d 1355: \u201cAfter we were in the car a few minutes, Deborah [the dog owners\u2019 daughter] said that they would have to get rid of the dog now because he had previously jumped someone else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqo\">The dog owners\u2019 daughter denied she had made any such statement, and stated in her affidavit, <em>id. </em>at 699, 378 A.2d 1355:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">\u201cAt no time on that date, or at any other time, did I say that my parents\u2019 dog got excited around strangers or that he had previously jumped on anyone. The fact is that the dog was gentle and had never attacked, bothered or threatened anyone prior to [the incident].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">The circuit court ruled that the mother\u2019s testimony about the comments made regarding the dog during the ride to the hospital were inadmissible hearsay, and the court granted summary judgment in favor of the dog\u2019s owners. We reversed, ruling that, because of the above statements attributed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>to the dog owners\u2019 daughter, there was a genuine factual dispute as to the issue of whether the dog\u2019s owners had the requisite knowledge of the dog\u2019s vicious propensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">We also held that circumstantial evidence of a dog owner\u2019s knowledge of the dog\u2019s vicious tendencies was sufficient to preclude summary judgment in <em>Moura v. Randall, </em>119 Md. App. 632, 705 A.2d 334 (1998). In that case, the owner of a Rottweiler (named \u201cDiesel\u201d) was taking the dog for a walk in the common areas of a townhouse community when the dog, which was not on a leash, \u201csuddenly bolted after another dog.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636, 705 A.2d 334. When the owner eventually found the dog, it had \u201csavagely attacked\u201d a four-year-old boy at a distant apartment complex. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 705 A.2d 334. In response to the law suit filed by the child\u2019s parents, the dog\u2019s owner moved for summary judgment, arguing that there was no evidence that he \u201cknew or should have known of Diesel\u2019s tendency to bolt or vicious propensities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 705 A.2d 334. In his affidavit in support of the motion for summary judgment, the dog\u2019s owner \u201caverred that Diesel was always friendly and, prior to the attack, Diesel had never been aggressive, Diesel had never bitten anyone, and Diesel had never run after another dog.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637, 705 A.2d 334. The circuit court granted the dog owner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">I have nothing to contradict the affidavit statements of the owner that he never experienced this particular animal to exhibit vicious propensities; that he had only had the dog bolt once, and that was when the dog was only a month or two or so into obedience training. It was some lengthy period before this tragic incident....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">So, there is not any real evidence here that would show ... a dispute that should be presented to the jury with regard to the owner\u2019s subjective knowledge of any propensities for this particular animal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">We reversed. Writing for this Court, Judge Ellen L. Hollander summarized the evidence in the record that created a genuine factual dispute as to whether the owner knew or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>should have known of the dog\u2019s vicious propensity, <em>id. </em>at 637-38, 705 A.2d 334:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">[In opposition to the dog owner\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs] attached a copy of [the dog owner\u2019s] testimony, given under oath before the Animal Matters Hearing Board of Montgomery County (the \u201cBoard\u201d). There, [the dog owner] conceded that, on one occasion when Diesel was unleashed, he had chased a cat into the wooded area behind [the dog owner\u2019s] residence. [The plaintiffs] posited that this incident charged [the dog owner] with the knowledge that Diesel might not always obey commands and that Diesel might run away if unleashed. [The plaintiffs] also submitted a copy of the testimony of Mark Lipsitt, a dog trainer and kennel owner with twenty-five years of experience working with animals, who appeared before the Board on December 5, 1994. Lipsitt\u2019s testimony concerned a report he prepared with respect to his examination of Diesel soon after the attack. He testified that when he examined Diesel, \u201cthe dog was straining at the leash. The dog was jumping up and down in an effort to get to me. He was barking. He was growling. He was snarling. He was baring his teeth, and he was snapping.\u201d Consequently, Lipsitt concluded that Diesel had \u201cprevious experience with agitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We held that the above evidence was \u201csufficient\u201d to \u201ccreate an inference as to appellee\u2019s knowledge of Diesel\u2019s dangerous behavioral propensities and thereby to establish an issue of material fact\u201d that precluded the entry of summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 652, 705 A.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In the present case, in ruling on the motion for judgment at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the trial court was required, as are we, to consider all evidence, and all inferences therefrom, in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. When so considered, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence before the jury from which it could have rationally concluded that Tracey was on notice of the potential danger posed by her tenants\u2019 pit bulls, including the particular male pit bull which attacked Dominic.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>At the outset, we note that the evidence showed the landlord had sufficient concern that these particular dogs posed a threat to others that the landlord changed the language in the renewal lease by omitting the prohibition against keeping a \u201cvicious or threatening\u201d pet, and emphasizing that the landlord was \u201cin NO WAY responsible\u201d for damages inflicted by the dogs. The landlord\u2019s concern about liability for the pit bulls was consistent with the observations expressed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Matthews, </em>351 Md. at 561, 719 A.2d 119, relative to the \u201cextreme dangerousness of this breed.\u201d <em>See also Moore, supra, </em>161 Md.App. at 369, 868 A.2d 954. Even though we ruled in <em>Ward </em>that a plaintiff does not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of knowledge of danger by simply proving that the attacking dog was a pit bull, we have never held that a dog\u2019s breed could not be considered by the fact finder along with other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In addition to the evidence that the landlord expressed concern about liability for the tenants\u2019 dogs in the renewal lease provision, there was uncontroverted evidence that the landlord had visited the property and had seen these particular pit bulls first hand. In light of a neighbor\u2019s testimony that \u201canybody\u201d who walked near these dogs would experience aggression from the dogs, the jury could have rationally inferred that the landlord, too, observed vicious behavior when she and her daughter visited the premises. <em>See Shields, </em>350 Md. at 688-89, 714 A.2d 881. Neighbor Lisa Luntz testified that she had seen the tenants\u2019 pit bulls often, and she was concerned about the aggressive nature of the male dog particularly \u201cbecause anybody that walked out of our home or to our home from the back would experience that aggression from the dogs, particularly the male dog, so unnerving to say the least.\u201d She was sufficiently alarmed that she avoided going near the dogs. Another neighbor, Michelle Bowers, testified to similar concern about the aggressive nature of the dogs. She testified that \u201cthe dog has actually tried to jump the fence before and get to us.\u201d She also testified about witnessing the male dog stand on the female dog\u2019s back and nearly escape the pen. She said there had been \u201c[a] lot of growling, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>barking, and ultimately the dog had stood on the back of the female and was teeter tottering on top with his belly on top of the top of the fence. So all it would have taken is one extra little push, and that dog would have been over.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Considered in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the evidence was sufficient to meet the requirement set forth in <em>Shields </em>and <em>Matthews </em>that the landlord either knew or should have known of the dangerous condition posed by the tenants\u2019 male dog. Luntz testified that she was afraid to walk near the pit bull because of the aggression it exhibited toward anybody who walked near the back yard. Bowers witnessed the pit bull attempting to escape the pen and nearly succeeding. No issue was raised by the landlord, either at trial or on appeal, about the time frame when the neighbors made their observations, but the inference most favorable to the Soleskys is that the neighbors\u2019 observations were made prior to the date of the lease renewal. Tracey knew that her tenants were keeping the pit bull in a small pen in the backyard of the leased premises, and the testimony of the neighbors supports an inference that, when the landlord visited the property just three months before the attack, the landlord \u2014 like anybody else who approached the backyard \u2014 more likely than not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>would have seen the male pit bull behave in the way Luntz and Bowers described. The evidence, if believed, supported the syllogism: (a) the dog exhibited aggression toward anybody who walked near the back of the property; (b) the landlord parked in back of the property on the day of lease renewal; (c) the dog would have exhibited aggression toward the landlord on the day of lease renewal. The emphatic exculpatory language Tracey\u2019s daughter added to the lease renewal agreement is further support for the inference that the landlord foresaw the risk that one of these pit bulls would harm some person.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">This evidence of the landlord\u2019s knowledge, when considered in a light most favorable to the Soleskys, was sufficient to survive the motion for judgment. The jury was not obligated to find \u2014 as the trial judge apparently assumed \u2014 that, on the occasion the landlord and her daughter inspected the premises, the dogs were uncharacteristically on good behavior. The testimony of the neighbors, if believed, would support a rational inference that the landlord witnessed the same aggressive behavior which Lisa Luntz said \u201canybody that walked out of our home or to our home from the back would experience.\u201d As the Court of Appeals ruled in <em>Shields, supra, </em>350 Md. at 688-89, 714 A.2d 881, the testimony of these witnesses was sufficient to support an inference that the landlord was aware of the vicious tendencies regularly observed by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">B. Control</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In the present case, considering all evidence and all inferences therefrom in a light most favorable to the Soleskys, a reasoning jury could have also rationally concluded that the control factor was met. A landlord may exercise control over the premises by refusing to extend the tenancy or by imposing conditions at the time of lease renewal. In <em>Shields, </em>350 Md. at 670, 714 A.2d 881, for example, the lease had expired and the dog owner remained on the premises as a month-to-month tenant to whom the landlord could refuse to re-let the premises upon the expiration of each month. The Court of Appeals observed that the landlord\u2019s opportunities to refuse to renew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the tenant\u2019s lease satisfied the requirement that the landlord have control over the presence of the dangerous dog, stating, <em>id. </em>at 682, 714 A.2d 881:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">[The landlord] here could have exercised control over [the pit bull] Trouble by refusing to re-let the premises to [the tenant] unless [the tenant] agreed not to bring Trouble there. [The tenant] had originally leased the premises pursuant to a written lease; however, that lease had expired prior to the attacks that led to the instant case, and [the tenant] remained as a month-to-month tenant. As each month went by, the premises were in effect re-let to [the tenant]. Thus, each time, the [landlord] had the opportunity to refuse to re-let the premises, thereby abating the danger posed by Trouble\u2019s presence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The Soleskys argue that Tracey had a similar opportunity to control the danger posed by the tenants\u2019 pit bulls in the present case. They note that, as in <em>Shields, </em>before entering into the new lease agreement with the dogs\u2019 owners \u2014 approximately three months before the male pit bull injured Dominic \u2014 Tracey could have exerted control to abate the dangerous conditions, either by refusing to re-let or by imposing restrictions regarding the dogs. But, at the point of lease renewal, Tracey failed to require the tenants to take any safety measures, and merely insisted that the tenants include a provision in the lease (a) agreeing to pay for damages the dogs might inflict, and (b) acknowledging that \u201c[t]he Lessor is in NO Way responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The Soleskys contend that, instead of simply trying to disclaim responsibility in the event the dogs attacked anyone, the landlord should have either refused to re-let the premises, or refused to allow the dogs to remain, or required O\u2019Halloran and Cesky to implement reasonable containment measures to ensure that their pit bulls would not escape the pen or the premises. We agree with the Soleskys that, considering all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the Soleskys, a reasoning jury could have rationally found that, prior to execution of the lease on January 28, 2007, Tracey had the ability to exert control over the dangerous condition on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>premises by either requiring O\u2019Halloran and Cesky to take measures to ensure the pit bulls would be adequately confined to the premises, or by refusing to re-let the premises to O\u2019Halloran and Cesky if they were unwilling to abate the danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Finally, we observe that, under the rules stated in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 379A (1965), and Restatement (Second) of Property (Landlord and Tenant) \u00a7 18.4 (1977), the duty to protect persons from dangerous animals maintained on one\u2019s property can extend to passersby who are foreseeably injured by an unrestrained animal. The first of these, \u00a7 379A of the Restatement (Second) op Torts, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">Activities After Lessor Transfers Possession</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APc\">A lessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm to persons outside of the land caused by activities of the lessee or others on the land after the lessor transfers possession if, but only if,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">(a) the lessor at the time of the lease consented to such activity or knew that it would be carried on, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">(b) the lessor knew or had reason to know that it would unavoidably involve such an unreasonable risk, or that special precautions necessary to safety would not be taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">An example provided in Comment c, Illustration 1, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">1.

A is subject to liability to C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Pertinent to this case, Comment d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">d.

In one of the cases cited by the Court of Appeals in <em>Matthews, supra, </em>351 Md. at 562, 719 A.2d 119, as an example of cases that had upheld legislation banning pit bulls, the New Mexico Court of Appeals summarized evidence that had been presented about the difficulty of confining pit bulls, <em>Garcia v. Village of Tijeras, </em>108 N.M. 116, 120, 767 P.2d 355, 359 (N.M.Ct.App.1988), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">Other evidence tended to establish that the American Pit Bull Terrier is an exceptionally strong and athletic dog. Extraordinary measures are required for confining American Pit Bull Terriers, such as a six-foot chainlink fence with an overhanging ledge to keep the dogs from jumping out, and six-inch wide, one-foot deep concrete footings around the base to keep the dogs from digging under. They have exceptionally strong bites, possibly twice the strength of bites of other dogs. They can grip cyclone fencing and tear it from its mounting, and have been known to destroy sheet metal panels by ripping them apart with their teeth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">We note, however, that the Soleskys did not introduce evidence during the trial of this case like that described above in the opinion of the New Mexico Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b353-6\">RUBIN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AzJ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">I respectfully dissent from part II of the panel majority\u2019s opinion. To be sure, the incident of April 28, 2007, was horrific. In my judgment, however, the circuit court correctly concluded that the evidence presented at trial by the plaintiffs was legally insufficient to sustain a verdict against the landlord. As a consequence, the circuit court properly granted the landlord\u2019s motion for judgment under Maryland Rule 2-519 at the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 case. <em>See Veytsman v. New York Palace, Inc., </em>170 Md.App. 104, 112, 906 A.2d 1028 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The majority begins its opinion by stating that Maryland is very forgiving in allowing even slight circumstantial evidence of negligence to go to the jury. This is true as far as it goes, but not all evidence is <em>legally sufficient </em>evidence of negligence. <em>See Fowler v. Smith, </em>240 Md. 240, 246-47, 213 A.2d 549 (1965). This case, I am confident, would be decided quite differently if the dogs in question were of another breed. And no case should be decided, as the majority\u2019s opinion surely implies, simply by saying that \u201cin a close case\u201d the jury must decide. As we held in <em>Robin Express Transfer, Inc. v. Canton R.R. Co., </em>26 Md.App. 321, 328, 338 A.2d 335 (1975), such an approach \u201cbetrays a fundamental misconception of the respective functions of court and jury where the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence is involved.\u201d We continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">It is the function of the court, in the first instance, to decide whether the inference of negligence is legitimate or permis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>sible. If the decision is \u201cno\u201d the evidence should be withheld from the jury. Contrariwise, if the decision is \u201cyes,\u201d the evidence should be submitted to the jury for its evaluation of the force of the inference of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">26 Md.App. at 328, 338 A.2d 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">This important role of the court as a gatekeeper in tort cases is recognized by the leading treatise on the subject.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap3\">But over such questions of fact the courts always have reserved a preliminary power of decision, as to whether the issue shall be submitted to the jury at all. If the evidence is such that no reasonably intelligent person would accept it, it becomes the duty of the court to remove the issue from the jury, and to nonsuit the plaintiff, or to direct a verdict for the defendant, or to set aside a verdict once rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyPg\">W. Keeton, <em>Prosser and Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 37 at 236 (5th ed. 1984)(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Nor is it sufficient to suggest that a verdict may rest entirely on circumstantial evidence. <em>See Robinson v. State, </em>348 Md. 104, 112, 702 A.2d 741 (1997). Although it may, the court still must determine whether the legitimate inferences that can be drawn from circumstantial evidence are legally sufficient to support a plaintiffs verdict. <em>C &amp; P. Tel. Co. of Maryland v. Hicks, </em>25 Md.App. 503, 524, 337 A.2d 744 (1975). \u201cInferences must be based on reasonable probability, rather than speculation, surmise, or conjecture.\u201d <em>Ward v. Hartley, </em>168 Md.App. 209, 218, 895 A.2d 1111 (2006). In my view, the evidence presented by the plaintiffs at the trial of this case was insufficient as a matter of law and would, under the views expressed in the majority\u2019s opinion, permit a verdict to stand based on the fact that the dogs in question were of the pit bull terrier breed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The majority concedes that the plaintiffs failed to present any direct evidence at trial of any prior misconduct by these particular dogs. For example, there was no evidence of prior biting, attacking, running loose or escaping from confinement. Nor was there any direct evidence that the landlord \u2014 or anyone else for that matter \u2014 was aware of any actual vicious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>propensities or bad acts of these particular animals. The majority, nevertheless, holds that the following circumstantial evidence was legally sufficient for the jury to find for the plaintiffs: (1) the lease contained a provision allowing the tenant to keep two pit bull terriers on the demised premises; (2) the landlord knew that the tenant kept two of these dogs in a pen in the backyard; (3) language in the lease required the tenant to pay for any damage or harm caused by the dogs; and (4) two neighbors testified that the dogs jumped and barked when other persons or animals passed by their pen and that they avoided the area in which the dogs were kept. I disagree that this was legally sufficient circumstantial evidence to allow a rational jury to return a verdict for the plaintiffs. <em>See Veytsman v. New York Palace, Inc., </em>170 Md. App. at 118-19, 906 A.2d 1028 (plaintiffs evidence of prior similar incidents legally insufficient to hold restaurant owner liable in tort for assault committed on the premises).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">In Maryland, the keeper of a domestic animal may be held liable in tort under theories of negligence, strict liability or both. <em>Pahanish v. W. Trails, Inc., </em>69 Md.App. 342, 356, 517 A.2d 1122 (1986); <em>Slack v. Villari, </em>59 Md.App. 462, 470, 476 A.2d 227, <em>cert. denied, </em>301 Md. 177, 482 A.2d 502 (1984). But a landlord may be held liable to a third-party for the actions of a tenant who keeps a dog only if the landlord knew, or under the circumstances should have known, of the dangerous or vicious propensities <em>of the particular dog. Matthews v. Amberwood, </em>351 Md. 544, 570, 719 A.2d 119 (1998). The majority\u2019s opinion eviscerates this long-settled requirement. <em>Twigg v. Ryland, </em>62 Md. 380, 385-86 (1884). As Judge Salmon reiterated for this Court in <em>Ward v. Hartley, </em>168 Md.App. at 220 &amp; n. 7, 895 A.2d 1111, the fact that the dog in question is a pit bull does not place the landlord on notice that a particular dog is or likely will be vicious. <em>See Moura v. Randall, </em>119 Md.App. 632, 653, 705 A.2d 334 (1998) (\u201cTo be sure, the fact that Diesel was a Rottweiler is not sufficient to establish that he is vicious.\u201d); <em>Slack v. Villari, </em>59 Md.App. at 476, 476 A.2d 227 (\u201c[T]he mere fact that the dog that injures a plaintiff belongs to a breed with an unsavory reputation, absent evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>dence that the particular dog was of a violent nature, is insufficient to prove scienter.\u201d) <em>See also Herbert v. Ziegler, </em>216 Md. 212, 216-17, 139 A.2d 699 (1958) (discussing legal sufficiency of the evidence of the owner\u2019s knowledge that a particular dog in question \u201cwas mischievous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Although the majority rightly acknowledges these legal points, it nonetheless proceeds to say that the jury can, without the aid of expert testimony, consider the breed of the dog. This is completely unwarranted. The majority then goes on to recite what it views as legally sufficient circumstantial evidence of the landlord\u2019s knowledge of actual or potential dangerousness of these particular dogs. I disagree. None of the items of evidence pointed to by the majority, singly or even in combination, are legally sufficient to submit this case to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The fact that the dogs were kept in an enclosure is not evidence or notice of any vicious propensities of these particular animals. <em>McDonald v. Burgess, </em>254 Md. 452, 458, 255 A.2d 299 (1969). Moreover, the fact that the dogs in this case barked or jumped when persons or other dogs walked by or near their enclosure likewise is not evidence of viciousness or notice of potential danger to third parties. <em>Hiner v. Mojica, </em>271 Mich.App. 604, 722 N.W.2d 914, 919-20 (2006) (collecting cases). Barking and jumping is what dogs of every breed, including pit bulls, do. <em>See Plowman v. Pratt, </em>268 Neb. 466, 684 N.W.2d 28 (2004) (\u201cNormal canine behavior, such as a dog barking at a stranger, is not sufficient to infer that a landlord has actual knowledge of a dog\u2019s dangerous propensities.\u201d) <em>See also Batra v. Clark, </em>110 S.W.3d 126, 130 (Tex.App.2003) (rendering judgment for the defendant when there was no evidence that the landlord \u201cknew that it was a potentially vicious animal or identified the dog\u2019s bark as the bark of a potentially vicious animal.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">Further, the fact that two neighbors were subjectively afraid of pit bull terriers likewise is not sufficient to impute knowledge of potential dangerousness to the landlord. It is not \u201creasonable to attribute vicious propensities to a dog <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>merely because he barks at strangers, <em>because a person is afraid of a dog, </em>or because a city ordinance requires a dog to be restrained at all times.\u201d <em>Royer v. Pryor, </em>427 N.E.2d 1112, 1117 (Ind.App.1981) (emphasis added). The facts of this case, even taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, are not even remotely similar to those held to be sufficient by the Court of Appeals to impute knowledge. <em>See Shields v. Wagman, </em>350 Md. 666, 687-90, 714 A.2d 881 (1998) (holding that landlord\u2019s knowledge could be imputed where another tenant informed the landlord\u2019s agent of the dog\u2019s viciousness prior to the attack). In this case, there was no evidence presented to show that the landlord or her daughter knew that the dogs could escape from the pen. Specifically, the evidence did not show that the landlord or her daughter knew that the pen was inadequate to contain the dogs, or that either had witnessed the dogs attempting to escape from the pen. Therefore, the evidence in this case does not support a reasonable inference that <em>this </em>landlord had any knowledge, actual or constructive, of any vicious tendencies or ability to escape from confinement on the part of <em>these particular dogs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Finally, the fact that the landlord required its tenant to bear the responsibility for any harm or damage done by their pets is meaningless. Nearly every commercial and residential lease in effect in Maryland today requires the tenant to bear responsibility for <em>any harm, </em>done by the activities conducted by the tenant on the demised premises, or to carry insurance to cover any losses arising out of those activities. Hence, the presence of such a lease clause in this case is without particular moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Respectfully, the burden on a tort plaintiff in Maryland to show the mischievous propensities of a particular dog is not very high. The plaintiffs in this case could have, but did not, present testimony regarding any threatening or dangerous conduct of the specific dogs in question, whether it be prior to or post the incident in question. <em>See Moura, v. Randall, </em>119 Md.App. at 643-44, 705 A.2d 334 (allowing testimony about post-attack conduct of the dog to support inference that dog had vicious tendencies). <em>See also Moore v. Myers, </em>161 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>App. 349, 363-65, 868 A.2d 954 (2005) (unleashed and unconfined pit bull that escaped from owner\u2019s property); <em>Hammond v. Robins, </em>60 Md.App. 430, 434-36, 483 A.2d 379 (1984) (homeowner permitted a dog to leave an enclosed yard knowing of dog\u2019s propensity to cross the street when unrestrained). The plaintiffs also could have presented, but did not, expert testimony based on sound science under Maryland Rule 5-702 about these specific dogs, or possibly even the breed in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Curiously, at oral argument, counsel for the plaintiff were unable to explain why they did not call to testify at trial either the police officers who responded to the scene, or the animal control officers who took control of and, ultimately, euthanized the dog which attacked the child in this case. Nor did plaintiffs\u2019 counsel explain why they did not present expert testimony at trial regarding the behavior of the animals in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The General Assembly likely can regulate, or even ban, pit bulls in the State of Maryland. A municipal corporation likely can regulate the keeping of pit bulls within their corporate limits. <em>Compare City of Toledo v. Tellings, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 278, 871 N.E.2d 1152, 1156-59 (2007) (upholding ban) <em>and Holt v. City of Maumelle, </em>307 Ark. 115, 817 S.W.2d 208, 209-10 (1991) (same) <em>with Dias v. City of Denver, </em>567 F.3d 1169, 1183-84 (10th Cir.2009) (reversing trial court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claim that municipal pit bull ban violated substantive due process). But a court of error review has no such authority to do so under the guise of tort law. Nor may it judicially notice as a \u201cfact\u201d that all pit bull terriers are dangerous. These, however, essentially are the consequences of the majority\u2019s decision under the evidence presented at trial in this case. I would affirm the judgment of the circuit court which granted a directed verdict against the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
