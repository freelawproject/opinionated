Law (\u201cC.L.\u201d) \u00a7 3-322 (unnatural or perverted sexual practice); C.L. \u00a7 3-307(a)(l) (third degree sexual offense); C.L. \u00a7 3-204(a)(1) (reckless endangerment); and C.L. \u00a7 4-203 (wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequently, on January 25, 2010, the court sentenced appellant to three years of imprisonment for wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, a consecutive five years for reckless endangerment, and a consecutive ten years for third degree sex offense, for a total of eighteen years of imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">On appeal, appellant presents two issues, which we have rephrased as follows:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">I. Whether the trial court erred in admitting, over appellant\u2019s objection, the testimony of an alleged rape victim from an unrelated pending case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">II. Whether the trial court erred in instructing the jury as to reckless endangerment by allegedly omitting the elements of the offense?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>We find no error and affirm the judgments of conviction, for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The acts for which appellant was convicted occurred on April 12, 2009, during a meeting between appellant and a Ms. Stahl (\u201cStahl\u201d) at the Master Suites hotel in Waldorf, Maryland. Stahl offered erotic services on the online advertising site known as Craigslist. Appellant made inquiries for sexual services through Craigslist, and identified Stahl as someone he wanted to contact. Appellant and Stahl agreed, in advance, via telephone, to meet at the hotel. Stahl arrived first at the hotel and invited appellant into the room. According to Stahl\u2019s testimony, once inside, she completed the agreed-upon activity of \u201cstripping and grinding\u201d in exchange for payment of $200.00. Appellant then produced a gun and forced Stahl to undress and lay on the bed while he straddled her and defecated in her mouth. Appellant also forced Stahl to engage in oral and anal sex while holding the gun to her head. Stahl testified, at trial, that she did not consent to being defecated on or to the oral and anal sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Detective Jack Austin, Charles County Sheriffs Department, a witness for the State, testified that, on May 1, 2009, he arrested appellant. Austin testified appellant told him the sexual activity with Stahl was consensual, and that appellant acknowledged defecating on Stahl, but said the defecating was \u201caccidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The State introduced the testimony of Ms. Swanson (\u201cSwanson\u201d). Swanson is the alleged victim in an unrelated case that was pending against appellant in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Swanson testified that she met appellant at her apartment on February 20, 2009, less than two months prior to appellant\u2019s encounter with Stahl. Swanson testified that her meeting was also generated by Craigslist, where she advertised erotic services. Swanson testified that, while inside her apartment, after a disagreement about payment, appellant produced a gun, told Swanson to undress and instructed her to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>perform anilingus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Swanson testified appellant defecated in her mouth while she was performing anilingus. Swanson testified that appellant forced her, with the results of the defecation still in her mouth, to perform oral sex. Swanson testified that she did not consent to being defecated upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Prior to Swanson taking the stand, appellant moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude Swanson\u2019s testimony, arguing that the testimony constituted inadmissible propensity evidence. Appellant argued the prejudicial effect of Swanson\u2019s testimony outweighed the probative value. The circuit court determined Swanson\u2019s testimony to be admissible to show intent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or under the absence of mistake exception of Maryland Rule 5-404(b), as argued by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Appellant testified that the sexual activity with Stahl was consensual, and that the defecation was not for sexual gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">At the conclusion of all of the evidence in the case, and prior to closing argument, the court instructed the jury. As to reckless endangerment, the court instructed: \u201cA person may not recklessly engage in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another.\u201d Prior to instructing the jury, the trial judge gave each attorney a copy of the jury instructions he intended to utilize, in order for the attorneys to \u201cfollow along\u201d as the court instructed the jury. At the conclusion of giving the jury instructions, the trial judge asked both counsel, on three separate occasions, whether they were satisfied with the given instructions. Neither attorney made any exception or objection to the court\u2019s instruction as to reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Appellant contends the circuit court erred in admitting Swanson\u2019s testimony that he defecated on her for three reasons: (1) Other crimes evidence is inadmissible to prove character of a person in order to show conduct in conformity therewith; (2) The testimony was used only to buttress the testimony of the complaining witness; and (3) Swanson\u2019s testimony was not relevant and was used to show criminal propensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The State acknowledges that evidence of a defendant having committed similar acts may not be introduced to prove a propensity to commit the acts in question, but asserts that, under Maryland Rule 5-404(b), such evidence may, however, be introduced to prove conduct other than propensity. The State points out that Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 404(b) offers a non-exhaustive list of things that may be proven with evidence of prior acts, including \u201cabsence of mistake or accident,\u201d and contends that such evidence was appropriately admitted, in this case, to refute appellant\u2019s claim of mistake or accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Maryland Rule 5-404(b) generally renders inadmissible evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts. <em>Thompson v. State, </em>412 Md. 497, 521-22, 988 A.2d 1011 (2010). Rule 5-404(b), providing that evidence of other crimes, wrongs or bad acts is ordinarily inadmissible, \u201cembodies the Maryland common law of evidence concerning other crimes, etc. which existed prior to adoption of the Rule.\u201d <em>Boyd v. State, </em>399 Md. 457, 482, 924 A.2d 1112 (2007) (citing <em>Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 806, 724 A.2d 111 (1999); <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 406, 697 A.2d 432 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">As Maryland Rule 5-404 explicitly recognizes, however, there are circumstances under which prior criminal or wrongful acts are admissible. Case law sets forth a three-pronged test for admissibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">When a trial court is faced with the need to decide whether to admit evidence of another crime \u2014 that is, evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>dence that relates to an offense separate from that for which the defendant is presently on trial \u2014 it first determines whether the evidence fits within one or more of the [Cross ] exceptions. That is a legal determination and does not involve any exercise of discretion. <em>See Cross [v. State </em>], 282 Md. [468,] at 474, 386 A.2d [757,] at 761 [ (1987) ]; <em>Moore v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 36, 44, 533 A.2d 1, 5 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 719, 537 A.2d 273 (1988).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\">If one or more of the exceptions applies, the next step is to decide whether the accused\u2019s involvement in the other crimes is established by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>302 Md. 691, 728, 490 A.2d 1228, 1247 (1985), <em>defendant\u2019s petition for cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1086, 106 S.Ct. 1469, 89 L.Ed.2d 725, <em>vacated, </em>475 U.S. 1078, 106 S.Ct. 1452, 89 L.Ed.2d 711, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>307 Md. 233, 513 A.2d 299 (1986); Cross, 282 Md. at 478, 386 A.2d at 764. We will review this decision to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the trial judge\u2019s finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">If this requirement is met, the trial court proceeds to the final step. The necessity for and probative value of the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is to be carefully weighed against any undue prejudice likely to result from its admission. <em>Cross, </em>282 Md. at 474, 386 A.2d at 761 [citations omitted]. This segment of the analysis implicates the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>Id.; Moore, </em>73 Md.App. at 44-45, 533 A.2d at 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\"><em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 634-35, 552 A.2d 896 (1989).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">As a threshold matter, in determining whether to admit evidence under Maryland Rule 5-404(b), a court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>evaluate whether evidence is introduced for some purpose other than to suggest that, because the defendant is a person of criminal character, it is more probable that he committed the crime for which he is on trial. <em>Boyd, </em>399 Md. at 483, 924 A.2d 1112. The evidence must fit into one of the categories of special relevance. In this case, the State\u2019s argument and the circuit court\u2019s reason for admission of Swanson\u2019s testimony was that the evidence fit the category of \u201cabsence of mistake.\u201d For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 718 A.2d 588 (1998), the Court of Appeals thoroughly examined the general admissibility of other crimes or bad acts evidence and specifically analyzed the \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d exception. The Court, in <em>Wynn, </em>stated: \u201c[Maryland Rule 5-404(b) ] means that evidence that the defendant committed other crimes or bad acts is not admissible unless it has special relevance \u2014 that it \u2018is substantially relevant to some contested issue and is not offered simply to prove criminal character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316, 718 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>A.2d 588 (quoting <em>State v. Taylor, </em>347 Md. 363, 368, 701 A.2d 389 (1997)). In <em>Wynn, </em>the Court of Appeals reiterated and applied the three step analysis of <em>Faulkner. Id. </em>at 324, 718 A.2d 588. Explaining common factual scenarios within the absence of mistake exception, the Court quoted Professor Lynn McLain, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">If the defendant admits that he or she took an action, but claims to have done so unintentionally or by mistake, so that allegations of, for example, forgery, fraud, embezzlement, or malice are unfounded, the prosecution may offer evidence of his or her similar prior wrongs, acts, or crimes. This use of the evidence as proof of absence of mistake is merely the obverse of proof of intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><em>Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 325, 718 A.2d 588 (footnote omitted) (quoting Lynn McLain, Maryland Practice \u00a7 404.12 (footnotes omitted)). Further, the Court of Appeals described a factual scenario in which a defendant asserts he was not responsible for the act causing injury, as the injury was caused by an independent accident. <em>Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 326, 718 A.2d 588. In this scenario, other crimes evidence could rebut the argument that an independent accident was the cause of the injury. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">After discussing many cases and authorities from Maryland,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Court, in <em>Wynn, </em>held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>for the \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d exception in Maryland Rule 5-404(b) to apply, a defendant generally must make some assertion or put on a defense that he or she committed the act for which he or she is on trial, but did so by mistake.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 326-31, 718 A.2d 588. Additionally, in order for the exception to apply, the crime or bad act allegedly committed by mistake must be the same crime or bad act for which the defendant is on trial. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 718 A.2d 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Following <em>Wynn, </em>in <em>Boyd, </em>399 Md. at 484-85, 924 A.2d 1112, the Court of Appeals reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Judge Cathell for the Court in <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 718 A.2d 588 (1998), extensively discussed the general admissibility of other crimes or bad acts evidence, and specifically dealt with the \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d exception. After reviewing numerous cases and other authorities, Judge Cat-hell explained one of the prerequisites for the exception <em>(Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 330-331, 718 A.2d at 599-600, emphasis in original):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">\u201cOur examination of the commentators and the case law both in Maryland and in other jurisdictions <em>that we have discussed </em>reveals a general prerequisite to the application of the absence of mistake exception. In order for the exception to apply, the defendant generally must make some assertion or put on a defense that he or she committed the act for which he or she is on trial, but did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>so by mistake. In those cases noted above in which the exception was found not to apply, the defendant made no assertion or put forward no defense that he or she mistakenly committed the <em>act for which he or she was on trial.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The factual scenario in this case satisfies the prerequisites for admission of absence of mistake evidence established by the Court in <em>Wyrm.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Stahl testified that after a consensual sexual encounter for payment, appellant displayed a handgun, held the gun to her head, forced her to undress, straddled her, and defecated into her mouth. The State sought to prove that the act of defecating into the victim\u2019s mouth constituted an unnatural or perverted sexual practice, in violation of C.L. \u00a7 3-322 (2003).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">When arrested by Detective Austin, appellant denied using a handgun or force against Stahl. Appellant described the incident as an encounter with a prostitute and told Detective Austin that the defecation was accidental. Detective Austin testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Did he make any indication that he was in Waldorf at the Master Suites hotel on [sic] that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">[DETECTIVE AUSTIN]: Yes. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Did he indicate that he had any\u2014 contact \"with Ms. Stahl?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">[DETECTIVE AUSTIN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Through your investigation \u2014 speaking to Ms. Stahl you\u2019re aware of the \u2014 the statement she made about the [appellant] defecating?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">[DETECTIVE AUSTIN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. What if anything, did the [appellant] say to you about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">[DETECTIVE AUSTIN]: He said it was an accident; it accidentally occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">At trial, Appellant testified, in his own defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5t\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you ever defecate on her which means go to the bathroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">[APPELLANT]: She said I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m not worried about what she said. Is that what you did? Do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">[APPELLANT]: In all honesty Sir, to give you a totally honest answer, I really don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">[APPELLANT]: I honestly don\u2019t. I mean like I was in an enjoyable \u2014 into a sexual act. I was into an enjoyable moment. The next [sic] you know she pushed me up and just \u2014 and that was it. But \u2014 and because of her reaction, I mean, I honestly believe, you know what I mean, that whatever she said was whatever it was because of her reaction to be totally honest. But I don\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t recall doing that. But \u2014 you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-F\">[PROSECUTOR]: Did you defecate or go to the bathroom for sexual gratification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-19\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>[APPELLANT]: Nah. Nah. No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">[APPELLANT]: You said cause you \u2014 you asking me did I go, use the bathroom for some type of sexual enjoyment? Is that what you ask?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, that was my question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnM\">[APPELLANT]: Oh no, Sir. Nah. No. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The circuit court, finding the evidence satisfied the prerequisites for admission under Maryland Rule 5-404(b), held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-c\">THE COURT: Well, I have to look at first whether the other acts alleged and I\u2019m going to accept the proffer for the purposes of this Motion in Limine \u2014 that I could find by clear and convincing evidence that the \u2014 alleged victim in the Prince George\u2019s County case would testify in accordance with what the State \u2014 represents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">But whether the other acts are substantially probative to a contested issue in the case other than to show that \u2014 conduct in the character or \u2014 and because the defense is going to be consent that it would be relevant to show his intent or absence of mistake or accident if that is in fact what he\u2019s \u2014 is [sic] position is going to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">And weighing that against the \u2014 I mean certainly it\u2019s prejudicial, I mean it\u2019s \u2014 but is it unduly prejudicial and \u2014 I do find that it is more probative than prejudicial. Under the circumstances I\u2019m gonna deny the Motion in Limine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">Appellant asserted pretrial that the act of defecation was accidental and, at trial, testified that the defecation was not for sexual gratification. The other crimes evidence, introduced by the State, involving Swanson, consisted of the same bad act or prior conduct as that for which appellant was on trial, defecating into the victim\u2019s mouth. Given that appellant made an assertion and put on a defense that he committed the act for which he was on trial, but did so by mistake or accident, and the crime or bad act evidence introduced at trial involved the same crime or bad act for which the defendant was on trial, we find no error in the circuit court\u2019s determination that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>evidence was admissible under the absence of mistake exception of Rule 5-404(b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Appellant relies on <em>Hurst v. State, </em>400 Md. 397, 929 A.2d 157 (2007), in which the Court of Appeals held evidence of sex offenses by the accused against a different victim to be inadmissible. We are aware that the Court in <em>Hurst </em>considered the relevance of uncharged sexual offenses committed by an accused against a different victim to prove consent in a current case. The Court, in <em>Hurst, </em>however, did not address the issue of the admission of testimony by a different victim to prove the absence of mistake, or that a particular action by the accused was not accidental. In <em>Hurst, </em>the Court found the testimony of the victim of an earlier assault was improperly admitted, as it was not relevant to prove whether the victim in the current case consented, and that the error in admitting the testimony was not harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 929 A.2d 157. In <em>Hurst, </em>the sole contested issue in the case was whether the current victim consented to the sexual acts. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">The State was required to demonstrate a lack of consent on the part of Ms. P. as to the sexual activities that it alleged. Evidence that a third party did not consent to sexual intercourse with petitioner in the past has no bearing on whether Ms. P. consented to sexual activity. Ms. E.\u2019s testimony was irrelevant as well to Ms. P.\u2019s consent or lack of consent. It was in essence evidence that petitioner possessed a criminal propensity to engage in sex crimes and, as such, was inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The defense of consent and the defense of mistake or accident differ on a fundamental level. Consent is based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the conduct of the victim, whereas mistake or accident is based on the repetitive nature of the defendant\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court, in <em>Hurst, </em>was not confronted with the admissibility of a different victim\u2019s testimony regarding a sexual act where the accused claimed the act to be accidental. Each of the cases the Court relied on in <em>Hurst </em>involved a victim or third parties\u2019 free will to form consent. 400 Md. at 410-14, 929 A.2d 157 (citing <em>Brown v. State, </em>459 N.E.2d 376, 379 (Ind.1984) (The court found that where the only contested issue is consent, evidence of prior rapes committed by the defendant was not admissible because the fact that one woman was raped does not tend to prove that another woman did not consent.); <em>State v. McArthur, </em>719 So.2d 1037, 1041 (La.1998) (The court held, \u201cwhere the only issue in a prosecution for rape is that of consent, other offenses are usually held inadmissible. The lack of consent by other victims is not probative of lack of consent by the complainant of the charged offense.\u201d); <em>State v. Sweeney, </em>299 Mont. 111, 999 P.2d 296, 302 (2000) (The court found that evidence of other sexual assaults was improperly admitted as this evidence served only to prove the defendant\u2019s character and to show he acted in conformity with that character.); <em>Com. v. Minor, </em>267 Va. 166, 591 S.E.2d 61, 67 (2004) (The court precluded other crimes evidence, holding: \u201c[I]n our view, evidence showing that a defendant raped one or more individuals other than the victim in the crime charged is generally not relevant to the question whether that victim did or did not consent to sexual intercourse with the defendant. This is so because \u2018the fact that one woman was raped ... has no tendency to prove that another woman did not consent.\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Alsteen, </em>108 Wis.2d 723, 324 N.W.2d 426, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>429-30 (1982) (The court held that evidence of prior sexual crimes is inadmissible to prove that a subsequent complainant did not consent to sexual relations.)). None of the cases relied on by the Court in <em>Hurst </em>involved other crimes evidence being admitted to prove absence of mistake or accident. Although <em>Hurst </em>postdates <em>Wynn, Hurst </em>is not controlling as to the absence of mistake exception under Maryland Rule 5-404(b), and does not encroach upon the standards set forth by the Court in <em>Wynn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">We note that, in his Reply Brief, appellant argues that mistake was not raised as a defense at trial, and that assuming <em>arguendo, </em>appellant asserted mistake as a defense, mistake is not a legal defense to the crime of unnatural or perverted sexual practices, rendering the other crimes evidence irrelevant. Additionally, appellant complains that the range of other crimes admitted into evidence, at trial, exceeded the \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s contentions, the record, to be sure, reflects appellant asserted accident and mistake as a defense. To begin with, upon apprehension, as mentioned above, appellant advised Detective Austin that the defecation was an accident. Admittedly, during the hearing on the motion <em>in limine, </em>before the empanelling of the jury, appellant argued that there is no relevance insofar as the \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d exception is concerned because mistake is not a defense to unnatural or perverted sexual practices. Although during the motion <em>in limine </em>appellant argued that unnatural or perverted sexual practices is a strict liability offense, for which there is no mistake defense to the crime, during closing argument, before the jury, appellant\u2019s counsel took a different tact arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We talked to Detective Swanson and \u2014 or Miss Swanson and on that portion \u2014 the State is correct in that you are only to consider her testimony for one thing and one thing alone. Was there defecation and was that mistake?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Additionally, at trial, it is undisputed that appellant testified that whatever the victim said as to the defecation was \u201cwhatever it was,\u201d but that he did not defecate for sexual gratification or enjoyment, giving rise to the inference that the defecation occurred by accident or mistake. As such, the record reflects that, pretrial in a statement to Detective Austin, at trial, in testimony, and in closing argument, appellant raised the defense of mistake or accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">As to whether mistake or accident may be a defense to the crime of unnatural or perverted sexual practices, in <em>Herd v. State, </em>125 Md.App. 77, 90-91, 724 A.2d 693 (1999), when discussing <em>mens rea, </em>we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">That, of course, does not end the inquiry. A simple black-or-white classification of the <em>mens rea </em>as one involving a specific intent or one involving only a general intent is but a part of the necessary examination. An involuntary act \u2014 a muscular spasm or a fall, for example \u2014 would not render one guilty even <em>of </em>a <em>crime malum prohibitum </em>let alone a crime <em>malum in se. </em>Even a crime <em>malum prohibitum </em>requires a voluntary act. <em>Mens rea </em>literally means \u201ca guilty mind.\u201d With respect to crimes <em>mala, in se, </em>to wit, to crimes involving a <em>mens rea, </em>even general intent may mean more than merely voluntarily doing the act that constitutes the <em>actus reus.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In <em>Garnett v. State </em>332 Md. 571, 580, 632 A.2d 797 (1993), the Court of Appeals stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">Conscious of the disfavor in which strict criminal liability resides, the Model Penal Code states generally as a minimum requirement of culpability that a person is not guilty of a criminal offense unless he acts purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently, <em>ie., </em>with some degree of <em>mens rea. </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02 (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1980). The Code allows generally for a defense of ignorance or mistake of fact negating <em>mens rea. Id. </em>at \u00a7 2.04. The Model Penal Code generally recognizes strict liability for offenses deemed \u201cviolations,\u201d defined as wrongs subject only to a fine, forfeiture, or other civil penalty upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>conviction, and not giving rise to any legal disability. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 1.04,2.05.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">While appellant argues that accident or mistake is not a defense to the crime of unnatural or perverted sexual practices, case law in Maryland reflects a recognition that a person must act voluntarily to be guilty of a crime <em>malum prohibitum. </em>Thus, other crimes evidence, under the Maryland Rule 5-404(b) absence of mistake exception, is admissible in the prosecution of an unnatural or perverted sexual practices offense, where the defendant alleges having committed the act or offense by mistake or accident. In this case, given that appellant did not concede before the jury that the offense of unnatural or perverted sexual practices is a crime of strict liability requiring no <em>mens rea, </em>the status of the law with respect to the permission of an accident or mistake defense generally, and the requirement that even a crime <em>malum prohibitum </em>be committed voluntarily, the circuit court did not err in the admission of the other crimes evidence under the accident or absence of mistake exception to Maryland Rule 5-404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">To the extent that appellant maintains the range of other crimes evidence admitted, at trial, exceeded the act of defecation \u2014 because Swanson was permitted to testify about her advertisement on Craigslist, appellant\u2019s alleged demand for unprotected sex, that appellant had a gun and money was exchanged \u2014 we conclude that counsel for appellant failed to preserve this issue for appeal. Although defense counsel litigated a motion <em>in limine </em>regarding the admission of the defecation incident as to Swanson, during the hearing on the motion <em>in limine, </em>counsel did not object to the scope of Swanson\u2019s testimony. When Swanson was called to testify at trial and recounted the details of her experience with appellant, there was no objection to her testimony regarding those details. It was clear during the motion <em>in limine </em>proceeding that the State intended to introduce the details of Swanson\u2019s encounter. During the hearing on the motion <em>in limine, </em>the State advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>[PROSECUTOR]: The evidence that we intend to show by the February act up in Prince George\u2019s County is that he committed the same act, [sic] okay, by force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: The evidence that we intend to show from Ms. Swanson and her testimony would go to show that what he did in Charles County in April was absolutely no mistake. That\u2019s what he does. That\u2019s what he does and that\u2019s what he did in February and that\u2019s what he did in April.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Clear and convincing evidence, I can make a further proffer if Your Honor wants to, that\u2019s how you indicated that you wish to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">THE COURT: If that\u2019s acceptable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Right.... Okay. About what \u2014 Ms. Swanson\u2019s testimony is going to be and the Court could\u2014 could find that \u2014 by clear and convincing evidence she\u2019s going to testify to the statement that she made and she made it to \u2014 I think it was Officer Howard of Prince George\u2019s County Police I think.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">In the Application for Statement of Charges completed by Detective Austin on May 1, 2009, and contained in the court file of the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court, Detective Austin wrote that he had been provided with information from a Prince George\u2019s County Police Department Detective, Ann Nicodemus, of a sexual assault involving another victim who had posted on Craigslist, and there were similarities in \u201cthe description of the weapon used and the method of operation by the suspect as described by both victims.\u201d Detective Austin wrote that the suspect defecated in the Prince George\u2019s County victim\u2019s mouth and forced her to consume his feces at gunpoint. These details were available to appellant and his counsel, as well as the State\u2019s proffer at the hearing on the motion <em>in limine </em>as to what Swanson\u2019s testimony would be, yet no objection was made during the hearing on the motion <em>in limine </em>as to the scope of Swanson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>At the hearing on the motion <em>in limine, </em>appellant initially made a two-fold argument, first, that introduction of the other crimes evidence would prevent him from testifying on his own behalf, due to appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination in the Prince George\u2019s county case; and secondly, that since identification was not an issue in this case, the other crimes evidence was not admissible under a signature crime or identity exception theory. Upon being informed by the prosecutor that the State sought to introduce the other crimes evidence under Maryland Rule 404(b) absence of mistake exception, appellant argued that the unnatural or perverted sexual practices offense is a strict liability offense, and mistake is not a defense. While defense counsel sought to exclude Swanson\u2019s testimony, there was no objection as to the scope of Swanson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">When Swanson was called as a witness at trial, counsel stated, \u201c[j]ust again to note my objection for the record.\u201d Swanson testified, without objection, that she encountered appellant through Craigslist,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> appellant requested oral sex without a condom,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> he produced a gun,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>money had been exchanged.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We conclude appellant has not preserved an objection to the testimony complained of, as the scope of Swanson\u2019s testimony was not the subject of appellant\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>and appellant made no objection, at trial, to this testimony.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Alternatively, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the objection to the scope of Swanson\u2019s testimony was preserved for appeal, we conclude that this testimony was reasonably necessary to describe the other crimes evidence. Under Maryland Rule 404(b), evidence can be admitted to the extent necessary to describe the crime. <em>See Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 642-43, 552 A.2d 896 (\u201cThis corroborative evidence, including the \u2018other crimes\u2019 evidence, is not merely cumulative in establishing Faulkner\u2019s guilt. It was reasonably necessary and served an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>appropriate probative purpose. In other words, it did more than suggest to the jury that Faulkner was a bad man or had a propensity to commit crimes.\u201d); <em>Cross, </em>282 Md. at 474, 386 A.2d 757 (\u201cIn some cases, [the weighing of the necessity for and probativeness of the evidence concerning the collateral criminal act against the untoward prejudice which is likely to be the consequence of its admission] may require that evidence of the criminal actions of the defendant be totally excluded; in others, admission of portions or all of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s specific criminal actions may be permissible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Appellant relies on <em>Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 724 A.2d 111 (1999), in an attempt to limit the scope of the other crimes evidence. <em>Streater, </em>however, is not dispositive. In <em>Streater, </em>the Court of Appeals addressed the scope of evidence admitted as other crimes evidence. In <em>Streater, </em>the Court held that a protective order admitted into evidence containing three factual determinations<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> made by a district court judge, which constituted the basis upon which Streater had been ordered not to contact the victim, was improperly admitted as other crimes evidence. 352 Md. at 802, 724 A.2d 111. The Court found that the trial court failed to properly analyze three separate instances of other crimes evidence contained in the protective order. <em>Id. </em>at 814, 724 A.2d 111. The Court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">[T]he factual determinations regarding the other crimes contained within the protective order each must be analyzed separately from the question of the admissibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>protective order itself. The trial court must therefore apply the three-prong test outlined above to determine (1) whether the evidence of other crimes carries any substantial relevance to contested issues in the case, (2) whether the other crimes have been established by sufficient evidence, and (3) whether admission of the contents had probative value outweighing the prejudice resulting from admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 814-15, 724 A.2d 111. The Court found that the trial court erred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">On the other hand, the trial court in the instant case ruled the entire protective order form admissible without addressing in the record the admissibility of factual references to other crimes that the order contained. These factual findings related to a time period not mentioned by any witnesses in the proceedings and also to acts committed by Mr. Streater that were unsubstantiated by any other testimony in the case and may have been more prejudicial than probative. In her testimony, Ms. Streater never discussed the specific events that apparently supported the factual findings contained in the protective order. The only events she testified to occurred four months <em>after </em>the protective order had been issued. Further, the record does not reveal the time frame in which the factual findings contained in the November 1995 order occurred. The only reference at trial to any violent <em>act </em>committed by Mr. Streater was the reference in the protective order to the \u201c[bjattery or assault and battery.\u201d The State never sought to explain the battery mentioned in the order nor did it present similar evidence through Ms. Streater\u2019s or any other witness\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 813, 724 A.2d 111 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Unlike <em>Streater, </em>where the trial court failed to apply the three-prong <em>Faulkner </em>analysis to the other crimes evidence, in this case, the trial court properly applied the three-prong <em>Faulkner </em>analysis to the other crimes evidence admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>It is clear that the attorneys and the trial court understood at the hearing on the motion <em>in limine </em>what Swanson would testify to, and this included the statement she made to a Prince George\u2019s County detective, and the specifics of the crime which mirrored the specifics of the crime against Stahl. The trial court heard argument from both attorneys on the three-prongs of the <em>Faulkner </em>analysis. The trial court, after hearing argument, denied defense counsel\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and permitted Swanson to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The State introduced Swanson\u2019s testimony to prove that appellant\u2019s defecation on Stahl had not been accidental or a mistake. To demonstrate the non-accidental nature of the act, it was necessary for the State to introduce evidence surrounding the act itself. <em>Streater, </em>352 Md. at 810, 724 A.2d 111 (quoting <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 642-43, 552 A.2d 896) (\u201c[T]he evidence must be reasonably necessary to establish the elements of the offense charged.\u201d). That appellant contacted Swanson for sexually related activity, produced a gun, and demanded oral sex of Swanson with the results of the defecation remaining in her mouth, were details related to the non-accidental nature of the act. It would have been impossible to describe the act of defecation in a vacuum with no supporting circumstances. For all of the reasons above, we conclude that the circuit court committed no error in admitting Swanson\u2019s testimony under the accident or \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d exception to Maryland Rule 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The next step, under the <em>Faulkner </em>three step analysis, is to determine whether appellant\u2019s involvement in the other crimes is established by clear and convincing evidence. For evidence to be admissible under Maryland Rule 5-404(b), it must be \u201cclear and convincing to the trial judge.\u201d <em>Cross, </em>282 Md. at 478, 386 A.2d 757. \u201cClear and convincing evidence means that the witness to a fact must be found to be credible, and that the facts to which [she] ha[s] testified are distinctly remembered and the details thereof narrated exactly and in due order, so as to enable the trier of the facts to come to a clear conviction, without hesitance, of the truth of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>precise facts in issue.\u201d <em>Goroum v. Rynarzewski, </em>89 Md.App. 676, 684-85, 599 A.2d 843 (1991) (quoting <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 320, 413 A.2d 170 (1980) (quoting, in turn, 30 Am. Jur.2d Evidence 1167 (1967))). We review the trial court\u2019s decision in this regard \u201cto determine whether the evidence was sufficient to support the [trial court\u2019s] finding.\u201d <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 635, 552 A.2d 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">In this case, Swanson, the victim of the other crime, testified in court. The crime or conduct about which Swanson testified was not remote in time but rather occurred in February 2009, approximately two months before appellant\u2019s interaction with Stahl, which occurred on April 12, 2009, in this case. Swanson reported the incident to law enforcement authorities immediately after the occurrence, and testified at trial, in November 2009, approximately eight months after her encounter with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The similarities between the two events lead to the determination that the other crimes evidence, as testified to by Stahl, was established by clear and convincing evidence. Both Swanson and Stahl reported advertising on Craigslist and being contacted by appellant. Both women reported being held at gun point, and being defecated upon, and forced to perform oral sex. There is no evidence that the two women were in any manner previously acquainted with each other. We find no basis to disturb the trial court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s involvement in the other crime is established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in admitting Swanson\u2019s testimony because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Maryland Rule 5-403 provides, \u201c[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>To some degree, all evidence admitted under Maryland Rule 5-404(b) is prejudicial. Therefore, the third <em>Faulkner </em>prong requires the trial court to engage in a Rule 5-403 balancing. <em>Streater, </em>352 Md. at 810, 724 A.2d 111. The Court of Appeals in <em>Carter v. State, </em>374 Md. 693, 705, 824 A.2d 123 (2003) , explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">With respect to issues involving the admissibility of evidence, although relevant evidence is generally admissible, <em>Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404, 697 A.2d 432, 439 (1997), it \u201cshould be excluded by the trial court, if the probative value of such evidence is determined to be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Andrews v. State, </em>372 Md. 1, 19, 811 A.2d 282, 292 (2002) (citing Maryland Rule 5-403). \u201c '[A] decision to admit relevant evidence over an objection that the evidence is unfairly prejudicial will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 405, 697 A.2d at 439 (quoting <em>Williams v.

State, </em>364 Md. 76, 89, 771 A.2d 389, 396 (2001)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">As reiterated by Professor McLain, in her book Maryland Rules of Evidence: \u201cRule [5-403] instructs the court to exclude the evidence only if the probative value it would add to the case is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice, confusion of the fact finder or, waste of time.\u201d Professor Lynn McLain, Maryland Rules of Evidence 66 (Thomson/West ed., 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">In <em>Hyman v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 618, 628, 857 A.2d 1166 (2004) , we discussed the balancing necessary to weigh probative value against prejudice as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-11\">The \u201cunfair\u201d component of the prejudice is not the tendency of the evidence to prove the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crimes. What is \u201cunfair\u201d is only the incremental tendency of the evidence to prove that the defendant was a \u201cbad man.\u201d As we balance, therefore, the emphasis must be not on the noun \u201cprejudice\u201d but on the qualifying, and limiting, adjective \u201cunfair.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>It is the failure to appreciate this distinction that leads many analyses astray. There is frequently a tendency to conclude that if the State\u2019s case is otherwise a strong one, the probative value of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is proportionately diminished. That is not the case. Probative value does not depend on necessity. When we are talking only about the legitimate prejudice that inevitably results from competent evidence enjoying a special or heightened relevance, there is no downside to making a strong case even stronger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">The probative value must, of course, be measured against the \u201cunfair\u201d component of the prejudicial evidence. When that is the subject of the balancing, necessity is a factor. We balance 1) the need for the evidence against 2) the tendency of the evidence to prejudice the defendant unfairly. In terms of legitimate prejudice, on the other hand, the State is not constrained to forego relevant evidence and to risk going to the fact finder with a watered down version of its case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\"><em>Oesby v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 144, 166-67, 788 A.2d 662, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 181, 798 A.2d 553 (2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In <em>Oesby, </em>142 Md.App. at 167-68, 788 A.2d 662, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">This final balancing between probative value and unfair prejudice is something that is entrusted to the wide discretion of the trial judge. The appellate standard of review, therefore, is the highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. The fact that we might have struck the balance otherwise is beside the point. We know of no case where a trial judge was ever held to have abused his discretion in this final weighing process. As a practical matter, that will almost never be held to have occurred. A properly disciplined appellate court will not reverse an exercise of discretion because it thinks the trial judge\u2019s decision was wrong. That would be substituting its judgment for that of the trial court, which is inappropriate if not forbidden. Reversal should be reserved for those rare and bizarre exercises of discretion that are, in the judgment of the appellate court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>not only wrong but flagrantly and outrageously so. In this case, we see no faint or distant glimmer of even arguable abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In this case, Swanson\u2019s testimony was highly probative, as Swanson testified that less than two months prior to appellant\u2019s contact with Stahl, appellant committed the same act, defecating in Swanson\u2019s mouth, which he contended to be accidental or not done for sexual gratification with Stahl. The circuit court determined the other crimes evidence, \u201cwould be relevant to show his intent or absence of mistake or accident if that is in fact what he\u2019s \u2014 is position is going to be.\u201d The court found that the probative value of the evidence against appellant outweighed the prejudice it would cause, stating, \u201c[a]nd when weighing that against the \u2014 I mean certainly it\u2019s prejudicial, I mean it\u2019s \u2014 but is it unduly prejudicial and \u2014 I do find that it is more probative than prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">At the conclusion of evidence in the case, the court gave the following instruction: \u201cYou have heard evidence that the defendant committed the bad act of defecating in the mouth of Rachel Swanson which is not a charge in this case. You may consider this evidence only on the question of whether the defendant\u2019s act of defecating in/on Ms. Stahl was accidental or mistake.\u201d Accordingly, the circuit court balanced the probative value of the evidence along with the danger of unfair prejudice, and gave a specific instruction to the jury explaining the purpose for admission of the other crimes evidence. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">At the conclusion of the case, the court gave the following instruction on reckless endangerment: \u201cA person may not recklessly engage in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another.\u201d Neither the State nor defense counsel objected to this instruction. As stated above, appellant was convicted of reckless endangerment and was sentenced to a consecutive five year sentence for the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>In this case, acknowledging a failure to object to the instruction, appellant argues the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury, as to reckless endangerment, constituted plain error. Appellant argues that the reckless endangerment jury instruction was not the Maryland Pattern Criminal Jury Instruction, and, as such, the circuit court erred by neglecting to identify the reasonableness prong of the reckless endangerment instruction and failed to provide the jury with any guidance on the meaning of recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The State contends that appellant, by failing to object, has waived any complaint on the topic, and that the court\u2019s discretion to review unpreserved issues must be used sparingly. The State further argues that to the extent the court\u2019s instruction on reckless endangerment was not a precise recitation of the Maryland Pattern Criminal Jury Instruction, this is of no consequence, because the facts of the case, and appellant\u2019s defense did not involve the claimed omitted portions of the pattern instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Maryland Rule 4-325(e) provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and grounds of objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">As the Court of Appeals discussed in <em>State v.

The premise for such appellate action is that a jury is able to follow the court\u2019s instructions when articulated fairly and impartially. It follows, therefore, that when the instructions are lacking in some vital detail or convey some prejudicial or confusing message, however inadvertently, the ability of the jury to discharge its duty of returning a true verdict based on the evidence is impaired. The responsibility for avoiding such circumstance rests with the trial judge who must advise the jury on every matter stemming from the evidence which is vital to its determination of the issues before them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aun\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In other words, plain error should be used in instances where the error is \u201ccompelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. at 203, 411 A.2d 1035. The responsibility for avoiding such error rests with the trial judge. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Appellant, in this case, agrees that no objection was made to the court\u2019s instruction on reckless endangerment. Therefore, absent plain error, any issue as to the propriety of the instruction on reckless endangerment has not been preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 4:26A, titled Reckless Endangerment, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">The defendant is charged with the crime of reckless endangerment.

In <em>Green v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 547, 562, 705 A.2d 133 (1998), we stated, \u201c[n]evertheless, the pattern instructions are not comparable to rules of evidence.

State, </em>356 Md. 677, 683, 741 A.2d 1119 (1999); <em>Ware v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 58, 702 A.2d 699 (1997); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 4-325(c) (2000). Appellant asserts that the trial judges\u2019C ] departure from the recommended language in the pattern jury instructions resulted in the possibility that the jury rejected his claim of self-defense because it erroneously believed he had a duty to retreat. In general, we have favored implementation of the Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">Nevertheless, we say for the benefit of trial judges generally that the wise course of action is to give instructions in the form, where applicable, of our Maryland Pattern Jury Instructions. Those instructions have been put together by a group of distinguished judges and lawyers who almost amount to a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of the Maryland Bench and Bar. Many of these instructions have been passed upon by our appellate courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\"><em>Green v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 758, 771, 736 A.2d 450 (1999).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">As the State points out, however, deviation from the recommended language in the pattern jury instructions does not <em>per se </em>constitute error. We explained in <em>Green v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 547, 562, 705 A.2d 133 (1998), that, \u201cWhen the evidence generates an issue that is not covered by a pattern instruction, we must count on the court to incorporate relevant and valid legal principles gleaned from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the case law.\u201d The court sought \u201cto give the jury the most accurate recitation of the law\u201d in its modification of the pattern instruction from \u201cat the moment that the force was used\u201d to \u201cat the moment the shots were fired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The circuit court instructed the jury that, \u201c[a] person may not recklessly engage in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious injury to another.\u201d The instruction, in this case, as given by the circuit court, is a direct and complete quote of the relevant Maryland criminal law statute under which appellant was charged for reckless endangerment, C.L. \u00a7 3-204(a)(1). C.L. \u00a7 3-204(a)(1) provides, \u201c(a) La] person may not recklessly: (1) engage in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another; ...\u201d and is an accurate description of the offense. We find no error in the circuit court providing the statutory description of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Relying on <em>General v.

In this case, the trial judge gave the jury the statutory definition of the reckless endangerment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>offense and provided no misinformation. The circuit court\u2019s instruction was not lacking in vital detail and did not convey prejudicial or confusing information. As such, the circuit court\u2019s instruction on reckless endangerment does not rise to the level of plain error: compelling, extraordinary, exceptional, or fundamental error.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CHARLES COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\">.

Appellant worded the issues thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">I.

By failing to instruct the jury on the elements of the crime of reckless endangerment, did the trial court undermine the jury\u2019s ability to apply the law and thereby compromise the fairness of the trial in violation of Mr. Cousar\u2019s constitutional right to due process?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\">.

In admitting Swanson's testimony, the circuit court found the evidence admissible to \u201cshow his intent or absence of mistake.\u201d The offense of unnatural or perverted sexual practice, however, does not require intent as an element. C.L. \u00a7 3-322. On appeal, the parties have, therefore, not addressed whether the evidence was admissible for the specific purpose of showing intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\">. Additionally Maryland Rule 5-404(b), codifies the \u201csexual propensity\u201d exception to the general rule excluding \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Vogel v. State, </em>315 Md. 458, 466, 554 A.2d 1231 (1989), the \"sexual propensity\u201d exception is applicable to evidence of \"prior illicit sexual acts [which] are similar to the offense for which the accused is being tried and involve the same victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Before Maryland Rule 5-404(b) was adopted, [the Court of Appeals] stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The primary policy consideration underlying the rule against other crimes evidence \"is that this type of evidence will prejudice the jury against the accused because of the jury\u2019s tendency to infer that the accused is a \u2018bad man\u2019 who should be punished regardless of his guilt of the charged crime, or to infer that he committed the charged crime due to a criminal disposition.\u201d Yet, in the area of sex crimes, particularly child molestation, \"courts have been likely to admit proof of prior acts to show a party\u2019s conformity with past conduct.\u201d Professor McLain suggests that this relaxation of the general prohibition is \"probably because the character evidence is believed to have greater probative value in those circumstances.\u201d In sex crimes cases the special relevance of the other crimes evidence that may be admissible is a criminal propensity particularized to similar sex crimes perpetrated on the same victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">Thus, in a sex offense prosecution, when the State offers evidence of prior sexual criminal acts of the same type by the accused against the same victim, the law of evidence already has concluded that, in general, the probative value, as substantive evidence that the defendant committed the crime charged, outweighs the inherent prejudicial effect. The discretion exercised by the trial judge in weighing unfair prejudice against probative value is concerned with special features in the particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\"><em>Thompson v.
