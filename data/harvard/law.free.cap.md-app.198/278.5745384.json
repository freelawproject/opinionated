The lender, SunTrust Bank (\u201cSunTrust\u201d), appellee, filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Ubom Law Group, PLLC (\u201cULG\u201d), and Uduak J. Ubom after ULG failed to make scheduled monthly payments on the account. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of SunTrust and against ULG and Mr. Ubom, jointly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>and severally, in the amount of $65,715.60, plus $4,129.65 for pre-judgment interest, $9,857.34 for attorney\u2019s fees, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Mr. Ubom appealed. He does not dispute the validity of the judgment against ULG, but he contends that the judgment against him personally was erroneous. He presents four questions for our review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which collectively question the propriety of the circuit court\u2019s ruling granting summary judgment in favor of SunTrust based on its finding that Mr. Ubom\u2019s signature as a guarantor of a commercial line of credit was in an individual capacity, as opposed to as a representative of the law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">ULG is a professional limited liability company that provides legal services. Mr. Ubom is the managing attorney and sole owner of ULG.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>On August 12, 2006, ULG filled out a \u201cFastAccess Line of Credit Application and Agreement\u201d (\u201cAgreement\u201d) to obtain a line of credit from SunTrust in the amount of $100,000. The first page of the Agreement included information regarding the applicant, ULG. The second page of the Agreement included information regarding the guarantor. In the \u201cGuarantor Information\u201d section, Mr. Ubom included, among other things, his date of birth, address, phone number, social security number, driver\u2019s license number, employment, and financial information. He did not, however, include his name in the section marked \u201cLegal Name of Guarantor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The last page of the Agreement contained signatures. Mr. Ubom signed his name twice; once on the signature line for \u201cApplicant\u201d and once on the signature line for \u201cGuarantor.\u201d After both signatures, in the box marked \u201cTitle,\u201d Mr. Ubom wrote \u201cManaging Attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">On August 17, 2006, SunTrust sent a letter to ULG advising that its application for a line of credit of $100,000 had been approved. SunTrust also sent ULG a Check Access Rider, which included additional terms and conditions of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">On May 29, 2009, SunTrust filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against ULG and Mr. Ubom, asserting: (1) that ULG had failed to make the scheduled monthly payments due on the account; and (2) that Mr. Ubom \u201chad personally guaranteed the payment to SunTrust of all obligations and liabilities\u201d arising under the Agreement. The Complaint alleged that the amount due on the account was $65,715.60 in principal, $2,109.35 in interest, and $9,857.34 in attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> SunTrust requested that the court \u201cgrant judgment in its favor against [ULG] and [Mr. Ubom], jointly and severally,\u201d in the above amount, plus \u201cpre-judgment interest accruing at the rate of $9.45 per day from May 13, 2009.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>On July 13, 2009, Mr. Ubom filed an answer on behalf of himself and ULG. The answer generally denied SunTrust\u2019s allegations, and it stated that the defendants had \u201cmade a good faith offer of settlement of the account, which was rejected by\u201d SunTrust. The answer did not set forth any affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On October 14, 2009, SunTrust filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. On November 20, 2009, Mr. Ubom filed a motion to dismiss and/or opposition to SunTrust\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Mr. Ubom acknowledged that ULG defaulted on the Agreement, but he argued that the court should dismiss him as a party or grant summary judgment in his favor because he signed the Agreement in his official capacity as Managing Partner of ULG, not as a personal guarantor of the loan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">On January 7, 2009, the court held a hearing on SunTrust\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Mr. Ubom argued that, after he obtained a home equity loan from SunTrust, \u201cthe manager convinced [him] that [he] had to get one for [his] business.\u201d Mr. Ubom asserted that the SunTrust representative told him that, although he was signing as guarantor on the ULG Line of Credit, he could avoid personal liability by: (1) not including his name on the second page of the Agreement that asked for the legal name of the guarantor; and (2) by writing \u201cManaging Partner\u201d after his signature on the fourth page of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Counsel for SunTrust argued that the Agreement was \u201cclear and unambiguous on its face,\u201d and it created a personal guaranty by Mr. Ubom. Counsel noted that Mr. Ubom\u2019s personal information was listed under the section titled \u201cGuarantor Information\u201d and Mr. Ubom signed on the line titled \u201cSignature Guarantor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The court found that the Agreement, which contained Mr. Ubom\u2019s signature as guarantor, was a personal guaranty, noting that Mr. Ubom was \u201ca sophisticated gentleman ... an attorney ... at law.\u201d Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment in favor of SunTrust and against ULG and Mr. Ubom.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Mr. Ubom argues that the court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of SunTrust against him personally. He asserts that he \u201csigned the [Ajgreement in his official capacity as Managing Partner [of] ULG,\u201d and he \u201cdid not sign the Agreement personally guaranteeing the obligations of ULG.\u201d Mr. Ubom further asserts that the court erred in preventing him from presenting testimony that he was assured by SunTrust that he would not be personally liable for the line of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">SunTrust argues that the circuit court correctly found that the Agreement created a personal guaranty on the part of Mr. Ubom. It asserts that the Agreement, which contains Mr. Ubom\u2019s signature as the guarantor, is \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d in creating a personal guaranty on the part of Mr. Ubom.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, \u201cwe independently review the record to determine whether the parties properly generated a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Reiter v. Pneumo Abex, LLC, </em>417 Md. 57, 67 (2010) (quoting <em>Livesay v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 1, 10, 862 A.2d 33 (2004)). A material fact is one which is \u201cnecessary to the determination of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. We \u201c \u2018review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the movant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67 (quoting <em>Livesay, </em>384 Md. at 9, 862 A.2d 33).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">In this case, there is no dispute of material fact. Mr. Ubom does not dispute that the identifying information contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the section titled \u201cGuarantor Information\u201d is his personal information or that his signature appears on the line captioned \u201cSignature (Guarantor).\u201d The question before us is a legal one, whether Mr. Ubom signed his name in his capacity as an officer of the corporation or whether it was a personal guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Before addressing the merits of the issue, we note that Mr. Ubom, in arguing that his signature did not create a personal guaranty, has cited no case law in support of this assertion. On this basis alone, we could reject his contention. <em>See Conrad v. Gamble, </em>183 Md.App. 539, 569, 962 A.2d 1007 (2008) (declining to address issue because appellants\u2019 argument was \u201ccompletely devoid of legal authority\u201d) (quotation omitted); <em>Marquis v. Marquis, </em>175 Md.App. 734, 758, 931 A.2d 1164 (2007) (\u201c <em>\u2018It is </em>not our function to seek out the law in support of a party\u2019s appellate contentions.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Sodergren v. Johns Hopkins Univ. Applied Physics Lab., </em>138 Md.App. 686, 707, 773 A.2d 592 (2001)); <em>Anderson v. Litzenberg, </em>115 Md.App. 549, 577-78, 694 A.2d 150 (1997) (refusing to address argument because appellants failed to cite any legal authority to support their contention of error), <em>cert. denied, </em>368 Md. 239, 792 A.2d 1177 (2002).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Nevertheless, although \u201cdismissal may be an appropriate sanction, whether to employ it is a matter left to the exercise of this Court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Esteps Elec. &amp; Petroleum, Co. v. Sager, </em>67 Md.App. 649, 657, 508 A.2d 1032 (1986). We will exercise our discretion to consider Mr. Ubom\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>Maryland courts adhere to the principle of the objective interpretation of contracts. <em>Ocean Petroleum Co. v. Yanek, </em>416 Md. 74, 86 (2010). Pursuant to this principle, \u201c \u2018unless a contract\u2019s language is ambiguous, we give effect to that language as written without concern for the subjective intent of the parties at the time of formation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 16, 919 A.2d 700 (2007)). We restrict our inquiry to \u201c \u2018the four corners of the agreement,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Cochran, </em>398 Md. at 17, 919 A.2d 700), and \u201cascribe to the contract\u2019s language its \u2018customary, ordinary, and accepted meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Fister v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>366 Md. 201, 210, 783 A.2d 194 (2001)). The Court of Appeals has made clear that, when language in a contract is unambiguous, and absent \u201cfraud, duress, or mistake, parol evidence is not admissible to show the intention of the parties or to vary, alter, or contradict the terms of that contract. Only when the language of the contract is ambiguous will we look to extraneous sources for the contract\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Brendsel v. Winchester Constr. Co., </em>392 Md. 601, 624, 898 A.2d 472 (2006) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Ambiguity will be found if, to a reasonable person, the language used is susceptible to more than one meaning, or it is of a doubtful meaning. <em>Anderson Adventures, LLC v. Sam &amp; Murphy, Inc., </em>176 Md.App. 164, 179, 932 A.2d 1186 (2007). \u201cTo determine whether a contract is susceptible of more than one meaning, the court considers \u2018the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of the execution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 932 A.2d 1186 (quoting <em>Phoenix Serv\u2019s Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>167 Md.App. 327, 392, 892 A.2d 1185 (2006)). \u201cThe interpretation of a contract, including the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law,\u201d which we review <em>de novo. Sy-Lene of Washington, Inc. v. Starwood Urban Retail II, LLC, </em>376 Md. 157, 163, 829 A.2d 540 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In <em>L &amp; H Enterprises, Inc. v. Allied Building Prod. Corp., </em>88 Md.App. 642, 646-47, 596 A.2d 672 (1991), this Court applied these principles in the context of the issue presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>here, <em>i.e., </em>whether a guaranty of a corporation\u2019s obligation, signed by a corporate officer, was signed in the officer\u2019s representative or individual capacity. In that case, L &amp; H Roofing, Inc., trading as L &amp; H Enterprises (the \u201croofing company\u201d), applied for credit with the appellee. The credit application was signed by the roofing company\u2019s president and the vice president/treasurer. <em>Id. </em>at 643, 596 A.2d 672. When the roofing company failed to make payment, appellee sued the company and the corporate officers personally. <em>Id. </em>The claim of personal liability was based on the following guaranty language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">In consideration of Allied Roofers Supply Corp., its subsidiaries or affiliates, extending credit I/we jointly and severally do guarantee unconditionally at all times, to Allied Roofers Supply Co., its subsidiaries or affiliates, the payment of indebtedness, or balance or indebtedness of the [roofing company].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">(All partners or officers should sign).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 644, 596 A.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">This Court looked to several factors in determining whether that agreement was ambiguous with respect to the capacity in which the corporate officers signed the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 645, 596 A.2d 672. Initially, we looked at the first page of the application seeking information about the applicant. <em>Id. </em>at 647, 596 A.2d 672. We noted that the credit application required information about the corporation and the corporate officers, and where the application requested the name of the spouse of the corporate officers, both officers filed in \u201cN/A\u201d (not applicable). <em>Id. </em>We stated that this tended to show \u201can intent to only bind the corporation\u201d because Allied could not reach joint marital assets without the signature of the officer\u2019s spouse. <em>Id. </em>at 647, 596 A.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Moreover, significant to this case, there was only one place on the application for the signature of the officers. <em>Id. </em>at 648, 596 A.2d 672. We noted that portions of the agreement, such as authorization to investigate credit references and charge interest, required the agreement of the corporation. <em>Id. </em>For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>these purposes, the officers\u2019 signatures appeared to be in their representative capacity. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, after reviewing the entire agreement, we held that, although the guaranty language itself may have been clear and unambiguous, when read in the context of the entire agreement, the contract was ambiguous regarding whether the officers of the corporation signed in a personal or representative capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 648-49, 596 A.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">As in <em>L &amp; H Enterprises, Inc., </em>we will look at the Agreement as a whole to determine whether Mr. Ubom signed the guaranty in a personal or representative capacity. Starting first with the form of the signature, this case is unlike <em>L &amp; H Enterprises, </em>88 Md.App. at 648, 596 A.2d 672, where the corporate officers signed only one time, and the contract needed the signature of the corporation. Here, there were two signature lines, one for \u201cApplicant,\u201d the law firm, and one for \u201cGuarantor.\u201d Mr. Ubom signed his name on both signature lines. Under these circumstances, a reasonable interpretation of the guaranty is that Mr. Ubom was signing in his personal capacity. <em>See Curtis G. Testerman Company v. Buck, </em>340 Md. 569, 578, 667 A.2d 649 (1995) (when intent that officer of corporation be personally liable on a contract, \u201c \u2018nearly universal practice is that the officer signs twice-once as an officer and again as an individual\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Salzman Sign Co. v. Beck, </em>10 N.Y.2d 63, 217 N.Y.S.2d 55, 176 N.E.2d 74, 76 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Indeed, a finding that Mr. Ubom signed the guaranty in a representative capacity would render the guaranty inconsequential; it would add nothing to SunTrust\u2019s security to have the law firm, through its Managing Partner, guaranty an obligation to which the law firm already was bound. <em>See Home Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Ramos, </em>229 Cal.App.3d 1609, 284 Cal.Rptr. 1, 3 (1991) (finding guaranty to be corporate, rather than personal, would be objectively unreasonable because the corporation was already bound under the contract); <em>American Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Wetland Workover, Inc., </em>523 So.2d 942, 945 (La.Ct.App.) (if guarantors signed in a representative capacity, the corporation would be guarantying an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>obligation for which it was already bound, rendering guaranty worthless), cert. <em>denied, </em>531 So.2d 283 (La.1988); <em>American Petrofina Co. of Texas v. Bryan, </em>519 S.W.2d 484, 487 (Tex.Civ. App.1975) (\u201c[T]o hold that Lthe corporation] is the only defendant liable under the terms of the written guaranty [signed by the officers] is to hold that the guaranty is meaningless.\u201d). <em>See also Cadle Co. v. Webb, </em>66 Mass.App.Ct. 269, 846 N.E.2d 1179, 1182 (2006) (the ordinary meaning of the word guaranty is that \u201csome one else is primarily liable for a debt and that the guarantor will pay it if the primary debtor does not\u201d) (quoting <em>Charlestown Five Cents Sav. Bank v. Wolf, </em>309 Mass. 547, 36 N.E.2d 390, 391 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Mr. Ubom argues, however, that his listing of his title, Managing Attorney, next to his signature as guarantor shows that his signature was in a representative capacity. A corporate officer, however, is not relieved of personal liability by the mere addition of his corporate title. <em>See Maske v. Chrysler First Commercial Corp., </em>602 So.2d 388, 390 (Ala.1992) (officer\u2019s addition of his corporate title to his signature as guarantor was merely descriptive and did not change the personal capacity in which he signed); <em>American Petrofina, Company of Texas, </em>519 S.W.2d at 487 (signatures by corporate officers, listing titles of President and Secretary of the corporation, did not show intent to bind corporation or create ambiguity regarding personal liability; the designations were \u201conly descriptio personae\u201d). <em>Accord </em>12 Richard A. Lord, Williston on Contracts \u00a7 35.56, at 466-68 (4th ed. 1999) (\u201cHistorically, it has been generally held that the mere addition of the word \u2018agent\u2019 or official designations such as \u2018president,\u2019 \u2018treasurer,\u2019 \u2018secretary,\u2019 \u2018trustee,\u2019 and the like, in the absence of words in the body of the instrument showing a different intent, is to be treated as a matter of description, and the agent or official is personally the contracting party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Moreover, the language in the Agreement as a whole shows an intent to fix personal liability on Mr. Ubom as guarantor. On page three of the Agreement, in the section entitled \u201cGuaranty,\u201d the Agreement states, <em>inter alia, </em>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>To induce Bank to open the Account and extend credit to the applicant, or to renew or extend such other credit, each of the individuals signing this Application as a \u201cGuarantor\u201d (whether one or more, the \u201cGuarantor\u201d) hereby jointly and severally guarantee payment to Bank of all obligations and liabilities of the applicant of any nature whatsoever and whether currently existing or hereafter arising, including without limitation, all obligations and liabilities under this Application and/or the Account, and reasonable fees and expenses of Bank\u2019s attorney(s) incurred in the collection of such obligations (collectively the \u201cObligations\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">This language is clear and unambiguous. It specifically identifies the applicant, ULG, as the entity primarily responsible for the fine of credit, and the individual signing as guarantor, as jointly liable for the obligations of ULG. This language clearly contemplates that Mr. Ubom was signing as guarantor in his personal capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Another provision makes clear that Mr. Ubom was signing the guaranty in a personal capacity. In the section of the Agreement identified as \u201cGuarantor Information,\u201d Mr. Ubom added his personal information, including his date of birth, address, phone number, social security number, and driver\u2019s license number. Mr. Ubom also included information regarding his individual finances, including his gross annual salary, sources of other income, and net worth. That Mr. Ubom did not include his name on the grantor line does not negate the clear evidence that Mr. Ubom was listing himself, personally, as the guarantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The clear language of the Agreement as a whole shows that Mr. Ubom\u2019s signature as guarantor was in a personal capacity, resulting in personal liability when ULG defaulted on its obligations. The language of the Agreement was unambiguous, and therefore, parol evidence was inadmissible to contradict the clear terms of the Agreement. The circuit court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>therefore, properly granted SunTrust\u2019s motion for summary judgment against ULG and Mr. Ubom.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\">. Mr. Ubom presented the following four questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">1. Whether the trial [cjourt erred in granting summary judgment to [appellee], against ULG, and Uduak J. Ubom, where the Fast Access Line of Credit Application and Agreement was between [appellee] and ULG, and Uduak J. Ubom, is appended as the Managing Partner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">2. Whether the trial [c]ourt erred in granting summary judgment to [appellee], against ULG, and Uduak J. Ubom, where the Fast Access Line of Credit Application and Agreement was between [appellee] and ULG, and does not include Uduak J. Ubom\u2019s name as the guarantor of the Loan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">3. Whether the trial [c]ourt erred in granting summary judgment to [appellee], against ULG, and Uduak J. Ubom, where the Fast Access Line of Credit Application and Agreement was between [appellee] and ULG, and Uduak J. Ubom was instructed by [appellee] not to include his name as the guarantor, but to sign the form in his official capacity as the Managing Partner of ULG.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">4. Whether the trial [c]ourt erred in granting summary judgment to [appellee], against ULG, and Uduak J. Ubom, without allowing Defendant Uduak James Ubom to testify to the fact that he was assured by [SunTrust], that he was not personally liable for the line of credit, as such he should not write his name in the Fast Access Line of Credit Application and Agreement column (Legal Name of Guarantor).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">.
