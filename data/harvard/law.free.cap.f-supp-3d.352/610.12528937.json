DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his \u00a7 2255 Motion, Petitioner asks the Court to set aside both his judgment of conviction and his sentence on five purported grounds. ECF No. 95. Grounds One, Two and Five challenge the lawfulness of his \u00a7 924(c) convictions, and Grounds Three and Four assert claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court shall address each of these grounds in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Ground One: Petitioner Claims that His \u00a7 924(c) Convictions are Invalid Because He Was Not Convicted of the Underlying Crimes of Violence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ground One alleges that Petitioner's two \u00a7 924(c) convictions (Counts 3 and 11) were premised on the commission of crimes of violence, namely, the robberies alleged in Counts 2 and 10 of the indictment, but such counts were ultimately dismissed pursuant to Petitioner's plea agreement with the Government. ECF No. 95 at 4. Petitioner therefore argues that the essential elements of his \u00a7 924(c) charges were not satisfied and that his convictions on Counts 3 and 11 are invalid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This argument is without merit. The Fourth Circuit has clearly held that \u00a7 924(c) convictions do not require a conviction on the predicate crime of violence or drug trafficking offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11420184\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/415/#p425\">\n    300 F.3d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 425 (4th Cir. 2002). This is also the consensus of every federal circuit to have addressed the question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, to secure a conviction\n   under \u00a7 924(c), there need only be \"legally sufficient proof that the predicate crime was, in fact, committed.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Link\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271778\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/214/506/#p518\">\n    214 F.Supp.3d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 518 (E.D. Va. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4013046\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/125/#p130\">\n    779 F.3d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 130 (2d Cir. 2015) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, there is more than sufficient evidence to prove that Petitioner committed the underlying acts of robbery alleged in Counts 2 and 10 even though he was never convicted of such counts. The agreed Statement of Facts supporting Petitioner's convictions states that, on March 6, 2017, at approximately 3:30 a.m., Petitioner and one of his co-defendants entered the 7-Eleven in the 9900 block of Jefferson Avenue, Newport News, Virginia where they ultimately robbed the store clerk at gunpoint and took tobacco products from the store. ECF No. 42 \u00b6 1. This is the precise offense conduct alleged in Count 2 of the indictment. ECF No. 1 at 3. Petitioner's Statement of Facts further states that, at approximately 1:00 p.m. on that same date, Petitioner and one of his co-defendants entered the 1st Stop Convenience Store located in the 2200 block of Executive Drive, Hampton, Virginia where they ultimately robbed a store clerk at gunpoint and took U.S. currency from the store. ECF No. 42 \u00b6 5. This is the precise offense conduct alleged in Count 10 of the indictment. ECF No. 1 at 9. During Petitioner's Rule 11 proceeding before the magistrate judge of this Court, Petitioner, under penalty of perjury, acknowledged that he read the Statement of Facts and initialed every page thereof, and he admitted that the facts alleged therein were true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41. Based on this Statement of Facts, there is clearly legally sufficient evidence that Petitioner committed the crimes of violence underlying his \u00a7 924(c) convictions. Therefore, Ground One of Petitioner's \u00a7 2255 Motion fails to state a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Ground Two: Petitioner Claims that the Two \u00a7 924(c) Convictions Stem from a Single Criminal Episode Sufficient to Sustain Only One Such Conviction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Petitioner next argues that at least one of his \u00a7 924(c) convictions should be vacated because the underlying crimes of violence (Hobbs Act robberies) sprang from a \"single impulse\" and constituted a single criminal episode given that the robberies occurred on the same day, in the same area, and had the same purpose. ECF No. 95 at 5. At the outset, the Court notes that the five robberies comprising Petitioner's conspiracy in this case occurred at five different locations across Newport News and Hampton and occurred over a nine-hour time span.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Facts, ECF No. 42. Regardless, the temporal or spatial proximity of the underlying predicate offenses does not control whether they can sustain multiple \u00a7 924(c)(1) convictions. In fact, multiple \u00a7 924(c) convictions can arise out of a single predicate offense.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Camps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844597\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/102/#p106\">\n    32 F.3d 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106 (4th Cir. 1994). As the Fourth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Camps\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   It is, we believe, self-evident that a defendant who has engaged in numerous instances of the precise conduct that Congress has outlawed has committed more than one criminal offense. A defendant who has \"used\" or \"carried\" a firearm on several separate occasions during the course of a single continuing\n   offense, therefore, has committed several section 924(c)(1) offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844597\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/102/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844597\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/102/#p106\">\n    at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Based on this clear statement of the law, Petitioner's second purported ground for relief is without merit. Petitioner's Statement of Facts clearly establishes that Petitioner committed two separate instances of brandishing a weapon during a crime of violence: the first during a robbery at a 7-Eleven convenience store in Newport News, Virginia at 3:30 a.m., and the second during a robbery at a 1st Stop convenience mart in Hampton, Virginia at 1:00 p.m., more than nine hours later. ECF No. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 1,5. Even though the underlying robberies were part of a single conspiracy, Petitioner's \u00a7 924(c) convictions in Count 3 and 11 properly correlate to two separate occasions when Petition carried and brandished a firearm during a crime of violence. Therefore, receiving two separate sentences under \u00a7 924(c) was appropriate, and Petitioner's claim to the contrary in Ground Two is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Ground Three: Petitioner Claims His Defense Counsel Was Ineffective by Advising Petitioner to Accept the Government's Plea Offer.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Petitioner's third purported ground for relief is an effective assistance of counsel claim. ECF No. 95 at 7. Specifically, he claims that his defense counsel was ineffective when advising Petitioner to accept the Government's plea offer because the only evidence against Petitioner was purportedly the statements of his two-codefendants and, according to Petitioner, \"the testimony of an accomplice, standing alone, is insufficient to convict.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844597\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/32/102/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, Petitioner must satisfy the two-prong test established in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Even assuming for the sake of argument that the only evidence against Petitioner in this case was the testimony of his two co-defendants, Petitioner is incorrect to state that such evidence is legally insufficient to convict. Indeed, \"[a]lthough the testimony of an accomplice should be examined with care and received cautiously, it is sufficient to sustain a conviction, even though uncorroborated, if it convinces a jury of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Therefore, Petitioner's claim fails both prongs of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   because (1) he fails to allege any facts tending to show that his counsel's performance was deficient by advising him to plead guilty, and (2) he fails to allege any rational basis on which Petitioner may have instead insisted on going to trial. Accordingly, Ground Three fails to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 2255 and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

This claim is also without merit. Petitioner claims that his counsel was ineffective by failing to address the purported deficiencies with his \u00a7 924(c) convictions that are alleged in Grounds One and Two of his \u00a7 2255 Motion. ECF No. 95 at 8. But, for the reasons previously stated in this Order, these alleged deficiencies lack any support in the law.
