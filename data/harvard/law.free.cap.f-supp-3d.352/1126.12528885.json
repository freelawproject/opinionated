ECF Nos. 37, 39. For the reasons stated herein, the plaintiff's motion is DENIED, and defendant's motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Great American Opportunities (GAO) is a Tennessee company in the business of fundraising. ECF No. 1 (Complaint) at \u00b6 2. It facilitates fundraising programing for schools, councils and civic organizations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. It does this by acting as a wholesaler of products - GAO's customers sell GAO products to fundraise for their organization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. GAO uses sales representatives who collaborate with fundraising program sponsors in each account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. Fundraising program sponsors are people like the school principal, administrators, secretaries, teachers and coaches that lead a fundraiser for their organization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. GAO runs as many as 25,000 fundraising programs each year for about 16,000 different accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In running these programs, GAO develops customer account information such as a customer's fundraising history, what product lines the customer has used, the method of marketing and prize giving, the number of program participants, total sales, net profits, and the future goals of the participating schools and groups.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   \u00b6 18. Sales representatives develop and document this information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. The information is stored on a computer server in Tennessee, and GAO maintains several layers of security to protect its data in compliance with the \"Payment Card Industry\" data security standards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. GAO states that it also develops strategic business plans, marketing plans, future product roll-outs, and information about the acquisitions of other sales forces and accounts of competitors in fundraising.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. It considers all this information to be trade secrets and valuable confidential information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jacob Kent is a Colorado citizen and was a sales representative for GAO between October 1999 and December 31, 2015 or January 1, 2016, when he voluntarily resigned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31; ECF No. 8 at \u00b6 46. In 2002 Mr. Kent had entered into an employment agreement in which he acknowledged GAO's requirements that he not disclose trade secrets and other confidential information as a condition of employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28, 35; Employment Agreement \u00a7 5(a). Mr. Kent further agreed that for a period of two years following the date of his resignation, he would not solicit any account, customer, or sponsor of GAO within his assigned territory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38; Employment Agreement \u00a7 5(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   However, GAO learned from other sales representatives that Mr. Kent, at least as of February 24, 2017, was soliciting business from Colorado accounts he formerly serviced as a GAO employee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49-50. GAO sent two letters to Mr. Kent in March 2017 reminding him of his obligations under the Employment Agreement. However, he continued to solicit GAO customers for his new fundraising business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53- 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For his part Mr. Kent maintains that he was never provided any confidential or trade secret information after his first year with GAO. ECF No. 44 at 4. He further states that most of the information GAO argues is confidential is publicly accessible in the Colorado High School Activities Association directory, or by calling or visiting the school, or on GAO's website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Kent describes the fundraising service provided by his new business as a platform for online donations that does not require student groups to sell products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. He argues that this is a service not offered by GAO, and that the customers he has contacted had already ceased doing business with GAO because they were looking to move from product sales to an online donation-only platform.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   GAO filed its Complaint against Mr. Kent on July 17, 2017. ECF No. 1. It brought claims for misappropriation of trade secrets under federal and state law (Counts One and Two), breach of contract (Count Three), tortious interference with contracts (Count Four) and breach of the non-solicitation and non-interference clauses of the contract (Count Five).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 12, 2018, Mr. Kent moved for partial summary judgment asking for dismissal of all claims except claims contained in Count Three for breach of the confidentiality provisions of the Employment Agreement. ECF No. 37. Mr. Kent contends that the information identified by GAO does not constitute trade secrets or confidential business information, and that even if it did, Mr. Kent never misappropriated such information. He further claims that the provisions of the Employment Agreement relied upon by Plaintiff are unenforceable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%208-2-113\">\n    Colo.

ECF No. 39. Mr. Kent filed an opposition to that motion, ECF No. 44, and GAO filed a reply, ECF No. 46. Mr. Kent then filed, with the Court's permission, a sur-reply. ECF No. 49. Both motions for summary judgment have been fully briefed and are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant claims that the noncompetition provision of the Employment Agreement between Mr. Kent and GAO are void and unenforceable under Colorado law; that he never misappropriated confidential or trade secret information; and that the tort and statutory claims are barred by the economic loss rule. Plaintiff claims that, beyond any genuine dispute as to any material fact, Mr. Kent misappropriated confidential and trade secret information in violation of his contractual, tort, and statutory obligations, and that he violated the non-solicitation agreement of his contract. After reviewing the briefings and applicable law I grant defendant's motion for summary judgment on Count Four, tortious interference with business relationships. Because genuine disputes of material fact remain, I deny defendant's and plaintiff's motions for summary judgment on all other counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Enforceability of Employment Agreement \u00b6 4 \"Non-Competition and Non-Interference.\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The first issue in determining the enforceability of the noncompetition clause in the Employment Agreement is determining what law applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   1)\n   <em>\n    Does Tennessee or Colorado Law Apply?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Kent's Employment Agreement provides that it \"will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee.\" ECF No. 1-1 at \u00b6 13. In his motion Mr. Kent does not address the choice of law issue and appears to assume that Colorado law applies. ECF No. 37 at 2, 6, 12. GAO responds that Mr. Kent overlooked the Tennessee choice of law provision but then argues that the agreement is enforceable under Colorado law anyway. ECF No. 42 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its motion GAO argues that Tennessee law applies. ECF No. 39 at 13. In response Mr. Kent argues that the Court should apply Colorado law notwithstanding the choice of law provision in the agreement. ECF No. 44 at 8. He adds that the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses are unenforceable under Tennessee law in any event.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   a)\n   <em>\n    Did GAO Waive Its Right to Enforce the Choice of Law Clause?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, Mr. Kent argues that GAO has waived its right to enforce the choice of law provision in the Employment Agreement. In addition to providing that it will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee, the Employment Agreement also provides that the \"[e]mployee hereby consents to the venue and jurisdiction of the courts of competent jurisdiction, state and federal, situated in Nashville, Davidson County, Tennessee in any action brought in connection with this Agreement.\" ECF No. 1-1 at \u00b6 13. Mr. Kent contends that this paragraph is meant to be construed as a whole so that Tennessee law will be applied when the case is tried in Tennessee. ECF No. 44 at 8. He argues that GAO, in filing suit in Colorado and waiving the right to sue in Tennessee, has also waived the choice of law provision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Kent does not cite any law that suggests that a party waives choice of law when it waives choice of forum. I too have not found any law on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On the other hand, GAO cites a Colorado Court of Appeals case that held that a party waives choice of law where it fails to raise the issue before the trial court rules on dispositive issues relying on the disputed state law.\n   <em>\n    Shoen v. Shoen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6981451\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/292/1224/\">\n    2012 COA 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6981451\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/292/1224/\">\n    292 P.3d 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1227. GAO argues that because it has met this standard, it could not have waived choice of law. However, that case addresses when a party waives the right to appeal the issue of choice of law applied by a trial court. It does not address whether a party waives their right to enforce a choice of law provision in a contract by not seeking to enforce other rights in the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Interpreting the plain language of the contract, I conclude that the Employment Agreement does not indicate that both the choice of forum and the choice of law must be enforced for either to be enforced. The contract does not indicate that Tennessee is the only forum where an action may be brought to enforce the agreement. Instead, it states that Mr. Kent consents to the jurisdiction of courts in Tennessee. A reasonable reading of this sentence is that Tennessee is an appropriate forum, but not necessarily the only appropriate forum. Therefore, even reading the choice of law and choice of forum sentences together, it seems consistent with the plain language of paragraph 13 for GAO to sue in a forum other than Tennessee, as long as that forum has jurisdiction over Mr. Kent. And GAO can also enforce the choice of law provision stating that the Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Tennessee. I conclude that GAO did not waive its right to invoke the choice of law provision. The question still remains as to whether this choice of law provision governs the enforceability of the noncompetition and non-solicitation clauses of the Employment Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   b)\n   <em>\n    Under Colorado Choice of Law Principles, Which Law Applies?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This case is before the Court on diversity jurisdiction. A federal district court sitting in diversity must apply the choice of law rules of the state in which it sits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141361\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/313/487/#p496\">\n    313 U.S. 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141361\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/313/487/#p496\">\n    61 S.Ct. 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141361\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/313/487/#p496\">\n    85 L.Ed. 1477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1941). Therefore, I will apply\n   Colorado choice of law principles in this case. Colorado choice of law principles on this issue are consistent with the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 187 (1971).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Target Corp. v.

Thus, the remaining questions are (1) whether Colorado has a materially greater interest than Tennessee in determination of the enforceability of the restrictive covenants and (2) whether the application of Tennessee law would be contrary to a fundamental public policy of Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, Colorado has a materially greater interest than Tennessee in determining whether \u00b6 4 of the Employment Agreement is enforceable. This agreement was to be performed in Colorado, the breach of the agreement is alleged to have occurred in Colorado, and the defendant is a resident of Colorado with his sole place of work in Colorado. More importantly, the non-solicitation agreement between Mr. Kent and GAO restricted competition in Mr. Kent's sales territory, Colorado, so that the effects of noncompetition resulting from this agreement would be felt in Colorado, not Tennessee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King v.

The 10th Circuit highlighted in\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   that Colorado has a fundamental policy of voiding noncompetition provisions that do not fall within one of the statutory exceptions. 485 F.3d at 586-87 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DBA Enters. v.

App. 1996) (\"Covenants not to compete, with some narrow exceptions, are contrary to the public policy of Colorado and are void.\"). Colorado only permits four narrow exceptions to its ban on covenants not to compete: those for the purchase and sale of a business, for the protection of trade secrets, for recovery of training and education costs for an employee who served for less than two years, and for executive or management personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Tennessee's rule is the opposite - restrictive covenants are enforceable if they\n   are reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vantage Technology, LLC v.

App. 1999). These are two different standards for the permissibility of restrictive covenants. In\n   <em>\n    Haggard v. Spine\n   </em>\n   , the District of Colorado held that where Pennsylvania law follows the rule of reasonableness in determining the enforceability of a covenant not to compete, the \"distinctions between Colorado and Pennsylvania law regarding the burden of enforceability are critical and they reflect that application of Pennsylvania law in this case may violate the fundamental public policy of Colorado.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201655030\">\n    2009 WL 1655030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

If Mr. Kent is correct, then the noncompetition provisions, \u00b6 4(a) and \u00b6 4(b), could be held unenforceable even if the items in dispute are held to be valuable trade secrets. He argues first that because other parts of the agreement already protect trade secrets, these separate general restrictive covenant paragraphs should not be read to serve that purpose as well. He points to \u00b6 5(a) and \u00b6 5(b) in the Employment Agreement which protect trade secrets and confidential information. Another clause, \u00b6 5(c), also prevents Kent from disclosing any trade secrets or confidential information for a period of seven years following the termination of the Employment Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For support, Mr. Kent points to\n   <em>\n    Colorado Accounting Machines, Inc. v. Mergenthaler\n   </em>\n   where the Colorado Court of Appeals held that where a trade-secret nondisclosure provision adequately protected plaintiff's interests, and because a separate restrictive covenant provision was not limited to enhancing this protection, the restrictive covenant provision was invalid.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Colo.%20App.%20155\">\n    44 Colo.App. 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10454858\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/609/1125/#p1126\">\n    609 P.2d 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1126 (1980). On the other hand, in\n   <em>\n    Saturn Sys., Inc. v. Militare\n   </em>\n   , the Colorado Court of Appeals found that the plain\n   language of an employment agreement showed that a non-solicitation clause was designed to protect its client lists, sales materials and proprietary information, thereby expressing an intent to prohibit former employees or from using trade secrets to solicit former clients.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987809\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/252/516/\">\n    252 P.3d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (Colo. App. 2011). The Colorado Court of Appeals found that this non-compete clause was different than the unenforceable one in\n   <em>\n    Colorado Accounting\n   </em>\n   because it did not exist as a separate provision with a separate purpose than the nondisclosure clause; rather, it was contained within a single confidentiality provision of an Employment Agreement. This caused them to \"read the plain language of the non-solicitation clause...as serving the valid purpose of protecting Saturn's trade secrets.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987809\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/252/516/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6987809\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/252/516/\">\n    at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Using these cases, Mr. Kent argues that the restrictive covenant provisions do not mention any confidential information or trade secrets and are not contained within any clause aimed at protecting trade secrets. Instead they exist in a section titled \"Non-Competition and Non-Interference,\" apart from the section titled \"Non-Disclosure of Information.\" Moreover, trade secrets and confidential information are not referred to anywhere in the \"non-competition\" section. There is a hint of the purpose of the non-competition clause in paragraph 4(d) where the parties agree that the noncompetition and non-solicitation provisions \"represent fair, necessary and reasonable means by which the Company may protect its business, personnel and property.\" But the protection of business, personnel and property in general is not one of the narrow grounds upon which Colorado law permits the enforcement of non-compete agreements absent a trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   However, GAO argues that the \"non-competition\" section should be read in conjunction with the \"non-disclosure of information\" section. Paragraph 5(c) states that \"the Company's trade secrets and other confidential information are legally protected property interests solely of the Company.\" Read together with paragraph 4(d), this shows that one purpose of the noncompetition agreement was to protect trade secrets and other confidential information. Effectuating the intent of the Employment Agreement as a whole would require reading these provisions together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    USF &amp; G v.

For example, the trial court, in interpreting a one-year restriction on contact with any \"candidate,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   held that this only prohibited plaintiff from contacting candidates with whom he had actual contact, not any of the approximately 10,000 \"candidates\" in the files to which he had access.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10397188\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/762/763/#p766\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   I find this approach to resolving a potentially overbroad noncompetition covenant instructive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mr. Kent points to the breadth of the restrictive covenants in the Employment Agreement to demonstrate that they are not narrowly tailored to protecting trade secrets. As examples, Mr. Kent highlights that \u00b6 4(a) prohibits even indirect ownership in a competing business and prohibits the solicitation of customers Mr. Kent has not contacted in several years. However, I don't think that the noncompetition and non-solicitation clauses should be held void as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage where I have not yet determined what trade secrets it is aimed at protecting and where, if overbroad, a limiting construction of these clauses could cabin them to the protecting of trade secrets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   3)\n   <em>\n    Collateral Estoppel in Proving Damages.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Kent argues that even if the Court finds that the covenants are enforceable, GAO is estopped from litigating a breach of noncompetition and non-solicitation clauses in the contract. To prevail on a claim for breach of noncompetition and non-solicitation clauses, the injured party must show (1) the existence of an enforceable covenant; (2) nonperformance and/or conduct amounting to a breach of the covenant; and (3) damages resulting from the breach.\n   <em>\n    Life Care Ctrs. of Am. v.

Mr. Kent points to a case GAO brought against a former employee claiming breach of noncompetition and non-solicitation clauses of the contract.

On the testimony presented in trial, the Tennessee Court of Appeals determined that GAO could not prove lost profits because GAO anticipated the attrition of clients anytime a representative moved to a different employer, even without a breach of contract, and its program agreements with customers were not binding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201678077\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Kent argues that this case bars the relitigation of whether GAO can establish damages, which means it cannot prevail on a claim of breach of a noncompetition contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The doctrine of issue preclusion bars litigation of previously decided issues in certain circumstances. The party seeking to assert issue preclusion to bar relitigation of an issue must show:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (1) the issue is identical to an issue actually litigated and necessarily adjudicated in the prior proceeding; (2) the party against whom estoppel was sought was a party to or was in privity with a party to the prior proceeding; (3) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior proceeding; and (4) the party against whom the doctrine is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues in the prior proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Villas at Highland Park Homeowners Ass'n, Inc. v.

GAO argues that the first prong of issue preclusion is not met. It argues that\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   did not raise an identical issue because the customers serviced by Patterson (based in Georgia and Tennessee) are materially different than those serviced by Kent (Colorado). ECF No. 46 at 4. GAO argues that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   was a factual finding based on circumstances unique to that case, and the Tennessee Court of Appeals did not hold that all lost\n   profits in the fundraising industry were incalculable. As support, GAO points to\n   <em>\n    Great American Opportunities Inc. v. Cherrydale Fundraising, LLC\n   </em>\n   , where a Delaware Chancery Court awarded damages to Great American based on the value of revenue generated by their former employees for Cherrydale's tortious interference with Great American employees' restrictive covenants.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20338219\">\n    2010 WL 338219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *27 (Del.

Thus, the question of whether the issues are identical turns on whether the differences in customers and region that GAO highlights are relevant considering the elements it must prove to prevail on its breach of contract claim. I find that the specific customers and circumstances are relevant to proving damages, and that the issue of damages here is not identical to the issue GAO litigated in\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, GAO is not estopped from bringing a claim for breach of a noncompetition contract against Mr. Kent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In sum, because the enforceability of the noncompetition and non-solicitation provisions, \u00b6 4(a) and \u00b6 4(b), depend on a dispute of material fact, the existence of trade secrets, I deny both plaintiff and defendant's motions for summary judgment on Count Three, Breach of Contract, and Count Five, Breach of Contract - Non-Solicitation and Non-Interference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

This conduct also is the basis of GAO's breach of contract claim - that Mr. Kent is soliciting its customers and accounts in Colorado in violation of his 2002 Employment Agreement which requires he not do so for two years following his resignation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b658-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Colorado Court of Appeals has held that a claim for tortious interference with business relationships was barred by the economic loss rule.\n   <em>\n    Parr v.

App. 2009) (holding that the economic loss rule barred a claim under Colorado's stolen property statute as there was no indication that the stolen property statute was intended to expand contractual remedies). At issue is whether the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) and the Colorado Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA) were intended to provide extra-contractual remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Mr. Kent argues that the duty of confidentiality and nondisclosure of trade secrets contained in the Employment Agreement is identical to the duty imposed by the Colorado Uniform Trade Secrets Act and the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act. Turning first to the CUTSA, the statute states that \"this article does not affect...contractual remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%207-74-108\">\n    Colo.

Utah Feb. 25, 2008) (finding similar language in the Utah Uniform Trade Secrets Act to permit a plaintiff to simultaneously pursue a statutory trade secret misappropriation claim and a breach of contract claim). I agree with the reasoning in these cases and find that GAO's claim under the CUTSA is not barred by the economic loss rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   GAO argues that in drafting the DTSA, Congress expressed an intent to model it after state statutes that follow the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. A House Report accompanying the referral of the bill that became Defend Trade Secrets Act suggests an intent to model the DTSA after similar state statutes. H.R. Rep. No. 114-529, at 2-5, 12-14 (2016) (\"[t]he Act's definition of misappropriation is modeled on the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, versions of which have been adopted by 48 states.\"). Since the DTSA was enacted, some courts have applied similar reasoning and standards in the application of the DTSA as in the application of similar state statutes that follow the Uniform Trade Secret Act.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brand Energy &amp; Infrastructure Servs. v. Irex Contr.

LEXIS 43497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *16-17 (\"It is clear that Congress borrowed heavily from the UTSA and the states' trade secrets laws in drafting many (if not most) provisions of the DTSA. The enactment of the DTSA was not a response to an inherent inadequacy in the states' trade secrets laws. Rather,...Congress intended the DTSA to apply in substantially the same way as the states' trade secrets laws, but with a much broader geographic and jurisdictional reach.\") (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Therefore, there is no reason to think that the DTSA was not intended to provide extra-contractual remedies where the CUTSA was intended to provide extra-contractual remedies. Accordingly, I find that the economic loss rule does not preclude statutory claims under either the DTSA and CUTSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiff argues that there remains no genuine dispute of material fact with regard to the CUTSA and DTSA claims so that summary judgment should be granted. ECF No. 46 at 4. However, Mr. Kent argues that the information at issue is not a trade secret, and therefore there was no violation of CUTSA and DTSA. I conclude that there remain genuine disputes over whether any information at issue is protected by trade secret law, and whether any information, if a trade secret, was ever misappropriated by Mr. Kent. Accordingly, I deny both plaintiff and defendant's motions for summary judgment on Counts One and Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the Court\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   1.

The motion is granted as to Court Four but is otherwise denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    It's unclear why Count Five is not included in Count Three and how it is distinct from it. Nonetheless, in analyzing the claims, I will list them separately as plaintiff has done.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Both parties use Colorado law to analyze whether the economic loss rule precludes any claims. This makes sense to me as the contract invokes Tennessee law only as to the interpretation and enforcement of the contract. The choice of law clause then shouldn't apply to an issue of whether the economic loss rule would preclude a claim that does not arise from the contract, like a tort or statutory claim, altogether.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
