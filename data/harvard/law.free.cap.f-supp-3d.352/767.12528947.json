In his sentencing memorandum, his attorney asserted that Anderson's role in the offense was minor, but conceded that he was a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines based upon prior felony convictions imposed by the State of Florida in 2002 and 2003. Specifically, Anderson had been convicted of battery upon a police officer and resisting or obstructing with violence in one case, and of aggravated assault, two counts of battery upon a police officer, and resisting or obstructing with violence in another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Sentencing Guidelines established a sentencing range of 262 to 327 months imprisonment, the trial court departed below the guidelines range and in December 2008 imposed a sentence of 210 months imprisonment, a term below the 20-year statutory maximum applicable to his offense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C).\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, Anderson was sentenced in 2008, three years after\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   was decided, at a time when the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory.

In particular, it relied upon\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   to support its holding that errors in applying sentencing enhancements are fundamental defects that constitute a miscarriage of justice where the sentence was imposed under pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   mandatory guidelines:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Thus, the misapplication of the sentencing guidelines, at least where (as here) the defendant was sentenced in the pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   era, represents a fundamental defect that constitutes a miscarriage of justice corrigible in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055185\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/719/583/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055185\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/719/583/\">\n    at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055185\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/719/583/\">\n    719 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   587-88 ). Second, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   noted that Sixth Circuit precedent has long permitted a sentencing challenge under \u00a7 2241 where the sentence imposed exceeds the statutory maximum.\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355560\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/591/\">\n    836 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   597 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Finally, the\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   Court flatly stated that \"... we reiterate that our decision addresses only a narrow subset of \u00a7 2241 petitions: (1) prisoners who were sentenced under the mandatory guidelines regime pre-[\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   ] ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 599-600. Therefore both the reasoning underlying the decision in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   and clear language in that opinion requires the conclusion that its precedent applies only to sentences imposed pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker.\n   </em>\n   While other panels of the Sixth Circuit may question the viability of the line drawn by the\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   panel, they have expressed only concern rather than conviction on this question, and have done so only in unpublished decisions. While the Sixth Circuit may decide to revisit the question in a future case,\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   itself is clear that only pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   sentences may be challenged in a \u00a7 2241 petition, and that conclusion binds this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Even if this were not so, Anderson's claims fail to satisfy other requirements of\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , and hence may not be pursued under \u00a7 2241.

In addition, the Sixth Circuit first states that the case need only be one of \"statutory interpretation,\"\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n    at 595,, but later states that the Supreme Court case must make clear that \"a previous conviction is not a predicate offense for a career-offender enhancement,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 600. Finally, the\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n    panel first indicates that the claim must be one that could not have been filed in an\n    <em>\n     initial\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 2255 motion,\n    <em>\n     Hill\n    </em>\n    at 595,, but later suggests that the issue must be one that could not have been raised in a\n    <em>\n     successive\n    </em>\n    motion under \u00a7 2255,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 560.
