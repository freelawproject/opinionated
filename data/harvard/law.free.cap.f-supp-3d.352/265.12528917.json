(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48, 52, 56, Dkt. No. 1.) Before the Court is Defendant's Fed. R. Civ.

No. 46.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. Count II, which alleges trade dress infringement, is well-pleaded and survives the motion. Count III, which alleges unjust enrichment, is legally insufficient and, therefore, dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff GeigTech, is a company founded by James Geiger. (Compl. \u00b6 7.) Geiger claims to be a pioneer in the field of \"home integration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He first installed window shades as an integrator in 1999. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) He started his own audio visual integration company called HeAVi LLC in 2003, selling and installing home theatres, lighting, and audio systems and motorized window shades. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In or about 2011, Geiger conceived and developed a concept for roller shades that Plaintiff describes as a \"new solution for the [ ] traditional methods of concealing screws, wires, and other hardware.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Plaintiff alleges that, generally, any screws, wires, and mounting hardware used to install roller shades are concealed by a ceiling pocket, valance, or fascia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Rather than concealing the mounting hardware, Geiger's concept \"involved exposed roller shades without any visible screws, wires, or unsightly hardware.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) This concept was ultimately developed and sold as the \"J Geiger Shading System.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff purports to have a protectable trade dress on the ornamental design of J Geiger's jamb bracket, center bracket, and end bracket, and has inserted pictures of each within the Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44, 45.) It describes its jamb bracket as \"pretty,\" \"simple,\" and \"Simply. Modern.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) The Complaint states that Plaintiff's \"pioneering signature look\" is represented by two types of brackets - a circular bracket and a U-shaped bracket - with \"floating\" couplers that connect two shades together. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). The pleading describes these brackets as \"clean circular element[s] that [are] integral and seamless with both the shade and the wall.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.) It further alleges that, \"Mr. Geiger's new hardware was elegant and distinct from traditional methods of window dress,\" and describes the design of its brackets as \"ornamental.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Plaintiff, sales of such shades increased year-over-year 286% from 2014-15, and 412% from 2015-16. However, they only increased 50% from 2016-17. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Absolute levels of sales are not alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff claims that, after it entered into a manufacturing sales agreement with Savant Systems, LLC, Defendant Lutron, a well-known provider of electronic shades, announced its Palladiom Shading System. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Defendant's shading system, Plaintiff alleges, incorporates jamb, center, and end brackets that infringe on the J Geiger jamb, center, and end bracket trade dress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 52, 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this lawsuit by filing a complaint, and Defendant has filed a motion to dismiss Counts II and III, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In other words, if a producer expends an enormous amount of resources in promoting its product, and as a result experiences success in selling that product, one could infer that the producer's efforts\n   in creating a link between that product and its origin were effective.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ergotron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20143903\">\n    1996 WL 143903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (\"The amount of sales may be indicative of whether or not a substantial portion of the purchasing public associates the trade dress with the source of the goods.\") That said, sales success alone cannot establish secondary meaning.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20143903\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Complaint states that, \"J Geiger began selling the J Geiger Shading System in 2014.
