Lane testified that Wang stated that he and Chan discussed work, the pharmaceutical industry, and investing, although Wang said that he did not talk with Chan about Merrimack or the drugs that Merrimack was developing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Text and telephone records admitted at trial confirmed Defendants' frequent communications with one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Merrimack\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Wang began working at Merrimack as the company's Senior Manager of Statistical Programming in December 2011. Ex. 4. His duties included developing statistical programs used to analyze datasets for Merrimack's drug studies. According to Wang's supervisor, Bruce Belanger, Wang was working in 2013 on the biometrics group for the NAPOLI-1 study, a Phase 3 study of the cancer drug MM-398.

As an \"overall survival trial,\" it was structured to measure how long patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer survived after the start of receiving treatment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517280\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/9/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517280\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/9/#p17\">\n    at 10:20-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . NAPOLI-1 was comprised of two experimental arms (one MM-398 monotherapy arm and one arm that combined MM-398 therapy with other drugs) and one control arm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517280\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/9/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517280\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/9/#p17\">\n    at 16:14-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

NAPOLI-1 was to be complete when the 305th participant died.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:2-4. At that time, Merrimack would stop the study and clean and analyze the data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:8-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Merrimack General Counsel Jeffrey Munsie emailed all Merrimack personnel on July 18, 2013, to say that while Merrimack would lift a previously imposed company\n   blackout period prohibiting employees from trading in Merrimack securities for most employees on July 22, certain Merrimack employees remained subject to a blackout based on their \"knowledge of material information that has not been disclosed publicly (for instance, clinical trial data, a potential financing or a potential collaboration).\" Ex. 10. Seven minutes later, Munsie sent an email to select Merrimack employees, including Wang, stating that they were subject to a continued \"material information blackout due to your\n   <em>\n    potential access to or knowledge of preliminary data from the MM-398 Phase 3 trial\n   </em>\n   . This blackout will last through the second full trading day after we issue a press release with the top-line data for the trial.\" Ex. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Laivins testified that he learned on August 28, 2013, that the NAPOLI-1 trial had reached its full enrollment goal of 405 participants. Laivins Tr. 9:19-25 [# 280]. That day, Merrimack issued a press release announcing this milestone, which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   Currently, there is no approved treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer after gemcitabine has failed, nor is there a clear consensus on the standard of care in this patient group. Limited data suggest that without effective treatment, these patients are expected to live only a few months once they have progressed on first line therapy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ex. 349. The press release also quoted Merrimack's Vice President and MM-398 Medical Director Eliel Bayever, who stated: \"To our knowledge this is one of the largest controlled studies ever conducted in this patient population, which has very few treatment options.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 7, Munsie sent an email to Merrimack employees stating that the company-imposed NAPOLI-1 material information blackout \"will end as of the end of the day today. However, please remember that the insider trading laws still apply, so you should not trade if you have any material non-public information.\" Ex. 11. When he testified at trial, Munsie explained that he sent this email because Merrimack \"no longer expected to receive [its NAPOLI-1] data in that fourth quarter of 2013 or even the first quarter of 2014 and that [it] only expected it to be in the second quarter of 2014.\" Munsie Tr. 32:1-6 [# 281]. Because the end date of this blackout had been extended far enough, Merrimack lifted the blackout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Munsie further testified that Merrimack publicly announced on the same date as the email that it now expected to receive NAPOLI-1 data in the second quarter of 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   NAPOLI-1's Statistical Analysis Plan, which set forth the protocols for the study, foreshadowed that, \"[i]n the course of data cleaning and statistical programming development, limited Merrimack clinical and biometrics personnel may view data for individual patients that could be unblinding due to the uniqueness of the visit schedules for each arm.\" Ex. 33 at 11-12. Bruce Belanger, who supervised the NAPOLI-1 biometrics group, explained that Wang's statistical programming work enabled him to view individual patient data, including enough to determine which treatment a patient received. Belanger Tr. 14:23-15:4, 19:15-17 [# 248].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Belanger testified as follows. Wang's role in the biometrics group was to supervise statistical programming. Belanger Tr. 7:14 [# 248]. As part of this role, Wang developed computer programs to analyze study data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:17-22. In the summer of 2013, the biometrics group had access to preliminary data from MM-398.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:10-21, 19:6-17, 57:22-58:11. As Belanger explained, Wang was working on developing\n   the statistical programs for analyzing this data, and this work provided him with access to the live data in November 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:8-10, 19:6-11. Before the biometrics group analyzed the data, Belanger testified, Wang was using the preliminary data exported out of NAPOLI-1's electronic data capture system to test the statistical programming software that he was developing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:20-17:2.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    In light of the standard for Rule 29 motions, this background section describes the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    When McKay testified, the court instructed the jury that the evidence of what Chan told McKay was only to be considered as to Chan.

When Chan later testified, he provided Wang an opportunity for cross-examination, thereby removing these Confrontation Clause issues. Nonetheless, in reviewing Defendants' Rule 29 motion, the court views the evidence as it stood at the close of the government's case. Therefore, the court considers this evidence only against Chan.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The court instructed the jury that Wang's statements to the FBI were only admissible against Wang, for the same reasons articulated\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    in note 2. Therefore, Wang's statements to Lane are considered only against Wang, and not against Chan.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    The evidence showed that in late November and early December 2013, Chan and Wang engaged in the first of several cash transactions.

The second is based on whether there were multiple conspiracies rather than a single one.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Which Studies Were Part of Conspiracy\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    As to the first theory, Defendants claim that while the indictment alleged Wang possessed material, nonpublic information about three different Merrimack drug studies, the evidence at trial pertained only to the latest of these studies, NAPOLI-1. Further, Defendants claim that the evidence showed Wang possessed material, nonpublic information no earlier than March 5, 2014. Defendants claim that a variance between the \"no later than November 2013\" conspiracy start alleged in the indictment and the March 2014 conspiracy start presented to the jury prejudiced Defendants by allowing the government to admit evidence that Wang made a series of cash withdrawals and gave this cash to Chan between November 2013 and February 2014. Defendants describe these transactions as \"the most damaging evidence at trial.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    It does appear that the government's evidence presented at trial varied somewhat from the indictment. The\n    <em>\n     Second Superseding Indictment\n    </em>\n    [# 185] referenced three different Merrimack drug candidates and studies. It alleged that \"[o]n or about November 26, 2013, Merrimack announced positive Phase 2 trial results for one of its candidates,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 13, that \"[o]n or about December 13, 2013, Merrimack announced positive Phase 1 trial results for another one of its drug candidates,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 14, and that \"[o]n or about May 1, 2014, Merrimack announced positive Phase 3 study results for a third drug candidate.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 15. It further alleged as part of the conspiracy that, \"[i]n his position as Director of Statistical Programming, Wang had access to a restricted database that collected clinical trial data, including but not limited to data related to the Merrimack November 26, December 13 and May 1 Announcements.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 16.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    These allegations in the indictment refer to three distinct Merrimack studies, although they omit the names of those studies. At trial, the government's evidence showed that the \"November 26 announcement\" referred to results from the Phase 2 study of a drug Merrimack was developing known as \"MM-121,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Ex. 15, that the \"December 13 announcement\" referred to clinical data from the Phase 1 study of another drug Merrimack was developing known as \"MM-302,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Ex. 350,\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    and that the \"May 1 announcement\" referred to the primary endpoint of overall survival in the NAPOLI-1 Phase 3 trial of MM-398,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Ex. 19. The government did not introduce any evidence at trial that Wang worked on or had material, nonpublic information from either the MM-121 or the MM-302 studies. Bruce Belanger, Wang's supervisor at Merrimack, also testified that Wang was not part of the MM-121 team.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Because the indictment alleged Wang possessed material, nonpublic information related to all three of these studies, but the evidence at trial showed Wang possessed material, nonpublic information related only to the NAPOLI-1 MM-398 study, the government's evidence varied from the indictment. Contrary to Defendants' assertions, however, this variance did not change the start date of the conspiracy. Defendants argue that the evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, was that Wang only obtained material, nonpublic information about MM-398 as of April 19, 2014, and no earlier than March 5, 2014. This is incorrect: Belanger testified that in November\n    2013, his biometrics group possessed live data from the MM-398 study, that Wang was part of this group and responsible for developing the statistical programs for analyzing the NAPOLI-1 data, and that Wang was working with this data. Belanger Tr. 14:8-10, 19:6-17, 57:22-58:11 [# 248]. The evidence at trial thus showed that Wang had access to material, nonpublic information concerning NAPOLI-1 data in November 2013.\n    <footnotemark>\n     14\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Based on Belanger's testimony, a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Wang possessed material, nonpublic information about the NAPOLI-1 study in November 2013. November 2013 was also when Wang's structured cash transactions began. Therefore, the government's evidence as to the\n    <em>\n     time period\n    </em>\n    of the conspiracy did not vary from the indictment, and did not affect whether evidence of the structured cash transactions would be admitted. Had Defendants sought to exclude evidence of the cash transactions simply on the grounds that they were \"uncharged, impermissibly prejudicial and outside the term and scope of the conspiracy,\" as Defendants contend they would have done, the court would have denied such a motion. These transactions were highly probative and within the scope of the charged conspiracy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Defendants argue that their defense strategy was premised on the notion that if they defeated the charge that Wang possessed material, nonpublic information pertaining to the MM-121 and MM-302 studies, this would defeat the financial transactions close in time to the November and December 2013 Merrimack public announcements. But Defendants cannot successfully show prejudice merely by showing \"they tailored their defense strategy at trial to their expectation that the government was obligated to prove the entire conspiracy as charged.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v. Mubayyid\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3836672\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/35/#p54\">\n     658 F.3d 35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 54 (1st Cir. 2011). \"Where, as here, the indictment alleges a conspiracy to commit multiple offenses, the conviction may be upheld as long as the evidence supports a conspiracy to commit any one of the offenses.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Defendants suggest that the variance from the indictment deprived them of the ability to challenge the admission of the evidence of the structured cash transactions. Because the indictment provided Defendants with adequate warning that the government was alleging a conspiracy starting no later than November 2013, however, it gave Defendants warning that the government could move to admit evidence of the structured cash transactions beginning that month. As described\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the start date alleged in the indictment was consistent with the evidence at trial. Thus, any variance did not prejudice Defendants'\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    ability to prepare to exclude this evidence, and did not prejudice their ability to move to sever or decide whether to testify.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the variance between the three Merrimack studies described in the indictment's conspiracy charge and the evidence at trial pertaining only to the MM-398 NAPOLI-1 study did not prejudice Defendants. \"[I]t is settled that the government need not recite all of its evidence in the indictment, nor is it limited at trial to the overt acts listed in the indictment.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

These factors include: \"(1) [the tipper's] access to information; (2) relationship between the tipper and the tippee; (3) timing of contact between the tipper and the tippee; (4) timing of the\n    trades; (5) pattern of the trades; and (6) attempts to conceal either the trades or the relationship between the tipper and the tippee.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136450\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/18/#p21\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136450\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/18/#p21\">\n     at 21-22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In contrast to the scenario presented in\n    <em>\n     Larrabee\n    </em>\n    , where the \"tipper\" disputed that he possessed material, nonpublic information, Chan concedes that he possessed such information as of August 21. Thus,\n    <em>\n     Larrabee\n    </em>\n    is not directly applicable to Count Three. However, some of the Larrabee factors still provide useful guidance in determining whether the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Wang, as the tippee, possessed material, nonpublic information regarding the 0011 study when he made the trades at issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Insofar as the Larrabee factors apply to this case, most weigh in favor of Defendants' conviction on Count Three. \"Access\" is not relevant here, as Chan concedes he possessed material, nonpublic information. The relationship between the tipper and tippee shows that Chan and Wang shared \"a personal, financial, and professional relationship,\" much like the tipper and tippee in\n    <em>\n     Larrabee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136450\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/18/#p21\">\n     240 F.3d at 22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Also, as in\n    <em>\n     Larrabee\n    </em>\n    , the evidence at trial showed that Chan attempted to conceal his relationship with Wang in his answers to the FINRA inquiry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Timing in this case is not as close as in\n    <em>\n     Larrabee\n    </em>\n    , where one minute after opening an account containing the material, nonpublic information, the tipper called the tippee and immediately thereafter, the tippee placed an order to purchase shares.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136450\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/18/#p21\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136450\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/18/#p21\">\n     at 23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, as Defendants highlight, a much longer period of time passed between Chan's receipt of access to the top-line 0011 results on August 21, his call with Wang on August 24, and Wang's purchases of Akebia shares beginning on August 28. Once again, however, the government in\n    <em>\n     Larrabee\n    </em>\n    was using the timing of events to prove that the\n    <em>\n     tipper\n    </em>\n    possessed material, nonpublic information. There, the close timing between one individual's opportunity to access such information, his communications with a second individual, and the second individual's purchase of stock soon thereafter provided strong circumstantial evidence that the first individual actually possessed material, nonpublic information. That was not in question here. Timing viewed in light of Wang's pattern of purchases supports the verdict on Count Three. Defendants ignore August 24, which is the critical date between August 21 and 28 when Chan and Wang communicated. Just four days after communicating with Chan, Wang started to place numerous large orders to purchase Akebia shares, to sell Akebia put options, and to purchase Akebia call options. He did this over the course of several days, culminating just before Akebia's September 8 press release announcing the positive results from the top-line data of the 0011 study. When an individual makes an uncharacteristically large investment in a stock soon after speaking with someone who possesses material, nonpublic information relating to that stock, this is strong circumstantial evidence that the investment was based on such information.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Larrabee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136450\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/18/#p21\">\n     240 F.3d at 23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Based on the foregoing, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Chan and Wang are guilty on Count Three.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    ii.\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency of the Evidence on Count Four\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    As to Count Four, Chan contends that there was insufficient evidence to show he possessed material, nonpublic information before making his August 19, 2015, purchase of $38,647.00 shares of Akebia stock. According to Chan, he only possessed material, nonpublic information as of August 21, 2015, at 3:10 p.m. The evidence at trial, however, was sufficient to\n    support a jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Chan possessed material, nonpublic information prior to his August 19 purchase. For one, Carriere's email to Hartman and Chan on August 19 at 8:03 p.m. contained information that the 0011 top-line results would show positive safety data. The evidence also showed Chan was working from home the night that this email was sent. Chan seems to argue that the fact that this email was sent at that time provided him only with the\n    <em>\n     opportunity\n    </em>\n    to access the information Carriere provided. While \"opportunity alone does not constitute proof of possession, opportunity in combination with circumstantial evidence of a well-timed and well-orchestrated sequence of events, culminating with successful stock trades, creates a compelling inference of possession....\"\n    <em>\n     Larrabee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11136450\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/18/#p21\">\n     240 F.3d at 21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Chan placed an order to purchase $38,647.00 of Akebia shares one hour and forty-three minutes after Carriere sent this email. That is sufficient to allow the jury to conclude Chan viewed the email and then made the trades. Even if Chan did not open his work email that night, however, the evidence at trial showed Chan had opened his work email as of 7:59 a.m. the next day, August 20, when he replied to an earlier email from Annis. Chan then placed an order on August 21 to purchase $49,456.00 of Akebia shares. At the very least, a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Chan possessed material, nonpublic information when he made this latter purchase of Akebia stock. This is sufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict on Count Four.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    iii.\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency of the Evidence on Count Two\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    As for Count Two, Defendants contend there was no evidence Wang possessed material, nonpublic information about the NAPOLI-1 trial before March 5, 2014, and only minimal evidence that he possessed such information prior to April 2014. Evidence at trial showed that Chan purchased Merrimack shares beginning in early August 2013 and continuing until the May 1, 2014, announcement. As discussed\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the evidence at trial was sufficient for the jury to conclude that Wang possessed material, nonpublic information starting in November 2013, that he continued to acquire further material, nonpublic information up until the days before the May 1 announcement, that he provided this information to Chan from November 2013 through April 2014, and that Chan purchased Merrimack shares based on that information. In particular, the evidence showed that, beginning roughly three hours and forty minutes after speaking with Wang on the phone on April 15, Chan placed his single largest order to purchase Merrimack stock. When that order expired, Chan continued to place these purchase orders until his April 21 order to purchase 32,522 shares was executed at a net cost of $145,708.55. Ex. 268. Soon thereafter, Merrimack issued its press release announcing the positive NAPOLI-1 results. In sum, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict on Count Two.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Rule 33 Motion\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Defendants also move for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, which permits a court to \"vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\" In considering the Rule 33 motion, the district court may \"weigh the evidence and evaluate the credibility of witnesses, but the remedy of a new trial is sparingly used, and then only where there would be a miscarriage of justice and where the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

There, Defendants urge the court \"to enter a judgment of acquittal as to the Merrimack Counts and order a new trial as to the Akebia Counts.\" Joint Motion 19 [# 266]. Defendants appear to argue that if the court were to agree that a judgment of acquittal is warranted on the counts involving Merrimack trades, then it could conclude that allowing the jury to hear the government's evidence on these counts may have prejudiced the jury's analysis of the counts involving Akebia trades. As set forth in the preceding sections, however, there is no basis for entering a judgment of acquittal on any of the counts charged. Accordingly, this argument for a new trial fails.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Defendants' Rule 33 motion presents an opportunity to address another argument Chan has raised throughout this prosecution. This argument, as reflected in Chan's trial testimony, is that Chan was able to obtain sufficient information through publicly available sources, combined with his own knowledge and expertise in the biotech industry, to determine that the NAPOLI-1 and the 0011 studies were going to show positive results for their respective drugs and companies even before Merrimack and Akebia issued the relevant press releases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Chan's testimony in support of this argument was as follows. Chan has a doctorate and other advanced degrees, and has had a successful career in the biotech industry, where he has worked since 1996. More than fifteen years ago, he became interested in trading in the stock market. Over the course of those fifteen years, he has invested almost exclusively in biotech stocks, because this is the industry he knows. When he wakes up in the morning, Chan peruses bioscience-related websites for news relating to pharmaceutical companies. Chan's process for deciding which companies to invest in is to (1) understand the science behind the drug in development; (2) review clinical data about that drug and information about any studies planned for the future through publicly available sources including the FDA and SEC websites as well as the pharmaceutical company's website; (3) track the history of the pharmaceutical company's stock; and (4) compare the drug in question to \"benchmark\" drugs with similar characteristics. Chan testified that he used this process to obtain and analyze the information that led him to make each of his purchases of Merrimack and Akebia shares at issue in this prosecution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    With respect to Merrimack, Chan testified that he began researching the company shortly after he learned Wang was working there. In the course of his research, he learned about MM-398. Chan had a high opinion of MM-398 because he had invested in a similar targeted chemotherapy drug in the past that had earned him a substantial return. Chan consulted with some of his other friends in the pharmaceutical industry, who did not work at Merrimack, to test his positive view of MM-398. Based on a July 2013 publication about the drug in the British Journal of Cancer, Chan knew that the life expectancy for the patient population in the NAPOLI-1 study was roughly three months, but that patients receiving MM-398 showed a median survival time of more than five months. When Merrimack announced on November 7, 2013, that the expected release date for top-line data from the NAPOLI-1 trial of MM-398 was moved from\n    the fourth quarter of 2013 or first quarter of 2014 to the second quarter of 2014, Chan suspected that patients were living longer than expected, and surmised this was because of MM-398.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    As for Akebia, Chan testified that he reviewed the safety data from the 0007 study of vadadustat in 2014 and concluded that safety concerns about the drug were inflated due to a reporting bias. Chan decided to begin purchasing Akebia shortly after he accepted a job there in late July 2015, and as soon as he could find a good time to buy. His confidence in vadadustat was bolstered by Akebia's 10-Q filing in early August 2015, which revealed that the company was planning a Phase 3 study of vadadustat for 2016. Chan also understood that his own hiring was a sign that Akebia was planning for a Phase 3 study and for vadadustat's success.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    All of this testimony from Chan as to how he decided to purchase the Merrimack and Akebia shares at issue was dependent upon the jury finding Chan to be credible. The jury's apparent finding that Chan was not credible was a reasonable one in light of the significant gaps and inconsistencies in Chan's testimony. Defendants have not shown any exceptional circumstances warranting court intrusion \"upon the jury function of credibility assessment.\"\n    <em>\n     Merlino\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5687290\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/22/#p29\">\n     592 F.3d at 32\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Even assuming, however, that Chan had been a credible witness as to his own independent appraisal of these drugs, the question is not whether Chan had the skills to make predictions about the drugs that turned out to be right. Rather, the question is whether the government has proven that Chan had material information that the market did not know at the time Chan made the trades at issue. Information is material if there is \"a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the 'total mix' of information made available.\"\n    <em>\n     Basic Inc. v.

With respect to Akebia, Chan traded\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    he received the email from Carriere confirming that this prediction was accurate, and when he knew from his preparation of the top-line data for presentation that the public would soon learn these positive safety results. With respect to Merrimack, Chan purchased a large number of Merrimack shares soon after Wang's biometrics team received data confirming the statistical significance of the increased lifespan for those in the study's combination experimental arm, and after Wang learned when this would be announced to the public. This information confirming Chan's predictions and notifying him of when these positive results would be announced to the public was material, as evidenced by the increase in share price and trading volume that followed both relevant press releases. Even taking Chan at his word, his defense does not hold water.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Defendants have not provided any other explanation for why they may be entitled to a new trial even if they are not entitled to a judgment of acquittal.
