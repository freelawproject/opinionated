Under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act (\"FOGRMA\"), an entity with an obligation to report who \"knowingly or willfully prepares, maintains, or submits false, inaccurate, or misleading reports\" faces potentially stiff civil penalties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201719\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case is an Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") challenge to an administrative penalty imposed under Section 1719(d)(1). The relevant facts are not in dispute. Over a 21-month period from April 2006 to December 2007, Statoil's predecessor-in-interest underreported the\n   amount of gas it sold, resulting in a net royalty underpayment to the Government of more than $370,000. Statoil stipulated during the administrative proceeding giving rise to this case that Statoil, in January 2011, \"knew the data\" in its reports \"w[ere] incorrect.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   For more than a year after January 2011, Statoil made several unfulfilled promises to correct its inaccurate reports. The Government informed Statoil in August 2011 that it could be penalized \"for knowing or willful failure to maintain accurate information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2012, because Statoil had not fulfilled its repeated commitments to correct the reports Statoil conceded were in error, ONRR assessed civil penalties of $406,350 against Statoil. The Government alleged that Statoil, by declining, without explanation or justification, to correct its admittedly erroneous reports on file with the Government for more than twelve months since January 2011, knowingly or willfully maintained inaccurate reports in violation of Section 1719(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Statoil now seeks a judicial ruling invalidating the Government's interpretation of Section 1719(d)(1) and the penalty. Statoil does not challenge the $370,000 underpayment claimed by the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court concludes that penalties under Section 1719(d)(1) were statutorily authorized and properly imposed. Consequently, the Court rejects Statoil's APA challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Statoil appears to offer four distinct arguments. First, Statoil contends that \"maintains\" in Section 1719(d)(1) refers only to regulated entities' internally kept records, not external reports that reporters have filed with ONRR. Second, Statoil argues that Section 1719(d)(1) covers only criminally punishable conduct and thus requires proof that the regulated entity intended to defraud the Government. Third, Statoil contends the Government's theory amounts to penalizing a reporter's failure to correct after notice from ONRR of errors in reports, supplanting the statutory role reserved for Sections 1719(a) and (b). Fourth, Statoil argues that it lacked \"fair notice\" that it could be penalized under Section 1719(d)(1) for maintaining inaccurate reports with ONRR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   None of these arguments avail Statoil. In short, its first and second theories ignore Section 1719(d)(1)'s plain language and FOGRMA's manifest purposes. The third argument is not properly before the Court because of Statoil's factual concessions. Statoil's fourth argument is waived and lacks merit. Accordingly, Statoil's Motion will be\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   and the Government's Cross-Motion will be\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    A. \"Maintains\" in Section 1719(d)(1) Encompasses Previously Submitted Reports Left on File with ONRR Without Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The seminal issue is whether, under Section 1719(d)(1), a reporter \"maintains\" reports it submits and leaves on file with ONRR for a prolonged period without amendment. Statoil contends that throughout FOGRMA \"maintains\" refers only to an entity's retention of its internal records. The Government contests this reading, arguing that the term \"maintains\" in Section 1719(d)(1) encompasses reports previously submitted to ONRR and left on file without amendment. The Court agrees with the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Initially, the parties dispute the level of deference owed to the Government's interpretation. The Government insists its interpretation should receive deference\n   under the\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   framework. Statoil counters that greater scrutiny is required. First, Statoil contends that the Government's utilization of authority broader than previously exercised under a mature statute like FOGRMA is suspect. Second, Statoil argues that it makes an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   challenge that should be reviewed without deference to the Government's interpretation. Third, Statoil argues that Section 1719(d)(1) is a hybrid statute,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a statute with both civil and criminal applications, WILLIAM N. ESKRIDGE JR., INTERPRETING LAW 334 (2016), that should be strictly construed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court concludes, for the reasons stated below, that Section 1719(d)(1) is clear and covers Statoil's relevant conduct.

They \"maintain\" the reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Statoil contests this interpretation. It urges that ONRR, not reporters, hosts the servers where reports are housed. So, according to Statoil, ONRR is in fact the entity that \"maintains\" submitted reports. This literal interpretation is unpersuasive. It stands to reason that two entities can \"maintain\" the same database in different respects. In any event, ONRR's hosting an electronic filing system does not establish that ONRR \"maintains\" reporters' reports on that system. A student \"maintains\" stellar grades, even though it is her school that stores the physical or electronic records of her grades. A teenager might \"maintain\" his car, even though his parents maintain the garage where it is parked. Similarly, a reporter that files with ONRR \"maintains,\" within the ordinary sense of the term, the reports, data, and other written information on ONRR's system that the reporter submits, even though ONRR hosts the system. Notably,\n   Statoil cites no provision indicating that ONRR has authority to alter sales and royalty reports submitted under FOGRMA, and the Court's review has disclosed no authority granted to ONRR to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Beyond the text of Section 1719(d)(1), FOGRMA offers strong contextual support for the Government's interpretation. \"[M]aintains\" in Section 1719(d)(1) refers to \"\n   <em>\n    reports\n   </em>\n   , notices,\n   <em>\n    affidavits\n   </em>\n   , records, data, or other written information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201719\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (emphasis added). \"Reports\" and \"affidavits\" are not the sorts of documents typically kept for internal purposes.

For instance, Interior must \"implement and maintain a royalty management system,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), and \"establish and maintain adequate programs providing for training\" of inspectors, accountants, and auditors,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1711(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This variation across FOGRMA demonstrates that Congress used \"maintain\" in various contexts but knew how to limit the term with regard to a regulated entity and its internal documents when it chose to do so. In contrast, Congress chose in Section 1719(d)(1) to list various externally-kept documents,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , affidavits, reports, among the grounds for a potential penalty. This choice is strong evidence favoring the Government's interpretation that \"maintains\" in that provision includes a reporter's reports submitted to ONRR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Statoil alternatively asks the Court to read into the verb sequence of \"prepares, maintains, and submits\" in Section 1719(d)(1). According to Statoil, because \"maintains\" is wedged between \"prepares\" and \"submits,\" \"maintains\" covers internal retention after preparation and before submission. This argument is unconvincing. Statoil cites no \"sequence\" canon and the Court has found none in its research. In everyday speech and writing, some verb sequences imply a strict order (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , shake and (then) bake; stop, drop, and (then) roll). But many do not (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , preserve, protect, and defend; \"form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence,\n   promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). Given the context surrounding the verb sequence, a non-sequential reading is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Statoil's interpretation of \"maintains\" does not comport with FOGRMA's manifest purpose and drafting history. Statoil agrees Section 1719(d)(1) penalties may be assessed against regulated entities that knowingly retain inaccurate internal records. For Section 1719(d)(1) to cover these regulated entities' internal information but not cover entities who knowingly keep inaccurate reports on file with ONRR would be incongruous. Both sets of information need to be accurate for ONRR to verify lessee data and ensure timely and accurate royalty accounting and collection. During FOGRMA's drafting, Congress expressed concern for the validity of information on file with the Government. Congress identified the \"fundamental problem with royalty accounting\" was the \"disarray\" of the Government's accounts, not lessees' records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. REP. NO. 97-859, at 15-16. Given Congress's concern for the state of the Government's accounts, it would be incomprehensible for it to impose the strictest sanction for reporters internal retention of inaccurate records while allowing only lighter sanctions for knowingly or willfully keeping inaccurate information on file with the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Statoil attempts to draw on legislative history to support its contention that Congress distinguished between internal and external record maintenance. Statoil cites language from the Senate Committee Report, stating that, with FOGRMA, Congress sought balance\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   between the need to deter violations ... and the need to avoid a situation in which exposure to very severe penalty liability for relatively minor or inadvertent violations of necessarily complex regulations becomes a major disincentive to produce oil or gas from lease sites on federal or Indian Land.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   S. REP. NO. 97-512, at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   This excerpt does not assist Statoil. It indicates that Congress did not wish to severely penalize \"inadvertent\" or \"relatively minor\" violations. In contrast, all violations of Section 1719(d)(1) are necessarily \"knowing[ ] or willful[ ],\" and thus not \"inadvertent.\" The quoted material also provides no guidance over what Congress deemed a \"relatively minor\" violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Observing that Sections 1719(d)(2) and (3) should be construed to penalize \"physical theft\" of oil and gas, Statoil contends that knowing maintenance of inaccurate information with ONRR is \"minor\" relative to the other conduct penalized by Section 1719(d). The Court disagrees. As demonstrated by the facts of Statoil's case, incorrect records on file with ONRR that understate a reporter's oil and gas sales result in artificially small royalties paid to the Government. This \"paper theft,\" as Statoil calls it, is a seminal part of what FOGRMA was designed to address. The so-called paper theft results in artificially low royalties paid to the Government, just as physical theft does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Moreover, knowingly maintaining inaccurate information with ONRR is not \"minor\" relative to conduct Statoil concedes\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   subject to Section 1719(d)(1),\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , knowing maintenance of inaccurate internal records. As noted, it would be incongruous to deem internal record maintenance a major violation worthy of sanction under Section 1719(d)(1) but, at the same time, deem the maintenance of inaccurate reports on file with ONRR, on which ONRR principally\n   relies for determination of royalties due, a minor violation. Both are likely to result in royalty underpayments to the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes Statoil \"maintained\" its inaccurate reports, within the meaning of Section 1719(d)(1), by submitting them to ONRR and leaving them on file for a prolonged period without amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Section 1719(d)(1) Does Not Require Proof of an \"Intent to Defraud\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Statoil contends that because Section 1719(d)(1) is a punitive provision incorporated by reference into Section 1720,\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   a criminal statute, Section 1719(d)(1) requires proof the reporter, lessee, or other regulated entity intended to defraud the Government. According to Statoil, Section 1719(d)(1) thus means the reporter must intend to deceive the Government and deprive it of royalties. Statoil contends, and the Government does not contest, that Statoil lacked such a malevolent mental state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Assuming, without deciding, that Section 1719(d)(1) should be interpreted with the stringency of a criminal statute, the Court is unpersuaded by Statoil's argument. In effect, Statoil requests the Court graft an extratextual, heightened mental state requirement onto Section 1719(d)(1). To the contrary, Section 1719(d)(1) is clear regarding the mental state required. Section 1719(d)(1) is not violated unless the reporter's conduct is done either \"knowingly or willfully.\" Neither of these mental state elements indicates, even in a criminal context, that the Government must prove intent to defraud. \"[T]he term 'knowingly' merely requires proof of knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense,\" unless \"the text of the statute dictates a different result.\"\n   <em>\n    Dixon v.

Under the Government's Interpretation, Sections 1719(a) and (b) Retain a Role Distinct from Section 1719(d)(1)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Statoil contends that the Government's interpretation allows ONRR to \"manufacture\" a \"knowing or willful\" violation and contravenes Section 1719's tiered penalty structure by using Section 1719(d)(1) to supplant Sections 1719(a) and (b)'s statutory roles. Contrary to Statoil's assertion, under the Government's interpretation, Sections 1719(a) and (b) retain their distinct statutory role from Section 1719(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As previously stated, under Section 1719(a), ONRR may impose a penalty of up to $500 for each day any statutory, regulatory, or lease-term violation continues if that violation is not corrected within 20 days \"after due notice of violation.\" Under Section 1719(b), the maximum daily penalty escalates to $5,000 after 40 days without correction. During the relevant time period and currently, \"due notice of violation\" under these provisions is transmitted by ONRR to regulated entities via a \"Notice of Noncompliance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201241.3\">\n    30 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - .4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Statoil characterizes the Government's interpretation as follows: once a reporter receives notice,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a communication from ONRR of a reporting inaccuracy, the reporter immediately \"knows\" its reports are inaccurate and is thus subject to Section 1719(d) penalties. As a result, according to Statoil, the Government's interpretation provides an unjustified shortcut around Sections 1719(a) and (b). These more lenient provisions, Statoil contends, were designed to afford regulated entities an opportunity to correct their errors after notice of a violation, a path the Government's\n   interpretation of Section 1719(d)(1) eliminates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Statoil's challenge is rejected. It is not properly before the Court. To raise its interpretative point, Statoil must hypothesize rulings and remove stipulated facts from the record. Statoil creates a strawman, namely, it attacks an agency ruling that a reporter \"knows\" its reports are inaccurate when the reporter receives from ONRR a notice alleging an error in a report filed by the reporter. No such agency ruling exists in this case. ONRR's February 2012 Notice of Civil Penalty to Statoil did not assert, and the IBLA never ruled, that notice of the agency's contention of a reporting error automatically establishes \"knowledge\" by the reporter of a false or inaccurate report. Indeed, the IBLA affirmatively ruled that although it was uncontested that Statoil received notice from ONRR, \"it remain[ed] to be determined whether ONRR can demonstrate that Statoil's failure to act was, in fact, knowing or willful.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor is such a rule necessary to sustain ONRR's penalty. The stipulated record\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   is that Hydro\"knew the data was incorrect\" as evidenced by its unfulfilled promises to correct its reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given this stipulation, the Court has no occasion to decide whether mere notice establishes knowledge. In sum, there is no agency ruling that \"notice\" automatically confers \"knowledge\" of that inaccuracy upon the reporter. Nor does the record require the Court to adopt such a rule to sustain ONRR's penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because there is no agency ruling that ONRR's notice automatically confers knowledge of a Section 1719(d)(1) violation, Statoil's attack is a mere strawman and it fails. Sections 1719(a) and (b) retain their distinct role from Section 1719(d). Section 1719(a) and (b) remain catch-all penalty provisions, penalizing all statutory, regulatory, and lease-term violations after receipt of a Notice of Noncompliance and an opportunity to cure, without regard to the regulated entity's mental state. Section 1719(d)(1) penalizes a narrow set of \"knowing or willful\" violations, which, as a matter of logic,\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   cannot be, and were not in\n   this case, established by receipt of a Notice of Noncompliance or mere notice from ONRR of a violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Statoil's \"Fair Notice\" Argument Is Waived and Lacks Merit in Any Event\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Statoil contends that it lacked requisite \"fair notice\" of its exposure to penalties under Section 1719(d)(1). According to Statoil, the Government concedes Statoil was the first entity penalized for knowingly or willfully maintaining incorrect reports with ONRR under Section 1719(d)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government contends Statoil's fair notice challenge is waived and that, in any event, Statoil had fair notice based on the text and application of Section 1719(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \"There are three related manifestations of the fair warning requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Statoil does not properly raise the doctrine before this Court.

Statoil was given adequate notice of exposure to this sanction. The Government's interpretation of \"maintains\" comports with the term's ordinary meaning and reflects FOGRMA's manifest purposes of requiring accurate reporting of product sales, informed calculations of royalties due to the Government, and timely collection of those royalties. Section 1719(d)(1)'s text makes it reasonably clear that it does not include an intent to defraud element. Statoil was penalized under Section 1719(d)(1) because it acted knowingly, not because it merely received notice of a reporting violation.

The Notice of Penalty asserted that after Hydro (Statoil's predecessor) had a \"discussion with ACM\" on January 26, 2011, \"it became indisputable that [Hydro ] knew the data\" in its reports \"w[ere] incorrect.\" R. 20. As a result of Statoil's stipulation and decision to forgo any discovery, the exact contents of this \"discussion\" are not in the administrative record. What is clear from the Notice of Penalty, however, is that \"[e]ach time Hydro was contacted, it made an unfulfilled promise to correct the inaccurate [reports] or did not respond.\" R. 19. The existence of a \"discussion\" establishes in the uncontested record that Hydro did respond on January 26, 2011. Further, Hydro made unfulfilled promise in May and September 2011 to correct its inaccurate reports and admitted that its reports were inaccurate. Hydro stipulated it \"made an unfulfilled promise to correct the inaccurate [reports].\" R. 19. Such promises demonstrate knowledge of the inaccuracies beyond mere notice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"57\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    If the Government's position were that notice automatically confers knowledge, the Court would not sustain such a rule. As a matter of logic, notice only gives a reporter knowledge that the Government believes the reporter's information on file is inaccurate. The reporter nevertheless may have good faith reasons to believe in the accuracy of its reports. Or the reporter may simply not have formed an opinion as to whether Government's view on its reported information is correct. For instance, in this case, knowledge is demonstrated and (and stipulated to) by a promise from the reporter to correct its inaccurate reports after conceding the need for correction, and refusal, without explanation, to do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"58\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Answer [Doc. # 22], \u00b6 38.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"59\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    Statoil did not expressly waive application of the rule of lenity because the rule is one \"of statutory construction whose purpose is to help give authoritative meaning to statutory language.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
