(Second Am. Compl. (\"SAC\") \u00b6 13.) In April 2016, he was promoted to Deputy Commissioner of that Division. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In September or October 2016, the New York City DOI asked the plaintiff to release ten DOC personnel for assignment to the DOI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) The plaintiff refused. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 23, 2017, the plaintiff assumed responsibility for the DOC Intelligence Bureau. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.) The Intelligence Bureau is a division of the DOC that, among other things, gathers intelligence in order to prevent contraband from coming into New York City detention facilities and re-arrests inmates for crimes committed while in custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 25, 2017, the plaintiff was put in charge of the Analytical Intelligence Division.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) This division was formed to investigate prisoner malfeasance by monitoring prisoners' telephone calls and social media websites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) The Analytical Intelligence Division was formed on January 9, 2017, about a month and a half before the plaintiff took command. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under the DOC's rules and regulations, the Analytical Intelligence Division was prohibited from listening to certain inmate calls, including when the inmate was speaking to the inmate's attorney, physician, or clergy member. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) The defendants claim that the Analytical Intelligence Division was prohibited by Mayor's Executive Order 16 from listening to calls between inmates and DOI investigators. (Defs.' Mem. at 5-6). The plaintiff asserts that monitoring calls between inmates and DOI investigators was permissible. (SAC \u00b6 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 9, 2017, members of the DOI learned that the Analytical Intelligence Division had been listening to telephone calls between an inmate and a DOI investigator and that Analytical Intelligence Division personnel had continued listening to the calls even after learning of the connection to an investigation by the DOI. (Defs.' Ex. A, at 3.) The plaintiff claims that the Analytical Intelligence Division was not under his control at the time these calls were placed and monitored. (SAC \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The calls in question took place between January 9, 2017, and February 7, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) During that time, the Analytical Intelligence Division was managed by Executive Agency Counsel Douglas Ziegler and Assistant Commissioner Keith Taylor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) On February 7, 2017, Mr. Ziegler informed the Commissioner of the DOC -- referred to only as \"DOC Commissioner Ponte\" in the Second Amended Complaint -- that there had been some \"suspicious\" inmate phone calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) The plaintiff claims that Commissioner Ponte then asked the plaintiff to review and \"vet\" the suspicious phone calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff went to a trailer on Rikers Island where Analytical Intelligence Division personnel conducted operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) The plaintiff was briefed by unnamed Analytical Intelligence Division officers on the suspicious phone calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) The Analytical Intelligence Division personnel told the plaintiff that the calls were \"secured,\" saved to disks, and that the conversations were \"problematic.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.) The plaintiff alleges that he then \"reinstructed\" the Analytical Intelligence Division personnel to secure the disk that held the telephone conversations, and that he subsequently asked other investigators from the Investigation Division to listen to the calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.) The plaintiff claims he did this to determine whether the calls were \"highly suspicious.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) On March 10 or 14, 2017, one Investigation Division investigator reported that the calls were \"questionable but overall not problematic,\" and another investigator said that \"there was nothing there.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 8, 2017, the DOI notified the plaintiff of a pending investigation concerning the improper personal use of City vehicles by the DOC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) This was not the first time questions were raised about the plaintiff's personal use of City vehicles. The plaintiff had previously been interviewed in late 2016 by defendant Sculco, the Inspector General of the DOI, concerning the DOC policy regarding the personal use of City vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.) On March 13, 2017, the DOI again questioned the plaintiff about personal use of City vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On March 16, 2017, pursuant to an investigation into the phone calls that the Analytical Intelligence Division recorded between prisoners and DOI agents, the DOI raided the Analytical Intelligence Division trailer on Rikers Island and confiscated computers, cell phones, and investigative files. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.) The DOI interviewed the plaintiff about the phone monitoring the next day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) At that interview, defendants Sculco, Carroll, and Cronin asserted that the plaintiff violated Mayor's Executive Order 16 and the City Charter, and that the plaintiff violated, obstructed, and interfered with a DOI investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The plaintiff claims that within a week or two of that meeting he went to the Bronx County District Attorney's Office, Public Integrity Unit, and informed them of the monitored telephone calls and his discussions regarding personal use of City vehicles, among other things.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) The plaintiff also alleges that he, along with Commissioner Ponte, Brenda Cook, and Director Antonio Cruz, met with New York City Corporation Counsel Zachary Carter regarding DOI's accusation that the plaintiff and DOC violated Mayor's Executive Order 16 and the City Charter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A few weeks later, on May 5, 2017, defendant Mark Peters, the Commissioner of the New York City DOI, sent a letter to the Mayor (the \"Peters Letter\"), which stated the findings of the investigation \"into multiple violations of Mayor's Executive Order 16 ... by members of the New York City [DOC].\" (Defs.' Ex. A.) That letter stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   DOI has determined that on multiple dates between January 2017 and March 2017, members of DOC staff inappropriately monitored telephone calls between\n   a DOI investigator and a DOC inmate that was cooperating with a DOI investigation. This monitoring violated [Mayor's Executive Order] 16, the New York City Charter, and the Rules of the City of New York, potentially compromised an ongoing criminal investigation, and jeopardized the safety of DOI investigators and inmate cooperators.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter also recommended that the plaintiff's employment be terminated based on his failure to demonstrate sound judgment for his role in the telephone monitoring. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; SAC \u00b6 91.) Within a week of the Peters Letter being sent, the plaintiff was terminated from his position as Deputy Commissioner of the Investigations Division of DOC. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 103, 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff alleges that on May 8, 2017, he was shown a \"different version\" of the Peters Letter from the one that was sent to the Mayor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) The plaintiff alleges that the version he was shown was \"a different version with more false allegations, misrepresentations and inconsistences in fact and law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The plaintiff asserts that this version of the letter was distributed to various newspapers in New York City and certain other public media. (Id. \u00b6 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiff brings claims for retaliation in response to his exercise of his right to free speech, deprivation of a liberty interest without due process, and defamation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defendants argue that the plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim must be dismissed because the plaintiff's speech is not protected by the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution by state officials is actionable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, courts have routinely applied the absolute and qualified privileges in similar situations where the allegedly libelous reports were shared with the public.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919485\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/59/301/\">\n    874 N.Y.S.2d at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a DOI report -- which was shared with the media -- was covered by at least a qualified privilege);\n   <em>\n    Firth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"424868\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/12/907/\">\n    785 N.Y.S.2d at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an author of a report was protected by absolute privilege even though the report was published on the internet).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Therefore, the plaintiff's defamation claim based on the Peters Letter is barred by an absolute or qualified privilege and is\n   <strong>\n    dismissed with prejudice.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The defendants argue that the plaintiff's defamation claim regarding the \"other version\" of the Peters Letter should be dismissed because the plaintiff fails to define with specificity what statements were defamatory. The plaintiff's entire description of the \"other version\" of the Peters Letter is that it made \"more false allegations, misrepresentations and inconsistencies in fact and law\" than the original letter.

(SAC \u00b6 87.) This includes his allegations that: the investigation into the plaintiff was designed to cover up DOI incompetence, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 82), the DOI was misusing public funds, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 84), certain officials were using their public office for personal vendettas, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 86), and he refused to release ten DOC personnel for assignment to the DOI, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 16-17).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The defendants include two exhibits with their motion to dismiss: the Peters Letter, (Defs.' Ex. A), and Mayor's Executive Order 16 and amendments to that Executive Order, (Defs.' Ex. B). The plaintiff specifically refers to the Peters Letter and the Mayor's Executive Order in the Second Amended Complaint. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 45-51, 91-103.) Therefore, the Court considers both the letter and the Executive Order on this motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The plaintiff includes affidavits and exhibits with his opposition papers. The plaintiff includes three affidavits (Maria Aff.; Pl.'s Exs. 14-15), exhibits reflecting correspondence between counsel in this case, (Pl.'s Exs. 1-3), the Peters Letter and a Memorandum of Understanding between the DOI and the DOC, (Pl.'s Ex. 4), and nine exhibits of news articles, (Pl.'s Exs. 5-13). The Peters Letter and Memorandum of Understanding are incorporated by reference in the Complaint. Both parties assert that the news articles may be considered. However, the affidavits and exhibits reflecting correspondence between counsel are plainly improper at this stage of the proceedings and will not be considered.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    In Count I of the Second Amended Complaint, the plaintiff does not specifically allege that he is bringing a claim under the First Amendment or Article I \u00a7 8 of the New York State Constitution. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 106-21.) However, the plaintiff claims that he \"spoke of matters of public concern and safety,\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 107), and that he was \"terminated from his employment with DOC because of his speech,\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 108).
