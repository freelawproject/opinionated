Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:33-27(a)(2) violates its First Amendment rights and that the government should be enjoined from enforcing the ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Cross-motions for summary judgment are now before the Court. Oral argument on the motions was held September 19, 2018, and the record of that proceeding is incorporated here. For the reasons stated during oral argument, as well as those articulated below, the Court will grant Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, as the Court finds the State's BYOB advertising ban unconstitutional. Accordingly, the State Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment will be denied. The parties are directed to provide the Court with a proposed permanent injunction to reflect these proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   GJJM operates a nightlife destination called Stiletto (\"the Club\") adjacent to the Atlantic City boardwalk. The Club features non-alcoholic beverages and live entertainment and frequently hosts tourists, convention groups, and bachelor parties. As a service to its customers, GJJM permits its clientele to bring their own beer and wine (\"BYOB\") to consume at the Club; it does not allow customers consume liquor or mixed drinks in the Club. GJJM contends that the fear of prosecution under New Jersey's ban on BYOB advertising has prevented it from notifying its clients-either through radio, print, television, and online ads or by exterior or interior signage-that they are permitted to bring their own beer or wine to the Club.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    New Jersey Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Section 2C:33-27 of the New Jersey Statutes governs the consumption of alcohol at restaurants that do not have a license to sell alcoholic beverages. It provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   a. No person who owns or operates a restaurant, dining room or other public place where food or liquid refreshments are sold or served to the general public, and for which premises a license or permit authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption has not been issued:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) Shall allow the consumption of alcoholic beverages, other than wine or a malt alcoholic beverage, in a portion of the premises which is open to the public; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) Shall charge any admission fee or cover, corkage or service charge or advertise inside or outside of such premises that patrons may bring and consume their own wine or malt alcoholic beverages in a portion of the premises which is open to the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) Shall allow the consumption of wine or malt alcoholic beverages at times or by persons to whom the service or consumption or alcoholic beverages on licensed premises is prohibited by State or municipal law or regulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   c. A person who violates any provision of this act is a disorderly person, and the court, in addition to the sentence imposed for the disorderly person violation, may by its judgment bar the owner or operator from allowing consumption of wine or malt alcoholic beverages in his premises as authorized by this act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:33-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under the statute, patrons may bring their own beer and wine to the restaurant, but may not bring outside liquor. 2C:33-27(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The restaurant may not, however, advertise-either inside or outside the establishment-that patrons are permitted to bring their own alcoholic beverages. 2C:33-27 (a)(2). As a result, restaurants are prohibited from notifying customers that their establishments are BYOB, even though it is lawful for patrons to bring and consume their own beer or wine on the premises. Individuals who advertise that customers may BYOB to their restaurants face prosecution as disorderly persons. 2C:33-27(c). In addition, courts may prohibit individuals who violate the advertising ban from permitting the consumption of BYOB beverages at their restaurants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Nature of the Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   GJJM's Constitutional claim is governed by Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides a civil remedy against any person who, under color of state law, deprives another of rights protected by the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

The remainder of the test allows the government to regulate nonmisleading commercial speech concerning a lawful activity where: it asserts a substantial interest in regulating the speech; the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted; and the regulation is not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   , a state public utility commission completely banned promotional advertising by an electric utility. The Supreme Court determined that the expression regulated was commercial speech that should enjoy First Amendment protection to protect the fact that it informed society, and the utility company's message promoting the use of electricity was not misleading or illegal. Additionally, the government had a substantial interest in conserving energy and preserving a fair rate structure and the ban on promotional advertising directly advanced those interests. However, the Court found that the complete ban was not narrowly tailored to address the impact of whether the promotional advertising at issue had any impact on the government's interest in energy conservation. Therefore, the Court held that the commission's ban violated the First Amendment\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Subsequently, a unanimous Supreme Court ruled that a federal law prohibiting the disclosure of the alcohol content of beer on labels failed the\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   test's requirement that the regulation directly advance the government interest.\n   <em>\n    Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339650\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/476/\">\n    514 U.S. 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339650\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/476/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339650\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/476/\">\n    131 L.Ed.2d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). While federal law prohibited the disclosure of alcohol content on labels unless required by state law, disclosure of alcohol content in advertising applied only in 18 states that affirmatively prohibited it. Producers were permitted to disclose alcohol content in advertising in much of the country, presumably advancing competition for business based on higher alcohol content. The Court determined that curbing the advertising of alcohol content of beers would be a better way of coping with strength wars than regulating labels, so the regulation at issue did not directly advance the governmental interest asserted. The Court determined that the federal law prohibiting disclosing alcohol strength on labels was not sufficiently narrowly tailored to the government's goal; that is, the government could directly limit the alcohol content of beer instead.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339650\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/476/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   New Jersey's ban on BYOB advertising raises similar concerns. Justice Stevens,\n   writing for the plurality in\n   <em>\n    44 Liquormart\n   </em>\n   , cautioned that the\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson\n   </em>\n   test should be applied with \"special care,\" as blanket bans on commercial speech have historically been disfavored by the Court and, when unrelated to consumer protection, rarely survive constitutional review.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745611\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/484/#p501\">\n    517 U.S. at 500, 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745611\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/484/#p501\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Allowing BYOB advertising would concern a lawful activity and not be misleading. The State has neither asserted a substantial interest in regulating the speech at issue, nor shown that the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and is not more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This Court, in an Opinion dated December 21, 2017, granted Plaintiff a preliminary injunction maintaining the status quo. The Court required the parties continue to act as they had, namely, the Defendants would not enforce the statute and Plaintiff would not advertise before the Court determined, on the merits, whether the statute is unconstitutional. The parties have agreed that facts have not changed since this Court issued the preliminary injunction enjoining the State Defendants from taking any actions to enforce the statutory provisions that prohibit establishments from advertising that patrons may bring their own beverages to consume on the premises. The State has not identified a governmental interest for its statutory ban on BYOB advertising and has failed to present a different argument against this Court's determination at the preliminary injunction stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   There is no dispute that the State has an interest in regulating alcoholic beverages to protect the health, safety, and welfare of its people, or that the State has the authority to regulate\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     conduct\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   in the alcoholic beverage industry through its Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (\"ABC\") under the authority of the Attorney General. As noted during oral argument, BYOB establishments must comply with ABC regulations as authorized by the statute at issue, which provides that no owner or operator of a BYOB establishment \"[s]hall allow the consumption of wine or malt alcoholic beverages at times or by persons to whom the service or consumption or alcoholic beverages on licensed premises is prohibited by State or municipal law or regulation.\" N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:33-27(a)(3). A BYOB owner or operator who violates the regulations is a disorderly person and may be barred from operating the premises as a BYOB.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745611\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/484/#p501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2C:33-27(c). While the State may, and does, regulate conduct regarding alcoholic beverages, it has not shown that regulating the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     speech\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   concerning that\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     conduct\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   furthers a governmental interest sufficient to override the constitutional rights at stake in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For these reasons as well as those stated during the September 19, 2018 oral argument on the cross-motions for summary judgment, this Court finds the State's BYOB advertising ban - specifically, the language of the statute that reads \"or advertise outside or inside the premises\" - to be unconstitutional. Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   IT IS ORDERED this 19th day of November, 2018 that Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment [Doc. 44] is hereby\n   <em>\n    GRANTED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the State Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment [Doc. 50] is hereby\n   <em>\n    DENIED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The parties are directed to provide the Court with a proposed permanent injunction striking the language of the statute that reads, \"or advertise outside or inside the premises\" to reflect this Court's decisions.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    As discussed during oral argument, an establishment's BYOB status often is well-known and even highlighted by magazine dining guides and online crowd-sourced review forums.
