Orrick, United States District Judge\n   Sean and Brodie Copeland were intentionally struck and killed by a truck driven by \"ISIS soldier\" Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel (Bouhlel) in Nice France in July 2016 (Nice Attack). This case, brought by Kimberly Copeland, the widow of Sean Copeland and mother of Brodie Copeland, alleges that defendants Twitter, Inc., Google LLC, and Facebook, Inc. failed to prevent foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorist groups from using their social media platforms. Broadly, Copeland argues that defendants' social media platforms played an essential role in the rise of ISIS. Narrowly, her First Amended Complaint (FAC) alleges that defendants' social media sites and tools provided material support, resources, and services to ISIS and that those actions led to the deaths of [Missing Text].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The theories of direct liability under the Antiterrorism Act (ATA) asserted by Copeland are precluded by the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Fields v.

The same courts have also dismissed the indirect liability (aiding and abetting) claims after specifically considered the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) amendments to the ATA.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Siegel v.

I will follow\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   and apply the \"direct\" proximate cause standard under the ATA for direct liability. Under that standard, the allegations in the FAC cannot support proximate cause as a matter of law. I also agree with and follow the analyses of the courts identified above with respect to JASTA and aiding and abetting liability--the allegations in the FAC do not support aiding and abetting liability as a matter of law. Finally, the state law tort claims fail for a similar failure to allege facts supporting proximate cause. Because Copeland's counsel was not\n   able to identify facts that could be asserted to get around these adverse decisions, the motion to dismiss is GRANTED and plaintiff's claims are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The FAC details in depth the legislative history behind the passage of the Antiterrorism Act (ATA) in 1992 and its amendment following the September 11, 2001 attacks as well as its amendment in September 2015 as part of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA). FAC \u00b6\u00b6 1-7; 42-90. The FAC also discusses the rise of ISIS, its designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) and \"specially designated global terrorist\" (SDGT) group, and ISIS's use of defendants' social media platforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-32; 91-172. In general, Copeland alleges that defendants \"knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds, and attracting new recruits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 26, 27, 455. She alleges generally how ISIS uses defendants' platforms to recruit new members, fundraise, and \"spread its terror propaganda.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 162-345, 352-358, 393-397, 458-459, 462-466. She identifies many thousands of Twitter accounts used by ISIS, with many thousands of followers, as well as alleged accounts on the other services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-17, 456. She asserts that defendants profit from allowing ISIS to use their services, through ads placed on ISIS posts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 448-450, 473-496. She contends that because ISIS content is shown on defendants' sites with \"configured\" ads provided by defendants, defendants are \"content providers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 497-501.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Copeland alleges that prior to the Nice Attack, defendants had notice of ISIS's use of their platforms but \"refused to actively monitor\" those accounts and knowingly permitted ISIS to use their services, despite being able to identify and then deny services to ISIS-related users through content-neutral algorithms and methods to detect \"suspicious\" activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 459; 513-537. When defendants received complaints about ISIS's use of their platforms, they determined that such use did not violate their terms of service and/or allowed ISIS's use to continue when it did violate those terms of service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 460. Even where defendants blocked some ISIS-related accounts, they did not make substantial or sustained efforts to ensure ISIS did not reestablish accounts using new identities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 461.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As relevant to the terrorist attack at issue in this case, Copeland contends that ISIS used defendants' platforms to \"specifically threaten France that it would be attacked for participating in a coalition of nations against ISIS, to celebrate smaller attacks leading up to these major attacks, and to transform the operational leader of the Nice attack into a 'celebrity' among jihadi terrorists in the year leading up to the Nice attack via videos featuring his ISIS exploits in Syria, France and Belgium.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. \"ISIS also used Defendants' platforms to celebrate the Nice attack, to intensify the intimidation of the attacks, and to claim credit for the attacks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Copeland asserts that \"ISIS carried out a horrific terror attack in Nice, France, murdering 86 people, including Sean and Brodie Copeland.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 346. The purpose of Nice Attack was \"a) to intimidate and coerce the civilian populations of France, the United States, and other countries engaged in activities against ISIS; b) to influence the policies of these governments by intimidation and coercion; and c) to affect the conduct of these governments by mass\n   destruction, assassination, and kidnapping.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 347. A \"major component of the Nice Attack was the messaging disseminated by ISIS prior to, during, and after the events, in which ISIS stated its reasons for committing the terrorist attack against these countries' civilians.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 348. \"The Nice Attack involved extensive planning, recruiting, organization, training, preparation, coordination, and funding,\" and \"involved the use of Defendants' platforms, before and after the attack, to intensify the fear and intimidation that ISIS intended to inflict by this mass casualty attack.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 349-350.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Copeland states that a month before the Nice Attack, the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism (ICSVE) obtained a \"sophisticated and disturbing\" video produced by ISIS \"urging followers to use a truck loaded with explosives to attack crowds. The video warns that ISIS can no longer wait for western soldiers to attack them, with one scene depicting an ISIS 'soldier' preparing to run over civilians with an SUV.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 359. ISIS produced other forms of media also encouraging the use of vehicles as weapons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 360-366.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Relying on a CNN news article, Copeland alleges that the \"Nice Attack involved communication and coordination between attacker Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel and ISIS, as ISIS 'radicalized (Bouhlel) very quickly.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 367. She also asserts, relying in a Guardian news article, that \"[a]uthorities believe Bouhlel carefully plotted and planned his attack for up to a year with accomplices and ISIS operatives.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 368. \"Investigations in Bouhlel's life revealed a history of ISIS-related internet searches and communications with accomplices via cell phones and Defendants' services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 373. Again, relying on a news article from the Guardian, she alleges that in January 2015, following the Charlie Hedbo terrorist attacks in which 12 people died, \"Bouhlel sent a text message to an accomplice that read, 'I am not Charlie. I'm happy they have brought some of Allah's soldiers to finish the job.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 374.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 4, 2016, an accomplice \"sent Bouhlel a Facebook message that read, 'Load the truck with 2,000 tonnes of iron ... release the brakes my friend and I will watch.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 376. Starting in April 2016, plaintiff states that Bouhlel began searching the internet for topics regarding ISIS, \"radical Islam\" violence, and \"jihadist propaganda\" chants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 378-383.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 4, 2016, Bouhlel reserved a \"heavy\" truck for the week of France's Bastille Day celebrations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 384-385. Bouhlel picked up the truck on July 11, 2016, and took photographs of himself and two accomplices with it, and over the next few days drove the truck around the promenade in Nice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 389-392.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 14, 2016, Bouhlel drove to the promenade and just before the attack, sent \"two 'odious messages' that had been pre-recorded on his mobile phone. These messages are frequently used by ISIS, both for the operative to declare allegiance to ISIS, as well as for ISIS to use as propaganda and glorify the attacker.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 416. Around 10:30 p.m. Bouhlel carried out his attack, using the truck to intentionally hit and kill people gathered for the Bastille Day celebrations on the promenade.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 417-421. The truck came to a stop and Bouhlel began shooting through the windows of the truck and screaming Allahu Akbar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 422-423. Bouhlel was eventually killed by police near where the truck had come to a stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 425.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Two days after the attack, ISIS \"issued a statement claiming responsibility, describing Bouhlel as a 'soldier of the Islamic State.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 427-429. ISIS, through its radio station and publications, continued to claim credit for the attack and that Bouhlel\n   was a \"soldier of the Islamic State.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 430-433, 439. Copeland relies on the statements of French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve that this attack \" 'is a new type of attack. We are now confronted with individuals that are sensitive to the message of ISIS and are committed to extremely violent actions without necessarily being trained by them. Cazeneuve went on to explain, 'We are now facing individuals who are responding positively to the messages issued by the Islamic State without having had any special training and without having access to weapons that allow them to commit mass murder.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 434-435. And French Defense Minister commented, \"[c]learly, certain individuals, such as the driver of that truck, individually responded to this call for committing murder. Even if Daesh doesn't do the organizing, Daesh inspires a terrorist spirit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 440.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Because Bouhlel was radicalized in part through social media from defendants' platforms, plaintiff alleges that the Nice Attack was an act of \"international terrorism\" under the criminal laws of the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 540-548.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In\n    <em>\n     Taamneh\n    </em>\n    , Judge Chen concluded that even if these state law claim apply a lower, less demanding proximate cause standard than under the ATA, the materially similar allegations in that case failed to support proximate cause because allegations that the terrorist \"was radicalized through Defendants' social media networks, that allegation is entirely conclusory in nature and fails to establish proximate cause even under the more lenient standard.\"\n    <em>\n     Taamneh v.

In light of Copeland's failure to identify any facts that she could plead to overcome the decisions from this and other courts who have consistently rejected materially similar claims, the motion to dismiss is GRANTED without leave to amend and her claims are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-67\">\n     As to the underlying ATA criminal acts, Copeland did not oppose dismissal of her Third Cause of Action (\u00a7 2339A [provision of \"material support or resources\" by anyone \"knowing or intending that they are to be used in preparation for, or in carrying out\" terrorism] ) or her Sixth Cause of Action (\u00a7 2339C(c) [\"knowing concealment\" by persons and entities in the United States or U.S. nationals of the \"nature, location, source, ownership, or control of any material support or resources, or any funds or proceeds of such funds\"] ). She opposed dismissal of her Fourth Cause of Action under \u00a7 2339B (providing \"knowingly\" provided \"material support\"). However, because I find that proximate cause has not and, given the discussion at the hearing on this motion, cannot be plausibly pleaded under the ATA for direct liability, I do not need to reach whether for purposes of direct liability plaintiff has also adequately alleged violation of \u00a7 2339B. If I did reach the issue, I would reject it for the same reasons as the materially relevant allegations in were rejected in\n     <em>\n      Crosby v. Twitter, Inc.\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524602\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/303/564/\">\n      303 F.Supp.3d 564\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , 576-77 (E.D. Mich. 2018) (\"Because the defendants must 'knowingly' provide support with some discernible apprehension that it could be used to facilitate terrorism, the failure to allege facts to show knowledge of a foreseeable connection to terrorist acts is fatal to the material support claims, particularly where the only allegations of the amended complaint are that the defendants provided 'routine' services knowing only generally that some (unidentified) users could be affiliated with terrorism.\") (relying on\n     <em>\n      Hussein v.
