No. 28]. Defendant, Wilma Charlien Peavler, as the Special Administrator for the Estate of Christopher Allen Richter (\"Defendant Peavler\") has filed her Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 30] and Progressive has filed its Reply in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. No. 32]. Defendant, J &amp; S Exchange, Inc. (\"Defendant J &amp; S\"), has not filed any Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. General Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 7, 2014, non-party Ivan Fry (\"Fry\"), non-party Zach Vassar (\"Vassar\"), and decedent, Christopher Allen Richter (\"Richter\") were involved in a one-car accident which resulted in the death of Richter. Fry was driving a 2001 Dodge Dakota (\"the Dodge\") when the accident occurred. At the time of the accident, Fry was insured under Policy No. 902648618 (\"the Fry Policy\"), a personal policy of automobile insurance that had been issued by Progressive to Fry's mother, Cynthia Wolfkill. By coincidence, Defendant J &amp; S was also insured by Progressive on July 7, 2014, under Policy No. 08201121-2 (\"the J &amp; S Policy\"), a commercial policy of automobile insurance issued to Defendant J &amp; S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a result of the accident, Defendant Peavler filed suit against Fry and Defendant J &amp; S in Kay County, Oklahoma (\"the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation\" or \"the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   lawsuit\"). Defendant Peavler's claims against Defendant J &amp; S are based on the theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior.\n   </em>\n   Due to the allegations asserted in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation, Progressive filed this declaratory judgment action seeking a judicial determination it (1) will owe no more than $25,000 of indemnity coverage to Defendant Peavler under the Fry Policy in the event any verdict is entered against Defendant J &amp; S in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation based on the theory of vicarious or\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability; (2) owes no uninsured/underinsured (\"UM/UIM\") coverage to Defendant Peavler under the J &amp; S Policy; (3) owes no medical payments (\"medpay\") coverage to Defendant Peavler under the J &amp; S Policy; and (4) owes no duty to defend or indemnify Defendant J &amp; S or Fry under the\n   liability coverage provisions of the J &amp; S Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Relevant Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Progressive instituted this declaratory judgment action on June 16, 2017, seeking a declaratory judgment from this Court as to its rights and liabilities under the Fry Policy and the J &amp; S Policy. [Doc. No. 1.] Originally, Ivan Fry was also named as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, on October 11, 2017, Progressive filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal of Ivan Fry, which memorialized Fry's stipulation that he would be bound by the judicial determinations of this Court. [Doc. No. 15.] Defendant J &amp; S filed its Answer on August 17, 2017, [Doc. No. 10], and Defendant Peavler filed her Answer on September 5, 2017, [Doc. No. 13]. Neither Defendant J &amp; S nor Defendant Peavler asserted any affirmative defenses, counterclaims, or crossclaims. [Doc. Nos. 10 and 13.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 2, 2018, Progressive filed its Motion for Summary Judgment. [Doc. No. 28.] Defendant Peavler filed her Response on April 12, 2018, [Doc. No. 30] and Progressive filed its Reply on April 26, 2018, [Doc. No. 32]. Defendant J &amp; S filed no Response to Progressive's Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendant Peavler sought leave to file a supplemental Response on May 1, 2018, [Doc. No. 33], to which Progressive objected, [Doc. No. 40]. Defendant Peavler's request for leave to file a supplemental Response was denied by this Court by way of minute order on May 16, 2018. [Doc. No. 41.] As such, Progressive's Motion for Summary Judgment is fully briefed and before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties jointly sought a stay of remaining deadlines in this matter on May 31, 2018, [Doc. No. 43] on the grounds this Court's ruling on Progressive's Motion for Summary Judgment, even if it is not granted, may moot the need for further litigation of Progressive's declaratory judgment action. [Doc. No. 43.] The parties' request for a stay was granted by Order of this Court on June 1, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. No. 45.] Pursuant to the terms of that Order, in the event this Court's ruling on Progressive's Motion for Summary Judgment does not dispose of this matter in full, the parties are to file either a joint dismissal without prejudice or request a lift of the stay in this matter within fourteen (14) days of the entry of this Opinion and Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Undisputed Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 7, 2014, Fry was involved in a single-vehicle accident while the Dodge, which he - not Defendant J &amp; S - owned. At the time of the underlying accident, Richter was a passenger in the Dodge Fry was driving. Fry was driving Richter and Vassar to the J &amp; S job site on July 7, 2014, and at that time he had J &amp; S' tools in the Dodge. It is undisputed Fry and Richter were both employees of Defendant J &amp; S on July 7, 2014. As a result of the accident, Richter passed away. Defendant Peavler instituted suit against Fry and Defendant J &amp; S in which she demanded judgment in excess of $75,000. The\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   lawsuit alleges Richter's death was due to the negligence of Fry; that Fry was an employee of Defendant J &amp; S at the time of the underlying accident; that Fry was acting within the course and scope of his employment with Defendant J &amp; S at the time of the underlying accident; and that Defendant J &amp; S is vicariously liable for the negligence of Fry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Defendants dispute whether Fry was acting in the course and scope of his employment with Defendant J &amp; S at the time of the underlying accident. Defendant Peavler has alleged Richter was not acting in the course and scope of his employment with Defendant J &amp; S at the time of the underlying accident because Richter was merely commuting to the worksite and was not carrying out any work assignments or tasks. It is undisputed Defendant J &amp; S had workers' compensation coverage at the time of the underlying accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Progressive issued the Fry Policy to Cynthia Wolfkill, and Fry was identified as a driver and household resident on the Fry Policy at the time of the accident. The Fry Policy also identifies the Dodge on the Declarations Page as an insured auto and provides $25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident of liability coverage. It is undisputed that Fry is an insured under the Fry Policy and that $25,000 per person/$50,000 per accident of liability coverage is available to respond on Fry's behalf, in his individual capacity, to the claims asserted by Defendant Peavler in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Progressive issued the J &amp; S Policy to its named insured, J &amp; S Exchange, Inc., with effective dates of August 21, 2013, to August 21, 2014. The J &amp; S Policy did not identify the Dodge on the Declarations Page as an insured auto. The J &amp; S Policy provides UM/UIM, Liability, Hired Auto Liability, and Employer's Non-Owned Auto Liability coverage, all with a combined single limit of $1,000,000. The J &amp; S Policy also provides Medpay coverage in the amount of $5,000 per person. There is no dispute concerning the language set forth in the Fry Policy and the J &amp; S Policy, though the parties disagree on how that language should be interpreted and applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jurisdiction Over Progressive's Declaratory Judgment Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before the Court decides the issues presented by Progressive's Motion for Summary Judgment, it must address a jurisdictional issue first raised by Defendant Peavler in her Response to Progressive's Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendant Peavler points out that Defendant J &amp; S, in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation, filed a motion to dismiss her Petition, which was denied. Asserting Progressive is in privity with Defendant J &amp; S in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation, Defendant Peavler argues the judicial declaration Progressive seeks with respect to the liability coverage provided by the J &amp; S Policy \"is inconsistent with the ruling of the state court.\" [Doc. No. 30] at p.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant Peavler did not cite any authority in support of her argument that Progressive's request for a declaratory judgment would be \"inconsistent with the ruling of the state court,\" nor has she expressly challenged this Court's jurisdiction over Progressive's declaratory judgment action at any time in the instant case. However, the Court is aware that \"[a] judgment is void when a court enters it lacking subject matter jurisdiction or jurisdiction over the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Life Sav. and Loan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1625146\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/802/1200/#p1202\">\n    802 F.2d 1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1202 (10th Cir.1986) (citation omitted). Accordingly, in light of Defendant Peavler's suggestion that entry of judgment on Progressive's request for declaratory relief could conflict with a state court decision, the Court has elected to examine the propriety of its exercise of jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   One of the primary functions of the Declaratory Judgment Act is to provide an insurance company a forum in which it can have its liability under an insurance policy determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918001\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/570/1384/#p1386\">\n    570 F.2d 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1386 (10th Cir.1978). This Court may exercise its discretion when determining whether to retain jurisdiction over Progressive's request for declaratory relief.\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v.

The Tenth Circuit has provided clear guidance on what factors a federal court should consider when deciding whether it will exercise jurisdiction over a complaint for declaratory relief when there is companion, parallel state court litigation in process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   This circuit has provided trial courts in its bailiwick with substantial guidance on this score, instructing them to weigh two questions originally supplied by Professor Borchard: Will a declaration of rights, under the circumstances, serve to clarify or settle legal relations in issue? Will it terminate or afford relief from the uncertainty giving rise to the proceeding? If an affirmative answer can be had to both questions, the trial court should hear the case; if not, it should decline to do so.

Co. v. Runyon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"572962\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/53/1167/#p1169\">\n    53 F.3d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1169 (10th Cir. 1995) (citing\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   at 983 ). Defendant Peavler did not enter a copy of the state court order she referenced in the record. Nevertheless, this Court may take judicial notice \"of proceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal judicial system, if those proceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    St. Louis Baptist Temple, Inc. v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1444603\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/605/1169/#p1172\">\n    605 F.2d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1172 (10th Cir.1979). Further, this Court \"may utilize the doctrines underlying judicial notice in hearing a motion for summary judgment substantially as they would be utilized at trial,\" and it may do so\n   <em>\n    sua sponte.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1444603\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/605/1169/#p1172\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The order denying Defendant J &amp; S' motion to dismiss in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation, which was filed on January 16, 2018, does not reflect any ruling that would impact Progressive's request for a judicial determination of its rights and responsibilities under the liability coverage provided by the J &amp; S Policy. The order simply recognizes the general legal principle that a motion to dismiss \"should be granted when there appears, based on the allegations of the Petition taken in light of the law, that there is no possible way for relief to be granted.\" The order held that, \"if taken as true, [Peaverl's Petition] indicates a basis for a respondeat superior claim against the Defendant, J &amp; S Exchange, Inc.\" and \"based on the evidence in the case at this time, the issues of the Petition have not been foreclosed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The decision that Defendant Peavler's state court Petition should survive Defendant J &amp; S' motion to dismiss is not an adjudicative declaration of any fact or legal issue which would be relevant to the relief sought by Progressive in its declaratory judgment action. Upon review of the record in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation, there is no order or ruling which would create friction between the District Court of Kay County, State of Oklahoma, and any ruling this Court may enter concerning Progressive's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the only\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   factor implicated by Defendant Peavler dictates in favor of this Court's retention of jurisdiction over this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Further, while Defendant Peavler did not raise any of the other\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   factors, this Court has considered them in the context of the record. Upon consideration of the evidence, the Court holds a ruling would settle the controversy before it in this matter - the nature and extent of insurance coverage owed by Progressive, if any, for the underlying accident and ensuing\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation. A decision on Progressive's declaratory judgment action would also clarify the legal relationship among the parties in this matter. Specifically, the Court shall determine whether Defendant J &amp; S and Fry are considered insureds for purposes of the liability coverage provided by the J &amp; S Policy, and will also determine whether Defendant Peavler is an insured under the J &amp; S Policy for purposes of the UM/UIM and medpay coverages it provides. The first and second\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   factors, like the fourth, weigh in favor of this Court's exercise of jurisdiction over this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant Peavler has not presented any evidence that would suggest Progressive is using its declaratory judgment action \"for the purpose of 'procedural fencing' or 'to provide an arena for a race to res judicata'.\"\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   at 983. In fact, the parties' joint request for a stay of deadlines in this matter reflects the opposite. They have advised the Court if it finds issues of material fact which preclude entry of summary judgment, these issues will be decided in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. No. 43.] This demonstrates none of the parties are seeking to utilize this Court's determination of Progressive's request for declaratory relief to engage in procedural fencing, or obtain a ruling that can then be declared a\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   determination of some factual or legal issue in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation. Finally, there is no indication in the record, or by any party, that \"there is an alternative remedy which is better or more effective.\"\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   at 983. As such, the third\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of this Court's exercise of jurisdiction over this matter, and there is no evidence the fifth\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   factor is relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In light of the foregoing, it is appropriate for this Court to exercise jurisdiction over Progressive's declaratory judgment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Fry Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Fry Policy states, unambiguously, that \"[t]he limit of liability shown on the declarations page for liability coverage is the most we will pay regardless of the number of ... insured persons.\" The limit of liability shown on the declarations page of the Fry Policy is $25,000 per person. There is no question Fry is an insured under the Fry Policy. Defendant J &amp; S, however, falls within the definition of an \"insured person\" under the Fry Policy \"with respect only to vicarious liability for the acts or omissions\" of Fry. Progressive has not sought a judicial determination as to whether Defendant J &amp; S falls within the definition of an \"insured person.\" Rather, it only seeks a judicial determination that the limit of liability coverage available under the Fry Policy is $25,000 per person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant Peavler did not present any evidence in opposition to Progressive's request for a judicial determination that the maximum amount of liability coverage available under the Fry Policy - irrespective of whether just Fry, or both Fry and Defendant J &amp; S, are eventually deemed to\n   fall within the scope of the definition of an \"insured person\" - is $25,000. As such, upon review of the undisputed facts and the arguments presented, this Court declares the maximum limit of liability coverage available under the Fry Policy for the underlying accident and/or the claims presented by Defendant Peavler in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation is $25,000 per person, regardless of how many \"insured persons\" exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The \"reasonable expectations doctrine,\" the purpose of which is to reform the written terms of an insurance contract, is an affirmative defense.

Defendant Peavler attempts to apply the terms of the Employer's Non-Ownership Liability Endorsement to expand the UM/UIM coverage provided by the UM/UIM Coverage Endorsement of the J &amp; S Policy. The title of the Employer's Non-Ownership Liability Endorsement clearly reflects it is a \"Liability Endorsement.\" By express terms set forth in bold, capital letters, the Employer's Non-Ownership Liability Endorsement states \"\n   <strong>\n    CHANGES TO PART I - LIABILITY TO OTHERS\n   </strong>\n   \" and also specifically sets forth that \"\n   <strong>\n    ALL OTHER TERMS, LIMITS, AND PROVISIONS OF THE POLICY REMAIN UNCHANGED\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Defendant Peavler has not demonstrated any ambiguity exists in the J &amp; S Policy.

Co.\n   </em>\n   , 2012-0221,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204335467\">\n    2012 WL 4335467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (unpublished). The\n   <em>\n    Babin\n   </em>\n   Court's analysis and rejection of the exact argument\n   Defendant Peavler has made in an attempt to create UM/UIM coverage where none exists is instructive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   Since the named insured (Hub) is a corporation, the UM endorsement clearly indicates that in order for \"any person\" to be an insured, they must be occupying \"your insured auto\" or a \"temporary substitute auto.\" It is undisputed that Ms. Dick's personal vehicle was not a temporary substitute auto for Hub. Furthermore, the general definition section of Progressive's policy provides that \"\n   <strong>\n    your insured auto\n   </strong>\n   \" means \"[a]ny\n   <strong>\n    auto\n   </strong>\n   specifically described on the\n   <strong>\n    Declarations Page\n   </strong>\n   , unless\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   have asked\n   <strong>\n    us\n   </strong>\n   to delete that\n   <strong>\n    auto\n   </strong>\n   from the policy.\" The record reflects that Ms. Dick's personal vehicle was not listed or specifically described on the declarations page of the policy. Thus, Ms. Dick was not occupying an insured auto at the time of the accident and she is not considered an insured under the policy for UM purposes. The Progressive policy unambiguously limits UM coverage to those persons occupying vehicles specifically listed on the policy's declarations page.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   Ms. Dick contends, however, that Progressive's policy provides UM coverage due to another endorsement that modifies and expands the general definition of \"insured auto\" in a section titled \"\n   <strong>\n    EMPLOYERS' NON-OWNERSHIP LIABILITY ENDORSEMENT\n   </strong>\n   .\" We disagree with Ms. Dick's interpretation of that particular endorsement. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   The employer's non-ownership\n   <em>\n    liability\n   </em>\n   endorsement modifying the definition of an \"insured auto\" is expressly and unambiguously limited to Part 1 of the policy, which is the \"\n   <strong>\n    LIABILITY TO OTHERS\n   </strong>\n   \" section. This endorsement does not apply to the UM endorsement provisions in Progressive's policy. Accordingly, the UM endorsement section of Progressive's policy is not expanded beyond the general definition of \"insured auto,\" which requires that the vehicle be specifically described on the declarations page of the policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    Babin\n   </em>\n   at *3-4 (italics and bold emphasis in original, footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Similarly, there is no ambiguity in the J &amp; S Policy concerning whether Richter qualified as an \"insured\" for purposes of the UM/UIM coverage. The J &amp; S Policy unambiguously dictates he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Finally, Defendant Peavler has failed to demonstrate Oklahoma public policy requires the J &amp; S Policy to provide UM/UIM coverage for the death of Richter. Defendant Peavler acknowledges Oklahoma law permits an employer with a commercial automobile policy to limit UM/UIM coverage to company-owned vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham v. Travelers Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9333030\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/61/225/#p230\">\n    61 P.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 (Okla.2002) (\"CKE and Travelers are free to exclude employees operating their own vehicles from UM/UIM coverage through the method of limiting UM/UIM coverage to vehicles owned by the company. No public policy is violated by such a limitation.\") No published Oklahoma decision has abrogated, or limited the holding of\n   <em>\n    Graham.\n   </em>\n   Defendant Peavler suggests, however, that the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ball v. Wilshire Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6995183\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/717/\">\n    221 P.3d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Okla.2009) demonstrates that because Richter was not riding in a vehicle he owned, the facts of this matter may prompt the Oklahoma Supreme Court to revisit the holding of\n   <em>\n    Graham.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   As Progressive points out, the\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   Court commented on the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   decision, stating, \"the critical factor in upholding the UM coverage restriction appeared to be Graham's ownership of his own vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   at 728 (emphasis added). It is true Richter did not own the vehicle he was in\n   at the time of the underlying accident - Fry did. There is no evidence before the Court as to whether Richter was the owner of any vehicle; whether he had an opportunity to purchase UM/UIM coverage; whether he was an insured under any other policy of UM/UIM coverage at the time of the July 7, 2014, accident; or whether Defendant Peavler received UM/UIM benefits from any other insurer as a result of Richter's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, there is no evidence in the record to support Defendant Peavler's argument, and there is no issue of material fact present in regard to the issue of whether Oklahoma public policy requires the J &amp; S Policy to provide UM/UIM coverage for Richter's death - as a matter of law, it does not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Progressive owes no UM/UIM coverage to Defendant Peavler under the J &amp; S Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Medical Payments Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Defendant Peavler did not assert the \"reasonable expectations doctrine\" as an affirmative defense to Progressive's request for a judicial determination that it owes no medpay coverage under the J &amp; S Policy. As such, she has waived this affirmative defense just as she waived it with respect to Progressive's request for a judicial determination that it owes no UM/UIM coverage under the J &amp; S Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Even had Defendant Peavler asserted the \"reasonable expectations doctrine\" as an affirmative defense in her Answer, she has failed to demonstrate that doctrine requires Progressive to provide medpay coverage under the J &amp; S Policy. Defendant Peavler has presented no evidence regarding Defendant J &amp; S' expectations concerning the medpay coverage provided by the J &amp; S Policy. Further, just as the Employer's Non-Ownership Liability Endorsement does not serve to amend the provisions of the UM/UIM Coverage Endorsement, it does not serve to amend the provisions of the Medpay Coverage Endorsement. Accordingly, Progressive owes no medpay coverage to Defendant Peavler under the J &amp; S Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Liability Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Progressive has stipulated for purposes of its Motion for Summary Judgment that the Dodge, which is not listed on the Declarations Page of the J &amp; S Policy, is a \"non-owned\" auto as that term is defined by the Employer's Non-Ownership Liability Endorsement. The Employer's Non-Ownership Liability Endorsement - which only amends the PART I - LIABILITY TO OTHERS section of the J &amp; S Policy - specifically adds \"non-owned auto[s]\" to the definition of \"insured auto[s]\" for purposes of liability coverage, only. It is therefore\n   undisputed for purposes of Progressive's Motion for Summary Judgment that the Dodge Fry owned and was driving on July 7, 2014, falls within the definition of an \"insured auto\" under the liability coverage provided by the J &amp; S Policy. The Employer's Non-Ownership Liability Endorsement's definition of \"non-owned auto\" also contains the following language: \"The definition of\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   does not include the owner of a\n   <strong>\n    non-owned auto\n   </strong>\n   .\" Therefore, this Court finds that Fry does not fall within the definition of an \"insured\" for purposes of the liability coverage provided by the J &amp; S Policy. Defendant J &amp; S is the only entity and/or person who falls within the definition of an \"insured\" for purposes of the liability coverage provided by the J &amp; S Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The only liability claim Defendant Peavler has asserted against Defendant J &amp; S in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation is one of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior.\n   </em>\n   There is no allegation Defendant J &amp; S, itself, is responsible for the death of Richter under any direct theory of liability. Rather, Defendant Peavler has alleged Defendant J &amp; S is vicariously liable for the acts of Fry, who Defendant Peavler asserts was acting within the course and scope of his employment by Defendant J &amp; S at the time of the underlying accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Progressive acknowledges there are genuine issues of fact present as to whether Fry and/or Richter were acting within the course and scope of their employment at the time of the underlying accident. It further concedes that the presence of these genuine issues of fact are material to and preclude this Court from deciding the question of whether Exclusions 5 and/or 6 of the PART I - LIABILITY TO OTHERS coverage serve to exclude the liability coverage provided by the J &amp; S Policy. According to Progressive, however, even presuming the factual scenario presented by Defendant Peavler in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation exists - in which Fry was acting in the course and scope of his employment and Richter was not acting in the course and scope of his employment - this Court can determine as a matter of law that the liability coverage provided by the J &amp; S Policy is barred by Exclusion 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Exclusion 3 reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Under this scenario, no liability coverage would be available to Defendant J &amp; S because it would not be liable for Fry's negligence. Defendant Peavler neither addresses nor disputes this scenario. The Court agrees that in this factual scenario, no liability coverage would be owed under the J &amp; S Policy. If it is determined Fry was acting outside the course and scope of his employment with Defendant J &amp; S, any personal liability he may have for Richter's death is not covered by the J &amp; S Policy, as Fry is not an insured under that policy. Additionally, no coverage would be owed by Progressive under the J &amp; S Policy in this scenario, as no liability could legally attach to Defendant J &amp; S.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Progressive also addresses the possibility that Fry could be found to have been acting within the course and scope of his employment with Defendant J &amp; S, which is what Defendant Peavler maintains the facts will demonstrate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Progressive argues that if Fry was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the underlying accident, he is statutorily immune from civil liability under the Administrative Workers Compensation Act (the \"AWCA\"). In support of this position, Progressive relies upon various provisions of the AWCA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   The rights and remedies granted to an employee subject to the provisions of the Administrative Workers' Compensation Act shall be exclusive of all other rights and remedies of the employee, his legal representative, dependents, next of kin, or anyone else claiming rights to recovery on behalf of the employee against the employer, or any principal, officer, director, employee, stockholder, partner, or prime contractor of the employer on account of injury, illness, or death. Negligent acts of a co-employee may not be imputed to the employer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   85A O.S. \u00a7 5(A).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   The immunity from civil liability described in subsection A of this section shall apply regardless of whether the injured employee is denied compensation or deemed ineligible to receive compensation under this act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   85A O.S. \u00a7 5(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Progressive argues these provisions of the AWCA provide Fry and Defendant J\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   &amp; S statutory immunity from civil liability for Richter's death even if, as Defendant Peavler alleges, Richter was not acting within the course and scope of his employment with Defendant J &amp; S at the time of the underlying accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Peavler counters by arguing Fry and Defendant J &amp; S only enjoy the statutory immunity provided by the AWCA if Richter was acting within the course and scope of his employment when he was killed. According to Defendant Peavler, it is only if Richter was acting in the course and scope of his employment that he would be entitled to the rights and remedies provided by the AWCA. Defendant Peavler's position is that the exclusivity provisions of the AWCA - and the statutory immunity from civil liability it provides to Fry and Defendant J &amp; S - are only implicated if Richter was acting in the course and scope of his employment with Defendant J &amp; S when he was killed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Neither Progressive nor Defendant Peavler fully address the language of Exclusion 3 of PART I - LIABILITY TO OTHERS of the J &amp; S Policy in context with the relevant provisions of the AWCA and the facts of this matter. Exclusion 3 bars liability coverage for \"[a]ny obligation for which an insured or an insurer of that insured, even if one does not exist,\n   <strong>\n    may be\n   </strong>\n   held liable under workers' compensation ... law.\" (Emphasis added.) As noted above, Fry does not fall within the definition of an \"insured\" for purposes of Exclusion 3; only Defendant J &amp; S is considered an \"insured\" under the liability coverage provided by the J &amp; S Policy. As such, the issue of whether Exclusion 3 serves to bar liability coverage will depend on whether the claims asserted by Defendant Peavler in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation are an \"obligation\" for which Defendant J &amp; S \"\n   <strong>\n    may be\n   </strong>\n   held liable under worker's compensation ... law.\" (Emphasis added.) The key issue before the Court is whether Exclusion 3 requires a determination that Defendant J &amp; S was,\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   , \"liable under workers' compensation ... law\" for Richter's death. This Court holds no such determination is necessary, as the plain language of Exclusion 3 shows no such determination of fact is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The unambiguous language of the exclusion bars coverage for any \"obligation\" for which Defendant J &amp; S \"\n   <strong>\n    may be\n   </strong>\n   held liable under workers' compensation ... law.\" (Emphasis added.)

As a matter of law, there is no genuine issue of material fact present that precludes the Court from making this determination. This Court does not need to decide whether Richter was acting in the course and scope of his employment with Defendant J &amp; S at the time of the underlying accident, nor does it need to determine whether Defendant J &amp; S would have been liable under the AWCA if Defendant Peavler had chosen to submit a workers' compensation claim as a result of Richter's death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   It must only determine whether Defendant J &amp; S may have been liable under the AWCA if Defendant Peavler had chosen to pursue a workers' compensation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Oklahoma law demonstrates Defendant J &amp; S \"\n   <strong>\n    may be\n   </strong>\n   held liable under workers' compensation ... law\" for Richter's death. (Bold emphasis added.) It is true the general rule in Oklahoma is that \"an injury suffered by an employee in going to and returning from his regular place of work does not arise out of and in the course of his employment so as to be compensable under Workmen's Compensation Law, in the absence of an agreement or contract to the contrary.\"\n   <em>\n    Weatherbee Elec.

According to Defendant Peavler, the \"actual teaching\" of\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   is \"[a]n employee who has suffered 'any injury for which compensation is recoverable under the workers compensation act' is limited to the act and a fellow employee as well as\n   the employer is immune from civil suit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc.

She then cites to Oklahoma jurisprudence discussing the \"Grand Bargain\" of workers' compensation - a worker's relinquishment of the right to recover from his or her employer under a tort theory of negligence if he or she is injured on the job in exchange for the employer's guarantee of wage and medical benefits if the employee is injured in the course and scope of employment. See [Doc. No. 30] at pp.13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Defendant Peavler argues that Progressive's reliance on 85A O.S. \u00a7 5(c) in support of its position that the statutory immunity Fry and Defendant J &amp; S enjoy (which would demonstrate Defendant J &amp; S \"may be held liable under workers compensation ... law\" and Exclusion 3, therefore, applies) is an absurd interpretation of the statute which violates the \"Grand Bargain.\" Progressive's suggested interpretation of 85A O.S. \u00a7 5, says Defendant Peavler, would \"mean that if an employee does not qualify for compensation because his injuries do not arise out of and in the course of employment he nevertheless cannot sue his employer or co-employee in tort and is left without any remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 30] at p.16. Defendant Peavler proposes that the meaning of 85A O.S. \u00a7 5(c) is if \"the plaintiff has a colorable claim for compensation, beginning with the fact that the injury is work-related, but is somehow prevented from asserting his claim,\" it is only then the plaintiff's employer and/or co-employee are statutorily immune from civil liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant Peavler's interpretation of 85A O.S. \u00a7 5. The Court also finds Richter's death was, as she describes it, a \"colorable claim for compensation\" under the AWCA. This is not a factual determination Richter was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the underlying accident. It is a legal determination that the undisputed facts demonstrate, under Oklahoma law, Richter may have been acting in the course and scope of his employment. The Court also agrees with Defendant Peavler that\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this matter because the passengers in that claim had submitted workers' compensation claims and received workers' compensation benefits. This distinction, however, proves - under Kansas law - a sleeping passenger simply riding in a vehicle and receiving no pay for travel time may be determined to have been acting in the course and scope of his or her employment and have sustained a compensable injury.\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   at 421-422.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Defendant Peavler's decision to forego presentation of a workers' compensation claim does not result in the legal or factual conclusion Richter's death occurred outside the course and scope of his employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The mere fact that Defendant Peavler did not submit a worker's compensation claim as a result of Richter's death does not mean she had no valid worker's compensation claim. Fry's and Defendant J &amp; S' statutory civil immunity is not mooted by Defendant Peavler's choice not to seek recovery under the AWCA, nor does Defendant Peavler's choice remove this matter from the impact\n   of Exclusion 3. Regardless of whether Defendant Peavler elected to pursue a workers' compensation claim, the facts demonstrate Defendant J &amp;aS \"may be held liable under workers compensation ... law\" for Richter's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Oklahoma law demonstrates the undisputed facts upon which Defendant Peavler bases her claim that Fry was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the time of Richter's death are just as likely to support a determination Richter was acting in the course and scope of his employment when he was killed. Defendant Peavler maintains Fry was in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the underlying accident because Defendant J &amp; S had instructed him to transport Richter and Vassar to the worksite and because Fry's truck had Defendant J &amp; S' tools in it when the accident occurred. As noted above, the\n   <em>\n    Pina\n   </em>\n   Court relied on pre-AWCA authority in reaching its conclusion that Pina suffered a compensable injury while in the course and scope of his employment despite the statutory exclusion of travel to and from work from the definition of \"course and scope of employment.\" This same pre-AWCA authority demonstrates Richter's death was a \"\n   <em>\n    colorable\n   </em>\n   claim for compensation\" because the same facts Defendant Peavler argues support a finding Fry was acting in the course and scope of his employment may also demonstrate Richter was, at the time of this death, within in the course and scope of his employment\n   <em>\n    Helmerich &amp; Payne, Inc.\n   </em>\n   at 965 (upholding determination worker suffered compensable injury in the course and scope of employment when driving his own vehicle in which other workers rode as part of a carpool and in which a water cooler used at work was being carried, despite the undisputed evidence demonstrating \"[i]t was never definitely determined who owned or furnished the water container but it was not claimed by the employer that it did not belong to it\" and \"[t]here was no agreement by the employer to haul the employees or otherwise see that they reached their place of work or that they were returned from their work to their homes.\");\n   <em>\n    Ince\n   </em>\n   at 347 (reversing denial of workers' compensation benefits for employee who was killed while driving vehicle home from work where \"decedent was transporting an empty water can owned by decedent's employer, which can was used in carrying water from the home of the employee who transported the drilling crew to the drilling site where the water was drunk by members of the crew.\");\n   <em>\n    Haco\n   </em>\n   at 677 (Plaintiff, who was not an employee of Haco and was injured in a two-vehicle accident when his car and a vehicle being driven by an employee of Haco, obtained a verdict in his favor against Haco on a theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability for its employee-driver's negligence. Haco appealed the verdict, arguing its employee was not in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident and, as such, it could not be held vicariously liable for its employee's actions. The Oklahoma Supreme Court upheld the jury's verdict, finding the employee who was not paid for travel time was acting in the course and scope of his employment when driving a vehicle for purposes of carpooling to work with two other workers and carrying a water can which was used on the job site, stating \"We recognize as the general rule that a man's employment does not begin until he has reached the place of his employment, and does not continue after he has gone.

Not only was it anticipated that an employee's car would be used but under the facts a particular person (on the day in question this was Hughes) and his car was to carry the ice water.

Defendant Peavler's choice not to pursue workers' compensation benefits does not change this.

No. 30] at p.9. This distinction does not moot the rationale of these decisions which applies to this matter. The workers' compensation exclusions in the automobile liability policies at issue in those cases were not found ineffective because the employer had no workers' compensation insurance. Similarly, Exclusion 3 is not moot because Defendant Peavler chose not to present what this Court has determined, as a matter of law, was a \"\n   <em>\n    colorable\n   </em>\n   claim for compensation\" to the Workers' Compensation Commission. Unlike the employers in\n   <em>\n    Adame\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Colony II\n   </em>\n   , Defendant J &amp; S carried workers' compensation insurance. Defendant Peavler, therefore - unlike the employees in\n   <em>\n    Adame\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Colony II\n   </em>\n   - had the option of presenting a workers' compensation claim. In fact, if she wished to recover damages for Richter's death, she was required to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Workers' Compensation Commission is vested with \"the exclusive responsibility and duty to carry out the provisions of\" the AWCA. 85A O.S. \u00a7 19(A). It is only when an employer fails to carry workers' compensation insurance that an employee is permitted to \"maintain an action in the district court for damages ....\" 85A O.S. \u00a7 5(D). By statute, it is the Workers' Compensation Commission that has the\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   authority to determine whether Richter's death occurred in the course and scope of employment, thereby making it a compensable injury, unless the employer at issue has failed to obtain workers' compensation insurance. Defendant Peavler never invoked the authority of the Workers' Compensation Commission for purposes of determining whether Richter's death was compensable under the AWCA despite the fact Defendant J &amp; S had workers' compensation insurance. Instead, she made the decision not to submit a workers' compensation claim. This unilateral decision - just like an employer's decision not to carry workers' compensation insurance - does not serve to moot the impact and effect of Exclusion 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   If this Court were to hold Defendant Peavler's choice not to present what it has determined as a matter of law was a \"colorable claim for compensation\" to the exclusive authority of the Workers' Compensation Court negated the impact of Exclusion 3, it would be sanctioning her attempt to shift the burden of insuring employment-related injuries from workers' compensation insurers to automobile liability insurers. This would violate Oklahoma's clear public policy \"\n   <em>\n    reliev[ing]\n   </em>\n   insurers of any legal obligation to include in the standard motor vehicle liability policy a provision for indemnity against\n   <em>\n    employment-related\n   </em>\n   harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Deffenbaugh\n   </em>\n   at 86 (emphasis in original).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   47 O.S. \u00a7 7-324(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   This Court acknowledges it is possible, had Defendant Peavler presented a workers' compensation claim for Richter's death, it may have been ultimately determined Richter was not acting in the course and scope of his employment when he was killed. Many workers' compensation claims raise the issue of whether the injured employee was acting within the course and scope of employment when the injury occurred. For instance, the Oklahoma Supreme Court recently analyzed the issue of whether an employee who slipped and fell on an icy curb when walking from the\n   OSU/OKC parking lot to the building in which she worked had sustained a compensable injury under the AWCA.\n   <em>\n    Legarde-Bober v. Oklahoma State University\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775905\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/378/562/\">\n    378 P.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Okla.2016). The AWCA specifically excludes from the definition of \"course and scope of employment ... any injury occurring in a parking lot or other common area adjacent to an employer's place of business before the employee clocks in or otherwise begins work for the employer or after the employee clocks out or otherwise stops work for the employer.\" 85A O.S. \u00a7 2(13)(c). The Oklahoma Supreme Court found the employee had been in the course and scope of her employment as OSU/OKC had admitted the parking lot was on its premises.\n   <em>\n    Legarde-Bober\n   </em>\n   at 564-565.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, as discussed at length above, the\n   <em>\n    Pina\n   </em>\n   Court held the employee seeking workers' compensation benefits for an injury sustained in an accident that occurred while the employee was driving to the job site was acting within the course and scope of his employment under 85A O.S. \u00a7 2(13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   There are four enumerated exceptions from the definition of the term \"course and scope of employment\" under the AWCA. 85A O.S. \u00a7 2(13). Whether any given employee falls within those exceptions when injured, thereby justifying the denial of workers' compensation benefits, is an issue of fact over which the Workers' Compensation Court has exclusive jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Defendant Peavler's theory of liability, any employee whose right to recover workers' compensation benefits is dependent upon a factual determination of whether he or she was acting within the \"course and scope of employment\" as defined by the AWCA may simply avoid the exclusive jurisdiction of the Workers' Compensation Court by choosing not to pursue a workers' compensation claim and, instead, pursuing a tort case in district court against a co-employee or employer for recovery of damages. This violates the very \"Grand Bargain\" of workers' compensation Defendant Peavler described, and is an \"end-run\" around the statutory immunity the AWCA provides to employers and co-employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Defendant Peavler's\n   theory of insurance coverage, an injured employee can shift the burden of indemnification for work-related injuries from a workers' compensation insurer to an automobile liability insurer by simply choosing not to submit a workers' compensation claim. This violates Oklahoma's express public policy of \"\n   <em>\n    reliev[ing]\n   </em>\n   insurers of any legal obligation to include in the standard motor vehicle liability policy a provision for indemnity against\n   <em>\n    employment-related\n   </em>\n   harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Deffenbaugh\n   </em>\n   at 86 (emphasis in original).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   47 O.S. \u00a7 7-324(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Finally, this Court recognizes the two-year statute of limitations governing Defendant Peavler's workers' compensation claim expired on July 7, 2016. 85A O.S. \u00a7 69(A)(3). As Defendant Peavler acknowledges, the statutory immunity afforded to Fry and Defendant J &amp; S remains despite the expiration of the statute of limitations governing her workers' compensation claim. 85A O.S. \u00a7 5(D).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 30] at p. 16. Defendant J &amp; S, therefore, \"may be held liable under workers' compensation ... law\" even though the statute of limitations has expired; that law dictates Fry and Defendant J &amp; S would have statutory immunity over Defendant Peavler's workers' compensation claim, had she chosen to submit that claim (whether before or after the expiration of the 2-year statute of limitations) to the one tribunal that has exclusive authority over the question of whether Richter's death was a compensable injury under the AWCA - the Workers' Compensation Commission. As such, the expiration of the statute of limitations governing Defendant Peavler's workers' compensation claim does not serve as an impediment to this Court's determination that Exclusion 3 of the J &amp; S Policy bars liability coverage for the underlying accident and ensuing\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   For the reasons outlined above, Progressive's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in its entirety.\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   Progressive (1) owes no more than $25,000 of indemnity coverage to Defendant Peavler under the Fry Policy in the event any verdict is entered against Defendant J &amp; S in the\n   <em>\n    Peavler\n   </em>\n   litigation based on the theory of vicarious or\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   liability; (2) owes no uninsured/underinsured (\"UM/UIM\") coverage to Defendant Peavler under the J &amp; S Policy; (3) owes no medical payments (\"medpay\") coverage to Defendant Peavler under the J &amp; S Policy; and (4) owes no duty to defend or indemnify Defendant J &amp; S or Fry under the liability coverage provisions of the J &amp; S Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED this 7th day of November, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    The parties also jointly requested a stay of the Settlement Conference in this matter, which was granted.

(Bold and italics emphasis added by Defendant Peavler at [Doc. No. 30], p.7.) In\n    <em>\n     Deffenbaugh\n    </em>\n    , it was undisputed the injured employees and employee who caused the injury (during a one-car accident) were acting in the course and scope of their employment; at issue was whether the employee who caused the injury had waived the statutory immunity provided by the version of the statutory workers' compensation scheme in effect at that time by purchasing personal automobile liability insurance.\n    <em>\n     Deffenbaugh\n    </em>\n    at 85-86. The\n    <em>\n     Deffenbaugh\n    </em>\n    Court found no waiver of the statutory immunity had occurred. Defendant Peavler suggests this statement by Justice Wilson means an injured employee must actually receive workers' compensation benefits for the statutory immunity provided by the AWCA to apply. This Court disagrees. Rather, the statutory immunity applies to any claim for damages over which the Workers' Compensation Commission has the exclusive authority to determine whether a compensable injury has occurred. For the reasons set forth herein, under Oklahoma law, the question of whether Richter's death was a compensable injury under the AWCA is one over which the Workers' Compensation Commission has exclusive authority. As such, there is no requirement Defendant Peavler have actually obtained workers' compensation benefits for Richter's death in order for this Court to determine as a matter of law J &amp; S \"may be held liable under workers' compensation ... law\" as stated in Exclusion 3 of the J &amp; S Policy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
