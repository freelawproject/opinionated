In criticizing the 1787 Constitution, the influential antifederalist Federal Farmer called the jury trial and legislative representation \"the wisest and most fit means of protecting [the people] in the community.\" Jurors were drawn from that very community and had vast powers of investigation, via the grand jury, and adjudication, via the petit jury.
