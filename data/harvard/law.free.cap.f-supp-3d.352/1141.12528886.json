Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sometime prior to April 16, 2016, Plaintiff Carl Parson (\"Parson\") served as administrator of the estate of Defendant Don Farley's (\"Farley\") brother and sued Farley to recover property allegedly taken by Farley from his brother's estate. On April 16, 2016, Farley allegedly sent a letter containing false and defamatory statements about Parson to the Inola Chamber of Commerce (the \"Letter\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the Letter was sent, Parson was a candidate for the Oklahoma House of Representatives. On May 23, 2016, Parson filed a Petition in Rogers County, Oklahoma, asserting claims against Farley for libel and false light invasion of privacy, seeking money damages, along with temporary and permanent injunctive relief. Parson alleges that Farley published the Letter to the Inola Chamber of Commerce out of \"hatred, ill will, malice, and only with the desire to intentionally injury [Parson] as a business owner.\" ECF No. 2-1 at \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When filing the Petition, Plaintiff moved to file the Letter under seal pursuant to Oklahoma law governing sealed court records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Okla. Stat. tit. 51, \u00a7 24A.30 (\"If confidentiality is not required by statute, the court may seal a record or portion of a record only if a compelling privacy interest exists which outweighs the public's interest in the record.\"). On May 23, 2016, the state court entered an Order to Seal a Portion of the Record with Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (\"Sealing Order\") pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 51, \u00a7 24A.30. The court found in relevant part: (1) the Letter contains words that \"without hearing on the merits tend to be actionable by themselves or are opprobrious and that the Letter clearly refers to the Plaintiff\"; (2) \"additional publication by filing in the public record of the Letter ... would only serve to further harm the Plaintiff's right to privacy\"; and (3) \"an order can be narrowly tailored ... to keep that portion of the record sealed and prevent irreparable harm to the Plaintiff ... until such time as the matter can be heard on its merits or further order of this Court.\" ECF No. 7-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Farley removed the case to this Court based on diversity jurisdiction and filed a motion to file documents under seal in accordance with the Sealing Order, which Judge Dowdell granted by minute order. ECF No. 8. On July 28, 2016, Farley filed an Answer (ECF No. 10), a Motion to Dismiss (\"7/28/16 Motion to Dismiss\") (ECF No. 11), and a sealed version of the 7/28/16 Motion to Dismiss, which attaches the Letter (ECF No. 9). Parson filed a Motion to Remand two days later. Judge Dowdell entered an Opinion and Order that (1) denied Parson's Motion to Remand on grounds that Farley is a citizen of Alabama; and (2) denied Farley's 7/28/16 Motion to Dismiss on grounds that Parson's allegations are sufficient to \"plausibly assert actual malice\" for purposes of the standard in\n   <em>\n    New York Times v.

After his attorneys withdrew from the case, Farley filed a notice of intent to proceed pro se and has defended the lawsuit pro se since November 9, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 12, 2018, several months before the dispositive motion deadline, Farley filed a pro se motion seeking dismissal, summary judgment, or, alternatively, an order to compel Parson to respond to Farley's discovery requests (\"1/12/18\n   Dispositive Motion\"). ECF Nos. 46, 47. Because the 1/12/18 Dispositive Motion referenced the contents of the Letter, Farley sought and received permission to file it under seal. ECF Nos. 48, 49. Parson publicly responded to the 1/12/18 Dispositive Motion (ECF No. 50), but he filed his attached affidavit under seal. ECF No. 51. The undersigned denied Farley's alternative request to compel further discovery responses, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 56), and the remaining aspects of the 1/12/18 Dispositive Motion are pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 5, 2017, proposed intervenor Volokh, who appears pro se, moved to permissively intervene pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b). Volokh is a law professor \"who writes for the Volokh Conspiracy, a prominent legal blog hosted by Reason Magazine\" and who \"would like to have access to the full record in this case so that both he and members of the public may better understand\" the issues. ECF No. 58 at 2. Volokh moves the Court to unseal all sealed documents and provide public access to the Letter and related filings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. In addition to requesting intervention and unsealing of documents, Volokh seeks expedited consideration of his motion and permission to file future documents via the Court's electronic filing system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Parson objects to the Motion to Intervene and Unseal, while Farley does not object. In his response, Parson raises the following procedural and substantive arguments: (1) the Motion to Intervene and Unseal is untimely and prejudicial to Parson's rights (ECF No. 60 at 2-5); (2) Volokh's interests are adequately represented by Farley (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-8); (3) the Sealing Order controls the outcome of Volokh's pending motion to unseal (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9); and (4) Parson's privacy interests in the contents of the Letter outweigh the presumption of public access (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-14). The Court addresses all arguments but organizes this Opinion and Order into two sections addressing the motion to intervene and motion to unseal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The Court finds that Volokh has established independent Article III standing to intervene for the limited purpose of seeking public access to judicial records. First, Volokh has shown a concrete and particularized injury to his right of public access caused by the Sealing Order because, but for the Sealing Order, Volokh would be able to gather information from the record and disseminate his opinion regarding this litigation through his blog.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Okla.

Volokh filed his motion shortly after the dispositive motion deadline. Farley's pro se dispositive motion is still pending, and the litigation is still active. As explained above, courts have granted motions to intervene to unseal documents even after the case is concluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Jose Mercury News, Inc. v. U.S. Dist.

Volokh, a professor and legal blogger who seeks public access to the documents to inform the public and provide legal commentary, does not bear a burden of establishing that he diligently searched for the litigation since the time of its filing. As argued by Volokh, members of the media or legal commentators \"are often unaware of the case until they stumble across it as they research other projects.\" ECF No 61 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Nor will Parson suffer prejudice from Volokh's intervention. In the context of permissive intervention, prejudice arises when the \"intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties' rights.\" Fed. R. Civ.

In this case, allowing Volokh to intervene for the limited purpose of seeking to unseal the Letter and related court filings will not delay the proceedings or prevent the parties from adjudicating the case on the merits. Because Volokh seeks this limited type of intervention, his role in the case will essentially be completed upon entry of this Court's Order and resolution of any objections thereto. To the extent Parson argues he will be \"prejudiced\" because the contents of the Letter are libelous and embarrassing, those arguments are properly addressed as part of the \"merits\" issue of whether to grant Volokh's motion to unseal, rather than as part of the Rule 24(b) procedural analysis of whether to grant intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Although Farley is arguing that he has a First Amendment right to publicly criticize a candidate for public office, his interest differs from Volokh's interest in obtaining public access to judicial documents. Farley has never challenged the Sealing Order or otherwise sought to vindicate the principle of public access to judicial records. Although Farley does not oppose Volokh's Motion to Intervene and Unseal, Farley lacks the same incentive to invest time and resources in the \"public access\" issue, given that he already has access to the Letter and related judicial records. While the First Amendment plays some role in both Farley's\n   and Volokh's interests in the litigation, their interests are far from identical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court reaches the following resolutions of the parties' specific arguments: (1) the Sealing Order entered by the state court prior to removal is not controlling; (2) the Letter and other sealed filings are judicial documents to which a strong presumption of public access attaches; and (3) Parson has not rebutted the strong presumption in favor of public access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

First, Volokh's motion to unseal was filed in federal court after removal and is governed by federal law.\n   <em>\n    Granny Goose Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176871\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/423/#p436\">\n    415 U.S. at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176871\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/423/#p436\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"once a case has been removed to federal court, it is settled that federal rather than state law governs the future course of proceedings, notwithstanding state court orders issued prior to removal\"). Although the federal and state legal standards are similar, the Court is certainly not bound by the Sealing Order in ruling on a procedural motion governed by federal law. Second, as explained above and as set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201450\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court has authority to revisit, modify, and dissolve state court orders entered prior to removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hauff v.

By its own terms, the Sealing Order was interlocutory and would remain in effect only \"until such time as the matter can be heard on its merits or further order of this Court.\" ECF No. 7-1. Finally, and most importantly, this Court (and not the state court) now has the strongest interest in determining whether its own judicial records will remain sealed or will be accessible to the public. Therefore, based on\n   Volokh's filing of the motion to unseal following removal, the Court finds it proper to revisit these issues under federal standards and determine whether to unseal judicial records in this federal litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

If, for example, the Letter was merely attached to a discovery motion, the document may be relevant to the proceedings but entitled to a weaker presumption of access.

By asking to maintain the Letter under seal throughout the lawsuit, Parson is essentially asking the Court to shield the entire litigation from the public. Without the Letter and dispositive motions discussing the Letter's contents, the public lacks any meaningful access to the proceedings. Therefore, although the district court has yet to expressly rule on dispositive motions, the\n   Court finds the sealed materials are the type of \"judicial documents\" entitled to a \"strong presumption\" of public access.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3627748\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/698/1222/#p1242\">\n    698 F.3d at 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]here documents are used to determine litigants' substantive legal rights, a strong presumption of access attaches.\");\n   <em>\n    Angilau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205905536\">\n    2017 WL 5905536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (\"The presumption of access to documents submitted in support of, or in opposition to, a motion for summary judgment is great.\") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Parson argues his privacy interests are substantial due to the \"outrageousness\" of the allegations and his strong likelihood of success. Volokh contends that, if the Court accepts Parson's argument, \"all libel cases would be litigated with the key underlying allegations kept secret,\" and that \"any defamation plaintiff could demand secrecy, which would leave the public in the dark as to just why courts are being asked to restrict speech.\" ECF No. 58 at 10. Volokh also argues that Parson's request for injunctive relief restricting future speech weighs in favor of public access because the public has an \"interest in seeing what could possibly lead a candidate for public office to seek such a drastic remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Upon weighing Parson's interests in maintaining the privacy of the disputed judicial documents against the public's interest in access to the adjudicative process, the Court concludes public access must prevail. The Letter accuses Parson of scurrilous behavior, calls him names, and essentially seeks to dissuade others from supporting Parson in his candidacy for state representative. It is less than one page long and written in the form of a bulletin or flyer. If believed, the Letter could potentially damage Parson's reputation, business, and political ambitions. However, the Letter does not reference Parson's sensitive or private information, such as bank account records, social security numbers, or family members' names. Nor does it reference or name any third parties or their sensitive information. This is a garden-variety libel case involving a few allegedly false statements about an individual running for office that are embarrassing and potentially injurious to his reputation and business dealings. Parson has failed to articulate any privacy interests that \"heavily outweigh\" public access and warrant the drastic remedy of preventing the public from understanding the\n   nature of his lawsuit. Courts have held that injury to one's reputation and potential embarrassment generally do not outweigh the strong presumption of public access attaching to judicial documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mann\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3778466\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/477/1140/#p1149\">\n    477 F.3d at 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (embarrassment flowing to plaintiff based on allegations in her own complaint regarding ongoing feud with family and disclosure of Alzheimer's diagnosis was not \"sufficiently critical\" to outweigh strong presumption in favor of public access);\n   <em>\n    In re Se.

Further, the Court finds Parson's privacy interests in the Letter particularly uncompelling, because Parson was running for public office when the Letter was written and the Letter expressly references his candidacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Parson seems to assert that the Court should test Farley's defenses and, presumably, deny the motion to unseal if Parson is likely to succeed on the merits of his libel or false light invasion of privacy claims. This argument misses the point. If Parson succeeds at summary judgment or trial, the Letter's contents will be the focal point of that adjudicatory process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the Letter and its contents remain sealed, future court proceedings would need to remain sealed, and the public would be excluded from the process. The public would be unable to determine whether and to what extent a candidate for public office successfully prosecuted a libel claim and obtained compensatory and/or injunctive relief. Volokh, the proposed intervenor, wants to review, understand, and comment on these legal proceedings both due to his interest in First Amendment jurisprudence and to assist the public in checking the integrity of the judicial branch. These are proper and laudable purposes. Although Parson appears to believe his lawsuit is a private matter, he is mistaken. By seeking money damages and injunctive relief in a court of law, he subjected himself to public court proceedings, including any consequences of further public disclosure of the Letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.
