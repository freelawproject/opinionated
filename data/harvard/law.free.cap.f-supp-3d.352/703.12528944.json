(Dkt. 18). Having considered the parties' briefs, the evidence, and the relevant law, the Court enters the following order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Armijo-Banda has been indicted with a single count of illegal reentry into the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Dkt. 10). Specifically, the Government alleges that Armijo-Banda is an alien who was found in the Hays County Jail on July 10, 2018, and that Armijo-Banda was previously removed from the United States to Mexico on or about October 25, 2012. (Compl., Dkt. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Armijo-Banda is a citizen of Mexico. (Gov't. Resp., Dkt. 22, at 3). Immigration authorities first found him in August 2005 and served him with a notice to appear (\"NTA\") while he was in custody. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Removal Warrant, Dkt. 18-3; NTA, Dkt. 18-1; Gov't. Resp., Dkt. 22, at 3). The NTA did not contain a date or time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NTA, Dkt. 18-1, at 1). Armijo-Banda was held in custody until the hearing, where he appeared and participated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't. Resp., Dkt. 22, at 3 n.3; Removal Order, Dkt. 18-2). At the hearing, Armijo-Banda was ordered removed; he waived appeal. (Gov't. Resp., Dkt. 22, at 3-4; Order, Dkt. 18-2). It is this removal order that forms the basis of Armijo-Banda's indictment for illegal reentry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Armijo-Banda now seeks to collaterally challenge his removal order. Relying on the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), Armijo-Banda argues that his pending indictment for illegal reentry must be dismissed because his sole prior removal order was invalid. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 18, at 1). Specifically, he contends that because he received a Notice to Appear that did not indicate the removal hearing's date and time as required by statute, that notice was invalid and the immigration judge who ordered his removal had no jurisdiction to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3). The Government filed a response. (Dkt. 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

After\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that to collaterally attack a prior removal order in a criminal proceeding, the alien must demonstrate that: \"(1) the removal hearing was fundamentally unfair; (2) the hearing effectively eliminated the right of the alien to challenge the hearing by means of judicial review of the order; and (3) the procedural deficiencies caused the alien actual prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Section 1326(d) provides that an alien may not challenge the validity of a removal order unless the alien establishes that: \"(1) the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order; (2) the deportation proceeding at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review; and (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

The Government argues that Armijo-Banda fails to establish all three prongs and has failed to demonstrate prejudice. (Gov't. Resp., Dkt. 22). The Court addresses each requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), and the question of prejudice, in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Armijo-Banda argues that his removal order was fundamentally unfair because the immigration judge who issued the order lacked jurisdiction to do so. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 18, at 5-11). The Court will consider whether the immigration judge had jurisdiction over Armijo-Banda's removal hearing and, if the immigration judge lacked jurisdiction, whether the removal hearing was fundamentally unfair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction of the Immigration Judge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Federal regulation provides that \"[j]urisdiction vests, and proceedings before an Immigration Judge commence, when a charging document is filed with the\n   Immigration Court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

[T]hese documents include a Notice to Appear, a Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge, and a Notice of Intention to Rescind and Request for Hearing by Alien.\"). The statute governing removal proceedings defines a NTA as a \"written notice\" that \"specif[ies]\" certain information, including \"[t]he time and place at which the proceedings will be held.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(G)(i). In\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that \"[a] putative notice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place of the noncitizen's removal proceedings is not a 'notice to appear under section 1229(a).' \"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2113-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(A) ). \"The plain text, the statutory context, and common sense all lead inescapably and unambiguously to that conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this case, Armijo-Banda argues that without a date and time, the putative NTA he received in 2008 was not a NTA at all. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 18, at 5-7). Without a NTA, Armijo-Banda argues, there was no charging document, and without a charging document, jurisdiction never vested in the immigration judge who issued Armijo-Banda's removal order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Government counters that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's reading of \u00a7 1229(a) is limited to the specific facts of that case, which concerned whether a NTA lacking the time and place of a removal hearing triggered the \"stop-time rule\" for certain discretionary immigration relief. (Gov't. Resp., Dkt. 22, at 8-17;\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2110 ). The Government contends that a document lacking the time and place of a removal hearing nevertheless meets the regulatory definition of a NTA, thereby vesting jurisdiction with the immigration judge. (Gov't. Resp., Dkt. 22, at 19-24). Based on the plain language of the statute, as supported by the clear directive of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , this Court finds that a notice to appear without a date and time is not a NTA and therefore cannot vest an immigration judge with jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Removal proceedings are regulated by statute under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a. The implementing regulations provide that \"jurisdiction vests, and proceedings before an Immigration Judge commence, when a charging document is filed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The statute governing removal proceedings defines a Notice to Appear as a \"written notice\" that \"specif[ies] ...

The regulations that govern the jurisdiction of an Immigration Judge state that a Notice to Appear \"must\n   also include\" a list of information that specifies all of the same information required by the statute under \u00a7 1229(a), except that the time and place of the removal proceeding are omitted.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

The Court rejects this theory for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, a regulatory definition does not displace a statutory definition where the statute is unambiguous. \"In the process of considering a regulation in relation to specific factual situations, a court may conclude the regulation is inconsistent with the statutory language or is an unreasonable implementation of it.

The Government argues that before\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , some courts of appeals \"held that a Notice to Appear lacking the date and time of the hearing, together with the later served Notice of Hearing, w[as] together sufficient to meet the statutory definition under \u00a7 1229(a)(1).\" (Gov't.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But the Government conflates the concept of notice with the concept of jurisdiction. As discussed above, federal regulation provides that \"[j]urisdiction vests, and proceedings before an Immigration Judge commence, when a charging document is filed with the Immigration Court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).
