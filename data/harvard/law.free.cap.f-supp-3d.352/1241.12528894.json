Plaintiffs were employees of Defendants Regions Financial Corporation and Regions Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants provide mortgage-loan services throughout the United States, including at a mortgage-operations center in Gainesville, Georgia, with a satellite location in Cumming, Georgia (collectively, \"Gainesville MOC\"). (Third Am. Compl., Dkt. [41] \u00b6\u00b6 44-47.) Defendants also operate mortgage-operations centers in Alabama, Indiana, Tennessee, Florida, and Mississippi. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-51.) Defendants employ individuals to work in three mortgage-related positions at all MOCs: (1) mortgage processor; (2) mortgage underwriter, and (3) mortgage closer.

In view of these allegations, Plaintiffs seek conditional certification of a collective action consisting of three subclasses to recover unpaid overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to seeking recovery under the FLSA, Plaintiffs bring class action claims on behalf of Gainesville MOC employees for violations of Georgia RICO. Plaintiffs allege that Georgia law requires every corporation to pay its employees \"the full net amount of wages or earnings due the employees for the period for which the payment is made.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 34-7-2(b).

And by decreasing labor costs, Defendants increased their cash flow to pay dividends to stockholders and to pay principal and interest on outstanding debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.) Plaintiffs thus allege that Defendants have engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity by committing criminal acts against its mortgage processors, mortgage underwriters, and mortgage closers at the Gainesville MOC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146, 166-74.) These acts include theft of Plaintiffs' services, theft of Plaintiffs' contractually earned straight-time hourly rates, and extortion.

At the notice stage, the district court makes a decision-usually based only on the pleadings and any affidavits which have been submitted-whether notice of the action should be given to potential class members. Because the Court has minimal evidence, this determination is made using a fairly lenient standard, and typically results in 'conditional certification' of a representative class. If the district court 'conditionally certifies' the class, putative class members are given notice and an opportunity to 'opt-in.' The action proceeds as a representative action throughout discovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The second determination is typically precipitated by a motion for 'decertification' by the defendant usually filed after discovery is largely complete and the matter is ready for trial. At this stage, the court has much more information on which to base its decision, and makes a factual determination on the similarly situated question. If the claimants are similarly situated, the district court allows the representative action to proceed to trial. If the claimants are not similarly situated, the district court decertifies the class, and the opt-in plaintiffs are dismissed without prejudice. The class representatives-i.e. the original plaintiffs-proceed to trial on their individual claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Hipp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11091438\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/1208/#p1216\">\n    252 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1218 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mooney v.

Plaintiffs' Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Court should certify three subclasses: (1) employees in all mortgage jobs at all MOCs whose nondiscretionary bonus payments were excluded from the calculation of overtime compensation; (2) employees in all mortgage jobs at the Gainesville MOC who worked off the clock and were not paid proper overtime compensation; and (3) employees in all mortgage jobs at the Gainesville MOC whose time records were falsified and who were not paid proper overtime compensation. (Third Am. Compl., Dkt. [41] \u00b6 65.) Plaintiffs assert that all class members had the same primary job duties, were compensated in the same way, and worked overtime. Furthermore, Defendants used the same unlawful overtime practices against them. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In support of these allegations, Plaintiffs produce several declarations from Plaintiffs and other employees. According to these employees, \"[a]t various times\" throughout their employment they \"worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek\"; Defendants were aware when they worked extra hours \"because such work was apparent from documents, including electronic documents, or was performed in plain sight of management\"; and \"[at] various times\" Defendants did not pay them for all the overtime hours worked in a workweek. (Colbert, Nesmith, Wick, &amp; Wilson Decls., Dkt. [45-6, 45-7, 45-8, 45-9] \u00b6\u00b6 19-21.) The declarants state that Defendants failed to calculate overtime compensation properly by excluding nondiscretionary bonuses from the regular rate of pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) They also state that \"[a]t various times\" they \"worked off-the-clock during lunch breaks and before and after regular business hours.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Furthermore, two employees state that \"REGIONS' managers could enter the timekeeping system to change the time records or enter new information into the time records of a [mortgage underwriter, processor, or closer] in order to decrease the amount of [their] compensable hours.\" (Colbert &amp; Nesmith Decls., Dkt. [45-6, 45-7] \u00b6 17.) Defendants routinely engaged in these practices and consequently underpaid employees' overtime compensation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Colbert, Nesmith, Wick, &amp; Wilson Decls., Dkt. [45-6, 45-7, 45-8, 45-9] \u00b6 23.) Plaintiffs thus argue that the class members are all similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Defendants' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In opposing conditional certification, Defendants stress that Plaintiffs' off-the-clock claims are inherently individualized, and the subclasses fail to remedy this problem. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp., Dkt. [75] at 11-12.) According to Defendants, the factual determinations as to each opt-in would be unique. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) What is more, Plaintiffs and the putative opt-ins held three different jobs with different duties, while the extent to which employees worked overtime depended on the position they held. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16.) Defendants point to several other issues, including that Plaintiffs had different supervisors who approved overtime hours; Defendants had policies requiring accurate timekeeping and prohibiting work off the clock; and Plaintiffs' allegations are vague and conclusory because none of the declarations specifies when or how often the employee worked off the clock, nor do they identify any policy requiring work off the clock. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20.) Finally, Defendants note that there is evidence Plaintiffs were paid for a substantial number of overtime hours, meaning numerous individualized questions exist about why each Plaintiff was not paid for certain overtime hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21; Pearce Decl., Dkt. [75-5] \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As for the time-falsification claims, Defendants deny that Plaintiffs and opt-ins\n   are similarly situated because only two declarants mention that their time records were falsified. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Colbert &amp; Nesmith Decls., Dkt. [45-6, 45-7] \u00b6 23.) Moreover, Defendants point out that neither one states who falsified their records, only that managers could change the time records in the time keeping system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Defendants also argue that resolving time-falsification claims would involve individual inquiries into each class member's pay discrepancies to identify whether anyone altered time records to reduce overtime pay. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp., Dkt. [75] at 23-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Last, Defendants argue that certification is improper for the subclass of employees whose bonuses were excluded from their regular pay-rate calculation because all three Plaintiffs' regular rates were properly calculated to include non-discretionary bonuses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26; Pearce Decl., Dkt. [75-5] \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Certification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After reviewing the Third Amended Complaint and the parties' submissions, the Court finds that Plaintiffs make an adequate showing of similarity at this stage to warrant conditional certification as to certain claims. First, the Court finds that the mortgage processors, mortgage underwriters, and mortgage closers are similarly situated in terms of their job duties and pay provisions. Although there is variation in the duties of the different positions, all putative class members had non-supervisory mortgage jobs at Defendants' MOCs. More importantly, Defendants state that \"MOC employees\"-presumably including all putative class members-were all non-exempt and were paid at an hourly rate plus non-discretionary bonus payments. (Pearce Decl., Dkt. [75-5] \u00b6\u00b6 5, 16-17.) Policies violating the FLSA could thus affect employees in the same way. Even though the job duties among the different mortgage jobs vary, \"variations in specific duties, job locations, working hours, or the availability of defenses are examples of factual issues that are not considered at this stage.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott v. Heartland Home Fin., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:05-CV-2812-TWT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201209813\">\n    2006 WL 1209813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Ga. May 3, 2006). For that reason, the Court finds that Plaintiffs make a sufficient showing that members of the putative class are similarly situated in terms of their job and pay provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Turning to Plaintiffs' first subclass, which includes mortgage employees at all MOCs, Plaintiffs allege they were subject to a common unlawful policy when Defendants excluded their bonuses from the calculation of their regular pay rate. However, Defendants submitted evidence that Plaintiffs were paid a \"true up\" payment in March 2013 that compensated them for overtime based on a rate of pay that included production bonus payments. (Defs.' Resp., Dkt. [75] at 26; Pearce Decl., Dkt. [75-5] \u00b6\u00b6 18-19). Thereafter, Defendants have included the production bonus in the regular pay rate used to calculate overtime payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). In their Reply, Plaintiffs assert that even if there were a \"true up\" payment, it went only to current employees and did not address former employees. (Pl.'s Reply [81] at 3, n.1). Plaintiffs do not represent that they did not receive the payment. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are not similarly situated to these putative members of the class that they seek to represent. While the Court would not typically consider merits at this stage of certification, the substantial number of potential plaintiffs who would have to be served with notice and yet, who appear not to have valid claims causes the Court to consider the merits at this time. Inclusion of this claim would require notice to be sent to hundreds of employees in Alabama, Indiana,\n   Tennessee, Florida, and Mississippi, and apparently, those who have been employed since March 2013, would not have valid claims. In light of these circumstances and Plaintiffs appearing not to be similarly situated to putative plaintiffs who may have a claim, certification of Plaintiffs' first subclass is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court next considers the other two proposed subclasses, consisting of mortgage employees at the Gainesville MOC (1) who worked off the clock in excess of 40 hours per week and (2) whose time records were altered to reduce the number of compensable overtime hours. Most of Defendants' objections to certification apply to these subclasses and how the Court would have to make independent inquires into each employee's records to determine liability and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court recognizes Defendants' concern that distinct proofs could be required to determine liability for each class member. Defendants submit several affidavits of employees who state they were paid all their overtime. But again, resolving these factual disputes is not appropriate at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kreher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20739572\">\n    2006 WL 739572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (noting that the focus of the first stage \"is not on whether there has been an actual violation of law but rather on whether the proposed plaintiffs are 'similarly situated' under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) with respect to their allegations that the law has been violated\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Young v.

Instead, the Court finds that at this stage Plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence that putative class members experienced the same FLSA violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The cases Defendants cite do not alter this conclusion. Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Accredited Home Lenders, Inc.\n   </em>\n   in arguing that certification of this class is improper. No. 1:05-CV-1681-TWT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202085312\">\n    2006 WL 2085312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ga. July 25, 2006). In that case, the plaintiffs sought certification of a class of one thousand current and former loan officers seeking unpaid overtime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The plaintiffs had worked off the clock and were told they would receive \"comp time\" for their overtime hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The court denied certification of a collective action because liability of the plaintiffs' off-the-clock claims could not be determined on a class-wide basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The court explained that \"there must be a fact-specific, individualized inquiry into each Plaintiff's day-to-day activities\" because \"every employee must testify about his awareness of the overtime policy, and his violation of that policy-and whether it was compelled by his or her branch manager.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendants argue that the same is true here. But in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the court skipped the first stage of conditionally certifying the class and instead proceeded with a factual determination of the similarly-situated question. The court did so because the plaintiffs had \"short circuited the process first by disseminating informal notice of the lawsuit,\" then about 150 current or former employees filed forms to opt in, the defendant deposed about 20 of the opt-in plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs deposed the defendant's senior managers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defendants also submitted declarations of 50 loan officers testifying that they always accurately recorded their hours and had been properly paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Here, although there are several declarations in the record, the Court does not have the benefit of discovery to make a final certification decision. Discovery could reveal factual circumstances that could make the liability question suitable for a collective action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   is further distinguishable because the plaintiffs there sought a nationwide collective action, and so the court found that such a case would be unmanageable\n   because it would involve hundreds of overtime claims from many different offices around the country with different supervisors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs limit their off-the-clock and time-falsification claims to Gainesville MOC employees only, thus greatly narrowing the scope of the class. Based on Plaintiffs' allegations and evidence, it is plausible Plaintiffs could prove Defendants had a common policy at the Gainesville MOC of ordering employees to work off the clock and of altering their recorded hours to reduce their overtime pay.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Randle v.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , another case Defendants cite, the court declined to certify a collective action \"of hundreds or thousands of current and former JP Morgan employees based on divergent 'off the clock' violations\" with \"varying factual circumstances including geography, line of business, supervisors and managers, duties, and time keeping and pay practices.\" No. 8:12-cv-00470-T-27TBM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206196035\">\n    2012 WL 6196035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (M.D. Fla. Dec. 12, 2012). There, too, the court found that many plaintiff-specific inquiries would be required.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Here, on the other hand, Plaintiffs and putative class members all worked at the Gainesville MOC, they were in the same general line of business, and they were subject to the same time keeping and pay practices. Even though they may have reported to different supervisors, those supervisors all worked at one location-the Gainesville MOC-thus minimizing the differences between putative opt-ins. More importantly, the plaintiffs and declarants in\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   \"each complain[ed] of widely divergent 'off-the-clock' violations\" resulting from different practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In this case, all class members allege the same core violation: Defendants failed to pay overtime by requiring employees to work off the clock and/or by falsifying time records to reduce overtime pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, the above cases either had the benefit of more evidence or involved class members who were clearly not similarly situated to one another in terms of pay, duties, or even alleged FLSA violations. In this case, because Plaintiffs do show the class members are similarly situated, it is more appropriate to evaluate the manageability of the class's claims after the Court has the benefit of discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' case is appropriate for conditional certification as to these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    2. Subclasses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants argue that the proposed subclasses are inappropriate, however, because they do not remedy the individualized inquiries required in this case. As explained above, at this stage the Court finds that the putative class members are similarly situated. Still, the Court notes that the proposed subclasses would not aid in the resolution of claims because they are largely overlapping. For example, some Gainesville MOC employees could be members of both remaining subclasses if they experienced both types of FLSA violations. Consequently, the Court finds that\n   the use of subclasses is not appropriate and\n   <strong>\n    DECLINES\n   </strong>\n   to establish subclasses. The Court finds that the class should be defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   All current and former employees of REGIONS BANK and/or REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION at the Gainesville, Georgia mortgage operations center, including the Commerce, Georgia satellite office, who performed the primary job duties of either a mortgage processor, mortgage underwriter, or mortgage closer, at any time from [three years prior to the mailing date of notice] to [date of notice], who did not receive all the overtime compensation legally owed them because REGIONS BANK and/or REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   1.

Others Desire to Join the Suit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Beyond demonstrating that other members of the putative class are similarly situated, Plaintiffs must also demonstrate that other employees wish to opt in before the Court will grant conditional certification.\n   <em>\n    Dybach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532133\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/1562/#p1567\">\n    942 F.2d at 1567-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Three opt-ins have already filed consents to join the three named Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. [8, 12-1, 12-3].)

Based on the Court's denial of certification of a class including employees from MOCs other than the Gainesville MOC, geographic diversity is no longer an issue. Accordingly, the lack of geographic diversity of the opt-ins does not defeat certification. Plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrate that others wish to join the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Based on the Court's decision to certify the claims of Gainesville MOC employees only, Defendants' concern is removed. Plaintiffs are\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTED\n   </strong>\n   to prepare a notice defining the class as defined in this Order. Otherwise, the proposed notice is approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs request permission to include the following legend on the front of each envelope containing a notice packet:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL NOTICE:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   UNPAID OVERTIME LAWSUIT AGAINST:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    REGIONS BANK and/or REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 You could get additional overtime pay for some of the hours you worked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 Your prompt attention is required.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   (Dkt.

The Court is aware of no authority permitting a plaintiff to parse FLSA-required overtime pay into components. Although Plaintiffs assert that their right to straight-time pay for overtime hours is independent of the FLSA, at bottom they seek a portion of the time-and-a-half overtime-pay guaranteed by the FLSA and therefore seek to remedy a violation falling within the FLSA's scope. In that sense, the right is not wholly independent of the FLSA; it is overlapping. But if Plaintiffs could recover treble and punitive damages for the straight-time component of the time-and-a-half they are owed under the FLSA, Plaintiffs would thwart Congress's exclusive remedy for FLSA claims by essentially substituting part of their FLSA claim with a Georgia RICO claim. That is why numerous courts have found that state-law claims are preempted when they \"merely duplicate[ ] FLSA claims\" or seek greater damages than those available under the FLSA.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046453\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/181/#p194\">\n    508 F.3d at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeSilva v.
