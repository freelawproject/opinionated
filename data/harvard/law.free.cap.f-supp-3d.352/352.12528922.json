(\"BTG\"). Janssen and BTG co-own the '438 patent. The '438 patent contains twenty claims covering methods for the treatment of prostate cancer by administering various dosages of abiraterone acetate and prednisone in combination. Patent exclusivity for these medications individually is not at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendants are Amerigen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Amerigen Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (collectively, \"Amerigen\"); Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC; Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (collectively, \"Amneal\"); Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc.; Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Ltd. (collectively \"DRL\"); Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Mylan, Inc. (collectively, \"Mylan\"); Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (\"Teva\"); West-Ward Pharmaceutical Corporation, and Hikma Pharmaceuticals, LLC (\"West-Ward/Hikman\"); Wockhardt Bio AG; Wockhardt USA LLC; and Wockhardt Ltd. (collectively, \"Wockhardt\"). The defendants are generic drug companies who seek to engage in the commercial manufacture, use, offer for sale, or sale of a generic version of the plaintiffs' branded drug, ZYTIGA\u00ae.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege infringement of claims 4, 8, 11, 19 and 20, all of which rely on claim 1 of the '438 patent, based on the defendants' filing of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (\"ANDAs\"). If defendants' ANDAs are approved, defendants will allegedly induce infringement of the asserted claims of the '438 patent under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and contribute to infringement of the asserted claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Defendants deny infringement and claim that the patent claims are invalid for obviousness and for lack of a written description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 3, 2017, defendants moved for summary judgment as to the induced and contributory infringement claims. (DE 364). The Court held a hearing on that motion on February 9, 2018. Because it appeared that there were issues of fact to be tried in any event, and that the issues on summary judgment would subsumed in those to be tried, the motion was terminated without prejudice to reassertion of all contentions therein following trial. (DE 483).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Meanwhile, on January 17, 2018, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\"), in three inter partes proceedings, found the patent invalid. A motion for reconsideration remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court conducted a bench trial beginning on July 23, 2018 and concluding on August 2, 2018. The parties have submitted post-trial briefing, as well as proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This Consolidated Opinion constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). The findings of fact are based on the Court's observations and credibility determinations of the witnesses who testified at trial and a thorough review of all the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Essentially, I rule as follows: Like the PTAB, I find that the '438 patent is invalid for obviousness. I find the patent's written description to be adequate, however. In the alternative, and to facilitate appellate review, I have ruled on the infringement issues that were tried. Assuming that the '438 patent is valid, I find based on the proposed generic labels that the ANDA defendants' marketing of abiraterone would infringe, on either an induced infringement or contributory infringement theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1. On July 31, 2015, plaintiffs filed a complaint for infringement of the\n   '438 patent based on defendants' ANDA filings, which sought approval to market generic abiraterone acetate\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   250 mg tablets. (Civil Action No. 15-5909, DE 1). Plaintiffs filed suit against the following ANDA defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   a. Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc., Actavis Pharma, Inc., and Actavis, Inc.

Wockhardt related to ANDA No. 208380. (DE 1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (DE 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   2. The complaint was dismissed against certain defendants without prejudice, after they all agreed to be bound by any judgment rendered in the 15-5909 action. Those dismissed defendants are Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited; Arab Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co.; Hikma Pharmaceuticals, PLC; Actavis Pharma, Inc.; Actavis, Inc.; Par; and Citron. (DE 41, 44, 46, 103, 117).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   3. On April 20, 2018, plaintiffs and Apotex entered into a license agreement for the '438 patent, and Apotex was dismissed from the action. (DE 467).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   4. On September 28, 2015, plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint against Hetero USA Inc., Hetero Labs Limited Unit-V, and Hetero Labs Limited, asserting infringement of the '438 patent related to Hetero's filing of ANDA No. 208349, which sought approval to market generic abiraterone acetate 250 mg tablets. Hetero subsequently withdrew its ANDA, and on March 13, 2017, the Court entered a stipulation dismissing without prejudice plaintiffs' complaint against Hetero. (DE 308).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   5. On May 2, 2016, plaintiffs filed a separate action against Amerigen, asserting infringement of the '438 patent related to Amerigen's filing of ANDA No. 208027, which also sought approval to market generic abiraterone acetate 250 mg tablets. (Civ. No. 16-02449, DE 1). This action was consolidated with the 15-5909 action on\n   July 29, 2016 for discovery purposes. (Civ. No. 16-2449, DE 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   6. On August 25, 2017, plaintiffs filed a separate complaint against Teva and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd., asserting infringement of the '438 patent related to Teva's filing of ANDA No. 210726 for approval to market generic abiraterone acetate 500 mg tablets. (Civ. No. 17-6435, DE 1). Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd. was dismissed from this action after it agreed to be bound by any judgment. (Civ. No. 17-6435, DE 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   7. On January 8, 2018, the 17-6435 action was consolidated with the 15-5909 action for all purposes, including trial, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a). (Civ. No. 15-5909. DE 381). Teva's ANDA No. 208432 (at issue in the Civ. No. 15-5909 action) is substantively identical to Teva's ANDA No. 210726 (at issue in the Civ. No. 17-6435 action).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   8. The invention claimed in the '438 patent treats metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (\"mCRPC\") through a combination of abiraterone and prednisone. (JTX 8000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   9. The prostate is a male genitourinary organ located in the pelvis. (3T530:24-25). Prostate cancer arises when there is an uncontrollable proliferation of prostate tissue. (3T531:2-4). Metastatic prostate cancer occurs when the cancer tumor spreads from the prostate to another organ, such as the bones, liver, or lungs. (3T531:6-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   10. Male sex hormones, called androgens, promote the growth of prostate cancer cells. (3T531:10, -22 to -24). A first-line treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (\"ADT\"). (1T100:22-25; 3T532:19-20). Starting in the 1940s, the main treatment for prostate cancer was ADT. (1T115:23-116:1). ADT deprives cancer cells of androgens, like testosterone, through either medical or surgical castration. (1T100:24-101:3; 3T532:19-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   11. ADT is not a cure for prostate cancer ; in most patients, ADT eventually loses effectiveness and the cancer may resume growing. (3T533:13-25). At that point the cancer is deemed castration-resistant, as that term is used in mCRPC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   12. Abiraterone, discovered in the early 1990s, is a second-line therapy. (9T1970:24). Abiraterone inhibits the 17a-hydroxylase/C\n   <sub>\n    17,20\n   </sub>\n   -lyase (\"CYP17\") enzyme. The CYP17 enzyme has a role in the steroid biosynthesis pathway that leads to the production of androgens, including testosterone. (1T123:13-18; 7T1434:4-21; 6T1152:5-9, 1280:1-1281:1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PDX7.5, chart of steroid biosynthesis pathway and abiraterone inhibition, attached as an exhibit to this opinion.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   13. Dr. Johann de Bono, an oncologist and coinventor on the '438 patent, hypothesized that, while abiraterone decreased the production of androgens, it also resulted in an accumulation of \"upstream\" non-androgenic steroids (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those whose production branches off from the synthesis pathway before the point at which the CYP17 enzyme that is inhibited by abiraterone operates). (1T127:15-16, 128:16-129:3; 3T607:12-14). Those accumulated non-androgenic steroids would activate the androgen receptors on the prostate cancer cells, thereby reducing abiraterone's effectiveness and causing a resistance to abiraterone. (1T128:18-24; 3T607:17-20;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   top horizontal row of chart, PDX7.5, attached as exhibit.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   14. To combat such resistance, Dr. de Bono hypothesized, a glucocorticoid (the family including prednisone ) could be administered to suppress those upstream steroids. (1T127:11-22, 129:8-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The '438 Patent and Asserted Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   15. On September 2, 2014, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the '438 patent. (JTX 8000). The named inventors of the '438 patent were Alan H. Auerbach and Arie S. Belldegrun. (DE 502, at 86 \u00b6 28). Dr. de Bono was added as an inventor by order of the Court in January 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   16. The '438 patent, titled \"Methods and Compositions for Treating Cancer,\" has twenty claims and is directed at methods of treating prostate cancer in humans. (JTX 8000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   17. As described in the '438 patent, it is believed that testosterone and dihydrotestosterone promote the growth of prostate cancer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). The '438 patent further states that hormone therapy can be used to suppress the production or block the effects of hormones like testosterone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It notes that CYP17 inhibitors have been shown to be useful in the treatment of cancer, and specifically in androgen-dependent disorders like prostate cancer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   18. The '438 patent discloses such methods as the administration of a CYP17 inhibitor, like abiraterone acetate, in combination with at least one other therapeutic agent, such as an \"anti-cancer agent or steroid.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). The '438 patent identifies prednisone as one such therapeutic agent that can be combined with abiraterone acetate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   19. Claim 1 of the '438 patent, the only independent claim, claims the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   1. A method for the treatment of a prostate cancer in a human comprising administering to said human a therapeutically effective amount of abiraterone acetate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically effective amount of prednisone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Claim 1 is practiced when a \"therapeutically effective amount of abiraterone acetate\" and a \"therapeutically effective amount of prednisone\" are administered to a patient with prostate cancer. (3T538:1-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   20. Dependent claims 2-20 of the '438 patent describe additional limitations of the method, including the amount of abiraterone acetate and the amount of prednisone used, and the type of prostate cancer being treated. Plaintiffs assert infringement of claims 4, 8, 11, 19, and 20 against each defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   21. Those dependent claims provide as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   a. Claim 4. The method of claim 3, wherein the therapeutically effective amount of the abiraterone acetate or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is about 1000 mg/day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   b. Claim 8. The method of claim 7, wherein the therapeutically effective amount of the prednisone is about 10 mg/day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   c. Claim 11. The method of claim 10, comprising administering to said human about 1000 mg/day of abiraterone acetate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and about 10 mg/day of prednisone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   d. Claim 19. The method of claim 18, comprising administering to said human about 1000 mg/day of abiraterone acetate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and about 10 mg/day of prednisone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   e. Claim 20. The method of claim 17, comprising administering to said human about 1000 mg/day of abiraterone acetate or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and about 10 mg/day of prednisone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Claim Construction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   22. By Order dated June 27, 2016 (DE 208), the Court adopted the parties' agreed-upon constructions (DE 502, at 89, \u00b6\u00b6 49-51) of the following undisputed '438 patent claim terms:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-70\"><strong>Claim Term</strong> <strong>Joint Construction</strong> Preamble: \"a method for The preamble of claim 1, on the treatment of a prostate which claims 2-20 depend, cancer in a human\" is limiting and limits the claims to the treatment of a prostate cancer in a human. \"refractory prostate \"Prostate cancer that is not cancer\" responding to an anticancer treatment or prostate cancer that is not responding sufficiently to an anti-cancer treatment. Refractory prostate cancer can also include recurring or relapsing prostate cancer.\" \"therapeutically effective \"An amount effective for amount\" treating cancer.\"</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   23. On November 10, 2016, following a hearing, the Court issued its\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   patent claim construction opinion and order. (DE 239, 240, reported at\n   <em>\n    BTG Int'l Ltd. v. Actavis Labs. Fl, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20157586\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 157586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Nov. 10, 2016) ). The parties principally disputed the terms \"treatment\" and \"treating.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   24. The Court construed the terms \"treatment\" and \"treating\" as \"the eradication, removal, modification, management or control of a tumor or primary, regional, or metastatic cancer cells or tissue and the minimization or delay of the spread of cancer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Clinical Trials and Data\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   25. There were a number of clinical trials of abiraterone and prednisone. The results of those trials were submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to establish the safety\n   and efficacy of abiraterone, with the object of gaining FDA approval to market ZYTIGA\u00ae. (2T265:8-12; PDX 2.2 (Summary of Clinical Trials) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   26. Clinical trials proceed in various phases. A Phase I trial is typically the initial drug development, and seeks to determine the safety of administering a particular drug into a human. (2T266:9-12). A Phase II clinical trial uses the findings from Phase I and extends testing to a larger patient population. Those results provide a basis for conducting a Phase III trial, which evaluates clinical efficacy and safety for regulatory approval. (2T266:13-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   27. In April 2004, Cougar Biotechnology\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   licensed the rights to develop abiraterone from BTG. (1T108:12-13, 230:25-231:4; 8T1817:25-1818:5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   28. In 2004 and 2005, Dr. de Bono designed the first clinical trial of abiraterone, which became known as the COU-AA-001 trial (\"001 trial\"). (1T108:21-23, 124:17024; PTX 13). The purpose of the 001 trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abiraterone monotherapy in men with mCRPC. (1T126:16-21, 127:23-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   29. The 001 trial was designed to proceed in two phases. (2T267:3-11). In Phase I of the 001 trial, the dose escalation phase, patients received abiraterone at doses of 250, 500, 750, 1000, or 2000 milligrams. (2T302:7-14). In the Phase II portion of the 001 study, all patients received 1000 milligrams of abiraterone acetate. (2T302:20-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   30. For both phases of the 001 trial, Dr. de Bono proposed an \"extension\" phase for patients whose cancer had progressed despite the administration of abiraterone. Those patients would receive 0.5 milligrams of a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (1T127:11-22, 134:5-14; 2T267:12-18; PTX 11, at 4, 39-40; JTX 8086, at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   31. The purpose of this extension study was to evaluate Dr. de Bono's hypothesis that the addition of a glucocorticoid could suppress the upstream steroids, and thus reduce resistance to abiraterone. (1T127:11-22, 128:18-129:3). Dr. de Bono opined that prednisone, another glucocorticoid, would be just as effective as dexamethasone because all glucocorticoids would have a similar effect in terms of suppressing the upstream steroids. (1T132:13-133:20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   3T618:1-6; 7T1415:5-9). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the Royal Marsden Cancer Research Committee. (1T142:6-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   32. The 001 study results were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Gerhardt Attard, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Phase I Clinical Trial of a Selective Inhibitor of CYP17, Abiraterone Acetate, Confirms that Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Commonly Remain Hormone Driven\n   </em>\n   , 26 J. of Clinical Oncology 4563 (2008) (JTX 8083) (hereinafter referred to as \"Attard 2008\"); Gerhardt Attard, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Selective Inhibition of CYP17 with Abiraterone Acetate is Highly Active in the Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer\n   </em>\n   , 27 J. of\n   Clinical Oncology 3742 (2009) (JTX 8086) (hereinafter referred to as \"Attard 2009\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   33. Even though the central purpose of the Phase I trial was to establish safety, the results of the trial showed that abiraterone alone had anti-tumor activity, measured by a reduction in Prostate-Specific Antigen (\"PSA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   levels. (1T143:21-23). The 001 trial involved 54 patients. (1T144:1). All received abiraterone. In phase I (abiraterone dose escalation), 15 of the subjects received dexamethasone as well. In phase II (administration of 1000 mg/day of abiraterone), 30 of the subjects received dexamethasone as well. (1T144:1-4). Assuming complete overlap, then, at least 30 patients received combination therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   34. When patients developed a resistance to abiraterone monotherapy and a glucocorticoid was added, the anti-cancer effect, measured by PSA declines of at least fifty percent, returned for 10 of the 30 combination-therapy patients in the Phase II portion of the study. (1T144:4-22; 3T588:13-24; JTX 8086). This suggested that a glutocorticoid such as prednisone, at least when administered in combination with abiraterone, has an anti-cancer effect. The suggested mechanism was the suppression of the \"upstream\" steroids. These upstream steroids, left unchecked, may stimulate prostate cancer growth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 3T604:20-24, 608:5-18, 663:12-14; 4T861:1-5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   top horizontal line of biosynthesis chart, attached.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   35. The second clinical study submitted to the FDA, the COU-AA-002 trial (\"002 trial\"), was similar to COU-AA-001. (2T268:12-13). The 002 trial, which was conducted in the United States, received FDA approval. (2T269:8-18). Phase I of the 002 trial tested abiraterone monotherapy to determine the best dosage. (2T268:18-19). As originally designed, the Phase II portion of the study was to consist of further abiraterone monotherapy. (2T268:18-19). However, on May 25, 2007, after the results of the 001 study suggested the effect of the glucocorticoid, the protocol of Phase II of the 002 trial was amended. (2T268:19-21, 271:8-12, 272:1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under that amended Phase II protocol, abiraterone and prednisone would be jointly administered. (2T268:21-23). Patients received 1,000 milligrams of abiraterone and 10 milligrams of prednisone per day. (2T272:4-6). The results of 002 Phase II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   were published. Charles J. Ryan, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Phase II Study of Abiraterone Acetate in Chemotherapy-Naive Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Displaying Bone Flare Discordant with Serologic Response\n   </em>\n   , Clinical Cancer Research (2011). (JTX 8093).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   36. A clinical study report of the 002 trial was submitted to the FDA for its consideration in approving ZYTIGA\u00ae. (2T312:16-313:2; DTX 1367). That report included a section that discussed the overall design of the study. (DTX 1367, at 19). In addressing the role of prednisone in Phase II of the 002 trial, the report noted that \"all subjects were required to receive low dose glucocorticoids such as prednisone 5 mg twice daily PO or dexamethasone (0.5 mg once daily) with abiraterone acetate to better manage mineralocorticoid side effects.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   37. The conclusion of the 002 study report provided, in full, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \u2022 In study COU-AA-002, abiraterone acetate demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity as assessed by PSA response by PSAWG criteria; objective response by RECIST criteria; and time to PSA progression in this patient population with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer who had prior hormonal therapies. Importantly, tumor responses to abiraterone acetate were observed in castrate patients who had prior ketoconazole medication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \u2022 Although corticosteroids were not mandated at the initiation of the study, the incidence of mineralocorticoid excess with abiraterone acetate monotherapy was of sufficient frequency to support the routine use of glucocorticosteroids.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \u2022 Although the MTD of abiraterone acetate could not be definitely determined based on available data, the doses administered appear to be well tolerated with no DLTs even at 1000mg/day. The results of the study support the use of the 1000 mg daily dose of abiraterone acetate in the treatment of advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer, in view of the antitumor activity and safety observed at this dose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (DTX 1367, at 110).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   38. Dr. Robert Charnas, ZYTIGA\u00ae's global regulatory leader, suggested that because abiraterone and prednisone were tested in combination, their individual anti-cancer effects could not be determined. (2T323:25-324:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   39. The COU-AA-003 (\"003 trial\") trial was another study that evaluated 1000 mg/day or abiraterone acetate in post-chemotherapy mCRPC patients. (DTX 1185). The patients in the COU-AA-003 study were allowed to be on steroids. Eighteen of forty-seven patients (38%) were on a low dose of steroids. (DTX 1185.4). PSA declines were seen in thirty-two of the forty-seven patients (68%). The results of this trial were published. Reid, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Significant and Sustained Antitumor Activity in Post-Docetaxel, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer with the CYP17 Inhibitor Abiraterone Acetate\n   </em>\n   , 20 J. of Clinical Oncology 1 (2010). (DTX 1185).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   40. The COU-AA-004 Phase II trial (\"004 trial\") used the combination of abiraterone and prednisone in post-docetaxel mCRPC patients. (2T272:7-19; 3T614:6-15). The median time to PSA progression reported in the COU-AA-003 trial and the COU-AA-004 trial was the same, approximately 5.6 months. (4T954:22-956:11). The results of the 004 trial were also published. Daniel Danila et al.,\n   <em>\n    Phase II Multicenter Study of Abiraterone Plus Prednisone Therapy in Patients with Docetaxel-Treated Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer\n   </em>\n   , 28\n   J. of Clinical Oncology 1496, 1497 (2010). (JTX 8090).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   41. The COU-AA-301 clinical trial (\"301 trial\") was the registration study that compared the combination of abiraterone plus prednisone to a control arm of prednisone plus a placebo. (2T276:19-277:3). The 301 trial was considered the pivotal trial showing efficacy and safety for the NDA application. (2T283:5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   42. Like previous trials, the coadministration arm of the 301 trial involved 1000 milligrams of abiraterone and 10 milligrams of prednisone, administered daily. (2T277:6-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   43. Positive effects were seen in the patients receiving abiraterone plus prednisone. The Independent Data Monitoring Committee, an outside committee that evaluates patient safety throughout a clinical trial, therefore recommended that the placebo control arm of the trial be discontinued for ethical reasons. (2T277:12-278:6). All the participants were then given prednisone plus abiraterone, as opposed to a placebo. (2T277:12-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   44. The 301 trial demonstrated that abiraterone and prednisone in combination were efficacious. (3T372:5-8). The results of the 301 trial demonstrated a four month increase in median overall survival. (2T278:9-13; 2T376:23-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   45. The results from the 001, 002, 003, 004 and 301 trials were submitted to the FDA for review as part of the original NDA application. (2T284:9-13). No single study compared abiraterone monotherapy to abiraterone plus prednisone combination therapy. (2T293:5-7). Such a comparison by the FDA would necessarily be less direct, based on a comparison of data from different studies. (2T374:12-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   46. The final clinical trial was the COU-AA-302 clinical trial (\"302 trial\"). (2T278:16). The 302 trial was the basis for a change to the indications on the ZYTIGA\u00ae label in 2018. (2T308:7-8). In the 302 trial, abiraterone plus prednisone was compared to prednisone plus a placebo. The study subjects were patients whose disease had not progressed to the point where chemotherapy was required. (2T278:18-23). The same dosages, 1000 milligrams of abiraterone and 10 milligrams of prednisone, were administered. (2T279:1-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   47. In the 302 trial protocol, it was noted that administration of a corticosteroid \"improved symptoms of fatigue and tolerability of abiraterone acetate, including symptoms of mineralocorticosteroid excess. The improved tolerability of abiraterone acetate after concomitant administration of low-dose corticosteroids was associated with suppression of ACTH and upstream adrenal steroids[.]\" (DTX 1358, at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   48. The comparative control arm of this study, as in the 301 study, was discontinued for ethical reasons, to allow all the patients to take abiraterone plus prednisone. (2T279:8-12). The combination of abiraterone and prednisone in the 302 trial showed a sixty percent reduction in the risk of progression or death, and an overall median survival improvement of about four months. (2T279:23-280:2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Prior Art\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   49. The priority date is August 2006.

Before 2006, there was a significant divergence of opinion within the scientific community as to whether prostate cancer was androgen dependent or independent. (1T116:9-18). However, the prevailing belief was that, once the cancer resumed growing after ADT, the cancer became androgen independent. (1T116:16-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   51.

In order to obtain approval to market a new drug, a company is required to submit a New Drug Application (\"NDA\") to the FDA. (2T282:4-10, 387:19-388:4). An NDA application contains proposed labeling, prescribing information, animal and human studies, including phase I, II, and III clinical trials, and toxicity data. (2T282:14-283:2, 388:5-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   55. ZYTIGA\u00ae is sold in the United States pursuant to approved NDA No. 202379. (Civ No. 15-5909, DE 502, at 90, \u00b6 53). The NDA application for ZYTIGA\u00ae was submitted in December of 2010 for the use of ZYTIGA\u00ae in combination with prednisone for the treatment of men with mCRPC. (2T283:19-20, 284:18-21, 370:9-10). The NDA was specifically submitted for ZYTIGA\u00ae, and prednisone was considered a concomitant therapy. (2T411:3-5). The application received priority review as requested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2T284:22-286:13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   56. On November 9, 2010, the FDA and Cougar Biotechnology had a \"pre-NDA\" meeting. (2T334:3-23, 335:9; DTX 1331). The purpose of a pre-NDA meeting is for the sponsor of a drug and the FDA to discuss the NDA; for the sponsor to inform the FDA about the NDA; and for the FDA to provide initial feedback that would aid in the NDA review process. (2T334:15-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   57. The scientific rationale for developing abiraterone was addressed in the briefing package that was submitted to the FDA for this pre-NDA meeting. (2T336:5-7; DTX 1331, at 11-14). That scientific rationale was described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Based on our understanding of abiraterone acetate's mechanism of action and as predicted by the syndrome of congenital deficiency of CYP17, we anticipated that a state of mineralocorticoid excess mediated by increased deoxycorticosteron could occur after pharmacologic inhibition of CYP17, resulting in hypertension, hypokalemia and fluid retention. Indeed, these mechanism-based toxicities were observed in Phase 1 and 2 studies. Accordingly, the Phase 1 studies were designed to allow administration of low dose corticosteroids for disease progression or for palliation of symptoms. The improved tolerability of abiraterone acetate after concomitant administration of low-dose corticosteroids was associated with suppression of ACTH and upstream adrenal steroids, including mineralocorticoids, suggesting that the combination may be better tolerated and safer regimen in this older prostate cancer patient population.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Thus, the regimen of low-dose prednisone 5 mg twice a day and abiraterone acetate 1 g daily was advanced into Phase 2 and 3 testing. Prednisone was selected over other corticosteroids because it is commonly used as standard of care in combination with chemotherapy and often maintained as palliative treatment after chemotherapy is discontinued in patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer. When abiraterone acetate was administered in a combination with oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily there appeared to be a decreased incidence\n   and severity of mineralocorticoid based side effects, including hypertension, fluid retention and hypokalemia (Danila et al., JCO). Anti-tumor activity was observed across all patient studies as declines in prostate specific antigen levels, and in objective radiographic responses in the subset of men who had measureable disease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (DTX 1331, at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   58. The NDA as submitted included a \"summary of clinical efficacy,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a summary of the clinical trials discussed above that established ZYTIGA\u00ae's efficacy. (2T352:16-353:6; JTX 8187). In comparing the various clinical trials and addressing efficacy, the report noted that \"[t]he totality of data from Phase 1/2 studies, Phase 2 studies, and pivotal Study COU-AA-301 consistently demonstrates the benefit of abiraterone acetate and prednisone treatment for patients with mCRPC.\" (JTX 8187, at 52; 2T375:8-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   59. The summary of clinical efficacy explained the specific dosing recommendations of 1000mg/day of abiraterone and 10 mg/day of prednisone. (JTX 8187, at 54). In addressing prednisone, the recommendation provided that \"concurrent treatment with prednisone\" was \"administered to ameliorate mineralocorticoid-related toxicity that was observed with abiraterone acetate in early Phase 1/2 studies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It noted that when abiraterone was administered alone, \"[h]ypertension, hypokalemia, and peripheral edema were observed frequently, and were managed with the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone or with low-dose glucocorticosteroids.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   60. On April 26, 2011, the FDA completed its medical review, which is the FDA's analysis and interpretation of the data presented in the clinical section of the NDA. (2T342:17-343:2; DTX 1333). In addressing the potential for overdose, drug abuse and withdrawal, the medical review included the following comment: \"Abiraterone acetate is given concurrently with 10mg of prednisone once daily in order to attenuate mineralocorticoid excess resulting from reduced feedback inhibition of ACTH.\" (DTX 1333, at 107; 2T344:8-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   61. The FDA approved the NDA on April 28, 2011. (2T286:19). Specifically, the FDA approved ZYTIGA\u00ae in combination with prednisone for the treatment of mCRPC.

The FDA requires NDA holders to identify in the Orange Book \"each patent that claims the drug or a method of using the drug that is the subject of the NDA ... and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   63.

Physicians look to the Indications and Usage section of a label to determine why a particular therapy is being used. (3T543:8-9). The Warnings and Precautions\n   section of a label provides information about adverse reactions that may occur when using the drug product. (2T420:4-7; PDX 406, at 4). The Dosing and Administration section of a label provides the recommended dose for each indication and subpopulation. (2T412:1-5; 3T543:18-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   66. On April 28, 2011, the FDA approved NDA 202379, with FDA-approved labeling. (DE 502, at 90, \u00b6 55). The Indications and Usage section provided that, \"ZYTIGA is a CYP17 inhibitor indicated for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90, \u00b6 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   67. On December 12, 2012, the FDA again approved NDA 202379, with FDA-approved labeling stating in the Indications and Usage section that \"ZYTIGA is a CYP17 inhibitor indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.\" (DE 502, at 90, \u00b6 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   68. On February 7, 2018, the FDA approved NDA 202379, with FDA-approved labeling stating in the Indications and Usage section that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   ZYTIGA is indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   \u2022 Metastatic castration-\n   <em>\n    resistant\n   </em>\n   prostate cancer (CRPC)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   \u2022 Metastatic high-risk castration-\n   <em>\n    sensitive\n   </em>\n   prostate cancer (CSPC)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   (PTX 406; emphasis added). This Indications and Usage Section is representative of the Indications and Usage section on the current ZYTIGA\u00ae label. (PPF. at 14, \u00b6 68). The Indications and Usage section of the label does not identify any other disease or condition, other than mCRPC and metastatic high-risk CSPC. (4T845:15-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   69. The approved \"Dosage and Administration\" section of the 2018 ZYTIGA\u00ae label reads, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    2.1 Recommended Dose for metastatic CRPC\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   The recommended dose of ZYTIGA is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) administered orally once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered orally\n   <strong>\n    twice\n   </strong>\n   daily.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    2.2 Recommended Dose for metastatic high-risk CSPC\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   The recommended dose of ZYTIGA is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) orally once daily with prednisone 5 mg administered orally\n   <strong>\n    once\n   </strong>\n   daily.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   (PTX 406). These are the doses that the FDA has approved for the treatment of these diseases. (2T412:1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   70. Section 5 of the ZYTIGA\u00ae label, \"Warnings and Precautions,\" warns that it may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention due to mineralocorticoid excess. (PDX 406, at 4). In the 2018 label, the FDA removed the following warning: \"[c]o-administration of a corticosteroid suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH ) drive, resulting in the reduction in the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions.\" (2T421:13-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   71. Section 14 of the label highlights some of the clinical studies that were completed and demonstrated efficacy. (2T415:20-22). This section specifies that \"[t]he efficacy and safety of ZYTIGA with prednisone was established in three randomized, placebo-controlled, international clinical studies.\" (PDX 406, at 21; 2T418:1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Defendants' Labels\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   72. Each defendant has filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic form of ZYTIGA\u00ae,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , abiraterone acetate tablets. (DE 502, at 91, \u00b6 65). The FDA requires\n   that a drug manufacturer, when filing for such an application, to prepare a side-by-side comparison of its proposed labels to the brand name labels. (2T398:10-13). Typically, a proposed generic's drug label is substantively the same as the approved branded drug's label. (3T393:10-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   73. Defendants' proposed ANDA product labels recite the same mCRPC indication as the ZYTIGA\u00ae label, except that defendants' labels substitute \"abiraterone acetate\" for \"ZYTIGA.\" (2T396:18-21, 407:22-24; 3T541:2-24; JTX 8011 (Amerigen's proposed label); PTX 359 (Amneal proposed label); PTX 367 (DRL); PTX 372 (Mylan); PTX 383 (Teva); PTX 393 (West-Ward/Hikman); PTX 397 (Wockhardt) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   74. The proposed Indications and Usage sections of defendants' labels entail that they wish to market abiraterone plus prednisone for the treatment of mCRPC only. (2T408:3-5). The defendants' proposed labels do not contain the mCSPC indication that was added to the ZYTIGA\u00ae label in its 2018 version. (2T396:22-397:1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   75. The Dosage and Administration sections of defendants' labels all recommend administering 1000mg/day of abiraterone acetate, and 10mg/day of prednisone. (DE 502, at 94, \u00b6 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   76. Amerigen's, Mylan's, and West-Ward/Hikman's Dosing and Administration sections are identical to the ZYTIGA\u00ae pre-2018 labels insofar as they state that the \"recommended dosage\" is 1,000 milligrams of abiraterone acetate tablets administered orally once daily in combination with 10 milligrams of prednisone administered orally twice daily. (2T413:18-23; JTX 8011; PDX 393).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   77. Amneal's, DRL's, Teva's, and Wockhardt's proposed Dosage and Administration sections, like the ZYTIGA\u00ae 2018 label, state the same 1000mg/ 10mg \"recommended dosage,\" while adding the words \"for mCRPC.\" (2T413:23-414:3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   78. The defendants' labels that are based on the ZYTIGA\u00ae 2015 label still contain the warning, dropped from the ZYTIGA\u00ae 2018 label, that \"[c]o-administration of a corticosteroid suppresses adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH ) drive, resulting in the reduction in the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions.\" (2T422:16-23). The FDA has already instructed Teva to remove this language from its label. (2T424:20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    J. ZYTIGA Marketing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   79. The FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to submit marketing materials. (2T483:8-10). The materials do not have to be approved in advance, but they cannot mischaracterize a drug's indication. (2T483:23-484:1). Several of ZYTIGA\u00ae's marketing documents discuss the role of prednisone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   80. In a marketing document related to the 2011 indication (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , prior to the removal of the warning language related to the \"[c]o-administration of a corticosteroid\") the role of prednisone was described as reducing \"the incidence and severity of mineralocorticoid-related adverse reactions\" with ZYTIGA\u00ae. (DTX 1260; 2T484:7-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   81. A ZYTIGA\u00ae brochure dedicated to explaining the role of prednisone also notes that prednisone\"reduces the incidence and severity of mineralocorticoid-related adverse reactions associated with ZYTIGA.\" (DTX 1276; 2T488:8-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   82. A third marketing document explaining the role of prednisone explains that prednisone lessens the system's response to a net cortisol deficit due to abiraterone. (2T489:7-12; DTX 1276).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   83. Other ZYTIGA\u00ae marketing materials, however, promote ZYTIGA\u00ae in combination with prednisone solely as a means\n   to treat prostate cancer. (PDX 424 (stating that \"ZYTIGA plus prednisone achieved a statistically significant median overall survival difference\"); PDT 447 (stating that \"ZYTIGA plus prednisone significantly increased median radiographic progression for survival\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

It teaches the administration of a specified dosage of two specified drugs for the treatment of a specified condition in a specified, narrow class of patients,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those suffering from mCRPC. Not even minimal adjustment or experimentation is suggested; a skilled practitioner (assuming regulatory approval) would need little if any additional instruction to practice the method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   In defendants' view, however, the specification is inadequate because it fails to disclose test results showing that prednisone\n   itself provides an anti-cancer benefit. Nor, they say, does it provide sufficient information to permit a POSA to understand that\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   agents, abiraterone and prednisone, \"treat\" prostate cancer. (DBr. at 68; Def. Response at 38). These challenges fit only awkwardly within a contention that the method is not described so that a practitioner could practice it. Nevertheless, I address them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   First, I find that the specification in the '438 patent sufficiently identifies prednisone as an anti-cancer agent for purposes of the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20122\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   written-description requirement. As stated in my\n   <em>\n    Markman\n   </em>\n   opinion, that is what \"treatment,\" as used here, means. The specification is directed to the administration of abiraterone acetate with \"at least one additional therapeutic agent, such as an anti-cancer agent or a steroid.\" (JTX 8000). The specification defines \"anti-cancer agent\" as \"any therapeutic agent that directly or indirectly kills cancer cells or directly or indirectly prohibits, stops or reduces the proliferation of cancer cells.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). The '438 patent provides a list of anti-cancer agents, including mitoxantrone, paclitaxel, docetaxel, leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, seocalcitol, bicalutamide, and flutamide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). It further identities additional \"anti-cancer\" agents as \"hormone ablation agents, anti-androgen agents, differentiating agents, ... antibiotic agents ... and anti-androgens.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). Thus, an antibiotic agent is defined as an anti-cancer agent, and prednisone is explicitly identified as an antibiotic agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Second, the specification provides a list of steroids, including hydrocortisone, prednisone, and dexamethasone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 10). In discussing the administration of steroids, the specification provides that the \"amount of the steroid administered to a mammal having cancer is an amount that is sufficient to treat the cancer whether administered alone or in combination with a 17a-hydroxylase/C\n   <sub>\n    17,20\n   </sub>\n   -lyase inhibitor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). Thus, whether identified as either an \"anti-cancer agent\" or a \"steroid,\" prednisone is sufficiently identified in the specification as an agent that \"treats\" cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   To this extent, the patent drafter is privileged to act as his or her own lexicographer. \"The specification acts as a dictionary when it expressly defines terms used in the claims or when it defines terms by implication.\"\n   <em>\n    Novartis Corp. v.

One component of the defendants' obviousness argument is that the anti-cancer role of prednisone in actual \"treatment\" of mCRPC could have been anticipated. A second component of the defendants' argument, however, is that the role of prednisone in palliation or reducing side effects would also have motivated a POSA to combine it with abiraterone. Implicit in that second component is the idea that the\n   <em>\n    motivation\n   </em>\n   to combine therapies need not have been entirely congruent with the patented\n   <em>\n    idea\n   </em>\n   as conceived by the inventor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    KSR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556178\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/398/#p406\">\n    550 U.S. at 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556178\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/398/#p406\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that it is error to look \"only to the problem the patentee was trying to solve\");\n   <em>\n    In re Kahn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1037336\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/441/977/#p990\">\n    441 F.3d 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 990 (Fed.

Cir. 1992) (\"[T]he law does not require that the references be combined for the reasons contemplated by the inventor.\") ). Thus defendants rely in part on these other effects of prednisone because those effects lent a separate impetus to the administration of abiraterone and prednisone in combination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The argument can be pushed too far; the proverbial blind pig must at least have been searching for an acorn. The case law does not suggest that obviousness must be found because an inventor, ignorant of the relevant science and considering an entirely different problem, could have stumbled on the patented method. This case, however, is close to the other end of the spectrum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The combination therapy, it is true, is patented as a \"treatment.\" But even prednisone's effects as a palliative and a side-effect minimizer would furnish a powerful motivation to combine it with abiraterone. And the idea for such a combination, even if initially motivated only by those two effects, would have gotten the POSA to the same place. That road led straight to the practice of the patented method: the target condition would be prostate cancer ; the target population would be the subset of patients who had mCRPC; the dosage would be 1000mg of abiraterone and 10mg of prednisone daily; the object would be to slow the spread of the disease by hormone deprivation; the clinical results would be the same, and would be measured by prolongation of life (or, in the interim, by proxy metrics such as reduction of PSA levels). In short, the anticipated combination therapy-irrespective of what was in the POSA's mind as to the exact mechanism-would have looked precisely the same. So understood, this begins to look less like serendipity and more like inevitability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   I first review the prior art evidence as to abiraterone, prednisone, and combination therapy (subsections a, b, &amp; c).

As a result, efforts were then being undertaken to discover a more potent and selective inhibitor. (DTX 1062, at 1). In that regard, Barrie 1994 concluded that abiraterone was \"worthy of further study\" as a potential agent \"for the treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer.\" (7T1563:7-9; DTX 1062, at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Potter 1995 explained that abiraterone is a \"strong candidate for further development as a potential drug for the treatment of prostatic carcinoma in humans.\" (JTX 8037, at 7; 7T1563:10-13). Abiraterone was also noted as an inhibitor of both the hydroxylase and the lyase function of the CYP17 enzyme. (JTX 8037, at 6; 6T1316:6-16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PDX 7.5, chart attached to opinion). A few years later, Jarman 1998 indicated that abiraterone had been selected for clinical evaluation based on animal testing: \"its marked reduction of circulating testosterone levels in the male rat and mouse and of androgen-dependent organ weights in the mouse.\" (DTX 1085, at 5375).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The first human trial of abiraterone, reported in O'Donnell 2004, began in 1997. (1T109:12-110:1, 209:11-13; DTX 1129). The Institute of Cancer Research tested abiraterone in a Phase I clinical trial. (1T205:24-206:6). No patient was given a glucocorticoid during testing. O'Donnell did, however, discuss co-administration of a glucocorticoid with abiraterone. (1T214:9; DTX 1129;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at 384).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The O'Donnell 2004 trial comprised of multiple parts. (1T211:3-5). In the first portion of the trial, a population of castrate male patients received a single dose of abiraterone, at varying dosage levels, and\n   were monitored for the following ten days. (1T211:15-20; DTX 1129, at 2319). All patients in this portion of the study experienced a reduction in testosterone levels below castrate levels. (1T214:14-16). The second portion of the trial administered a single dose of abiraterone, at various dosages, in non-castrate males. (1T212:5-7; DTX 1129, at 2319). Testosterone levels were reduced there as well, but not to below-castrate levels. (1T215:4-5). In the third and final portion of the study, non-castrate males were given a single dose of 500 milligrams of abiraterone every day for twelve days. (1T212:8-18, -21). Testosterone suppression was not sustained in that non-castrate portion of the study. (1T214:20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The O'Donnell 2004 trial determined that abiraterone was safe. (1T214:11). But because of the failure to attain sustained testosterone suppression in non-castrate patients, the results suggested that abiraterone was suitable as a second-line (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , post-castration) treatment. (1T216:12-19; DTX 1129, at 2317 (\"The enhanced testosterone suppression achieved in castrate men merits further clinical study as a second-line hormonal treatment for prostate cancer.\") ). Specifically, O'Donnell 2004 found that testosterone levels would be suppressed below castrate levels by a daily dose of abiraterone in the amount of 800 milligrams. (DTX 1129, at 2317;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Garnick 2006 (DTX 1157, at 919-20 (recognizing that abiraterone \"shows potential in the treatment of cancer,\" and \"has demonstrated [an] ability to selectively inhibit the target enzyme, resulting in inhibition of testosterone production in both the adrenals and the testes\") ) ). After a series of rejections, the O'Donnell results were eventually published in the British Journal of Cancer, four years after the close of the underlying study.

O'Donnell notes that \"[i]n addition to ketoconazole, aminoglutethimide and abiraterone, other compounds designed to inhibit general androgen production have been developed and show promise.\" (DTX 1129, at 2321). In addressing ketoconazole, O'Donnell 2004 observes that it is an \"unselective\" inhibitor, that it has an antitumor effect (measured by clinical benefit as well as reduction in PSA), and that a more \"selective\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , CYP-17) inhibitor, abiraterone, could be used as a second-line agent. (DTX 1129, at 2318).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Prior art: prednisone\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Tannock 1996 was a palliation study involving patients having refractory prostate cancer with pain. They received mitoxantrone, a chemotherapy drug (not a CYP17 inhibitor) with prednisone, or else prednisone alone. (7T1609:2-12; DTX 1076, at 1756; 8T1742:14-18). Tannock 1996 disclosed that prednisone, dosed at 10 milligrams per day, would provide palliation to hormone-resistant prostate cancer patients, when used with mitoxantrone. (7T1609:1-15; DTX 1076, at 1756). Defendants' expert testified that prednisone was administered to alleviate the \"known effects of mitoxantrone\" including nausea, vomiting, hair loss, low blood counts, and neuropathy. (8T1743:2-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Sartor 1998 evaluated the effects of prednisone on PSA levels in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. (DTX 1087, at 252). Twenty-nine patients were given ten milligrams of prednisone daily. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; 7T1575:5-11). Of those twenty-nine patients, fourteen (48%) achieved a PSA decline of at least 25%, ten (34%) achieved a PSA decline of at least 50%, and four (14%) achieved a PSA decline of at least 75%, measured from baseline. (DTX 1087, at 254). Sartor 1998 reported that four patients (14%) had a duration of response\n   greater than six months.

(DTX 1087, at 255; DE 393-3 (\"Sartor reasonably stands for the proposition that administration of prednisone is tolerated and effective in a subset of patients, and at the time it was published, indicated some measure of efficacy for certain mCRPC patients.\").

Of the 101 patients treated with twenty milligrams of prednisone per day, twenty-one (20.8%) had a PSA decline of greater than 50%. (7T1578:8-10; JTX 8048, at 63, 67). There was no difference in median overall survival between the two groups of patients, however. (JTX 8048, at 70). Fossa 2001 concluded that \"[m]onotherapy with low-cost prednisone should be considered as first-line, standard hormonal manipulation of HRPC, but the combination with tolerable cytotoxic treatment should be explored further.\" (JTX 8048, at 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Fakih 2002, a clinical review article that evaluated \"the mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid antitumor effects in prostate cancer,\" concluded that \"[g]lucocorticoids may exert an antitumor effect on androgen-independent prostate cancer by suppression of adrenal androgens.

It evaluated the efficacy and safety of administering 200 milligrams of ketoconazole, three times a day, with replacement doses of hydrocortisone. (JXT 8053, at 542). Harris 2002 noted that \"[g]lucocorticoids alone may have antitumor effects mediated either by direct interaction with androgen receptors or by feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 544).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Prior art: combination therapy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   The study published in Gerber 1990 evaluated PSA level changes in fifteen men with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer that were treated with a combination of ketoconazole and prednisone. (DTX 1059, at 1177). The action of ketoconazole is not as focused as that of abiraterone. Abiraterone acetate is a selective drug that inhibits CYP17, one enzyme with two functions: 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase. (1T123:13-20; JTX 8072, at 3). Ketoconazole is a non-specific inhibitor; it acts on the CYP17 enzyme, but also on other points in the pathways of adrenal steroid synthesis. (1T105:2; 6T1262:10-17, 1326:4-19).Ketoconazole inhibits adrenal steroid synthesis and causes adrenal insufficiency. (6T1276:3-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The patients in the Gerber 1990 study were treated with 600 to 900 milligrams of ketoconazole daily and five milligrams of prednisone twice per day. (DTX 1059, at 1177-78). Of the fifteen patients, twelve (80%) had a decrease in PSA levels with a median duration of response of three months. (DTX 1059, at 1177). The other three patients had a prolonged response, greater than eight months, of decreased PSA levels and improvement in bone pain. (DTX 1059, at 1177). Ultimately, Gerber 1990 concluded that \"there appears to be a small subgroup of patients with progressive prostate cancer despite androgen ablation who will benefit from ketoconazole\n   and glucocorticoid treatment.\" (DTX 1059, at 1177).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   O'Donnell 2004, discussed in the preceding section, reported promising results for abiraterone. It also indicated, however, that the treated patients experienced a reduced adrenal reserve. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Attard 2005 (JTX 8072) (noting that all six patients in O'Donnell 2004 \"had a reduced Cortisol response to ACTH stimulation on the 11th day after dosing, suggesting reduced adrenocortical reserve.\"). Researchers speculated that such a deficiency could be addressed with a dose of a steroid, either concomitantly or during times of stress. (1T220:24, 221:7-22, 244:12-19, 249:5-9; DTX 1129, at 2317 (\"Adrenocortical suppression may necessitate concomitant administration of replacement glucocorticoid.\") ). In considering the use of a glucocorticoid, O'Donnell 2004 noted that it was \"common practice\" to administer supplementary hydrocortisone with aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole. (DTX 1129, at 2323).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   O'Donnell 2004 suggested that \"further studies with abiraterone acetate will be required to ascertain if concomitant therapy with glucocorticoid is required on a continuous basis, at times of physiological stress, if patients become symptomatic or indeed at all.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Attard 2005 (JTX 8072, at 1245) (concluding that safety and efficacy of abiraterone should be undertaken where abiraterone was administered daily \"to castrate men with advanced prostate cancer\" and that patients should \"be monitored for the development of glucocorticoid insufficiency\"); Garnick 2006 (DTX 1157, at 919-20) (noting that abiraterone was under development \"as a second-line hormonal therapy for prostate cancer for patients who are refractory;\" and that administration of 800 mg/day resulted in \"hypersecretion of luteinizing hormone,\" which \"may necessitate concomitant treatment with replacement glucorticoid\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   In 2004, Dr. de Bono,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   along with Lara Vidal, published a review article titled \"Reversing Resistance to Targeted Therapy.\" Its subject matter was methods of fighting resistance to cancer treatment and thereby maximizing the treatment's anti-tumor effect. (1T113:9-225; DTX 1135). It noted that hormone therapy was the \"mainstay\" of treating metastatic prostate cancer. (DTX 1135, at 17). Vidal 2004 further observed that circulating low levels of adrenal androgens (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those produced by the adrenal glands rather than the testes) can result in failure to respond to hormone therapy. It further stated, however, that adrenal androgen synthesis can be inhibited by low doses of steroids, or through inhibition of key enzymes using either abiraterone or ketoconazole. (DTX1135, at 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The authors noted generally that combining drugs could improve outcomes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   (1T122:3-4). For example, chemotherapy drugs had been combined to treat lymphoma. (1T122:5-6). Vidal 2004 noted that combination therapies entail \"major logistical challenge[s]\" since they require \"more than one industry partner\"; as a result, researchers were pursuing \"less selective agents that can hit multiple targets.\" (DTX 1135, at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Finally, Sartor 2006 noted that \"[s]econdary hormonal manipulations (i.e, ketoconazole, estrogens, glucocorticoids, antiandrogens, and antiandrogen withdrawal) have long been used in [hormone refractory prostate cancer ], but because no study with these agents has demonstrated a survival advantage, their potential role is not agreed upon by all.\" (PTX 108, at 238).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    d.\n    <em>\n     Objective considerations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   As to factor 4, objective considerations, plaintiffs raise several arguments related to ZYTIGA\u00ae's commercial success, failure of others, skepticism, long-felt need, professional approval and industry praise, and unexpected results. My assessment of these is mixed at best, and I give them correspondingly less weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   As of today, ZYTIGA\u00ae has achieved substantial sales and marketplace success. From April 2011 to the end of 2017, plaintiffs estimate, ZYTIGA\u00ae generated over $5.7 billion in net sales. (8T1790:17-20). Plaintiffs presented evidence that approximately 85% to 95% of ZYTIGA\u00ae prescriptions were being filled in proximity to a fill of prednisone. (8T1803:14-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   During most of that period of ZYTIGA\u00ae's market success there was a blocking patent in place. Prior to the '438 combination-therapy patent was the patent on abiraterone itself. That patent,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%205%2C604%2C213\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 5,604,213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the '213 patent\"), titled \"17-Substituted Steroids Useful in Cancer Treatment,\" was issued February 18, 1997, and expired in December 2016. (PPF at 208). The '213 patent discusses seventeen steroids and their use in the treatment of androgen-dependent and estrogen-dependent disorders. (JTX 8042). The '213 patent specifically discloses abiraterone and suggests a method of using abiraterone acetate for the treatment of prostate cancer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The '213 patent compares the inhibition levels of abiraterone with those of ketoconazole, and reports that abiraterone achieves a superior reduction of testosterone levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It was under the '213 patent that BTG granted Cougar Biotechnology an exclusive license to develop abiraterone in 2004. (9T2044:21-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Plaintiffs point out that two other CYP17 inhibitors had failed to treat advanced prostate cancer (9T1969:24-25); that various pharmaceutical companies declined to pursue abiraterone after 1999 (1T229:10-230:17); and that the O'Donnell 2004 authors had difficulty getting their results published. The anti-cancer effect of abiraterone plus prednisone, then, was unexpected in plaintiffs' opinion. In countering that the argument that ZYTIGA\u00ae met a long-felt need, Defendants note that other treatments, in particular Taxotere and Jevtana, had similar survival benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <strong>\n    e.\n    <em>\n     Obviousness: Discussion and analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   By the priority date of August 25, 2006, abiraterone had been identified in the art as a treatment for prostate cancer. It was understood that abiraterone selectively inhibited the CYP17 enzyme. This was seen as an improvement on ketoconazole, a less selective agent that inhibited CYP17, but also interfered with other metabolic steps. (See O'Donnell 2004; Barrier 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Ketoconazole and aminoglutethimide were known treatments. (6T1260:22-24, 1276:3-6, 1325:13-14, 1327:8-15). Both ketoconazole and abiraterone were steroid inhibitors, and both inhibited the CYP17\n   enzyme (although, as stated, ketoconazole inhibited others steps as well). (6T1262:7-17, 1325:13-1326:19). Barrie 1994 and O'Donnell 2004 both used ketoconazole as a starting point for their discussions regarding abiraterone and its potential to be a more selective inhibitor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (7T1563:7-9; DTX 1062, at 5; DTX 1129, at 2318). Barrie 1994, comparing the inhibition levels of hormone production by abiraterone with ketoconazole, concludes that abiraterone was more effective than ketoconazole in decreasing testosterone levels. (DTX 1062, at 270;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Jarman 1998 (noting that abiraterone caused \"marked reduction of circulating testosterone\" warranting further clinical evaluations (DTX 1085, at 5375) ). O'Donnell 2004 specifically notes that abiraterone's ability to sustain testosterone suppression in castrate males, when given in 500 to 800 milligram doses, suggested that it could be used as a second-line treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DTX 1129, at 2317).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   From all of this, I conclude that abiraterone had been identified in the prior art as a second-line prostate cancer treatment. I also conclude that it was regarded as a superior swap for ketoconazole, in that it performed a parallel function in a more targeted manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   As for prednisone itself, Tannock 1996 suggested that corticosteroids provide some level of palliation to cancer patients. Sartor 1998 goes farther, and suggests that prednisone can cause reduced PSA levels, a marker of anti-cancer effect. It further teaches the administration of 20 mg/day of prednisone as a monotherapy in patients with mCRPC. Plaintiffs may be correct that Sartor 1998 was flawed, in that it was not a prospective study but a retrospective analysis of data, and that it carried a risk of sample bias. A reference, however, \"is prior art for all that it discloses, and there is no requirement that a teaching in the prior art be scientifically tested ... or even guarantee success ... before providing a reason to combine.\" (internal citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    Duramed Pharm., Inc. v.

Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Sartor 1998 teaches that prednisone monotherapy worked to reduce PSA levels in some mCRPC patients, and a POSA would have known that. Whether firm or shaky, the Sartor results disclosed to a POSA that prednisone can have an anti-cancer effect. That conclusion is supported by three other prior art references: Fossa 2001, Fakih 2002, and Harris 2002.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Reduced PSA levels, to be sure, do not necessarily correspond to a survival benefit. Still, PSA levels are an accepted measure of progression of prostate cancer. I am not convinced that PSA levels are so meaningless that researchers would have been dissuaded from pursuing prednisone in combination therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and some additional references (especially O'Donnell\n   2004), I find that there was more than sufficient motivation for a POSA to combine abiraterone with prednisone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Gerber 1990 suggests that a patient whose PSA levels are increasing can be treated with a combination of ketoconazole and a glucocorticoid, which can result in a decrease in PSA levels. Gerber 1990 also teaches that the combination of ketoconazole and five milligrams a day of prednisone, twice daily, is safe and effective for treating hormone-refractory advance prostate cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   O'Donnell 2004 corroborates that in the clinical use of ketoconazole, it was \"common practice\" to administer supplementary hydrocortisone. It states cautiously that \"further studies with abiraterone acetate will be required to ascertain if concomitant therapy with glucocorticoid is required on a continuous basis, at times of physiological stress, if patients become symptomatic or indeed at all.\" (DTX 1129, at 2323). The prior art went so far as to identify specific dosages: between ten and twenty milligrams per day of prednisone (Gerber 1990; Tannock 1996; Sartor 1998; Fossa 2001); and 800 milligrams of abiraterone. (Gerber 1990; O'Donnell 2004; Garnick 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   A POSA would have interpreted ketoconazole's clinical use as a basis to take the next investigative steps with abiraterone. It made sense to replace ketoconazole with abiraterone, as it became clear that abiraterone was a superior, more selective inhibitor. Co-administration of 10mg per day of prednisone would naturally carry over from the ketoconazole combination therapy to the abiraterone combination therapy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   I believe a POSA would have been concerned about the potential reduction in Cortisol as a side effect of abiraterone's inhibition of CYP17. Specifically, a POSA would have seen the potential for resulting excess mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) and adrenal insufficiency. Plaintiffs' reservations about the Synacthen test for adrenal insufficiency\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   are, I believe, well-taken. They do not, however, outweigh the clear import of O'Donnell 2004. O'Donnell 2004 states that \"[s]ome impact on adrenal reserve was predictable from the steroid synthesis pathway.\" That conclusion is consistent with defendants' expert's testimony and with the literature relied upon by defendants' expert. (6T1287:3-1292:8; DTX 1096). O'Donnell 2004 suggests that a practitioner could address those side effects through coadministration of a glucocorticoid. To be sure, the paper appears to be agnostic about whether coadministration would (or would always) be necessary. It falls far short, however, of concluding that such coadministration is unnecessary or should be avoided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DePuy Spine, Inc. v.

I therefore do not agree, as plaintiffs suggest, that prior art \"taught away\" from the combination therapy. Plaintiffs further suggest that there were other options and theories on how to treat mCRPC, and that there were other anti-cancer agents, perhaps even more promising ones. Nevertheless, the prior art clearly pointed to coadministration of abiraterone with a glucocorticoid.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9144466\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/1195/#p1200\">\n    391 F.3d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1200 (Fed.

(1T229:23-230:3). Dr. Judson pointed to no further attempts to find a licensing partner. (1T229:12-14). And starting in 2004, of course, both the blocking patent and the Cougar license (which was exclusive) prevented non-owners or licensees from entering the market.

Plaintiff advances arguments related to the delayed publication of the study results underlying O'Donnell 2004, a negative comment received in response to those results, the failure to obtain a licensing partner after 1999 and before 2004, the uncertainty of Dr. de Bono's colleagues in proceeding with the extension study, and an article from 1999 that discounted hormonal therapies. Much of that skepticism seems to be directed to abiraterone itself, rather than the claimed combination. And the context is important: as noted above, prior art suggested the combination of abiraterone and glucocorticoids to treat prostate-cancer, and by 1997 industry researchers had patented abiraterone itself. By then, multiple experts had concluded that it was worth pursuing abiraterone as a treatment for prostate cancer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section II.A.2.a,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   This skepticism factor does not point strongly either way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   I next address the plaintiffs' claims that the patented invention addressed a long-felt need and had unexpected results. \"[L]ong-felt need is analyzed as of the date of an articulated identified problem and evidence of efforts to solve that problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Tex.

Induced infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   The gist of the induced infringement claim here is that the ANDA label, which specifies indications and proper use of the abiraterone/prednisone combination therapy, would induce physicians' direct infringement of the method claimed in the '438 patent. The label by definition embodies the range of uses and indications that are approved by the FDA. Defendants argue that because the allegedly infringing use would fall outside the scope of the FDA-approved use, the ANDA label does not induce infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   It's a subtle argument. Both the patent and the label indications, followed faithfully, would lead to the same actions, undertaken in the same manner and for the same reason: the administration of abiraterone and prednisone, in combination, to treat a class of patients who suffer from mCRPC, with the goal of slowing the progression of the disease. The defendants, however, argue that the '438 patent claims that\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   component (abiraterone, prednisone ) has an anti-cancer effect. The FDA, in contrast, allegedly approved administration of the prednisone component of the combination only for its palliative effect, or to address side effects. Therefore, the argument runs, the administration of the combination therapy in accordance with the FDA-approved label would not infringe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Defendants ask, in effect, that the court look behind the Indications and Usage section of the label, which provides for combination therapy and does not segregate the\n   contribution of each component. That would require the Court to reanalyze the clinical data as if it were a regulatory body, and posit a revised Indication which, in defendants' estimation, would better fit the underlying science. I do not sit to reconstruct a theoretical ruling by an ideal FDA; in assessing the scope of the FDA approval, I am confined to the actual ruling of the actual FDA. In short, this is not an appeal of the FDA's decision, but only an attempt to define its scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   \"Whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warner-Lambert Co. v.

There, the defendants sought to market a generic form of Yasmin, a branded oral contraceptive. The FDA had granted plaintiffs' NDA seeking approval of Yasmin \"for oral contraception.\" 676 F.3d at 1319. The defendants' ANDAs sought FDA approval to market generic forms of Yasmin for the same approved use, \"oral contraception.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants filed paragraph IV certifications, and the plaintiffs filed suit against the ANDA applicants, alleging infringement of a method-of-use patent. That patent's claims recited that the drug \"achieves three effects simultaneously: a contraceptive (or gestagenic) effect, an anti-androgenic effect ... and an anti-aldosterone effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1320. Defendants filed a motion for judgment in their favor on the pleadings; they would not infringe, they said, because they sought to market the generic form of Yasmin \"only for oral contraception and not for the combination of uses claimed in the [ ] patent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The district court agreed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiffs acknowledged that both the FDA-approved label and the proposed generic labels stated in their Indications and Usage sections that the drug was to be used as an \"oral contraceptive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1320. The \"Clinical Pharmacology\" section of the label, however, referred to the other two effects,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the anti-androgenic and anti-aldosterone effects. Based on that language, the plaintiffs argued that the FDA had approved \"the use of Yasmin to induce those effects\" in addition to the contraceptive effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1322, 1324.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   The Federal Circuit held that, as to this issue, it is the Usages and Indications\n   section that does the real work. The court expressly rejected the notion that an indication could be implied from another section of the label, an approach that would not make regulatory sense. A particular use or indication for a drug is FDA-approved only when the safety and efficacy of that use has been established. The inclusion of such a use in the label's Indications and Usage section constitutes the necessary \"[a]cknowledgement of the safety and efficacy of that specific method of use.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1324.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Mention in the Clinical Pharmacology section, the court held, is not the same thing at all:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   The reference in the Clinical Pharmacology section of the label to the anti-mineralocorticoid and anti-androgenic activity of drospirenone is certainly not a direct indication of an appropriate use for Yasmin, and even if it could be considered an \"implied or suggested\" indication of an appropriate use, the regulation expressly states that such implied or suggested uses do not constitute approved uses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1323.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   The Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Bayer Schering\n   </em>\n   discussed extrinsic evidence submitted by the plaintiffs, including physicians' declarations and marketing materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1324. These documents, said the plaintiffs, established a context that suggested FDA approval of Yasmin as safe and effective not just for contraception, but for the claimed combination of three effects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Federal Circuit demurred. This evidence, the Court held, demonstrated that the FDA was\n   <em>\n    aware\n   </em>\n   that Yasmin could cause the other two effects, not that the FDA had\n   <em>\n    approved\n   </em>\n   the safety and efficacy of the medication for the claimed combination of effects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court held that the FDA had approved Yasmin for use only as an oral contraceptive, and that defendants did not commit infringement. The defendants sought to market their drug solely for that approved use as a contraceptive, while the patent claimed the trio of uses in combination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1326.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   Following the lead of\n   <em>\n    Bayer\n   </em>\n   , I will not read an indication into the ZYTIGA\u00ae label or ANDA labels that is not there. The Indications and Usage section is clear that abiraterone and prednisone are to be used in combination for the treatment of mCRPC. That indication signifies that these agents are FDA-approved in combination to treat cancer. (2T400:16-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   Defendants' FDA expert, Dr. Akhilesh Nagaich, testified persuasively that prednisone would not have been identified in the Indications and Usage section if its sole approved purpose were the treatment of side effects, and I agree. (4T861:21-862:2). I also credit Dr. O'Shea's testimony, which is consistent with the FDA regulations, that if prednisone were approved solely to treat side effects of abiraterone, it would probably not appear in the Indications section, but only in the label's dosage and administration section, or the warnings and precautions section. (2T401:19-402:1, 405:1-6). It is also likely that if prednisone had been approved only to alleviate side effects, the label would simply have said so. (2T402:2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   An item's inclusion in the Indications and Usage section cannot be brushed aside; to place it there is a critical regulatory decision. Indeed, as noted above, it's essentially that or nothing; indications\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   listed in the Indications and Usage section cannot be derived by implication from other sections of the labeling.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20201.57\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(iv) (\"Indications or uses must not be implied or suggested in other sections of the labeling\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bayer Schering\n   </em>\n   , 676 F.3d at 1323-24 ;\n   <em>\n    Warner-Lambert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381389\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/1348/#p1363\">\n    316 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1352 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   <em>\n    Shire LLC v.

To be sure, there are indications in the record that the FDA was aware of prednisone's palliative benefits. To be sure, underlying NDA submissions emphasize the anti-cancer effect of abiraterone rather than that of prednisone. And there there are marketing materials that tout the palliative effects of prednisone without mentioning its anti-cancer effect. Giving these proofs due latitude, I nevertheless conclude that they do not negate what the FDA actually did in its approval of the label's Indications and Uses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bayer Schering\n   </em>\n   , 676 F.3d at 1323-24 (refusing to imply indication from marketing materials, clinical pharmacology section of label at issue, and from physician's declarations). I cannot find that prednisone was approved as part of ZYTIGA\u00ae's indication solely for its benefits with respect to palliation and side effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   Concededly, this Court, like the parties, must wrestle with an irreducible level of ambiguity in a combination-therapy approval. As defendants say, the Indications and Uses do not, for example, attribute a percentage of efficacy to each component; the most that can be said is that the FDA has approved the combination as safe and effective. Similarly, defendants attack plaintiffs' cited combination-study clinical trials which, in defendants' view, are confounded and fail to establish the independent contribution of prednisone to the efficacy of the combination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Again, the fact remains that the FDA did approve the combination-based treatment\n   of mCRPC based on a combination study. Perhaps the studies could have been better designed. Perhaps the researchers could have found an ethical means of definitively isolating the contribution of each component.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   But from arguments that the FDA\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   not have approved an indication, I cannot leap to the conclusion that it\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   not. That, to me, is an important methodological lesson to be drawn from the approach of\n   <em>\n    Bayer.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   I treat defendants' other two cited cases more briefly. In\n   <em>\n    Warner-Lambert\n   </em>\n   , the branded manufacturer held a patent for a method of \"treating neurodegenerative diseases\" using a drug known as gabapentin.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381389\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/1348/#p1363\">\n    316 F.3d at 1351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Its NDA, however, led to approval of gabapentin for use in \"adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizure with and without secondary generalization in adults with epilepsy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381389\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/1348/#p1363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9381389\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/1348/#p1363\">\n    at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Cir. 2003), the Federal Circuit held that an ANDA applicant's labeled indication for reducing intraocular pressure would not induce infringement of patented methods of \"protecting the optic nerve and retina\" and \"providing neural protection.\" Because the patent-claimed uses were not approved by the FDA, the ANDA applicant could not be held liable for infringement even if the proposed drug in fact had those additional protective effects in patients who took the drug for the approved purpose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160943\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/1322/#p1324\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160943\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/1322/#p1324\">\n    at 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   These three cited cases,\n   <em>\n    Bayer\n   </em>\n   in particular, eschewed the kind of searching review of the FDA record and regulatory \"do-over\" that defendants propose. The common feature of these three cases is that, to decide the induced-infringement issue, those courts compared the wording of the label to the patent claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   Following that approach, I find that the combination therapy embodied in the label meets the claim limitations of the patent. The Indication on the ZYTIGA\u00ae label is clear: \"ZYTIGA is indicated in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).\" (PTX 406). That language aligns with the language of Claim 1 of the patent: \"A method for the treatment of a prostate cancer in a human comprising administering to said human a therapeutically effective amount of abiraterone acetate ... and a therapeutically effective amount of prednisone.\" (JTX 8000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   Although the Indications and Usage section is paramount, I observe that the dosing section and the clinical studies section corroborate the reasoning above. The 301 study established that the combination of the two drugs has an anti-cancer effect. Section 14 of the label, which highlights the clinical studies that were completed, states that \"[t]he efficacy and safety\n   <em>\n    of ZYTIGA with prednisone\n   </em>\n   was established in three randomized, placebo-controlled, international clinical studies.\" (PDX 406 at 21 (emphasis added); 2T418:1-4). The effectiveness\n   seen in the studies is attributed to abiraterone plus prednisone, not simply abiraterone. (2T418:6-7; 3T588:5-7). The dosing section recommends that both drugs be administered in specific doses for the purpose of treating mCRPC. In short, it is the combination, and not one drug to the exclusion of the other, that was found safe and effective as a treatment for mCRPC. The FDA meant what it said when it listed the combination in the approved Indications and Uses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   The ZYTIGA\u00ae Indications and Usage section encompasses an FDA-approved method, the administration of abiraterone plus prednisone for the treatment of mCRPC. That being the patented method, I find that the labels encompass infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Intent to induce infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   The next, interrelated question is whether the ANDA defendants' proposed abiraterone labels evince a specific intent to encourage physicians to infringe the '438 patent. To summarize, the '438 patent claims the administration of a \"therapeutically effective amount of abiraterone acetate\" and a \"therapeutically effective amount of prednisone,\" which is defined in dependent claims as 1000mg/day of abiraterone and 10 mg/day of prednisone, to a mCRPC patient. I find that the labels embody an intent to induce a physician to do just that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   Inducement can be established \"where there is '[e]vidence of active steps taken to encourage direct infringement,' which can in turn be found in 'advertising an infringing use or instructing how to engage in an infringing use.' \"\n   <em>\n    Takeda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4183619\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/625/#p629\">\n    785 F.3d at 630-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v.

(2T408:3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   Again, the Indications and Usage section is paramount, but I find corroboration elsewhere. The approved \"Dosage and Administration\" section of the 2018 ZYTIGA\u00ae label reads, in part: \"Recommended Dose for metastatic CRPC ... The recommended dose of ZYTIGA is 1,000 mg (two 500 mg tablets or four 250 mg tablets) administered orally once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg administered orally twice daily.\" (PTX 406).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   Defendants' labels all contain Dosage sections that recommend administering 1000mg/day of abiraterone acetate, and 10mg/day of prednisone. (DE 502, at 94 \u00b6 73). Amneal's, DRL's, Teva's, and Wockhardt's proposed Dosage sections track the wording of ZYTIGA\u00ae's 2018 label. (2T413:23-3). They state the recommended \"recommended dosage\n   <em>\n    for mCRPC\n   </em>\n   .\" (2T413:25-414:3 (emphasis added) ) The other defendants' labels track the pre-2018 ZYTIGA\u00ae label in that they state the \"recommended dosage\" but omit the words \"for mCRPC.\" I do not regard the distinction as significant; everyone agrees that\n   the relevant target group for the ANDA consists of mCRPC patients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   The similarities between plaintiffs' and defendants' Indications and Dosing sections are manifest. Defendants nonetheless contend that this, in itself, is not sufficient to establish inducement because the labels do not direct doctors to use prednisone to fight cancer, as opposed to addressing abiraterone's side effects. (DBr. at 27). In a similar vein, defendants argue that they do not \"know\" that prednisone has anti-cancer effects. Lacking such knowledge, defendants say, they cannot be regarded as intentionally promoting such use. (DBr. at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   The intent required here is not the kind of specific intent required by the criminal law.

The noninfringing \"use,\" then, is not so easily separated from the infringing one. This is not like using a patented anvil to moor a boat. The distinction between infringement and noninfringement seems to turn, not on any external fact, but on the subjective mental processes of the prescribing physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Warner-Lambert\n   </em>\n   is therefore misplaced; that case involved an off-label use to treat a separate condition.

I conclude that it is not, and for this reason, too, my consideration of validity issues is not estopped. 1 think finality, for these purposes, should track the concept as it is used in the closely related context of exhaustion and appealability. \"The parties to an appeal to the Board may not appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under \u00a7 1.983 of this title [Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in inter partes reexamination] until all parties' rights to request rehearing have been exhausted, at which time the decision of the Board is\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      final\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    and appealable by any party to the appeal to the Board.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2041.81\">\n     37 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    37 C.F.R. 90.3(b)(1) (deadline to appeal runs from PTAB's action on request for rehearing).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-355\">\n    A contrary view of finality would lead to the same conundrum identified above-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the possibility of issuance of a mandatory injunction based on a PTAB decision treated by the plaintiff as \"final,\" but only for purposes of \u00a7 315(e) estoppel (because the plaintiff itself sought reconsideration).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-356\">\n    I observe that these are issues which will tend to arise in the interim when the PTAB and court proceedings are not synchronized.
