Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia at 12:42 AM that morning, en route to Beijing, China, with 227 passengers and 12 crew members aboard the plane. Thirty-nine minutes after takeoff, while the Boeing 777 aircraft was flying over the South China Sea and transitioning from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace, Malaysian air traffic controllers lost radar contact with the aircraft. At Malaysia's behest, a massive international search and rescue effort ensued, but neither the plane nor any wreckage was recovered, and on January 28, 2015, the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation (\"MDCA\") announced that all aboard Flight MH370 were presumed deceased. Some pieces of wreckage have since washed ashore on islands in the Indian Ocean and on the eastern coast of Africa, but, to date, most of the plane remains unaccounted for, including the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following the disappearance of Flight MH370, litigation commenced in both Malaysia and in the United States; many plaintiffs have filed suit in both jurisdictions. In the United States, complaints were filed in California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, New York, South Carolina, and Washington state, and the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation subsequently centralized the pretrial proceedings with respect to all of these cases in this District. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transfer Order, ECF No. 1.) The complaints in these matters can generally be grouped into two categories. First, there are cases that assert claims under the Montreal Convention against the defendant airlines-Malaysia Airlines System Berhad (Administrator Appointed) (\"MAS\") and Malaysia Airlines Berhad (\"MAB\")-and/or their insurers, Allianz Global Corporate &amp; Specialty SE (\"AGCS SE\"), and Henning Haagen, an officer at AGCS SE. Second, there are cases that assert common law wrongful death and products liability claims against airplane manufacturer Boeing, including claims based on a\n   <em>\n    res ipsa loquitor\n   </em>\n   tort theory. There is also a single complaint that resides in the overlap between these two groups-it asserts Montreal Convention, wrongful death, and personal injury claims, and names MAS, MAB, AGCS SE, Haagen, and Boeing as defendants. All told, 40 complaints are currently pending in this MDL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before this Court at present are five ripe motions pertaining to particular threshold issues that various defendants have raised: (1) a joint motion seeking dismissal of all pending cases based on the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , in which Defendants argue that it would be more convenient to ligate these matters in Malaysia, as opposed to the United States\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Joint Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss on the Ground of\n   <em>\n    Forum Non Conveniens\n   </em>\n   (\"FNC Mem.\"), ECF No. 37-1); (2) a motion by MAS and MAB seeking dismissal of the claims against them on the grounds that they are agencies of the Malaysian government and immune from suit in United States courts pursuant to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201330\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1602 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

MAS's Mem. in Supp. of Its Rule 12(b)(1) Mot. to Dismiss on the Ground of Lack of Subject Matter Juris. Pursuant to the Montreal Convention (\"Montreal Convention Mem.\"), ECF No. 38-1);\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) a motion by AGCS SE seeking dismissal of the claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction, because it is a foreign company that did not engage in any conduct connected to the loss of Flight MH370 in any of the jurisdictions in which it has been sued (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. AGCS SE's Rule 12(b)(2) Mot. to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Juris. (\"AGCS SE Pers. Juris. Mot.\"), ECF No. 35-1); and (5) a motion by AGCS SE and Haagen seeking dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, in which they argue that Plaintiffs' attempt to make them representatives of MAS and MAB, based solely on their status as alleged insurers of MAS, has no legal foundation (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs. AGCS SE and Henning Haagen's Mem. in Supp. of Their Rule 12(b)(6) Mot. to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim (\"Reinsurer Rule 12(b)(6) Mem.\"), ECF No. 36-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Court has carefully parsed the myriad dismissal arguments Defendants have presented, and as fully explained below, it has determined that, on balance, the claims asserted in the consolidated complaints have a substantial and overriding nexus to Malaysia that outweighs the less substantial connection to the United States. As such, litigation of these claims in the United States is comparatively inconvenient, and Defendants' joint motion for dismissal based on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Plaintiffs' cases will be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice. The remaining threshold motions will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as moot.

However, this \"blip\" appeared to be diverting from Flight MH370's northerly flight plan; it briefly veered to the right, and then turned left dramatically, flying west-southwest across Malaysia, at variable altitudes and speeds, before turning right when the plane was south of Penang Island, off of the western coast of Malaysia.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Scheduling Order, ECF No. 14, at 1-2.) Following the discovery period, Defendants filed the joint motion seeking dismissal under the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    that is the subject of this opinion.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    FNC Opp'n at 21-23.) They also argue that the balance of private and public factors weighs in favor of dismissal, because the vast majority of evidence regarding liability is in Malaysia, and that it would be difficult to obtain the testimony of unwilling Malaysian witnesses in the United States. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 24-32.)

Moreover, Defendants contend that Malaysia's interest in resolving lawsuits arising from the disappearance of Flight\n    MH370 far outweighs any interest the United States has in this matter, even taking into account Boeing's status as an American company and the presence of a few American plaintiffs and decedents.

Both sets of plaintiffs' briefs also maintain that little, if any, relevant evidence is located in Malaysia because the plane was never found and the Malaysian investigators were unable to determine the cause of the disappearance even after conducting an extensive investigation. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Podhurst FNC Opp'n at 35-37; Motley Rice FNC Opp'n at 10.) Plaintiffs further maintain that all records related to Boeing are located in the United States, and that other relevant evidence is located in other countries such as China (records related to Chinese decedents), the United Kingdom (satellite data records), or Australia (search records). (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Podhurst FNC Opp'n at 30-42; Motley Rice FNC Opp'n at 8-11). In this regard, the Podhurst Plaintiffs emphasize that none of the decedents that Podhurst represents are from Malaysia, and that certain of the decedents and plaintiffs in cases they have filed have connections to the United States. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Podhurst FNC Opp'n at 17-18.)

ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Defendants' joint motion for dismissal of the instant MDL cases on\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    grounds requires this Court to consider the adequacy of Malaysia as a forum for litigating claims related to this incident, and, as reflected in the myriad applicable public and private interest factors, the Court must also balance the significant relationship between Malaysia and the claims brought in these cases, on the one hand, against the manifestly less-substantial connection between the Flight MH370 disaster and the United States, on the other. The substantial connections that exist between the country of Malaysia and the tragic incident that precipitated the legal actions that comprise the instant MDL are undeniable, as explained below. Boeing's role as the missing plane's manufacturer and the alleged U.S. citizenship or resident status of a few of the named plaintiffs and decedents are significant considerations too, but this Court's assessment of the established\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    factors compels the conclusion that neither the Montreal Convention claims nor the wrongful death and products liability claims that are at issue in these cases are ultimately more conveniently litigated in the United States than in Malaysia. As a result, and for the reasons discussed below, the Court concludes that Defendants' motion for dismissal based on\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    must be granted, and the 40 pending cases that compromise this MDL must be dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     A. On Balance, And When Compared To Malaysia, The United States Is An Inconvenient Forum For The Litigation Of Plaintiffs' Montreal Convention Claims Against MAS/MAB\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Six cases currently pending in this MDL assert Montreal Convention claims against MAS and MAB (and, in two instances, their affiliated insurers): two of the cases that the Podhurst Plaintiffs have filed, and four of the cases that the Motley Rice Plaintiffs have filed.\n    <em>\n     See Wood v. Malaysia Airlines Berhad\n    </em>\n    , 16cv0053;\n    <em>\n     Gaspard v. Malaysia Airlines Berhad\n    </em>\n    , 16cv0419;\n    <em>\n     Smith v.

Careful consideration of the established\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    factors persuades this Court that, notwithstanding the fact that some of these cases involve U.S. plaintiffs or decedents, the Montreal Convention claims that these cases raise would be more conveniently litigated in Malaysia than the United States.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Piper Aircraft Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n     454 U.S. at 255-56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n     102 S.Ct. 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Malaysia Is An Available And Adequate Forum For Litigation Of Plaintiffs' Montreal Convention Claims\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    With respect to the first factor in the\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    analysis, this Court readily finds that Malaysia is an available and adequate alternative forum for litigation of Plaintiffs' Montreal Convention claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Giro, Inc. v.

Apr. 5, 1991) (same). The Podhurst Plaintiffs do not dispute that the Malaysian courts are available and adequate with respect to litigating these claims (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Podhurst FNC Opp'n at 20 n.30), and as noted, cases brought against MAS and MAB relating to the Flight MH370 disaster are currently pending in that country's courts (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Singh Decl. \u00b6 7). Malaysia is also a signatory to the Montreal Convention, and because Malaysia is both the domicile and the principal place of business of the airline that operated Flight MH370, Malaysian courts have the power to hear Plaintiffs' Montreal Convention claims under the terms of the Montreal Convention itself.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Montreal Conv., Art. 33.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The Motley Rice Plaintiffs contend nevertheless that Malaysia is not an available and adequate forum for the purpose of the\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    analysis because, due to the Malaysian legislature's enactment of Act 765, \"there is nothing left of MAS except one 'Administrator' who has no MAS property, records or assets to administer.\" (Motley Rice FNC Opp'n at 12.) In this Court's view, this assertion is an unpersuasive basis for continuing to litigate these matters in the United States for at least two reasons. First of all, it appears that MAS's status as a former commercial entity is immaterial to its ability to satisfy any judgment against it under the Montreal Convention or otherwise, because MAS holds an insurance policy from which claims and judgments can be paid. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Decl. of Brendan Baxter, Ex. A to AGCS SE Pers. Juris. Mot., ECF No. 35-2, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.) Moreover, even if MAS is judgment-proof, that status hardly compels the conclusion that the United States is a more convenient forum, which is the relevant issue with respect to the\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    analysis.

It was Malaysia's national air carrier-MAS-that operated Flight MH370, and the ill-fated aircraft departed from an airport in Kuala Lumpur shortly before its disappearance, as detailed and documented in Part I.A.1 above. Malaysian air traffic controllers were the last persons to have direct contact with the pilot and crew, who were themselves Malaysian citizens. And after the aircraft vanished, Malaysian officials were responsible for leading the civil safety investigation pursuant to an international treaty. Malaysian authorities further conducted a separate criminal investigation concerning individuals who were known to have contact with the flight and/or aircraft, and the Malaysian court system has now undertaken to entertain a host of lawsuits that were filed in that jurisdiction by representatives and heirs of the decedents-in fact, 77 of the 88 Flight MH370 passengers whose interests are represented in the cases that are now before this Court are also the subject of pending Malaysian lawsuits that arise out of these same unfortunate circumstances.

The parties here have already pointed to a variety of jurisdictions as possible sources of governing law in this case, including Malaysian law, Chinese law, the U.S. Death on the High Seas Act, and the common law of the various states where the plaintiffs initially filed their complaints.

It is also potentially troubling that this Court might be called upon to consider the validity of Act 765, which the Motley Rice Plaintiffs have alleged is invalid and improper. (Motley Rice FNC Opp'n at 13-16.) Questions regarding the validity of foreign laws that are effective in foreign countries are better left to courts in those countries,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hourani\n    </em>\n    , 796 F.3d at 11-12 ; thus, the possibility that this Court might have to address such complex, novel legal issues is another public interest factor that weighs heavily in favor of dismissing the Montreal Convention claim cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    b.\n    <em>\n     The Private Interests Also Generally Weigh In Favor Of Litigating Plaintiffs' Montreal Convention Claims In Malaysia\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    As explained above, the relevant private interest factors in the\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    analysis include \"the relative ease of access to sources of proof; [the] availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling [witnesses] and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing[ ] witnesses; [the] possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate to the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.\"\n    <em>\n     Gulf Oil Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354212\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/501/#p508\">\n     330 U.S. at 508\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"354212\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/501/#p508\">\n     67 S.Ct. 839\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This Court's evaluation of these and similar private interest factors begins with the recognition that standard Montreal Convention claims are strict liability claims that ordinarily raise limited questions of fact-specifically, whether an accident occurred with respect to a carrier's aircraft, and the amount of damages suffered.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Art. 21, Montreal Conv. (imposing strict liability on a carrier for damages up to a set amount of special drawing rights). Moreover, here, in addition to the lack of any dispute regarding the existence of the Flight MH370 disaster, Plaintiffs have agreed to make all damages-related evidence available, at their own expense, in the United States. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Podhurst FNC Opp'n at 33 n.59.) Thus, litigation of Plaintiff's strict liability Montreal Convention claims in the United States will not necessarily inconvenience Defendants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    However, with respect to the Montreal Convention claims at issue in this MDL, the private interest-balancing inquiry does not stop there, because Plaintiffs have made clear that they are seeking damages\n    <em>\n     in excess\n    </em>\n    of the first 113,000 special drawing rights. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Compl.,\n    <em>\n     Wood v. Malaysia Airlines Berhad\n    </em>\n    , 16cv0053, ECF No. 1, \u00b6 59; Compl.,\n    <em>\n     Smith v. Malaysia Airlines Berhad\n    </em>\n    , 16cv0439, ECF No. 1, \u00b6 115.) The Montreal Convention permits plaintiffs to recover such excess damages (assuming their evidence establishes those loss values), but the carrier is also authorized to defend against any such judgment by demonstrating that the \"accident is entirely attributable to events wholly outside the carrier's control.\"\n    <em>\n     Delgado\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%209838339\">\n     2013 WL 9838339\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4. And it is\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    inquiry that will necessarily expand the scope of the litigation related to Plaintiffs' Montreal Convention claims such that litigating these claims in the United States could become unduly burdensome.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    This is so because the logical alternative party to which MAS/MAB could point as being responsible for the disappearance of Flight MH370 is aircraft manufacturer Boeing-Plaintiffs have acknowledged (and embraced) this possibility, presumably because Boeing is a U.S. corporation.

And Boeing's response to any such charge might well be to contend that the design and manufacture of the aircraft was not responsible for Flight MH370's disappearance; instead its loss was caused by some other factor-such as pilot suicide, cargo fire, or terrorism-and such allegations plainly open the door to an assessment of what, in fact, caused Flight MH370 to disappear. In other words, because a carrier sued under the Montreal Convention can cast blame on other potentially responsible parties to defend against the plaintiffs' recovery of amounts in excess of the 113,000 drawing rights strict-liability cap, and those other parties can point to other potential causes, any claim for excess damages\n    <em>\n     necessarily\n    </em>\n    involves the possibility of full-blown litigation into the fault issue that the strict-liability aspect of Montreal Convention claims seeks to avoid.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    And, of course, once liability is at issue, MAS/MAB and any other implead defendants would be entitled to take discovery on that topic.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P 26(b) (authorizing parties to take discovery \"regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense\"). Here, liability-related evidence might include satellite-communication evidence located in the United Kingdom, debris evidence in France and Australia, and search records that are also located in Australia, and the discovery quest would also inevitably include seeking the potentially vast amounts of materials and information that are located in Malaysia, including personnel files, airline maintenance records, manuals, air traffic control recordings, video recordings, cargo records, and bank records.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pain\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5685401,1353794\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/637/775/\">\n     637 F.2d at 786-87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that maintenance records and accident reports prepared by a foreign government were relevant to an aircraft manufacturer's defense or tort claims arising from crash).

Plaintiffs fail to cite a single case that squarely supports the proposition that a civil defendant is barred from revisiting issues and evidence that were explored during an investigation conducted under Annex 13 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, much less that a court must grant preclusive effect to the conclusions of any such Annex 13 investigation in the context of related civil litigation. Rather, it is axiomatic that civil defendants have the right to develop and present their defense, and in this case, because Plaintiffs are seeking damages in excess of the strict-liability drawing rights cap, the defense would necessarily involve discovery pertaining to the issue of fault, including exploration of any and all potential causes of the disappearance of Flight MH370.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nolan v.

First, except as discussed in Part IV.A.2(c) below, the vast majority of the Montreal Convention decedents appear to have no connections whatsoever to the United States or Malaysia. 42 of the 45 decedents who are referenced in Motley Rice's cases, in particular, are citizens of China. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    , Compl.,\n    <em>\n     Zhang v. Malaysia Airlines Berhad\n    </em>\n    , 16cv1048, ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 44-84; Compl.,\n    <em>\n     Kanan v.

Malaysia Airlines Berhad\n    </em>\n    , 16cv0439, ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42 (naming two American decedents).) The plaintiffs who are proceeding on behalf of these 42 individuals appear to have brought these Montreal Convention claims in the United States solely by virtue of Defendants AGCS SE American and Haagen-alleged reinsurers of MAS/MAB who purportedly do business in the United States. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Resp. in Opp'n to Def. MAB's Mot. to Dismiss Pls.' Compls. on the Ground of Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction Pursuant to the Montreal Convention, ECF No. 66 at 12-13.) This means that most of the evidence related to the damages claimed in\n    Motley Rice's cases will likely be located in China or Malaysia. And it is no more convenient to have that evidence translated into English and brought to the United States than it is to have that evidence translated to Malay and brought to the Malaysian courts to be considered along with any other evidence pertaining to both damages and liability that the parties will marshal in litigating the expanded universe of issues that these Montreal Convention claims raise.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Air Crash at Madrid, Spain, on Aug. 20, 2008\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277820\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/1020/#p1033\">\n     893 F.Supp.2d 1020\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1033 (C.D.

That evidence, too, will be undoubtedly be located in Malaysia-yet another factor that weighs in favor of dismissal of Plaintiffs' Montreal Convention claims on\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    grounds.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    c.\n    <em>\n     The Fact That Some Of Plaintiffs' Montreal Convention Claims Involve Plaintiffs Or Decedents With United States Connections Is Insufficient to Alter The Outcome\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The strongest point that Plaintiffs make in favor of maintaining the Montreal Convention claims against MAS/MAB in United States courts is the fact that a plaintiff's choice of forum generally controls, and that some of the plaintiffs and/or decedents in the cases at issue here have connections to the United States.

With respect to the Wang Decedents, the United States' interest in these claims is still minimal, as the sole connection to this country (other than the citizenship of the personal representative) is the fact that the Wang Decedents' tickets were purchased through a US-based online travel agent. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Gaspard Compl. \u00b6 18(g).) Likewise, the United States has a relatively minor interest in claims associated with the death of Zhang, because although she was a United States green card holder, she had been residing in China with her new husband in the years prior to her death.

All told, the Montreal Convention cases in this MDL involve only six U.S. citizens with a direct connection to the Flight MH370 tragedy, as either plaintiffs or decedents. Among the hundreds of passengers on that flight, only three were citizens of the United States (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Part IV.A.2.a.,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    ), and while the United States undoubtedly has a strong public interest in the claims involving their deaths, its interest pales in comparison to Malaysia's interest in litigating these claims. Malaysia's public interest includes not only an interest in the untimely deaths of the Malaysian pilot and crew, but also an interest in determining precisely what happened to Flight MH370, given that a Malaysian airline owned, operated, and maintained the aircraft; the flight took off from an airport in Malaysia for a destination outside the United States; and it disappeared from radar\n    when Malaysian air traffic controllers were handing off the flight. And Malaysian authorities made substantial investments of time and resources in the wake of this disaster: Malaysia conducted extensive civil and criminal investigations, and changes in Malaysian law led to the creation of a new national Malaysian airline. It is Malaysia's strong interest in the events that give rise to the claims at issue here that makes this a distinctly\n    <em>\n     Malaysian\n    </em>\n    tragedy, notwithstanding the presence of the few Americans onboard Flight MH370. Thus, just as the\n    <em>\n     AirFrance\n    </em>\n    court found that France had a greater public interest in the Montreal Convention claims concerning U.S. plaintiffs and decedents than the United States did, so too does this Court find that, on balance and comparatively speaking, Malaysia has a greater public interest in the instant Montreal Convention claims, even taking into account the United States citizenship of plaintiffs Wood, Smith, and Gaspard, and of Philip Wood and the Meng children.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    In addition to this public interest, this Court must also consider the private interests that, as noted above, implicate the practicality of litigating a particular matter in one forum or another.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Am. Dredging Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"233169\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/443/#p448\">\n     510 U.S. at 448\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"233169\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/443/#p448\">\n     114 S.Ct. 981\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (requiring the court to consider, among other things, access to sources of proof, enforceability of judgment, and the location of relevant evidence and witnesses). When considering the Montreal Convention claims of plaintiffs and decedents with connections to the United States, the most substantial difference on the private interest front could be the location of, and access to, evidence and witnesses regarding damages. However, no such differences exist with respect to the Meng children who, while United States citizens, spent almost all of their lives with their parents in China. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Resps. to MAS's and MAB's First Set of Interrogs. for Bing Meng, at Nos. 2-3, Ex. 14 to FNC Mem., ECF No. 37-16.) Zhang and the Wang Decedents are on somewhat different footing: Zhang had some employment history in the United States and allegedly intended to return there, even though her most recent work history appears to have been in China (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Motley Rice Montreal Convention Opp'n at 6), and Rui Wang's wages from a U.S.-based employer supported the Wang Decedents (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Podhurst FNC Opp'n at 33). Likewise, evidence regarding damages in regard to Decedent Wood's estate and his heirs will likely be located in the United States, given his United States citizenship and family connections, and his employment with IBM. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Podhurst FNC Opp'n at 32-33.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Nevertheless, as discussed in Part IV.A.2.b.,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the relevant evidence in this case extends beyond damages and into the realm of causation. And as far as this Court can tell, a substantial amount of this causation evidence is located outside of the United States, including documentary items such as cargo records, personnel files, airline maintenance records, manuals, air traffic control recordings, video recordings, and bank records, as well as witnesses, such as crew family members, air traffic controllers, cargo shippers, and maintenance technicians.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pain\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5685401,1353794\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/637/775/\">\n     637 F.2d at 786-87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re W.

Podhurst and Motley Rice have filed these cases on behalf of various plaintiffs.

But Motley Rice has not pointed to any particular prejudicial deficiencies in Malaysia's own fact-finding process that would indicate the inadequacy of such proceedings such that a concession in this regard is needed.

And given that no one specific cause of the disappearance of Flight MH370 has been claimed affirmatively, much less that a certain known design or manufacturing defect precipitated this accident, this Court is hard pressed to find that the interests of the United States in resolving the instant product-defect claims against Boeing outweigh what is, at its core, a Malaysian tragedy, for the reasons explained above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Put another way, despite Plaintiffs' general contention that (by process of elimination) a mechanical problem with the U.S.-manufactured Boeing aircraft must have caused the events that give rise to their claims, \"a defendant's manufacturing activities within the U.S. do not tilt the public interest in favor of retaining jurisdiction\n    where overseas events are the primary catalyst for litigation initiated by foreign plaintiffs.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Air Crash Near Peixoto De Azeveda\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794446\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/574/272/#p288\">\n     574 F.Supp.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    288 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Air France\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180510\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/760/832/#p839\">\n     760 F.Supp.2d at 845\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (explaining that \"the American interest here, ensuring the quality of component parts on aircraft and protecting the rights of two American citizens, is real and legitimate but less significant than the French interest\");\n    <em>\n     Clerides\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065762\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/623/#p630\">\n     534 F.3d at 630\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that while the \"United States has an interest in regulating domestic companies, its interest is matched by the interests of Greece and Cyprus in regulating the use of allegedly defective products within their borders\"). The same public interest factors discussed in Part IV.A.2.a.,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , that weigh in favor of the dismissal of the MDL cases involving Montreal Convention claims are equally applicable to the MDL cases that involve wrongful death and products liability claims, because both sets of claims arise from the same underlying set of facts. And under the circumstances presented here, there can be no dispute that Malaysia-which owned and operated the aircraft at issue as part of its fleet of national carriers on the day of the plane's disappearance-has the primary public interest in litigating these products liability claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    b.\n    <em>\n     There Are Compelling Private Interests On Both Sides, But Much Relevant Evidence Is Located Outside The United States, And The Prospect Of Impleading Raises Complex Immunity Considerations That Weigh In Favor Of Dismissal\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The balancing of the private interests is a closer call in the products liability context than it was with respect to the Montreal Convention claims. Plaintiffs are asserting manufacturing and design products liability claims directly against Boeing-a United States party-and it is undeniable that most of the evidence pertaining to these claims is inside the United States. This would suggest that the private interest factor concerning the location of the evidence points squarely in the direction of litigating the claims in the United States; however, notably, Boeing has agreed to make all such evidence available in Malaysia, and has also agreed to pay any judgment that the Malaysian courts hand down. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    FNC Mm. at 22 n.5.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Most importantly, \"[e]ven if plaintiffs intend to base their case on the negligence of defendants in the planning, design, manufacture, assembly, testing, service and inspection of the aircraft and its engines, the evidence regarding the crash itself and the actions of [the airline] are central to the tragedy.\"\n    <em>\n     Nolan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7386407\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/762/680/#p683\">\n     762 F.Supp. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    683 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     King v.

This is particularly so because Plaintiffs plan to proceed both on traditional negligence and strict products liability theories, and on a\n    <em>\n     res ipsa loquitur\n    </em>\n    theory of causation, as noted above. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. Hr'g Tr. at 38:4-8.) To succeed on the latter theory, Plaintiffs will have to rule out other likely causes of the plane's disappearance-e.g., weather, terrorism, crew sabotage, and the like-and a substantial portion of the evidence regarding possible alternative causes is located in Malaysia, as previously discussed. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Part IV.A.2.b.,\n    <em>\n     supra.\n    </em>\n    ) Similar evidence pertaining to the cause of the disaster is likely located in Australia, the United Kingdom, and other non-U.S. countries. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Podhurst FNC Opp'n at 15 (noting that the pieces of wreckage that washed ashore were taken to Australia, and that the Inmarsat satellite communication\n    data is located in the United Kingdom).)\n    <footnotemark>\n     26\n    </footnotemark>\n    Thus, when the nature of these claims and the scope of the related litigation is carefully considered, the location-of-the-evidence aspect of the private interest factor tips in favor of dismissing the instant claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    It is also clear that other types of relevant evidence-including damages evidence-is largely located outside of the United States. That is, while Plaintiffs' counsel and their retained expert witnesses are, in fact, located inside the United States (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Motley Rice FNC Opp'n at 10; Podhurst FNC Opp'n at 28), the vast majority of the decedents and the plaintiffs are from places other than Malaysia, such as China and Australia (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Podhurst FNC Opp'n at 17-18). Therefore, evidence pertaining to damages with respect to the products liability claims in these MDL cases is located abroad-in locales other than the United States\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n    Malaysia-and, indeed, it might well be more convenient and less costly to bring these claims to trial in Malaysia, given that the places where most of the damages evidence is likely to be are physically closer to Malaysia than to the United States.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Air Crash at Madrid, Spain, on Aug. 20, 2008\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277820\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/1020/#p1033\">\n     893 F.Supp.2d at 1033\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that the costs of transporting witnesses to trial would be lower if case were litigated in Spain). In other words, the dearth of U.S. - based plaintiffs or decedents means that both Plaintiffs and Defendants will likely face evidence-related burdens regardless of where the products liability cases are litigated.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277820\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/893/1020/#p1033\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    An additional private interest factor related to the litigation of Plaintiffs' products liability claims in the United States is the extent to which Boeing could, or would, seek to implead all potential defendants.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Piper Aircraft Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n     454 U.S. at 259\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n     102 S.Ct. 252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that the ability to implead the estate of the pilot was a factor that weighed in favor of a\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    dismissal). Whether or not Boeing can implead MAS or MAB as third party defendants raises questions of sovereign immunity, given that both MAS and MAB appear to be agencies or instrumentalities of the Malaysian government for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs' Resp. to MAS's Rule 12(b)(1) Mot. to Dismiss Under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, ECF No. 64, at 10 n.6 (conceding that MAS and MAB are agencies or instrumentalities of the Malaysian government but opposing dismissal based on sovereign immunity);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    FSIA Mem. at 12 (arguing that MAS and MAB are presumptively immune from suit and that Plaintiffs have not established that any FSIA exception applies).) And there appear to be other potentially sovereign defendants: the plaintiffs in the Flight MH370-related cases that are pending in Malaysia have named several Malaysian government entities as defendants, including the Department of Civil Aviation, the Royal Malaysian Air Force, the Immigration Department of Malaysia, and the Government of Malaysia, as well as certain individual Malaysian officials. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Singh Decl. \u00b6 9.) Any effort to implead such defendants would substantially complicate any litigation involving the wrongful death and products liability claims that are pending against Boeing in the United States.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kryvicky v.

Thus, even when the products liability claims of U.S. plaintiffs and/or U.S. decedents are isolated and that status is taken into account, the United States is still not a convenient forum for the litigation of manufacturing claims against Boeing related to the Flight MH370 disaster.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Wood\n    </em>\n    lawsuit presents the closest call in this regard, given that there are U.S. parties on both sides, and an American decedent, which suggests that much of the relevant discovery involves evidence that is inside the United States. (\n    <em>\n     See Wood v. The Boeing Co.\n    </em>\n    , 16cv1149.) But as previously explained, given the tort theories on which Plaintiffs are proceeding, evidence and witnesses pertaining to the aircraft, the crew, the events preceding the disappearance, and the search will be indispensable to litigating Plaintiffs' claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nolan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7386407\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/762/680/#p683\">\n     762 F.Supp. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    683 ;\n    <em>\n     King\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5898437\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/562/1374/#p1384\">\n     562 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1384 ;\n    <em>\n     Lueck\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11171154\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/1137/#p1143\">\n     236 F.3d at 1146\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    At its core, this case is about the unexplained disappearance of a passenger plane operated by Malaysia Airlines as part of its national air carrier fleet following its departure from a Malaysian airport. The disappearance of Flight MH370 was the subject of a years-long investigation by Malaysian authorities, and while a host of other countries undeniably participated and undoubtedly have some interest in the legal claims that have been made in the wake of this tragedy-including China, Australia, India, and the United States-these other points of connection do not alter the fundamental and substantial nexus between this tragic incident and the country of Malaysia. In consideration of all of the relevant\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    factors, this Court has concluded that litigation in the United States related to the Flight MH370 disaster is inconvenient, and that dismissal of the MDL cases in favor of Malaysia is warranted. Thus, as reflected in the attached Order and subject to the conditions laid out therein, Defendants' joint motion for\n    <em>\n     forum non conveniens\n    </em>\n    dismissal is\n    <strong>\n     GRANTED\n    </strong>\n    , and the cases in this MDL are\n    <strong>\n     DISMISSED\n    </strong>\n    without prejudice.

For the purpose of the\n     <em>\n      forum non conveniens\n     </em>\n     analysis, this Court has focused on\n     <em>\n      Smith v.

Plaintiff Chen is a resident of the United States, but not a citizen, and Meng Zhang's connection to the United States is predicated on her status as a green-card holder and her\n     <em>\n      past\n     </em>\n     work and residence in the United States. In the\n     <em>\n      Gaspard\n     </em>\n     case, the Wang Decedents' connection is premised on Gaspard's citizenship, and Rui Wang's employment with an American company, even though he lived and worked overseas.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
