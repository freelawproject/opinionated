The plaintiffs have voted and plan to continue voting in Massachusetts for presidential candidates who are not members of the Democratic Party. They allege that their votes for these candidates are effectively discarded because Massachusetts has adopted a \"winner-take-all\" (\"WTA\") system for selecting electors. In this system, the candidate receiving the most votes in Massachusetts is awarded all of the Commonwealth's electors, with the other candidates receiving no electors. The plaintiffs seek a declaration that this system violates the United States Constitution -- both the \"one person, one vote\" principle rooted in the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Count I) and the voters' freedom of association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments (Count II). In their view, the Constitution requires a \"more equitable\" method for distributing electors, one that allocates electors proportionately to parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Complaint seeks a declaration that the WTA system is unconstitutional and a corresponding injunction. It also asks the Court to impose a deadline by which state authorities must implement a valid method of selecting electors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendants have moved to dismiss based on\n   Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. After hearing, the Court concludes that the Massachusetts winner-take-all system of selecting electors in presidential elections is constitutional. The motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 21) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff William F.

The plaintiffs argue that Massachusetts' WTA system is indistinguishable from the ones that\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   found to \"invidiously ... cancel out or minimize the voting strength\" of particular groups.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/\">\n    at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175946\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/412/755/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 2332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held: \"Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person's vote over that of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/\">\n    531 U.S. at 104-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Framed this way, the plaintiffs seem to be suggesting that, prior to\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   , a \"one person, one vote\" claim required proof of conduct that was invidious, but after\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   , arbitrary and disparate treatment of voters is sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For starters, the precedential value of\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   is unclear, as the main opinion expressly states that it is \"limited to the present circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/\">\n    531 U.S. at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505432\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/98/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Roman v.

The disjunctive language is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Bush\n   </em>\n   in that it indicates that arbitrariness may suffice to prove a \"one person, one vote\" violation, even in the absence of invidious discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

The WTA system for selecting electors simply does not violate the \"one person, one vote\" principle the way it has been described so far by the Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The plaintiffs' first obstacle is the text of the Constitution. Article II of the Constitution authorizes each state to appoint electors \"in such Manner as the [state] Legislature ... may direct.\" U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1. The Supreme Court long ago observed that \"from the formation of the government until now the practical construction of [this] clause has conceded\n   <em>\n    plenary power\n   </em>\n   to the state legislatures in the matter of the appointment of electors.\"\n   <em>\n    McPherson v.

For example, a state legislature could mandate appointment by the people (either at large or in districts), by the legislature itself, by the governor, or by the state supreme court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Of course, this does not permit states to choose a method that violates some other provision of the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   And the plaintiffs here argue that the WTA system chosen by the Massachusetts legislature violates the \"one person, one vote\" rule. The essence of the rule is that, once a geographical unit for a representative is established, \"all who participate in [an] election are to have an equal vote -- whatever their race, whatever their sex, whatever their occupation, whatever their income, and wherever their home may be in that geographical unit.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765361\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/368/\">\n    372 U.S. at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1765361\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/372/368/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On its face, the WTA system in Massachusetts makes none of these forbidden distinctions.

The WTA system, standing alone, does not treat\n   <em>\n    voters\n   </em>\n   differently at all. Massachusetts counts all presidential and vice-presidential votes equally, and then awards its electors to whichever party's candidate obtains the most votes. In short, this system complies with equal protection because it does not inherently favor or disfavor a particular group of voters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McPherson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">\n    146 U.S. at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564547\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/1/#p35\">\n    13 S.Ct. 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If presidential electors are appointed by the legislatures, no discrimination is made; if they are elected in districts where each citizen has an equal right to vote, the same as any other citizen has, no discrimination is made.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The heart of the plaintiffs' assertion of unfairness revolves around their understanding that Massachusetts's WTA system functions as a two-step election. First, voters cast ballots for presidential candidates. Second, the votes are tallied, and the WTA system awards all of the Commonwealth's electors to the winner and zero electors to the candidates of the non-dominant parties.
