The matter is presently before the court on the threshold issue of whether the motion is successive for purposes of \u00a7 2255(h). The issue has been fully briefed and is ripe for decision. For the reasons that follow, the court concludes that the motion is successive and that it must be dismissed without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Hayes was indicted by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Virginia on January 19, 2006. Count One of the indictment\n   charged him with possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(e). Hayes entered a plea of guilty to that count on July 7, 2006. Under the terms of the written plea agreement, Hayes acknowledged that he would be subject to an enhanced mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of fifteen years under the Armed Career Criminal Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   During the guilty plea hearing conducted pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, an Assistant United States Attorney was called upon to offer evidence in support of the defendant's plea of guilty. Proceeding by proffer, the prosecutor summarized the government's evidence as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [T]he events that led to this charge took place on the 6th of December, 2005, in the town of Vinton, in the Western District of Virginia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   That night, Officer [Craig] Frye, of the Vinton Police Department, was on patrol in what is known as a high-crime area of the town. He observed Mr. Hayes seated in a vehicle. He walked up to the vehicle, just to see what was going on, spoke to Mr. Hayes, [and] eventually asked Mr. Hayes for consent to pat him down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Hayes stepped out of the vehicle at some point during that and in fact did consent to being patted down. Almost immediately the officer felt a pistol in Mr. Hayes' pocket. He asked Mr. Hayes about it, after it had been removed. Mr. Hayes said he had been in a dispute earlier, where he had been punched, and had the pistol for his protection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Hayes is indeed a felon who had not received clemency. It was a firearm that was found in Mr. Hayes' pocket, designed to expel a projectile by means of explosion, and that firearm had moved in interstate or foreign commerce. And this is Mr. Hayes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plea Hr'g Tr. 29-30, Docket No. 88. In response to subsequent questions from the court, the defendant and his attorney indicated that they agreed with the prosecutor's summary of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    at 30-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At that time, the court concluded that Hayes qualified as an armed career criminal. The court sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 180 months, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Hayes did not appeal his conviction or sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 6, 2010, Hayes filed a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , claiming that he was improperly sentenced as an armed career criminal and that his defense attorney provided ineffective assistance. The court conditionally filed the motion and advised Hayes that the motion appeared to be untimely. After granting Hayes an opportunity to present additional argument on that issue, the court summarily dismissed the motion as untimely filed.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government moved to dismiss the motion\n   on the basis that it was successive. The court granted the government's motion on March 30, 2012.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hayes\n   </em>\n   , No. 7:06CR0002,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2046308\">\n    2012 U.S. Dist.

Hayes simultaneously filed a motion to stay consideration of the petition pending a decision by the Fourth Circuit as to whether Hayes was authorized to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. On June 28, 2016, the Fourth Circuit denied Hayes' motion for authorization \"on the ground that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   would entitle Hayes to no relief.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hayes\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-9460 (4th Cir.

The court granted the motion to withdraw on June 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 30, 2018, the government filed an omnibus motion for voluntary disclosure of grand jury and other materials in 55 closed criminal cases, pursuant to its obligations under\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

Keegan\n   </em>\n   , No. 7:14CR00029, Dkt. No. 32 (W.D. Va. Apr. 30, 2018). The motion sought permission to disclose potential impeachment information concerning Craig Frye, which had come to the government's attention between April and June of 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The motion also requested that the Federal Public Defender's Office be appointed to represent each of the defendants identified by the government. The motion was granted on May 16, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Although Frye was the primary witness against Hayes, this case was not included in the initial list of 55 cases provided by the government. On September 20, 2018, the Federal Public Defender's Office notified the United States Attorney's Office that it believed disclosure may also be required in the instant case. The government concurred with that assessment. Accordingly, on September 24, 2018, the government moved for voluntary disclosure of the relevant materials and requested that the Federal Public Defender's Office be appointed to represent Hayes. The government's motion was granted on September 26, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 12, 2018, Hayes filed a\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   pleading that the court construed and docketed as a \u00a7 2255 motion. Relying on the potential impeachment information that had recently been released by the government, Hayes asserted that his conviction was unlawful. In accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Castro v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897148\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/375/\">\n    540 U.S. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897148\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/375/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897148\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/375/\">\n    157 L.Ed.2d 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), the court notified Hayes of its intention to treat his submission as a \u00a7 2255 motion and directed him to file an amended motion, if he elected to proceed under that statutory provision. The court also advised Hayes that his submission appeared to constitute a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 5, 2018, Hayes, through counsel, filed an amended \u00a7 2255 motion. Based on the newly disclosed information, Hayes argues that his conviction must be vacated on two grounds. First, Hayes claims that the government violated his due process rights under\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), \"by failing to disclose Frye's lengthy history of misconduct, as well as his prior arrest[,] ... before Mr. Hayes pled guilty on July 10, 2006.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Am.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00a7 2255 Mot. 22, Dkt. No. 116. Second, relying on the Fourth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802843\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/460/\">\n    711 F.3d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2013), Hayes contends that \"his guilty plea was involuntary\" because he \"pled guilty without the benefit of any of this important\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   information.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   13, 21. In support of these claims, Hayes cites to the following acts or incidents involving Frye that predated Hayes' plea of guilty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 On December 14, 2004, a Vinton Police Department (\"VPD\") sergeant stated by electronic letter that he had been advised that Frye had elected to conduct drug investigations that reached beyond the scope of standard patrol level enforcement, and that, in doing so, Frye had circumvented the procedures and policies implemented by the VPD and created a potential \"credibility\" issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 On that same day, the sergeant was advised by a VPD detective that \"Frye would most probably not respond to another counseling session ... regarding ... this type of street level proactive drug enforcement,\" which the detective \"warned could result in 'tainted' drug cases.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 On November 23, 2005, the then-chief of the VPD advised Frye in writing that he intended to take disciplinary action against Frye for racially insensitive and inappropriate remarks regarding African-Americans that were allegedly made by Frye on November 14, 2005 in the presence of three witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 On December 5, 2015, Frye was ordered to undergo mandatory counseling for the racially insensitive remarks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 On January 25, 2006, Frye composed a memorandum to his personnel file in which he admitted to having surreptitiously accessed the computer of another officer and changed the officer's home page to a homosexual website.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 On September 15, 2017, a new chief of police stated in an internal affairs memorandum that Frye had been arrested and charged with felony larceny prior to being employed by the Town of Vinton as a police officer, and that the charge was later dismissed and expunged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   11-13. In response to the previous\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   notice, Hayes also contends that the current motion should not be deemed successive, and that the motion was timely filed within one year of discovering the evidence at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   By order entered November 9, 2018, the government was directed to respond to the defendant's arguments on the issue of whether the pending motion is successive for purposes of \u00a7 2255(h). The government subsequently filed a response in which it\n   argues that the motion must be dismissed as successive. The defendant has since filed a reply brief on this issue. Although Hayes, through counsel, initially requested oral argument, the parties have since agreed for the matter to be decided on the briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), a federal district court may consider a \"second or successive\" \u00a7 2255 motion only upon certification from the appropriate court of appeals that the motion meets certain criteria.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).

Hayes alleges that \"the Vinton Police Department was aware of Frye's misconduct before ...

Am. \u00a7 2255 Mot. 22, 24. It follows that the factual predicate underlying Hayes'\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim-the failure to disclose potentially exculpatory or impeachment evidence-accrued before Hayes filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion in 2010, even though Hayes was unaware of it. Thus, unlike the claims asserted in\n   <em>\n    Panetti\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hairston\n   </em>\n   , Hayes'\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim is not based on facts that did not exist at the time of his initial \u00a7 2255\n   motion.

However, as Hayes emphasizes in his current motion, \"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   applies even if the United States Attorney's Office was not aware of [exculpatory or impeachment evidence] before [the defendant] pleaded guilty,\" since \"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   encompasses evidence 'known only to police investigators and not to the prosecutor.' \" Am. \u00a7 2255 Mot. 23 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kyles v.

Because a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation occurs at the time the exculpatory evidence should have been disclosed (i.e., before a defendant goes to trial or pleads guilty), courts have held that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claims were barred as successive in cases where similar information implicating police officers was not provided by a police department until after an initial\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

The letters implicated three officers who were in some way related to petitioner Gregory Brown's case and indicated that the material at issue dated back to the 1980s, long before Brown went to trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516851\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/661/#p672\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516851\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/661/#p672\">\n    at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, notwithstanding the fact that the evidence at issue did not come to light until more than a decade after Brown's first\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   petition was denied on the merits, the Court held that the claim was successive and that Brown could pursue it only if he satisfied the gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2244(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court is convinced that the same outcome is required here. Hayes claims that the Vinton Police Department was aware of Frye's prior arrest and instances of professional misconduct before Hayes pled guilty, that the information implicating Frye was potential impeachment evidence, and that the failure to disclose the evidence prior to the entry of his guilty plea violated his due process rights under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   . Consistent with\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   and other decisions cited above, the court concludes\n   that Hayes'\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim was ripe at the time of his first \u00a7 2255 motion, and that he is entitled to pursue it only if he obtains authorization from the Fourth Circuit under \u00a7 2255(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The court reaches the same result with respect to Hayes' claim that his \"guilty plea [was] involuntary because it was predicated on impermissible government conduct that was material to his decision to plead guilty.\" Am. \u00a7 2255 Mot. 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (asserting that \"his guilty plea was voluntary\" because he \"pled guilty without the benefit of any of this important\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   information\"). Because Hayes maintains that pre-plea misconduct rendered his guilty plea involuntary, the court concludes that this claim was also ripe at the time of his first \u00a7 2255 motion. As discussed above, whether a claim was ripe under the AEDPA \"turns on whether the factual predicate existed, not whether the petitioner\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   it existed at the time of his initial habeas petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516851\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/661/#p672\">\n    889 F.3d at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). Since the factual predicate underlying Hayes' involuntary plea claim existed at the time he filed his first motion to vacate, this claim is also subject to the requirements for second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Accordingly, Hayes must obtain authorization from the Fourth Circuit before this court may consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In closing, the court emphasizes that its decision here is confined to the narrow issue of whether Hayes' current motion is barred by the restrictions on second or successive motions imposed by \u00a7 2255(h). The decision should not be read as expressing or implying any view on the merits of either claim. Unless and until the Fourth Circuit authorizes the filing of a successive motion, this court does not have jurisdiction to consider the new claims on the merits. While the court recognizes that Hayes is nearing the end of his federal sentence, the court cannot short-circuit the AEDPA's gatekeeping requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the reasons stated, the court concludes that Hayes' current motion is successive for purposes of \u00a7 2255(h). Consequently, the court is not authorized to consider the motion absent certification by the Fourth Circuit. Because Hayes has not obtained the requisite certification, the court must dismiss the motion without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.
