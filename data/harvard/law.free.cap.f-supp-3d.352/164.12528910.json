The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   RMH, a Colorado limited liability company, has its principal place of business in Colorado Springs, Colorado. JTM \u00b6 5(a). It is jointly owned by Robert Haddock and his three children. Tr. 19:24-25. Mr. Haddock\n   created RMH and assigned to it his patents, including the '629 Patent -the patent at issue in this case. Tr. 19:17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   MRI, a Colorado corporation, also has its principal place of business in Colorado Springs, Colorado. JTM \u00b6 5(A)(c). Mr. Haddock created MRI in order to market his inventions. Tr. 20:16-17. He is currently MRI's President and Chief Executive Officer, and several of his family members, including his two sons, work for MRI. Tr. 21:5-14. MRI is responsible for testing, marketing, conducting market research, and otherwise marketing his patents, including the distribution of products based on those patents. Tr. 20:17-21. Mr. Haddock owns roughly 98% of the business; the remainder is held by an equity partner in charge of all manufacturing. Tr. 20:25-21:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   MRI also does business under the name S-5! and is primarily known under this name on the market. Tr. 21:15-22. S-5! sells a variety of metal products that make it easy to attach ancillary structures or systems to metal rooftops. Tr. 21:23-22:2. MRI is the exclusive licensee of the '629 Patent. JTM \u00b6 5(A)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   PMC, a Connecticut corporation, has its principal place of business in Plainville, Connecticut. JTM \u00b6 5(A)(d). Alan Wasley is the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of PMC. Tr. 264:15-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Robert Haddock's Background in the Metal Roofing Industry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Mr. Haddock's father, who owned a construction company in Colorado Springs, introduced Mr. Haddock to the steel building construction industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 14:14-17. After working for his father for several of his high school years, Mr. Haddock enrolled in college, but left after the first semester. Tr. 14:15-19, 14:2-7. He then held a variety of positions, including working in a machine shop, in construction, on a ranch, and competing at professional rodeos. Tr. 14:9-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In 1977, Mr. Haddock founded a wholly-owned company, a subcontractor specializing in erecting pre-engineered metal buildings. Tr. 15:5-16. Over time, the business expanded into other areas, including the development of architectural metals, metal cladding\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and coverings for composite wall systems, and other metal components for building construction. Tr. 15:14-16. Mr. Haddock estimates that company, which he wrapped up in 1990, worked on hundreds of metal commercial and industrial buildings on more than five hundred job sites. Tr. 16:2-21. The types of structures included distribution facilities for shipping companies such as United Parcel Service and Federal Express. Tr. 16:13-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In the 1980s, Mr. Haddock began independent consulting under Metal Roof Advisory Group, a new wholly-owned company, which continues to operate today. Tr. 16:24-17:18, 18:17-21. In that role, Mr. Haddock has done a significant amount of teaching, training, and technical writing for trade associations and trade publications. Tr. 17:22-24. He has also regularly been hired as an expert witness in cases involving metal building defects, specifically roofing construction defects. Tr. 17:25-18:5. By his estimation, his consulting\n   practice has resulted in work on several hundred roofs. Tr. 18:22-19:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Mr. Haddock's knowledge of the engineering, technical, and scientific challenges involved with metal roofing and construction were primarily gained through work experience and interactions with other industry professionals. Tr. 54:20-55:16. He has received multiple awards and recognitions within the metal construction roofing industry. Tr. 55:17-57:2; Pls.' Ex. SSS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Robert Haddock's Inventions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   During Mr. Haddock's time in the metal roofing industry, he encountered many products that were available on the market for mounting snow guards and snow retention systems on metal roofs. Tr. 22:20-23:2, 57:23-58:16. Such systems are frequently mounted on pitched metal roofs by contractors like Mr. Haddock because these roofs are particularly prone to a phenomenon called \"rooftop avalanche.\" Tr. 23:3-5. Pitched metal roofs with snow piled on them are very likely to suddenly experience melts that cause significant amounts of snow to fall off the roofs and onto people in the immediate vicinity of the building. Tr. 52:6-54:8, 66:25-5; Pls.' Ex. Z. The image below depicts the phenomenon:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Pls.' Ex. Z at 4, fig. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As a result, buildings with metal roofs will often be outfitted with snow retention systems. These systems are designed to hold the snow in place on the roof so that even if the snow melts, large amounts of snow will not come down at once. Tr. 52:6-54:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   There are two major types of snow retention systems currently in use on metal roofs. Tr. 51:21-52:5. \"Fence\" type snow retention systems use a series of continuous horizontal components, assembled laterally along either the eaves of the roof or in parallel rows up the slope of the roof in the style of a fence, to resist the sliding force, as seen below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Pls.' Ex. Z at 8, fig. 8A. \"Cleat\" type snow retention systems consist of small individual units used as \"cleats\" spot located at or near the eaves of the roof, as seen below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Pls.' Ex. Z at 8, fig. 8B. Both systems restrain or slow the movement of a bank of snow by restraining its base.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In Mr. Haddock's experience, however, many of the snow retention systems on the market were not particularly well-adapted to metal roofs, Tr. 22:22-23:2, specifically standing seam metal roofs. Tr. 58:3-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   There are many different types of metal roofs currently manufactured with a variety of \"seam profiles\"-that is, differences in how metal roof panels are connected at their seams. Tr. 35:2-10. The following image highlights several different standing seam profiles currently in use:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Pls.' Ex. Y at 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \"Standing seam\" profiles allow the roof's metal panels to move appropriately in response to temperature changes that cause expansion and contraction of roofing materials. Tr. 38:20-41:1. This is important because a metal roof's panels, while attached to the underlying structure, are attached to each other with metal clips or fasteners. Tr. 37:5-38:23; 42:1-43:1. If the panels are not able to move independently, as standing seam metal roofs permit, the movement caused by thermal expansion and contraction can wear down those clips, damaging the integrity of the roofs. Tr. 39:20-40:1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Mr. Haddock determined that the snow guards on the marketplace in the mid-1980s were either attached with penetrating methods-i.e., screw-fastened or bolted through the roof itself-or glued to the roof. Tr. 58:3-16. The former could jeopardize the weatherproofing of the roof; the latter would simply have a very limited lifespan before falling off.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Mr. Haddock sought a more permanent solution when he built his own home. Tr. 58:18-20. This led to the invention of his own snow retention system.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Haddock created metal clamps that sit over the metal roof seam \"like a saddle would sit on a horse,\" and which are then tightened onto the seam with screws without penetrating or damaging the underlying roofing material. Tr. 59:4-60:7. This basic technology allowed for a very strong connection to be made between the roof and whatever was being mounted on it. Tr. 60:5-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Mr. Haddock faced resistance from the roofing industry when he initially introduced his mounting clamps, as there was significant concern that mounting anything to a roof would ultimately damage it. Tr. 60:10-61:14. Over time, however, Mr. Haddock's innovations were recognized and adopted into wider use, in part due to his\n   commitment to conducting extensive load testing to demonstrate the holding strength of his clamps. Tr. 61:15-62:4. Mr. Haddock conducted more than 3,000 load tests on a combination of different materials and seam profiles, as the holding strength of the clamps varies based on the shape of the profile and the type of metal used. Tr. 62:5-63:2. The data from this load testing was ultimately compiled into a load test chart that Mr. Haddock used in making the case for his products to others in the roofing industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 63:3-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The mounting clamps' uses are not limited to snow-retention systems. Tr. 23:14-24:3. They can be used to attach a variety of devices to standing seam roofs, including satellite dishes, HVAC systems, and solar panels, as seen in these images:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Pls.' Ex. Y at 52, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Once he had developed the mounting clamp, Mr. Haddock began to develop a snow retention system that used the clamps to mount rails, or cross-members, onto standing seam metal roofs. Tr. 63:15-64:12. His first system, SnoFence, is still on the market. Tr. 66:8-11. He eventually developed, however, a new system: ColorGard. Tr. 66:12-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   One of ColorGard's innovations-the one that gave it its name-was that it created an easy way to match the snow retention system to the color of the roof. Tr. 69:9-70:24. Over the years, customers had used a variety of methods to paint their snow guards to match their roofs, but those methods did not last as long as the color of the roof itself; roofing materials are typically warrantied for color for several decades. Tr. 69:12-17, 70:11-21. The ColorGard system features a channel-similar to an office door's nameplate-into which a roof installer could insert a strip of the actual roof material, creating a perfect match that would last for the life of the roof because it was the same exact material. Tr. 69:21-70:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The first-generation ColorGard system was patented under a patent that expired in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 66:18-25. Mr. Haddock realized, however, that a specific feature of the ColorGard-the fact that the cross-members contained pre-punched holes-was preventing wider adoption of the system for roofs whose seams were spaced in non-standard ways, and thus needed more flexibility in determining where clamps would be installed. Tr. 68:15-69:8. This led to the development of the design for the second-generation ColorGard system in\n   the late 1990s. Tr. 70:25-71:13. That system, while very similar to the original system, utilizes an unpunched cross-member. The images below illustrate the differences between the two types of cross-members:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Ex. BB at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Mr. Haddock also developed an adaptor clip, which he called the VersaClip, which slides onto the unpunched cross-member and is then connected to the mounting clamps. Tr. 71:4-19. This product allows the installer to position the adapter anywhere along the unpunched cross member and then bolt it to a mounting clamp.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The image below depicts the VersaClip:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Ex.

PMC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Alan Walsey, the CEO of PMC, testified that PMC is one of two companies whose roots go back three generations in the Wasley family, to a company named Wasley Products. Tr. 269:13-271:6. Today, Mr. Wasley is CEO of two companies: Innovative Metal Products (\"IMP\") and PMC Industries, Inc. (\"PMC\"). Tr. 264:15-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   IMP distributes patient positioning products for the orthopedic community. Tr. 264:21-23. These products are primarily used in hospital operating rooms. Tr. 264:23-265:21, 272:16-273:9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   PMC has three business units. Tr. 266:1. One manufactures IMP's products. Tr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   266:1-2. Another manufactures bearing seals for automotive and aerospace companies. Tr. 266:4-7. The third division-and the one relevant to this action-produces clamps and roofing accessories. Tr. 266:2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   IMP began in the mid-1980s, after Mr. Wasley's company produced a product for his childhood friend, James Bailey, who had asked him for help creating a product to stabilize a patient during orthopedic care. Tr. 271:14-273:5. Mr. Wasley and Mr. Bailey realized that there was a need for such products and decided to enter business together. Tr. 272:16-273:9. Today, IMP holds roughly twenty-five patents for patient positioning devices. Tr. 274:11-15. Many of these involve metal clamps that attach the devices to an operating room table. Tr. 274:18-275:11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   PMC was also launched in the mid-1980s, but was originally known as Precision Molding Company. Tr. 266:8-14. At that time, the company's primary business involved plastic injection molding, developed as the need for engineered plastics supplanted the need for the rubber products previously produced by Wasley Products. Tr. 266:18-267:2. Among the plastic molded components PMC manufactured was a plastic snow guard for roofing. Tr. 267:2-3. For roughly the past decade, PMC has been manufacturing clamps designed to secure components to roofs, such as solar panels and snow retention systems. Tr. 267:8-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   PMC also employs Mr. Wasley's son, Brad Wasley. Brad Wasley is currently a sales manager for PMC and has been employed with the company for over twenty years. Tr. 280:6-13. Brad Wasley's duties include attending trade shows for PMC. Tr. 280:15-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Interactions Between Brad Wasley and Robert Haddock\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Brad Wasley and Robert Haddock first met at trade shows in the early 2000s. Tr. 89:20-90:24. At a MetalCon trade show in 2002, Mr. Haddock saw Brad Wasley at a vendor booth displaying a plastic glue snow guard that he recognized as one developed by a company called Zaleski, but without the company's label. Tr. 89:22-90:6. Mr. Haddock then talked to Brad Wasley about the origin of that snow guard. Tr. 90:6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The following year, at the MetalCon trade show, they met again. Brad Wasley displayed again the part from the year before, as well as a mechanically attached part on a seam that seemed, to Mr. Haddock, very similar to S-5!'s technology. Tr. 90:12-20. Mr. Haddock informed Brad Wasley that it appeared the part infringed on several of Mr. Haddock's patents, but that he would be willing to discuss licensing terms. Tr. 90:21-91:8. Brad Wasley, who claimed it was a prototype, never followed up to discuss licensing terms. Mr. Haddock never saw the product appear on the market; so, he did not pursue any legal action. Tr. 91:9-92:14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   A few years later, Mr. Haddock saw advertisements for a product sold by PMC called the ML clamp and marketed as AceClamp. Tr. 92:17-24. The ML clamp was similar to the clamp Mr. Haddock developed, but also featured an innovation; it locked onto a roof seam through the tightening of a screw that pulled the parts together. Tr. 93:16-94:8. At the time, Mr. Haddock sought advice from legal counsel as to whether the ML clamp infringed on his patents. Tr. 94:9-13. While he concluded that the ML clamp likely infringed his patent, he decided not to take legal action against it at that time. Tr. 94:9-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   At some point, Mr. Haddock also learned that another company, Unirac, had posted a copy of Mr. Haddock's load test table-for which Mr. Haddock had received\n   a copyright-on its website. Tr. 95:4-95:17. When Mr. Haddock confronted Unirac about its publication of the table, he learned that Unirac had obtained the table from Brad Wasley. Tr. 96:16-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    G. PMC's Development of ColorSnap\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In May 2015, PMC executives had a visit with a customer who was an architect, and who wanted to install a new snow retention system on his roof. Tr. 842:20-23. The customer allegedly was looking for a snow retention system that would match the color of his roof and apparently urged them to develop such a system. Tr. 842:24-843:7; 416:10-417:5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   This meeting launched PMC into rapid product development. Tr. 843:20-844:1. PMC's efforts ultimately yielded the accused device, ColorSnap. Tr. 844:2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The development of the product was initially assigned to PMC consultant Robert Mercier, who developed several prototypes. Def.'s Exs. 15-19; Tr. 417:22-423:15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   After Mercier's design was rejected, however, Tomas Kovacs, an engineer who worked for PMC and IMP, took up the task. Tr. 424:7-425:3. Mr. Kovacs testified that he did not look at the designs of competitor products, such as ColorGard, while he was developing the design of ColorSnap. Tr. 549:14-550:8. Mr. Kovacs, however, admitted that he was aware that all competitor products, including S-5!, slid the cross-member from the side into the clamp, which he viewed as inefficient. Tr. 550:9-17. He claimed that, in designing ColorSnap, his goal was to come up with a product where the rail could be inserted directly into the clamps and snap into place. Tr. 550:17-551:6, 552:11-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   On June 18, 2015, Mr. Kovacs sent an e-mail to the project team-including Brad Wasley, Robert Mercier, and PMC consultant Caroll Marston-with the notable subject line \"Ideas of colorguard system.\" Pls.' Ex. QQ at 1. Attached to the email were the following design renderings:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Pls.' Ex. QQ at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Over the following months, the design changed several times, but generally remained the same-except that the component PMC called the \"top block\" was changed from a bracket to a solid piece, and the metal used was changed from stainless steel to aluminum. Tr. 553:12-558:17; 568:18-569:11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   With the PMC snow retention system, the top block and mounting clamps are shipped together, pre-assembled. Tr. 439:19-20; 440:3-441:2. These pieces can then be taken out of the box and quickly attached to the roof seams. Tr. 440:3-7, 440:22-441:2. The horizontal rail can then be \"snapped\" into all the clamps at once. Tr. 441:23-442:10. These features are intended to save an installer time. Tr. 300:16-21. The following images captured from a PMC promotional video demonstrate this \"snapping\" installation:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Def.'s Ex. 39 at 01:55-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   On July 15, 2015, Jim Bailey, Alan Wasley, Tamas Kovacs, and Andy Brady met with PMC's patent attorney, Damian Wasserbauer, to discuss ColorSnap and other PMC products in-development. Tr. 610:4-611:10. The team directed Mr. Wasserbauer to conduct an analysis as to whether the ColorSnap infringed on any existing patents. Tr. 611:15-24. They specifically directed him to research any of Mr. Haddock's patents, and to research patents related to ColorGard. Tr. 614:8-615:20. On August 11, 2015, after reviewing his initial search results, the team directed him to investigate the '629 Patent further, and to prepare a freedom to operate opinion. Tr. 617:7-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   On September 13, 2015, Mr. Wasserbauer sent PMC a \"preliminary opinion\" that ColorSnap did not infringe the '629 Patent :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   We wanted to give you the clearance you sought...in view of the clearance searches and the upcoming trade show on Tuesday, 9/15/2015. We are providing this preliminary opinion by email as these formal letters will be provided this week ... We performed the clearance search on the Wire management now called A2 SnowBreak \"Color Snap\". We reviewed the results and found no prior art that disclosed the design. However, we did find that the Haddock USP 6,470,629 was the closest reference and required a claim chart. See Attached. We are of the opinion that the Color Snap product is\n   <em>\n    clear\n   </em>\n   primarily due (1) to use of the bracket [i.e., mounting adaptor, which PMC calls a top block] without the third portion element as required by the Haddock claims and (2) any equivalence in the purpose and structure to the second portion thereto. The claim chart illustrates these differences and we have ordered the file history of this patent that may provide other prosecution history estoppel arguments in addition to the PMC product not infringing under a literal element-by-element analysis or by equivalents. We are preparing and will file a provisional patent application on 9/14/2015 with the inventor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Def.'s Ex. 44 at 1. As Mr. Wasserbauer's preliminary opinion made clear, he prepared it under significant time pressure from PMC to clear the product ahead of a trade show on September 15, 2015. Tr. 618:19-619:4. He wrote that e-mail, moreover, without having even reviewed the patent prosecution history. Tr. 623:15-25. Mr. Wasserbauer did not subsequently provide PMC with an updated written opinion based on reviewing that history several weeks later, nor did he prepare a formal opinion letter as promised in his September 15, 2015 email.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 331:17-332:2, 332:23-333:4, 721:9-722:20, 810:8-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In October 2015, Mr. Kovacs and Caroll Marston from PMC took a prototype of the ColorSnap system to the MetalCon conference.

A mounting system that comprises:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   first and second mounting clamps;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   first and second mounting adaptors, wherein each of said first and second mounting adaptors comprises first and second mounting adaptor portions, wherein said first mounting adaptor portion of said first mounting adaptor is disposed on said first mounting clamp, and wherein said first mounting adaptor portion of said second mounting adaptor is disposed on said second mounting clamp;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n   first and second fasteners that anchor said first adaptor portion of said first and second mounting adaptors, respectively, to said first and second mounting clamps, respectively;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   a cross member; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   first and second means for detachably interconnecting said cross member with said second adaptor portion of said first and second mounting adaptors, respectively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Ex. A at 9. Claim 15 therefore has five limitations that must be found in the ColorSnap device to prove infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    1. First and Second Mounting Clamps\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The term \"mounting clamp\" was not given any particular construction in the Claim Construction Order, as the patent language simply referred to \"suitable\" mounting clamps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Claim Const. Order at 7-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Defendants have conceded that the ColorSnap system is designed to function with at least three types of mounting clamps PMC produces: the A2, A2N, and ML clamps. JTM \u00b6 5(A)(v). The A2N and ML clamps are depicted in the images below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Pls.' Exs. IIII, JJJJ (images from slip sheets).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The Court therefore finds that this limitation is present in the ColorSnap system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    2. First and Second Mounting Adaptors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The second limitation requires \"mounting adaptors\" comprised of \"first and second mounting adaptor portions, wherein said first mounting adaptor portion of said first mounting adaptor is disposed on said first mounting clamp, and wherein said first mounting adaptor portion of said second mounting adaptor is disposed on said second mounting clamp.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The Claim Construction Order defined \"mounting adaptors\" as \"generally rectangular shaped bodies having first and second areas and that interfaces with the mounting clamp, and a cross member respectively.\" Claim Const. Order at 8-10. It also defined \"first and second mounting adaptor portions\" as \"[t]he mounting adaptors each have a first distinct area separated from a second distinct area of the body.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Proving that this second limitation is present in the ColorSnap system requires that the Court find four further elements: (1) that the system utilizes two generally shaped rectangular bodies; (2) that each generally rectangular shaped body has a first distinct area separated from a second distinct area of that body; (3) that the first distinct area of each body interfaces with the mounting clamp; and (4) that the second distinct area of each body interfaces with the cross member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   ColorSnap's \"top blocks\" are the components alleged to be mounting adaptors that meet the requirements of the second limitation of Claim 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Generally Rectangular Shaped Bodies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The Claim Construction Order adopted the phrase \"generally rectangular\" because \"the Patent only discloses a rectangularly shaped mounting adaptor and, given the function of the adaptor (i.e. to interface with the cross member), a shape other than generally rectangular would not work for its intended purpose.\" Claim Const. Order at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   At trial, PMC argued that the phrase \"generally rectangular\" requires the Court to find that the top block is rectangular in all views. But if Judge Arguello had intended such a narrow definition, then the Claim Construction Order would have required that the adaptor be \"rectangular in all views,\" or that it needed to be a \"rectangular prism.\" Instead, she used the phrase \"generally rectangular\"-and the Court therefore must determine whether the top block is \"generally rectangular,\" not \"rectangular in all views.\" PMC's definition also fails because the preferred embodiment of the mounting adapter in this claim limitation, the VersaClip, is not rectangular in all views, as seen when viewed from the cross-sectional perspective below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Pls.' Ex. FFFFF (image from slip sheet);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 216:5-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   A mounting adapter that appears rectangular in at least one view thus is \"generally\" rectangular. The top block, meanwhile, is rectangular in the top view and bottom view, as depicted in the images below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Pls.' Exs. WWWW, KKKK (image of physical exhibit from slip sheet). The top block therefore is a generally rectangular shaped body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Two Distinct Areas/Mounting Adaptor Portions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   There are two distinct areas, or portions, of the mounting adaptor, if it is possible to distinguish one section of the mounting adaptor as being sufficiently different from the other.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Claim Const. Order at 10; Tr. 188:7-13, 193:8-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The image of the top block below, as marked by Mr. Haddock, indicates the two areas of the top block. The green marking represents the first area. The purple parallelogram is drawn around the second area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Pls.' Ex. YYYY; Tr. 130:6-16. The areas are distinct both visually and functionally. The top block therefore has two mounting adaptor portions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    c. First Mounting Adaptor Portion Interfaces with the Mounting Clamp\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The first mounting adapter portion in the top block interfaces with the mounting clamp because it sits on top of it and touches it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   There was some contention during trial about the meaning of \"interface\" in this context, and several dictionary definitions were introduced into evidence. The Court finds that, from all the definitions offered, one best captures the ordinary meaning of interface in its noun form: \"a surface forming a common boundary of two bodies, spaces, or phases.\" Tr. 476:14-24; Pls.' Ex. X In its verb form, to interface simply means \"to join by means of an interface.\" Pls.' Ex. X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Thus, so long as the first mounting adaptor portion, when assembled with the rest of the ColorSnap, touches or shares a boundary with the mounting clamp, it can properly be said to interface with the mounting clamp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Second Mounting Adaptor Portion Interfaces with the Cross Member\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   The second mounting adapter portion in the top block interfaces with the cross member because it hooks onto the cross member and touches it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   So long as the second mounting adaptor portion, when assembled with the rest of the ColorSnap, touches or shares a boundary with the cross member, it therefore can properly be said to interface with the cross member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Because all four of these elements are found in ColorSnap's top block, the second limitation of Claim 15 is found in the ColorSnap system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <strong>\n    3. First and Second Fasteners\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The third limitation of Claim 15 requires \"first and second fasteners that anchor said first adaptor portion of said first and second mounting adaptors, respectively, to said first and second mounting clamps, respectively.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The Claim Construction Order does not define \"fasteners,\" but the Court finds that \"fasteners\" in the metal roofing context commonly refer to screws or bolts.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls.' Ex. CC (article discussing \"Fastener Compatibility with Profiled Metal Roof and Wall Panels\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The record makes clear that the ColorSnap system uses fasteners, i.e. bolts, to anchor the top block to the mounting clamp, regardless of which type of clamp is used. Tr. 132:19-133:12, 135:15-136:5, 229:8-230:8. The issue is whether ColorSnap's top block has a \"first adaptor portion.\" The Court has already determined that ColorSnap's top block has a \"first adaptor portion,\" and that this distinct area of the adaptor sits on top of the mounting clamp. The top block must be secured to the clamp with a fastener; otherwise, the system will not hold anything up. Tr. 448:18-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The Court therefore finds that this limitation is present in the ColorSnap system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Cross Member\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   The fourth limitation of Claim 15 requires that the mounting system feature a cross member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The Claim Construction Order defined a cross member as \"A panel with a channel adapted to receive a roofing material and having a rear portion with an outwardly extending multisurfaced protrusion designed to mate with corresponding substantially inverse surfaces of the second\n   portion of the mounting adaptor.\" Claim Const. Order at 11-12. One of ColorSnap's components is what PMC refers to as an \"extruding rail.\" At trial, PMC witnesses did not dispute that the rail is designed so that a color strip may be inserted into front portion of it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 590:17-591:3 (testimony of Tomas Kovacs). The extruding rail therefore features a \"panel with a channel adapted to receive a roofing material.\" Tr. 136:6-10. That panel, and the way in which it receives roofing material, can be seen in the images captured from a ColorSnap promotional video below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Def.'s Ex. 39 at 00:34, 00:35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 73 (extruding bar with color strip).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   PMC disputes, however, that this rail has a \"rear portion with an outwardly extending multisurfaced protrusion designed to mate with corresponding substantially inverse surfaces of the second portion of the mounting adaptor.\" Tr. 469:1-17. PMC argues that there is no mating between these surfaces because, according to their expert Robert Mercier, the top block merely sits on the rail. Tr. 462:8-19. To mate, Mr. Mercier contended, would require that a connection be formed to keep the adapter in place without any further support.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   PMC Post-Trial Brief \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   The Court gives little weight to Mr. Mercier's testimony, as his expertise in this field is rather limited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court further notes that, were Mr. Mercier correct, the VersaClip and cross-member of the ColorGard-the preferred embodiment of the patent-would not mate, either, as the VersaClip also needs additional support to be held in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The second portion of the mounting adaptor, as discussed above, is the portion of the top block that is shaped like a hook. That portion is not merely sitting on the protrusion-it interlocks with it and is clearly designed to do so, as seen in this image:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Pls.' Ex. DDDDD. The substantially inverse surfaces of the mounting adaptor's second portion are clearly identified in the image marked up below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Pls.' Ex. BBBBB. As seen here, the protrusion lines up with these surfaces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The Court therefore finds that this limitation is present in the ColorSnap system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   <strong>\n    5. First and Second Means\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The fifth limitation requires that the mounting system has \"first and second means for detachably interconnecting said cross member with said second adaptor portion of said first and second mounting adaptors, respectively.\" The Claim Construction Order construed this limitation as \"first and second surfaces of the second portion of each mounting adaptor that interface with substantially inverse surfaces of the cross member protrusion.\" Claim Const. Order at 12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   This limitation is, in essence, the corollary of the above limitation. In other words, this limitation requires that the mounting adaptor's two surfaces line up with the protrusion's substantially inverse surfaces. The top block does have two such surfaces, as identified by Mr. Haddock in the image below:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Pls.' Ex. EEEEE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The Court therefore finds that this limitation is present in the ColorSnap system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Claim 16\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Claim 16 is a dependent claim of the '629 Patent, and reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   16. The mounting system of claim 15, wherein:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   said first adaptor portion of each of said first and second mounting adaptors comprises a first hole, wherein said first and second fasteners extend through said first hole on said first and second mounting adaptors, respectively, and into said first and second mounting clamps, respectively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Pls.' Ex. A. This claim simply requires that, if all the elements of Claim 15 are met, the first mounting adaptor portion have a hole that the fasteners (from the third limitation of Claim 15) can be inserted into before being screwed or bolted into the mounting clamp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   The top block's first area, indeed, has such a hole through which the fastener is inserted, before being into the mounting clamp, as seen in these images:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Def.'s Ex. 24; Pls.' Ex. CCCCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   The sole limitation of Claim 16 therefore is present in the ColorSnap system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. FINDINGS OF FACT: THE ISSUE OF IRREPARABLE HARM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   As Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction, they bear the burden of showing that any infringement of the '629 Patent caused irreparable harm to them. This section sets forth the Court's findings of fact as to\n   the harm flowing from PMC's manufacture, sale, and distribution of ColorSnap. The Court's conclusions of law address whether these harms are sufficient to justify permanent injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Market Share &amp; Lost Sales\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Mr. Haddock testified that \"any product that [PMC] sell using this [patented] technology means it takes a bite out of sales that our company would have had instead.\" Tr. 145:5-8. Plaintiffs occupy \"about 80 percent of this specific market space,\" \"so it's logical to presume that 80 percent of the sales that they make of this system would have fallen to our company instead.\" Tr. 145:10-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   This statement as to the size of ColorGard's market share-which was not supported by any documentation or other evidence in the record-does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that every ten sales of the ColorSnap denies Plaintiffs eight sales of ColorGard. Mr. Haddock's claim does not account for other market competitors, or the fact that customers of PMC may already be pursuing an alternative to the dominant market leader.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Indeed, on cross-examination, Mr. Haddock admitted that Plaintiffs had not commissioned any studies that could assess or quantify ColorSnap's impact on market share or sales. Tr. 196:21-197:12. He also admitted that he could not identify any lost sales or lost customers due to ColorSnap. Tr. 198:11-20. He claimed that he could not do that because he did not know PMC's customer list. Tr. 198:15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   In the post-trial oral argument, Plaintiffs claimed that they could not be expected to assess lost sales because they sell ColorGard through distribution and therefore do not know their own specific sales or end customers. Post-Trial Arg. Tr. 29:24-30:1. It is not clear from the record, however, why Plaintiffs could not have reasonably sought to obtain any such information, or other information in PMC's possession relevant to assessing markets share or lost sales, during discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   While Plaintiffs are not required to show lost market share or sales through direct evidence, they must still make some prima facie showing in this regard.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robert Bosch LLC v. Pylon Mfg. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049854\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/659/1142/#p1148\">\n    659 F.3d 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (\"While it is true that at least some of Bosch's loss of market share is attributable to other competitors, it is undisputed that it was Pylon that secured the Wal-Mart account, which alone accounts for a substantial portion of the entire market. Pylon argues that Bosch presumes 'that Wal-Mart would turn to Bosch if Pylon were enjoined.' Bosch, however, makes no such presumption. Rather, Bosch relies on the fact that it previously secured the Wal-Mart account as circumstantial evidence that it would reclaim Wal-Mart's business were Pylon enjoined. While the party seeking an injunction bears the burden of showing lost market share, this showing need not be made with direct evidence. Here, Bosch made a prima facie showing of lost market share, and Pylon proffered no evidence to rebut that showing.\") (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have not made the necessary showing of lost market share or sales, the Court does not find that Plaintiffs have suffered a loss of market share or sales due to PMC's conduct. This does not mean that the Court finds the inverse to be true (that no loss of market share or sales occurred), but simply that there is insufficient evidence in the record to support such a finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Reputational Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Mr. Haddock also testified about harms to Plaintiffs' reputation as a result of PMC's manufacture, sale, and distribution of ColorSnap. Plaintiffs have established\n   their reputation-and the reputation of Mr. Haddock-as a primary innovator in this field.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 II(B) &amp; II(C). They also have established the harms to their reputation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   First, the appearance of infringement has led to numerous inquiries from distributors and customers. Tr. 144:24-145:4. These inquiries were apparently so persistent that, apart from filing this lawsuit, Plaintiffs also took other measures, such as announcing the filing of this litigation at a distributorship conference, Tr. 207:8-10, and later issuing a press release, shortly before an industry trade show, to update distributors and customers of the status of this case. Def.'s Ex. 55; Tr. 205:11-25, 207:3-7. That press release was, at the time of trial, still available on the S-5! website. Tr. 286:25-287:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Second, PMC's marketing of ColorSnap against ColorGard has resulted in serious reputational harms to Plaintiffs. Mr. Haddock specifically pointed to a video in which PMC conducted a \"speed test\" of ColorSnap against ColorGard. The following images captured from that video depict that \"test\":\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Pls.' Ex. DDDD at 1:37, 2:04, 2:19, 2:39, 2:50, and 3:12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Mr. Haddock testified that this video has been shown at trade shows and is available to watch online. Tr. 146:3-9. Mr. Haddock explained that it harms Plaintiffs because its comparison of ColorSnap to ColorGard implies that ColorSnap looks like ColorGard, installs faster than ColorGard, and therefore \"must be as good as or better than\" ColorGard. Tr. 146:13-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Mr. Haddock also testified that in manufacturing, selling, and distributing ColorSnap, PMC was \"trying to piggyback and usurp some of our brand recognition and our brand integrity by using such a similar name.\" Tr. 98:4-10. As he elaborated at trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-243\">\n   Well, by creating a name so similar and a product so similar and videos that compare our product with their product, I think they're usurping our brand integrity because users or viewers of that kind of media would rather naturally conclude, well, gosh, it sounds the same as ColorGard, it looks the same as ColorGard ... it must have all the brand\n   integrity behind it that ColorGard does. And part of that brand integrity involves the extensive load testing that we have done on all our parts and systems. And that's what really makes us so different than most of our competitors. By using the same name and by using very similar shapes and principles with a slide-in color strip, I believe they are usurping our brand integrity. They are piggybacking on all the work that we have done in test labs in this establishing the fact that our systems are all engineered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Tr. 220:12-221:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   PMC argues that Plaintiffs have \"produced no evidence of brand diminution or other non-economic harm that may result from any future infringement by PMC.\" Def.'s Post-Trial Brief \u00b6 161. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Indisputably, the purpose for the public dissemination of PMC's marketing video is to diminish the reputation of the ColorGard product in the marketplace, i.e., to show that ColorSnap is a better product in order to convince consumers to buy ColorSnap instead. Because of PMC's literal infringement of the ColorGard product, which facilitated the introduction and availability of the ColorSnap product in the marketplace, Plaintiffs have suffered an irreparable harm to its reputation, a reputation diminished by the dissemination of PMC's comparison video and a harm not remedied by money alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   The Court therefore finds that the sale, manufacture, and distribution of ColorSnap has resulted in significant intangible reputational harm to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   This case involves the issue of patent infringement and any appropriate remedy. This Court, however, also must address two other legal issues: (1) whether Mr. Mercier's proffered expert testimony should be excluded; and (2) whether Mr. Bailey violated the Court's sequestration order and, if so, whether sanctions should be imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Expert Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   To prove patent infringement, parties typically rely heavily on the testimony of expert witnesses. This case is no exception. The parties dispute, however, the relevant qualifications necessary for an expert in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, courts may permit expert testimony if (1) the expert is qualified as an expert by their knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education; (2) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (3) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (4) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (5) the expert has reliable applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case. FED. R. EVID. 702.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   During the bench trial, the Court admitted Mr. Haddock as an expert in the field of snow retention systems. Tr. 121:23-123:9. PMC did not challenge Mr. Haddock's admission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Plaintiffs objected, however, to PMC's proposed expert, Mr. Mercier, who was offered as an expert in the fields of manufacturing, engineering, and product design, including snow retention systems. Tr. 413:20-23. Plaintiffs challenged both his qualifications and his methodology. The Court reserved decision during trial and now concludes that Mr. Mercier may be admitted as an expert-but, as noted above, has given little weight to his opinions, given his limited experience with snow retention systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The trial court did not err in refusing to strike Donohue's testimony.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   When prejudice is shown, however, district courts have exercised their discretion to exclude testimony.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paradigm All., Inc. v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that Mr. Bailey's conduct, as alleged, did not violate the express terms of the sequestration order. While Plaintiffs contend that the order barred \"all prospective trial witnesses ... from hearing, overhearing, being advised of, reading, and discussing in-court witness testimony,\" Pls.' Post-Trial Brief \u00b6 108, nothing in the Court's order provided for more than fact witnesses' exclusion from the courtroom during testimony. Nevertheless, courts have recognized that while the plain language of Rule 615 refers only to exclusion from the courtroom so that witnesses cannot hear other witnesses' testimony, Rule 615 has been given a \"long-standing and consistent judicial construction of prohibiting all prospective witnesses from hearing, overhearing, being advised of, reading, and discussing, the previously given in-court testimony of witnesses on their own side as well as the opposite side.\"\n   <em>\n    Weeks Dredging &amp; Contracting, Inc. v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5634043\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cl-ct/11/37/#p53\">\n    11 Cl. Ct. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53 (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   The Court does not find, however, that Plaintiffs have shown that Mr. Bailey violated this broader understanding of the sequestration order. Plaintiffs have cited statements by Mr. Bailey under cross-examination in which he agreed with Plaintiffs' counsel' that he had \"discussed\" with several PMC witnesses the testimony they \"gave in this case - in this trial,\" that he did this \"in the evening,\" and that he \"spoke with counsel\" about the testimony of witnesses in this case. Tr. 869:16-870:21, 885:6-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   These alleged admissions came in the context of cross-examination in which Plaintiffs were asserting that Mr. Bailey had reviewed the trial transcripts of other witnesses' testimony. On re-direct, however, Mr. Bailey clarified that he had not reviewed any transcripts from this trial, but only from his own deposition. Tr. 885:18-886:15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   Putting the transcript issue aside, Mr. Bailey's statements still do not support Plaintiffs' claim that Mr. Bailey \"participated in after-Court briefing sessions where testimony of the other witnesses was freely and openly discussed.\" Pls.' Post-Trial Brief \u00b6 109. Yet even if this were true, the Court does not find that Plaintiffs have shown that they were seriously prejudiced by Mr. Bailey's testimony. Plaintiffs claim Mr. Bailey's testimony on willfulness was crucial, because he testified that PMC had primarily relied on Mr. Wasserbauer's September 2015 preliminary opinion. Pls.' Post-Trial Brief \u00b6 109. That fact is well-supported, however, by other testimony already in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 331:17-332:2, 343:4-346:12. Nor is that fact persuasive on, or even determinative of, the ultimate question of willfulness here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   The Court therefore finds that Mr. Bailey's testimony does not need to be excluded. Instead, the Court-as the finder of fact here-has taken Mr. Bailey's statements into consideration in evaluating the credibility of his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

We base this conclusion not only on the Patent\n   Act's statutory right to exclude, which derives from the Constitution, but also on the importance of the patent system in encouraging innovation. Injunctions are vital to this system. As a result, the public interest nearly always weighs in favor of protecting property rights in the absence of countervailing factors, especially when the patentee practices his inventions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   <em>\n    Apple V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4059795\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/633/#p639\">\n    809 F.3d at 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   Here, the public interest is best served by protecting patent rights and entering a permanent injunction against PMC-particularly given that PMC's ability to compete in this market, as set forth above, would not have been possible absent infringement of the '629 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have demonstrated an irreparable injury, an inadequate remedy at law, that the balance of the hardships favors them, and that the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction, it is appropriate to enjoin the sale, manufacture, and distribution of the ColorSnap system in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   <strong>\n    F.
