(\"Genz-Ryan\") sued Weyerhaeuser NR Company (\"Weyerhaeuser\") in Minnesota state court, bringing breach of contract, promissory estoppel, and unjust enrichment claims. Weyerhaeuser removed to federal court, counterclaimed for declaratory relief, and moved to dismiss Genz-Ryan's equitable claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Genz-Ryan opposed Weyerhaeuser's Motion to Dismiss and moved for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. This matter is before the Court on Weyerhaeuser's Motion to Dismiss and Genz-Ryan's Motion for Sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Weyerhaeuser is a timber and wood products company. In or around July 2017, Weyerhaeuser discovered that one of its\n   products, \"TJI Joists with Flak Jacket Protection\" (\"Product\"), was emitting formaldehyde and had to be remediated. Weyerhaeuser contracted with BlueSky Restoration Contractors, LLC (\"BlueSky\") to remediate the Product in Minnesota homes. BlueSky subcontracted Genz-Ryan for remediation services in homes built by CalAtlantic Group, Inc. (\"CalAtlantic\"). From December 7, 2017 to the present, Genz-Ryan performed remediation services on homes that incorporated the Product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Genz-Ryan alleges that two contracts govern the remediation work. First, on December 7, 2017, Weyerhaeuser, Genz-Ryan, BlueSky, and CalAtlantic supposedly entered into an Oral Agreement (\"Oral Agreement\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   whereby Genz-Ryan agreed to accelerate its remediation work schedule in exchange for Weyerhaeuser paying its \"past and continuing costs, losses, and damages including all of its lost business opportunities and profits arising from - or related to - the remediation work previously furnished by Genz-Ryan as well as the remediation work to be furnished by Genz-Ryan under the accelerated schedule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notice of Removal, Ex. A, Pl.'s Compl. \u00b6 11. Second, on December 14, 2017 the parties executed an Indemnification and Release Agreement (\"Indemnification Agreement\"), whereby Weyerhaeuser:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold Genz-Ryan from all costs, damages, fees, and expenses arising from the Product, and to pay Genz-Ryan as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In consideration of Genz-Ryan foregoing other business opportunities to deal with the issues related to the [Product], Weyerhaeuser agrees to pay Genz-Ryan for its costs incurred in furnishing services relating to the [Product] or the remediation thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 13. Genz-Ryan alleges Weyerhaeuser has not paid Genz-Ryan for services rendered under either contract, totaling $5,056,518.10 as of January 11, 2018, despite Genz-Ryan performing the remediation services in accordance with the accelerated schedule contemplated in the December 7, 2017 Oral Agreement. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14. Genz-Ryan sued Weyerhaeuser for breach of contract, and in the alternative,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   under theories of promissory estoppel and unjust enrichment. Weyerhaeuser filed a Motion to Dismiss and a Counterclaim\n   seeking declaratory relief. ECF Nos. 10, 9. Genz-Ryan filed a Response to Weyerhaeuser's Motion to Dismiss and moved the Court to sanction Weyerhaeuser under Rule 11. ECF Nos. 16, 20. Weyerhaeuser filed a Reply to Genz-Ryan's responsive memorandum. ECF No. 19.

Genz-Ryan's Promissory Estoppel Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Weyerhaeuser argues that Genz-Ryan failed to state a claim for promissory estoppel. To state a claim for promissory estoppel, the complaint must allege that: (1) a clear and definite promise was made; (2) the promisor intended to induce reliance and the promisee in fact relied to his or her detriment; and (3) the promise must be enforced to prevent injustice.\n   <em>\n    Martens v.

Minn. 2011). Genz-Ryan is permitted to plead a promissory estoppel claim in the alternative, as it did in its Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Weyerhaeuser argues that even when pled in the alternative, Genz-Ryan's promissory estoppel claim lacks plausibility because the parties' relationship is governed by contract. According to Weyerhaeuser, Genz-Ryan's promissory estoppel claim can only be sustained in the absence of a contract and Genz-Ryan does not dispute the existence of governing contracts. This argument does not persuade the Court. It is possible that no contract controls the subject matter underlying Genz-Ryan's promissory estoppel claim for at least two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, the Indemnification Agreement does not necessarily address the subject matter of Genz-Ryan's promissory estoppel claim: namely, it does not address Weyerhaeuser's alleged promise to pay Genz-Ryan lost business opportunities and profits to induce Genz-Ryan to accelerate its schedule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1. To be sure, Weyerhaeuser contends in its Counterclaim that the Indemnification Agreement \"subsumed any and all prior negotiations\" between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Countercl. \u00b6 34, ECF No. 9. If the Court concludes that contention is true, Genz-Ryan may have difficulty prevailing on its promissory estoppel claim because the Indemnification Agreement would presumably govern. However, drawing all reasonable inferences in Genz-Ryan's favor, as the Court must do at this stage, the existence of the Indemnification Agreement does not defeat Genz-Ryan's promissory estoppel claim because it does not address the subject matter of the promissory estoppel claim-the alleged promise to pay for lost business opportunities and profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the Oral Agreement might not amount to a valid contract. Although the alleged Oral Agreement covers the same subject matter as Genz-Ryan's promissory estoppel claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weyerhaeuser disputes the validity of the Oral Agreement in its\n   Counterclaim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court, therefore, may ultimately find that the subject matter of Genz-Ryan's promissory estoppel claim is not governed by a valid contract. And in the absence of a governing contract, Genz-Ryan could potentially state a promissory estoppel claim. This Court has previously allowed promissory estoppel claims to proceed under similar circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krutchen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5885996\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/591/1002/#p1018\">\n    591 F.Supp.2d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (permitting promissory estoppel claim, which was \"duplicative\" of a breach of contract claim, to proceed as an alternative theory subject to later challenge as the record developed more fully);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transp.

Minn. May 10, 2017) (allowing promissory estoppel claim based on a contract claim to proceed to discovery when parties disputed whether valid contract governs). Again, drawing all reasonable inferences in Genz-Ryan's favor, the Court cannot conclude that a valid contract necessarily controls the factual allegations supporting Genz-Ryan's promissory estoppel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court will not opine further on the merits of the Genz-Ryan's promissory estoppel claim because Weyerhaeuser only challenges its plausibility on the grounds that a valid contract governs the dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For these reasons, Weyerhaeuser's Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Complaint is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Court declines to sanction either party for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Rule 11(b) requires an attorney to certify that a pleading or motion (1) \"is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation\" and (2) includes \"claims, defenses, and other legal contentions [that] are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1)-(2). In deciding whether an attorney is liable for sanctions for violating Rule 11, \"the standard is ... whether the attorney's conduct, 'viewed objectively, manifests either intentional or reckless disregard of the attorney's duties to the court.' \"\n   <em>\n    Adams v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276079\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/863/1069/#p1077\">\n    863 F.3d 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1077 (8th Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). \"If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines Rule 11(b) has been violated, the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule or is responsible for the violation.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Genz-Ryan asserts that Weyerhaeuser does not \"cite any binding authority to justify its contention that Genz-Ryan is precluded from pleading a claim for breach of contract along with inconsistent equitable claims.\" Pl.'s Motion for Sanctions\n   3, ECF No. 20. From this, Genz-Ryan argues that Weyerhaeuser's attorneys \"have knowingly filed a motion that is not warranted under existing law in violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2).\" Pl.'s Motion for Sanctions 4, ECF No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Contrary to Genz-Ryan's assertions, Weyerhaeuser's Motion to Dismiss cites enough support to avoid Rule 11 sanctions. The Court therefore denies Genz-Ryan's Motion for Sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In its response to Genz-Ryan's Motion for Sanctions, Weyerhaeuser, in turn, asked the Court to sanction Genz-Ryan for filing its Motion for Sanctions. Because Genz-Ryan failed to cite any cases where a court sanctioned a party for filing a motion to dismiss like Weyerhaeuser's, Weyerhaeuser argues that Genz-Ryan had no \"objectively reasonable\" basis for believing its motion would be successful on the merits. Although Genz-Ryan's Motion for Sanctions is itself not clearly warranted under existing law, the Court declines to impose Rule 11 sanctions against Genz-Ryan at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on the files, records, and proceedings herein, and for the reasons stated above, IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   1.
