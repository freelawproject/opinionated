Cincinnati seeks a declaration that it has no duty to indemnify Defendant Milionis Construction, Inc. (\"Milionis\"). Defendants Jeffrey and Anna Wood oppose the motion as individual defendants and as assignees of Milionis and Defendant Stephen Milionis. ECF No. 90. Having reviewed the pleadings and the file in this matter, the Court is fully informed and grants the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case arises from a lawsuit that Jeffrey and Anna Wood filed against Milionis and Stephen Milionis in the Spokane County Superior Court (\"the underlying\n   action\") on November 18, 2016. The Woods had hired Milionis as the general contractor for the construction of a residential home. ECF No. 89-1 at 54. In the underlying action, the Woods alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Milionis breached the parties' agreement by leaving the home unfinished.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-66. Milionis's insurer, Cincinnati, defended Milionis under a reservation of rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cincinnati then brought the instant action while the underlying action was still pending, seeking a declaratory judgment that it did not have a duty to defend or indemnify Milionis in the underlying action. ECF No. 1. On March 13, 2018, Cincinnati moved for summary judgment on the issue of coverage, i.e., whether it had the duty to defend and indemnify. ECF No. 32. The Court denied the motion, concluding that based on the eight corners of the policy and the complaint in the underlying action, Cincinnati had a duty to defend. ECF No. 63 at 6-7. The Court also found that questions of fact precluded summary judgment on whether Cincinnati had a duty to indemnify.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Now that the underlying action has concluded and the parties have engaged in extensive discovery, Cincinnati renews its partial summary judgment motion on the issue of coverage. ECF No. 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Liability Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 23, 2014, Cincinnati issued to Milionis a commercial general liability policy, Policy Number CSU0053004. ECF No. 88 at 2. It was effective until November 23, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The policy provides Milionis coverage for \"sums that [it] becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage.' \" ECF No. 89-1 at 8. This insurance applies to \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   only if \"caused by an 'occurrence'\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   that takes place in the 'coverage territory.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The policy also contains provisions limiting insurance. It specifically excludes insurance for property damage to \"that particular part of real property on which [Milionis] or any contractors or subcontractors working ... on [its] behalf are performing operations, if the 'property damage' arises out of those operations\" (\"operations exclusion\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. It further excludes insurance for property damage to \"that particular part of any property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because '[its] work'\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   was incorrectly performed on it\" (\"repair exclusion\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The policy also contains an Independent Contractors Limitations of Coverage Endorsement (\"ICL\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. The ICL requires Milionis, \"as a condition to and for coverage to be provided by this policy,\" to (1) obtain a formal written contract\n   with all independent contractors and subcontractors verifying valid commercial general liability insurance; (2) obtain a formal written contract stating the independent contractors or subcontractors agree \"to defend, indemnify and hold [Milionis] harmless from any and all liability, loss, actions, costs;\" and (3) verify in the contract that the independent contractors or subcontractors have named Milionis as an additional insured on their general liability policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The ICL emphasizes that \"\n   <strong>\n    this insurance will not apply to any loss, claim or 'suit' for any liability or any damages arising out of operations or completed operations performed for [Milionis] by any independent contractors or subcontractors unless all of the above conditions are met.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Milionis itself \"performed no labor on the subject construction project,\" ECF No. 92-4 at 4, except excavation, ECF No. 89-2 at 120. It hired subcontractors to do \"pretty much everything\" else. ECF No. 89-2 at 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its November 28, 2016 reservation-of-rights letter, Cincinnati quoted the ICL and requested that Milionis send it contracts if \"any of the work was subcontracted out.\" ECF No. 89-1 at 75. Again on May 18, 2017, Cincinnati requested copies of Milionis's subcontractor contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78. On October 16, 2017, Cincinnati finally wrote to Milionis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   It is our understanding that Milionis hired subcontractors to perform work on the Woods' house, but it did not have written contracts for some or all of that work, as is required by the Independent Contractors Restriction. Cincinnati's policy, therefore, does not appear to apply to some or all of the damages claimed in the Woods' lawsuit. Should this understanding be in any way incorrect, please provide ... copies of all contracts between Milionis and its subcontractors for this project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To date, Milionis has not sent Cincinnati any subcontractor contracts or proof of Milionis's additional insured status as required by the ICL.

Property Damage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court now turns to the property damage in order to trace back to the cause to determine if any exclusions or limitations apply.

ECF No. 88 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, Milionis does not dispute that it did not meet the conditions precedent-obtaining subcontractor contracts and being named as an additional insured on the subcontractors' liability policies. Thus, if Cincinnati can show actual prejudice, then it is not responsible for any \"loss, claim or 'suit' \" arising out of the work that subcontractors performed, which was \"pretty much everything.\" ECF No. 89-2 at 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

ECF No. 87 at 15. Moreover, it deprived Milionis of the ability to have direct contractual rights to a defense and coverage from the subcontractors' insurers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=961%20P.2d%20358\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, Cincinnati was left with no other insurers and parties to share in the costs of defending and indemnifying Milionis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In opposition, the Woods argue that because \"Milionis's liability to the Woods is based on Milionis's conduct,\" not the terms of the ICL or the work of any subcontractors, there could have been no prejudice. ECF No. 90 at 15. The Woods are incorrect. Liability includes loss, i.e., property damage. Property damage is \"the actual loss, injury, or deterioration of the property itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Overton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314616\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/145/417/#p429\">\n    145 Wash. 2d at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20P.3d%20322\">\n    38 P.3d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Property damage is not, as the Woods seem to suggest, the overall amount of\n   <em>\n    damages-\n   </em>\n   or compensating loss-that the state court entered in the underlying action, whether it was higher or lower than the amount of actual property damage.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 90;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20P.3d%20322\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This distinction removes the focus from Milionis's negligent conduct and appropriately analyzes whether any resulting loss and liability from property damage fell within the scope of the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diamaco\n   </em>\n   , 97 Wash. App. at 337,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=983%20P.2d%20707\">\n    983 P.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the insurance policy at issue here is not a performance bond, it is of no import that the subcontractors may not have caused any property damage had Milionis properly performed. Thus, the Court rejects the Woods's unsuccessful arguments that the property damage they suffered was the sole result of Milionis's negligence, i.e., administrative failures, and that any exclusions or limitations to the policy do not apply because they do not involve damage from negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 90 at 6-7, 9, 14, 16, 19-20. Again, the focus falls on the property damage itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Woods additionally posit that \"there are disputed facts relating to any allegation of prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. However, the Court is unpersuaded because they do not identify those facts or explain why they are material. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Cincinnati met its burden to show concrete and identifiable prejudice, as the underlying action has concluded and Cincinnati alone is left to pay coverage owed under the policy. No rational jury could find otherwise. Therefore, Cincinnati is relieved of its duty to indemnify under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While the result in this case is unfortunate because the Woods could not have foreseen that entering a contract to have their dream home built would result in years of legal action and resulting damages, they are at the mercy of Milionis's general liability policy, at least in this action. And Milionis could have protected itself and any assignees by complying with the policy's conditions or by paying a larger premium to modify the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court sees no reason to consider Cincinnati's additional arguments that the operations exclusion and repair exclusion apply to any remaining speculative property damage. Not only did the Woods never make such speculated arguments, but also, the terms of the ICL are broad enough to encompass costs to repair and replace parts of the house that were defectively constructed and structurally deficient. And this includes any damage to the unfinished house from sitting exposed to the elements,\n   as it arose out of the subcontractors' operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Renewed Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Re Coverage,\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 87\n   </strong>\n   , is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   The Clerk's Office is directed to\n   <strong>\n    ENTER DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n   in Plaintiff's favor that Plaintiff the Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company is not required to indemnify Defendant Milionis Construction, Inc. in the underlying suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    On July 20, 2018, the state court entered a stipulated judgment against Milionis for damages \"in the principal amount of $1,700,000, plus reasonable attorney fees and costs and interest.\" ECF No. 89-2 at 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    \"Property damage\" means \"physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property,\" or \"loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\" ECF No. 89-1 at 23.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    \"Occurrence\" is defined as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 22.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    This means \"work or operations performed by [Milionis] or on its behalf.\" ECF No. 89-1 at 24.
