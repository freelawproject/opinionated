(Doc. 1 \u00b6 11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the same day, Plaintiff Foster Logging Inc. (\"Foster\") was harvesting timber nearby. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) On April 21, 2017, Plaintiff Foster parked its equipment in the B-19.5 area near Fort Stewart. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) According to the complaint, the fire spread to the B-19.5 area and damaged Plaintiff Foster's equipment after the Government failed to properly monitor and maintain the prescribed burn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) Some of the damaged equipment was insured by Plaintiff American Guarantee and Liability Insurance Company (\"AGLIC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) As a result of the damage to the property, Plaintiff Foster was unable to harvest timber for three days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Plaintiff Foster was required to rent equipment to continue harvesting timber in the area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 19, 2018, Plaintiffs Foster and AGLIC brought suit alleging that the Government was negligent in its maintenance of the prescribed fire. (Doc. 1.) In the complaint, Plaintiff AGLIC seeks to recover $247,348.12, plus costs, for damage caused to the insured equipment as a result of the Government's failure to properly monitor and maintain the controlled burn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Additionally, Plaintiff Foster seeks to recover $125,120.52, plus costs, to account for uncovered losses sustained as a result of the fire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Government has now filed a Motion to Dismiss, seeking dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) (1). (Doc. 11.) In its motion, the Government contends that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs' claims because the Government retains its sovereign immunity in this action. In response, Plaintiffs contend that the Government has waived its immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202678\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq.

Ultimately, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the discretionary function did not bar the plaintiff's claim because \"once the Corps exercised its discretion to build and maintain the stairs, failure to maintain them in a safe condition is simply not a permissible exercise of policy judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1372.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In this case, Plaintiffs contend that the Government also did not make a permissible policy judgment by failing \"to observe, monitor, and maintain the fire.\" (Doc. 14 at 3.) Plaintiffs contend that once the Government initiated the controlled burn, the Government was obligated to maintain the fire so as not to damage Plaintiff Foster's property. Plaintiffs argue that, like the impermissible decision to not maintain the stairs in\n   <em>\n    Swafford\n   </em>\n   , the Government's decision not to control the prescribed burn did not involve a valid policy determination that would meet the requirements of the second prong of the discretionary function exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After careful consideration, the Court disagrees with Plaintiffs' position. First, the Court finds that the conduct and policy judgments at issue in\n   <em>\n    Swafford\n   </em>\n   are materially distinguishable from the facts and policy judgments alleged in this case. In\n   <em>\n    Swafford\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit found that the failure to maintain a staircase did not constitute a permissible exercise of judgment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177863\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/1365/#p1370\">\n    839 F.3d at 1371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, however, there are markedly more policy considerations that could have affected the Government's decision not only to initiate the controlled fire, but to maintain and control the fire. When maintaining a fire, the Government may need to consider certain policy implications that include the safety of public citizens in the area, the safety of those monitoring the fire, and the management of limited resources used to control a fire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the Government may need to consider certain policy implications related to the fire and the protection of surrounding natural resources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Autery v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11969787\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/992/1523/#p1531\">\n    992 F.2d 1523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1531 (11th Cir. 1993) (finding that the discretionary function should apply when government officials had to consider \"the extent to which the natural state of the forest should be preserved\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition, the existence of the military base at Fort Stewart also adds weight to the Government's position that the discretionary function exception should apply in this case. In\n   <em>\n    OSI, Inc. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446931\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/947/#p949\">\n    285 F.3d 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 949 (11th Cir. 2002), a metal building manufacturer sued the United States Air Force for its alleged negligence in the maintenance of three solid waste landfills that polluted a local groundwater source. In concluding that the discretionary function barred the manufacturer's suit against the Air Force, the Eleventh Circuit emphasized the unique policy considerations that arise when dealing with a military base.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446931\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/947/#p949\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446931\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/947/#p949\">\n    at 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The nature of the military's function requires that it be free to weigh environmental policies against security and military concerns.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, in this case, the Government had to consider the needs of the military base in making decisions with respect to how it monitored and controlled the prescribed burn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ultimately, the Court finds that the Government's decision to initiate and maintain the prescribed burn falls within the discretionary function exception to the FTCA. The Court finds that the decision to initiate and maintain the fire involved an element of judgment and implicated important policy considerations. Accordingly, the Government has not waived its immunity in this case and Plaintiffs' suit is barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Government's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of Plaintiffs' claims.
