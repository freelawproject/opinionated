DEVER III, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On June 3, 2016, Abbington SPE, LLC (\"Abbington\" or \"plaintiff\") filed suit in\n   Onslow County Superior Court against U.S. Bank, National Association (\"U.S. Bank\") and C-III Asset Management, LLC (\"C-III\") (collectively, \"defendants\") alleging various contract and tort claims under North Carolina law [D.E. 1-2] 2-19. On July 11, 2016, defendants removed Abbington's action to this court based on diversity jurisdiction [D.E. 1]. On July 18, 2016, defendants moved to dismiss Abbington's complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) [D.E. 7] and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 8]. Abbington responded in opposition to the motion to dismiss [D.E. 12], and defendants replied [D.E. 15]. On August 9, 2016, Abbington moved to remand the action to Onslow County Superior Court based on a forum-selection clause in the promissory note [D.E. 13] and filed a memorandum in support [D.E. 14]. Defendants responded in opposition to the motion to remand [D.E. 17], and Abbington replied [D.E. 18]. As explained below, the court denies Abbington's motion to remand and grants defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In December 2005, Abbington executed a promissory note for $17,500,000 in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. in order to purchase real property in Onslow County, North Carolina. Compl. [D.E. 1-2] \u00b6\u00b6 4-7. Defendant U.S. Bank is the successor-in-interest to that promissory note, and defendant C-III is the loan's \"special servicer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The promissory note contained numerous obligations. First, the note contained a \"due-date provision,\" stating that \"principal and interest shall be due and payable thereafter in equal consecutive monthly installments of $100,022.86 each beginning on February 11, 2009, and continuing on the eleventh (11th) day of each and every month\" until Abbington repaid the loan. [D.E. 1-2] 25. Additionally, Abbington agreed to an \"event-of-default\" provision, stating that \"[a]n 'Event of Default' shall be deemed to exist if [ ] any sum payable under this Note is not paid on or before the date such payment is due.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   28. When \"any Event of Default exists ... interest shall accrue on the outstanding principal balance of the Note at a rate per annum equal to five percent (5.0%) plus the interest rate which would be in effect hereunder absent such Event of Default.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The promissory note included a separate \"late-fee provision,\" providing that \"[i]n the event that any payment is not received ... within fifteen (15) days after the date when due, then in addition to any default interest payments due hereunder, Borrower shall also pay to Lender a late charge in an amount equal to four percent (4.0%) of the amount of such overdue payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before June 2015, Abbington made payments on the loan on or before the 11th of each month. Compl. \u00b6 17. At some point \"[d]uring the term of the loan,\" Abbington received statements that it claims indicated that there was a \"grace period in which payments could be timely received from the 11th of each month through and including the 26th of each month.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [D.E. 1-3] 20-23. On June 22, 2015, Abbington tendered a late payment. Compl. \u00b6 18. On June 25, 2015, U.S. Bank sent Abbington a letter notifying Abbington that \"[t]he Loan is in default based on the Borrower's failure to make payments as and when due,\" but U.S. Bank \"ha[d] chosen not to exercise its rights\" at that time. [D.E. 1-3] 25, 34. On June 29, 2015, Deanna Jones (\"Jones\"), Abbington's controller and vice president of accounting, sent an email confirming that she had spoken to \"Peter at C-III Asset Management,\" that she was aware \"[t]he grace period is basically for late fees not to be a[ssessed],\" and that \"standard procedure\n   [was] to place [the] loan in default if payment is not received by the due date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   32. Jones also confirmed that she knew that the \"due date\" was the \"11th.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July, August, and September 2015, Abbington again failed to make timely payments. Compl. \u00b6 19. On November 6, 2015, U.S. Bank sent a letter to Abbington \"accelarat[ing] the outstanding balance of the Note and demand[ing] payment in full.\" [D.E. 1-3] 29-30;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 22. In response, Abbington requested multiple \"payoff statements.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-39. On March 3, 2016, subject to a reservation of rights, Abbington paid $16,578,956.99, the amount defendants claimed was due in the third adjusted payoff statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-39; [D.E. 1-3] 92-96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 3, 2016, Abbington filed suit against defendants in Onslow County Superior Court, alleging that defendants violated North Carolina contract and tort law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-94. Abbington asserted the following claims: (1) breach of contract,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-46; (2) fraudulent misrepresentation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-53; (3) negligent misrepresentation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-61; (4) breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-70; (5) \"declaratory judgment determining estoppel and violation of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 45-36.7,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-81; (6) unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of North Carolina's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"UDTPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2075-1.1\">\n    N.C.

This representation has been shown to be false by Defendants' charging of late fees for payments made after the 11th, but before the 26th.

Insofar as Abbington contends that defendants stated that payment after the 11th would not trigger the event-of-default clause, Abbington was contractually obligated to make payments by the 11th of each month in order to avoid an event of default. The promissory note plainly stated this obligation, and defendants reminded Abbington of this fact after the June 22, 2015 late payment.
