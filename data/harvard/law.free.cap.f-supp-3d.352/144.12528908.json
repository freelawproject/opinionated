Here, even assuming\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    that Defendant is correct that no contract was formed, Massachusetts courts have not found a consummated contract necessary to exercise long-arm jurisdiction under Section 3(a). Further, much like the defendant in\n    <em>\n     Haddad\n    </em>\n    , Defendant negotiated the employment contract via phone and email while Plaintiff was in the Commonwealth. Finally, as the land for sale in\n    <em>\n     Haddad\n    </em>\n    was in Massachusetts, Defendant contemplated that at least some of Plaintiff's services would be rendered from his home in the Commonwealth. Thus, I find that Defendant transacted business in the Commonwealth within the meaning of the long-arm statute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    In addition to Defendant transacting business in the forum, Plaintiff's claims have arisen from Defendant's transaction of business in the Commonwealth. In accordance with the broad construction of the long-arm statute, the court in\n    <em>\n     Tatro\n    </em>\n    interpreted the \"arising from\" requirement to require only \"but for\" causation.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"819056\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/416/763/#p767\">\n     416 Mass. at 770\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=625%20N.E.2d%20549\">\n     625 N.E.2d 549\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"terms such as 'arising from' ... should be interpreted as creating a 'but for' test. This test permits jurisdiction in a case [where the transaction of business is] the first step in a train of events that results in the [harm].\"). Here, Defendant's conduct easily satisfies the \"but for\" causation standard. Plaintiff's claims arise directly from Defendant's transaction of business in the Commonwealth. Indeed, Plaintiff's negotiations and consummation of an employment\n    contract with Defendant were the first step in the train of events resulting to his alleged harms.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Because Defendant has transacted business in the Commonwealth within the meaning of the Massachusetts long-arm statute and because Plaintiff's claims arise from that transaction under the \"but for\" standard, I find that asserting jurisdiction is proper under state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    <em>\n     2. Constitutional Due Process\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Because Plaintiff has satisfied his burden of demonstrating that exercising jurisdiction does not violate the Massachusetts long-arm statute, he must now demonstrate that it does not offend the Due Process Clause. \"The exercise of personal jurisdiction may, consistent with due process, be either specific or case-linked or general or all-purpose.\"\n    <em>\n     Cossart v.

In\n    <em>\n     Copia\n    </em>\n    , on the other hand, the First Circuit found exercising specific jurisdiction improper where none of the factors were present.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357244\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/13/#p19\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Importantly, neither the\n    <em>\n     Cossart\n    </em>\n    nor\n    <em>\n     Copia\n    </em>\n    courts suggested that the presence of all three factors were necessary to find purposeful availment. Instead, the caselaw suggests that if a defendant satisfies all three factors, it has purposefully availed itself of the forum, and if a defendant has not satisfied any of the factors, it has not purposefully availed itself. Here, two of the facts are present. Defendant solicited Plaintiff's services while he was at home in the Commonwealth. Further, the contract envisioned the performance of in-forum services. While Plaintiff has not actually performed extensive in-forum services like the plaintiff in\n    <em>\n     Cossart\n    </em>\n    , it would be a strange result to allow Defendant to evade suit in the Commonwealth simply by breaching a contract that envisioned performance in the forum before Plaintiff had an opportunity to perform. Indeed, Defendant's voluntary actions in the Commonwealth-entering into an employment contract with a Massachusetts resident that envisioned performance in the forum-certainly rendered suit in the forum foreseeable. Therefore, I find that Defendant has purposefully availed itself of the forum with respect to Plaintiff's contract claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Turning to Plaintiff's tort claims, as mentioned above, these claims are based on the same underlying conduct by Defendant. Because Defendant's conduct in the Commonwealth was both voluntary and made it foreseeable that it would be haled into a Massachusetts court, Defendant has also purposefully availed itself of the forum with respect to Plaintiff's tort claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <em>\n     iii.
