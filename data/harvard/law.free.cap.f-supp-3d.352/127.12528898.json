PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In light of what follows, it is perhaps helpful to describe the course of proceedings in some detail. CellInfo filed its complaint with this Court on June 15, 2018. Compl. 26. Forty-five days later, American Tower filed a motion to dismiss CellInfo's complaint or, in the alternative, stay this action and compel arbitration, as well as an accompanying memorandum. Defs.' Mot. Dismiss/Stay 1-2; Defs.' Mem. Dismiss/Stay 18. Nearly a month passed; then, on August 27, 2018, CellInfo filed its opposition to American Tower's motion to dismiss, Pl.'s Opp'n 9, and -- signaling a change of course -- a motion to expedite discovery, CellInfo's Mot. Expedited Disc. (\"Pl.'s Mot. Disc\") 1-2, ECF No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The next day, CellInfo further moved for a preliminary injunction against American Tower. CellInfo's Mot. Prelim. Inj. 1-2, ECF No. 29. American Tower duly filed their opposition to CellInfo's motions for expedited discovery and preliminary injunction on September 14, 2018. Defs.' Mem. Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Expedited Disc, ECF No. 34; Defs.' Mem. Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 24, 2018, this Court heard argument on the motion to dismiss or stay this action. Hr'g Tr. 1, ECF No. 47. The Court expressed a willingness to collapse a further hearing on the preliminary injunction with trial on the merits, Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a), and asked CellInfo when it wanted to try the case. Hr'g Tr. 3:18-23. Facing the prospect of an actual evidentiary\n   hearing as opposed to dueling affidavits,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   CellInfo promptly lost its appetite for emergency relief. While it welcomed the prospect of complete equitable relief, it indicated that a trial could wait until late January 2019. Hr'g Tr. 3:18-4:3. This Court then denied the motion to dismiss and turned to the preliminary injunction request. Hr'g Tr. 9:2, 11:9-10. American Tower agreed that there was a need to resolve the motion for\n   <strong>\n    preliminary\n   </strong>\n   injunction, but argued that, under the Agreement's arbitration clause, the Court's role was limited to considering whether to issue a \"stand still\" injunction. Hr'g Tr. 6:7-21. Everything else, American Tower argued, had to go to the arbitrators. Hr'g Tr. 6:23-25. Both parties agreed that the Court should construe the Agreement and resolve this initial question. Hr'g Tr. 9-11. Frankly baffled, the Court took the matter under advisement. Hr'g Tr. 11. As it turns out, both parties are wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The way to construe an agreement is to start with the Agreement itself. This one has a broad arbitration clause. It is important to note that this is not \"forced arbitration,\" that one-sided species of arbitration unconscionably forced on vulnerable consumers and workers and almost universally reviled,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   enforceable only due to the mandate of a slim majority of the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Express Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Italian Colors Rest.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/#p238\">\n    570 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238-39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/#p238\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/#p238\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ;\n   <em>\n    AT&amp;T Mobility LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Concepcion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5939512,12458766\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/333/\">\n    563 U.S. 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 344-52,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5939512,12458766\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/333/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5939512,12458766\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/333/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   No. It appears that the broad arbitration clause here is the product of mutual negotiation among independent equals, each represented by skilled counsel.

The arbitrators: (a) may not add to, amend or disregard this Agreement in whole or in any part; (b) will allow such discovery as is appropriate to the purposes of arbitration in accomplishing fair, speedy and cost effective resolution of disputes; (c) will reference the rules of evidence of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure then in effect in setting the scope and direction of such discovery; and (d) will not be required to make findings of fact or render opinions of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   MCSA 13.

Specifically, the Agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   If the provisions of this [Confidentiality] article are breached, or are threatened to be breached, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to seeking any relief otherwise available at law or under the terms of this Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   MCSA 7.

Since the federal courts are supported by the public, the incidental costs of actual hearings are less expensive to the litigants than a comparable hearing before arbitrators (where the parties bear all the incidental costs). Federal court discovery, on the other hand, is especially expensive. Here, of course, the agreement contemplates the arbitrators authorizing discovery. MCSA 13.

As regards this case, the facts are these:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The litigation costs will be roughly equivalent, though the start-up costs of arbitration are greater. So long as one party wants speed, the Massachusetts federal courts are markedly faster, 5-8 months start to finish. In arbitration, CellInfo and American Tower can cloak themselves\n   in secrecy; in federal court they cannot. At the conclusion of arbitration, the parties will receive an award but no explanation and will have virtually no appellate rights. At the end of a federal trial the parties will get a thorough written decision and award. Each will have full rights to appeal to one of the finest appellate courts in America.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Which course is better?

Arbitration is secret, shielding companies' wrongdoing from public view. There's no right to appeal. Forced-arbitration provisions usually bar class actions, making it more daunting and difficult to sue an employer. And workers can't realistically opt out; they're typically presented with a take-it-or-leave-it contract to sign if they want to put food on the table.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    There's also a rather one-sided right to injunctive relief under the Agreement's general provisions which provides in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    The Parties hereto acknowledge that the services to be rendered by Consultant under this Agreement and the rights and privileges granted to AMT under the Agreement are of a special, unique, unusual, and extraordinary character which gives them a peculiar value, the loss of which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated by damages in any action at law, and the breach by Consultant of any of the provisions of this Agreement will cause AMT irreparable injury and damage.
