(Doc. 730). Defendants seek to introduce evidence of prior and subsequent prostitution-related acts by the government's victim witnesses as an exception under FRE 412. The government opposes the motion arguing that defendants should be barred from offering any evidence at trial regarding alleged sexual activities of its sex trafficking victim witnesses except with respect to the defendants' cross examination of these witnesses about their prostitution activities for defendants and other members of the Black P-Stones. The government contends that the other acts of prostitution by its witnesses not related to the charges in this case are precluded under FRE 412 as \"prior or subsequent\" or \"other\" sexual behavior. For the reasons set forth below, the court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   defendants' motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The TSI also alleges that the defendants conspired to violate \u00a7 1591 and maintained\n   four victim-witnesses by force to engage in commercial sex acts.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants contend that they should be permitted to offer evidence of prior and subsequent prostitution-related acts by the government's four victim-witnesses, identified as M.F., S.P., M.M., and K.E., as part of their rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to offer a complete defense in their trial and to cross-exam and impeach witnesses. They argue that such evidence is admissible as an exception under FRE 412(b)(1)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants state that the information they received from the government during discovery indicated that M.F., S.P., M.M., and K.E. engaged in commercial sex acts before, during and after their alleged involvement with defendants. They also state that the discovery material indicated that three of the witnesses were recruited by the forth witness, S.P., to perform commercial sex acts for her as their madam. As such, defendants contend that they should be allowed to introduce this evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the outset, the government does not challenge the defendants' ability to cross-examine its four victim witnesses about their acts of prostitution for defendants and other members of the Black P-Stones during the conspiracy alleged in the TSI. The government does however oppose defendants' request to introduce evidence and to cross-exam its victim witnesses regarding\n   prostitution acts that they allegedly engaged in before and after the conspiracy charged in the TSI. Thus, the issue is whether a violation of the defendants' constitutional rights to a complete defense and to cross-examine witnesses will occur if defendants are not allowed to introduce such testimony and evidence against the government's four victim witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants' rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are not unlimited. Nor is the right to cross-examine witnesses unlimited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United States v.

Threats of force or coercion is defined for purposes of \u00a7 1591(a) to include \" 'threats of serious harm to or physical restraint against any person,' and 'any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person.' \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=612%20Fed.%20Appx.%2077\">\n    Id. at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants argue that the alleged prior and subsequent commercial sex acts of the four witnesses are relevant to show that their prostitution-related acts were consensual and not forced by defendants and, that they were not compelled to engage in prostitution to avoid \"serious harm.\" They also state that the stated evidence shows the women freely consented to engage in prostitution and that no threats or coercion was required based on the witnesses' prior and later performance of commercial sex acts. Further defendants state that the evidence will show S.P. recruited the other three women to work as prostitutes for her and, that she advertised their services on the internet and other media. Defendants state that this evidence will show S.P. was not a victim and that the other women did not have to be forced by them to work as prostitutes, which is an element of the \u00a7 1591(a) charge. In particular, defendants state that the evidence of the alleged prior and subsequent prostitution activities of the four women shows that they engaged in prostitution for the financial gain and not because defendants forced and coerced them to do so. Defendants also point out that M.M. had previously worked as a prostitute with a pimp named \"Young\" or \"Forty\" and that is how they met her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The government relies, in part, on\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=666%20Fed.%20Appx.%20186\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the defendant \"contend[ed] that the District Court's exclusion of evidence concerning [the victim witness'] prior years of prostitution in\n   accordance with Fed.R.Evid. 412 deprived him of the right to present a defense under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=666%20Fed.%20Appx.%20186\">\n    666 Fed.Appx. at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In Williams,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=666%20Fed.%20Appx.%20186\">\n    id. at 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Third Circuit stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Other courts of appeals in precedential opinions have upheld the exclusion of evidence of an individual's prior acts of prostitution in trials for commercial sex trafficking notwithstanding defendants' arguments similar to those that Williams advances here.

The probative value of such evidence\n   in this case is also outweighed by the prejudicial effect of it and the harm to the victim-witnesses. Although defendants argue that this evidence relates directly to their defense to the sex trafficking charge under \u00a7 1591(a), the court finds that they can still cross-exam the women as well as all of the government's witnesses and present other evidence, including the witnesses's acts of prostitution during the conspiracy charged in the TSI. Defendants will also be able to cross-examine the women regarding whether they were forced or coerced to engage in commercial sex acts during the conspiracy. However, defendants will not be allowed to present any evidence and testimony regarding prostitution acts that the women allegedly engaged in prior to and subsequent to the conspiracy charged in the TSI. These alleged commercial sex acts by the witnesses outside of the scope of the indictment are not directly related to defendants and the charges against them. To allow such evidence and testimony, including the witnesses' prior and subsequent arrests and convictions related to prostitution referenced in defendants' brief, would result in a mini-trial placing the four victim witnesses on trial for their alleged stated acts related to prostitution shifting the focus of the case from the defendants to the witnesses themselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Untied States v.
