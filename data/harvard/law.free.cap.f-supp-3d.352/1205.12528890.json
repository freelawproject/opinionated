DALTON JR., United States District Judge\n   In this Title IX case, Defendant Rollins College (\"\n   <strong>\n    Rollins\n   </strong>\n   \") moves to dismiss Plaintiff John Doe's Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Doc. 17 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n   \").) Plaintiff responded. (Doc. 25.) On review, the Motion is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case involves an accusation of sexual assault brought against Plaintiff, a former Rollins student, by Jane Roe, another Rollins student.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 10-14.) Months later, the accusation led to a Title IX investigation into Plaintiff headed by Rollins Title IX coordinator Oriana Jimenez (\"\n   <strong>\n    Jimenez\n   </strong>\n   \") and conducted by a retained investigator D.B. Wallace (\"\n   <strong>\n    Wallace\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-20.) The investigation consisted of a series of interviews with Jane Roe and Plaintiff, plus twenty-two witnesses, none of whom had firsthand knowledge of the incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-45.) These witnesses told conflicting accounts, but the investigation at least revealed information and allegations that both Plaintiff and Jane Roe were victims of violations of Rollins' Title IX Sexual Misconduct Policy-not just Jane Roe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-45, 48.) Yet the investigative report penned by Wallace did not tell the whole story. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-58.) Instead, it included a number of irrelevant, inflammatory, and conclusory statements about Plaintiff-crediting the testimony of Roe's witnesses over Plaintiff's while making untoward editorial comments about Plaintiff's prior sexual history. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-58.) Further, even though the report acknowledged conflicting testimony and no additional eyewitnesses, Wallace provided a credibility assessment of both actors-Jane Roe was credible but Plaintiff was not. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following the publication of the report, Plaintiff received a 27-page letter from Jimenez. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.) Based on the report, which the letter essentially re-printed, Jimenez told Plaintiff that he had been found responsible for violating Rollins Sexual Misconduct Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) So Plaintiff received these sanctions: (1) a no contact order prohibiting contact with Jane Roe; (2) permanent separation from Rollins without the opportunity for readmission, noted on Plaintiff's transcript; and (3) prohibition from participation in commencement/graduation and any alumni events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff submitted an appeal, which Rollins denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From all this, Plaintiff contends that he has been denied the benefits of an education at his chosen school, his academic and professional reputations have been damaged, and his ability to enroll at institutions of higher learning and pursue a career may be affected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) Plus, he has suffered significant economic and emotional damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Thus, Plaintiff instituted this action against Rollins and now brings two claims under Title IX and one claim for breach of contract based on Rollins handling of Jane Roe's complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-103.) Rollins moves to dismiss, claiming that the Amended Complaint fails to state a plausible claim, includes immaterial and irrelevant allegations, and constitutes a shotgun pleading. (Doc. 17.) With Plaintiff's Response (Doc. 25), the matter is ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 67-72.) Such \"criticism\" took the form of adverse news coverage, campus meetings or protests, and enforcement actions concerning Rollins. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) For example, the Amended Complaint points to\n   a USA Today article that quoted a Rollins student describing a \"Slut Walk\" staged by female students in 2013-14 to protest people justifying rape based on dress, appearance, or intoxication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68c.

In 2015, Rollins' Director of Public Safety published an article in the Orlando Sentinel speaking to some issues, from the school's perspective, with abiding by federal and state requirements for sexual assault allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68d. (citation not found).) And in September 2017, the student newspaper published a piece critiquing the Department of Education's recent changes to Title IX guidance that, from the author's perspective, would likely lead to increased underreporting of campus sexual assaults and deplete victims' rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68e.

Rollins College\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 6:16-cv-2232-Orl-37-KRS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203088102\">\n    2017 WL 3088102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Fla.

One article highlighted how Rollins failed to provide accused students with a hearing or cross-examination tools and that subsequent litigation \"has not done much to move the needle back towards a fairer process for students accused of sexual misconduct and other serious wrongdoing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79a. (citing Samantha Harris,\n   <em>\n    Accused Student Says He Was Told to \"Stay Quiet\" About His Own Lack of Consent\n   </em>\n   , Reason (July 29, 2017), https://reason.com/archives/2017/07/29/accused-student-says-he-was-told-to-stay).) Another listed\n   <em>\n    Mancini's\n   </em>\n   allegations of how Rollins displayed gender bias with a response from a Rollins spokesperson denying such unfairness or mistreatment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70b. (citing Gabrielle Russon,\n   <em>\n    Rollins Student Sues School After Suspension in Sex Assault Case\n   </em>\n   , Orlando Sentinel (Dec. 29, 2016), https://www.orlandosentinel.com/features/education/os-rollins-lawsuit-sexual-assault-20161229-story.html).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Altogether, these articles display a Rollins-specific concern with campus attitudes towards sexual assault, specifically victims being taken seriously, and administrative concern that mandated procedures weren't doing enough. Plaintiff contends that Rollins reacted to this criticism by favoring \"the accusing female over the accused male,\" and this \"biased stance\" was evident in Rollins' handling of Jane Roe's complaint. (Doc. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 72-74.) Because of this gender bias, Plaintiff asserts that Rollins' process of investigating and disciplining Plaintiff was flawed from the beginning, as the entire procedure slanted toward believing Jane Roe rather than uncovering the truth. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At this stage, the Court finds that Plaintiff has met his burden to plead gender bias. Rollins investigated Plaintiff's claims amidst a clamor of public and campus scrutiny over its treatment of sexual assault complaints by female students. Alone, allegations of external pressure fail to support an inference of gender discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Baum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518564\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/575/#p586\">\n    903 F.3d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 586 (6th Cir. 2018). Yet Plaintiff has also pointed to the negative attention Rollins received after\n   <em>\n    Mancini\n   </em>\n   that caused it to buckle down in support of its policies, along with circumstantial evidence of bias in Plaintiff's specific proceeding. (Doc. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 70-73.) For example, the investigative report credited the testimony of witnesses who were friends or sorority sisters of Jane Roe while rejecting testimony from friends or fraternity brothers of Plaintiff's-based, in part, on the male witnesses' fraternity associations without making the same leap about the female witnesses' sorority associations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) The report also excused any inconsistencies in Jane Roe's account concerning whether she verbalized consent but entirely disregarded Plaintiff's assessment of consent on account of Plaintiff's prior sexual history, which Plaintiff contends should not have been considered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Thus, taking Plaintiff's allegations of external pressure from increased public scrutiny with the\n   <em>\n    Mancini\n   </em>\n   litigation and the particular circumstances of Plaintiff, the Court finds Plaintiff's claim plausible. At this pleading stage, the Court construes all allegations in Plaintiff's favor, and Plaintiff's claim that Rollins acted out of gender bias is plausible. Discovery may reveal differently, but Plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded circumstantial evidence of gender discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518564\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/575/#p586\">\n    903 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   586-87 ;\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Ohio Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"207806\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/76/634/#p641\">\n    76 F. App'x 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641 (6th Cir. 2003) (\"To support a selective enforcement claim,\" the male plaintiff must allege \"that a female was in circumstances sufficiently similar to his own and was treated more favorably by the University\"). To that end, Plaintiff points to Rollins' treatment of Jane Roe-she was a female student \"in circumstances sufficiently similar to John Doe's and was treated more favorably by Rollins.\" (Doc. 14, \u00b6 82a.) Specifically, \"Rollins received credible information that ... John Doe engaged in sexual activity with Jane Roe while John Doe was intoxicated,\" and \"that John Doe was the victim of retaliation during the pendency of the investigation,\" but Rollins \"did not encourage [him] to file a complaint, consider the information, or otherwise investigate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81a.-81b.) Further, on adjudicating Plaintiff guilty of violating the Sexual Misconduct Policy, Plaintiff contends that Rollins chose the severest form of penalties \"due to [Plaintiff's] gender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82a.-82b.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the motion to dismiss stage, the Court finds that Plaintiff's allegations plausibly make out a selective enforcement claim against Rollins. As Plaintiff alleges, the information Rollins collected during the investigation could have equally supported disciplinary proceedings against Jane Roe for also violating the Sexual Misconduct Policy. (Doc. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 81-82.) Yet Rollins treated Jane Roe-a female student-differently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Preferentially even, as Plaintiff alleges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.) Such allegations sufficiently support a selective enforcement claim against Rollins.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Amherst Coll.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267790\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/238/195/#p223\">\n    238 F.Supp.3d 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223 (D.

Thus, the Motion is denied for this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of Contract Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Last, the Court evaluates Plaintiff's breach of contract claim. (Doc. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 88-103.) Plaintiff contends that his enrollment at Rollins, payment of tuition and fees, and attendance gave rise to a relationship, contractual in nature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) The terms of this contract were set forth in the student handbook and Rollins' policies and procedures, which incorporate the Sexual Misconduct Policy and accompanying Bill of Rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docs. 1-2, 1-3.) Plaintiff thus points to various provisions of the Sexual Misconduct Policy that Rollins allegedly violated in its handling and adjudication of Jane Roe's complaint (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 14, \u00b6 99), including the guarantee of an outcome based on information that is \"credible, relevant, based in fact, and without prejudice,\" without regard to any \"irrelevant prior sexual history\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99d.-99e.). Plaintiff also alleges that Rollins breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to provide him \"with an investigatory and adjudicatory process that was 'essentially fair.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100.) Specifically, Rollins used a biased investigator who assessed Jane Roe's account as credible over Plaintiff's, failed to provide Plaintiff the opportunity to cross-examine or otherwise question Jane Roe, reached the outcome without sufficient evidence, and conducted its investigation and adjudicatory process without complying with federal law and the Clery Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101a.-101d.;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102a.-102c.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   These allegations give rise to a plausible breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Lynn Univ., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268467\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/1336/#p1342\">\n    235 F.Supp.3d 1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1342-43 (S.D. Fla. 2017) (denying motion to dismiss breach of contract and good faith and fair dealing claims based on defendant's deviation from procedures set out in defendant's published policies). Plaintiff has identified specific provisions of the Sexual Misconduct Policy that Rollins purportedly breached and facts alleging how the breach occurred. (Doc. 14, \u00b6\u00b6 99-103.) At the motion to dismiss stage, such suffices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amherst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267790\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/238/195/#p223\">\n    238 F.Supp.3d at 215-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
