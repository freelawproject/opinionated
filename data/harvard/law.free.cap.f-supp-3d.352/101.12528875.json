Plaintiff has filed a Motion for Order Reversing the Decision of the Commissioner (Docket No. 18), and the Commissioner has filed a cross Motion to Affirm the Commissioner's Decision. (Docket No. 20). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's motion (Docket No. 18) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and Defendant's motion (Docket No. 20) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      denied\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Plaintiff claimed she was unable to work since March 4, 2014. (AR 211, 218). Both applications were denied. (AR 129-134, 139-144). A hearing was subsequently held before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") on July 28, 2015. (AR 48-74). On August 31, 2015, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled. (AR 26-42). On October 18, 2016, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review (AR 4-9), thus making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. Plaintiff has exhausted her administrative remedies, and this case is therefore now ripe for review under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) and 1383(c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    2. Medical History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 9, 2014, Dr. Cruz wrote that Plaintiff was \"diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Due to increased stress exacerbation of her depression/anxiety, we recommend that patient changes her job title/job position.\" (AR 426). Plaintiff's depression and anxiety were caused by several factors including a traumatic childhood in a warzone and being sexually abused in her early twenties. (AR 640; 565).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 16, 2014, Plaintiff was admitted to the neurological department at UMass Memorial Medical Center for numbness on her left side and the possibility of a seizure. (AR 408). The attending physician found Plaintiff alert and oriented to three spheres, she seemed anxious but not agitated, her fluency and comprehension were normal, there was no pronator drift, and she had a mild slightly high amplitude tremor in her bilateral upper extremities. (AR 411). Further, Plaintiff's strength was observed as five out of five, she had decreased sensation in her face and left upper extremity, her Romberg test was negative, and her cerebellar function and gait were normal. (AR 411). While she was hospitalized, Plaintiff had an EEG\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   which was normal and a CT scan of her head which revealed numerous scattered calcifications throughout both cerebral hemispheres that could represent sequalae of prior granulomatous disease. (AR 414). On January 18, Plaintiff was discharged with a prescription for an increased dose of Tegretol. (AR 408).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 27, 2014, following her hospitalization, Dr. Jennifer Moodie wrote, \"no driving for 6 months. Activity as tolerated, no heavy weight lifting, no pushing or pulling of heavyweights, no strenuous activity, do not lock bathroom doors from inside when alone at home. Diet should be containing less than 2 g of sodium per day.\" (AR 472).\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    On March 11, 2014, Dr. Cruz wrote that Plaintiff \"has symptoms of depression and anxiety due to her work.\" (AR 425). On March 27, 2014, Courtney Petter, LMHC, completed a Psychiatric Disorder Form. (AR 485-487). Ms. Petter concluded that Plaintiff's Global Assessment of Functioning (\"GAF\") score was 56,\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    she was oriented to three spheres, and there were no concentration and attention deficits (AR 485). Further, Ms. Petter diagnosed Plaintiff with major depressive disorder.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    On March 28, 2014, Dr. Cruz saw Plaintiff, who complained that she was continuing to have memory problems. He noted she was \"working in housekeeping\" though recently, she slipped and fell on her right side. (AR 491). Dr. Cruz also recommended that Plaintiff speak with a neurologist about her memory loss and headaches. (AR 492). Dr. Cruz opined that Plaintiff's \"memory loss can be due to her depression/anxiety. This can also be due to the Topamax medication. However, we cannot stop this medication because of his or her seizure.\" (AR 494).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    During the summer of 2014, Plaintiff began treating with Margot Pagan, MA. In her initial assessment, Ms. Pagan assigned Plaintiff a GAF score of 56 and noted Plaintiff suffered from anxiety and depression. (AR 532-42). Plaintiff continued treating with Ms. Pagan through July 2015. During that time, Ms. Pagan Ms. Pagan noted Plaintiff was \"extremely challenged by symptoms of depression\" (AR 805) and found no significant changes in Plaintiff's mood/affect, thought process/orientation, behavior/functioning, or medical conditions. (AR 790-827, 848-860).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    On July 28, 2014, Plaintiff again presented to UMass Memorial Medical Center. Dr. Butler noted that Plaintiff had a few beers the night before and then had intentionally taken more than 10 Baclofen in a suicide attempt. (AR 576). Her suicide risk assessment tools noted severe depression, preoccupation with hopelessness, despair, feelings of worthlessness, and continued suicidal thoughts.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    On assessment, Plaintiff was anxious, crying, and depressed.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In addition, Dr. Butler found Plaintiff to be a low suicide risk. (AR 570). The same day, Plaintiff was seen by Michael Lebeaux, a therapist affiliated with Community Health Link, and he assigned her a GAF score of 50.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    (AR 645).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    On August 5, 2014, Plaintiff treated with Ronald Gobeil, DO. (AR 564). Plaintiff reported being depressed and anxious. Dr. Gobeil reported that Plaintiff was dysphoric over her job situation and hesitant to find a new job, maybe because she feared\n    a similar situation as her last job where she had problems with a co-worker. (AR 564). Two days later, Plaintiff again treated with Dr. Cruz. Plaintiff informed Dr. Cruz about her suicide attempt and Dr. Cruz noted that she presented with depression. (AR 549).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    On October 21, 2014, Plaintiff was treated at the neurology clinic and reported that she had a seizure the previous weekend. Plaintiff reported \"deep depression\" and that Topamax was worsening he memory problems. On examination, Drs. Chu and Ramirez found that Plaintiff denied suicidal ideation, she was alert and oriented to three spheres, her upper extremity strength was rated as five out of five, her lower extremity strength was four plus out of five, and her sensation, gait, cerebellar function, and coordination were normal. (AR 565, 567). Further, Dr. Chu concluded that Plaintiff's seizures were uncontrolled and therefore ordered an extended EEG and increased her dosage of carbamazine. (AR 568). On October 26, 2014, Plaintiff was again treated at the UMass Memorial Medical Center and reported that she had a seizure. The EMT reported, however, that it appeared that she had a panic attack. (AR 785).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    On June 3, 2015, John Fleming, LMHC, RN, noted that Plaintiff reported experiencing increased stress, resulting in increased anxiety and depression (AR 649). Nurse Fleming then found Plaintiff was oriented to four spheres, she was not experiencing any delusions or hallucinations, her though process was linear, she was easily engaged with a tearful affect at times, and she had passive suicidal ideation with no intent. (AR 651). Further, Nurse Fleming assigned Plaintiff a GAF score of 55. (AR 657).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Plaintiff continued to receive treatment from Island Counseling Center through July 2015. (AR 680-691). During that period, Dr. Gobeil noted that Plaintiff was anxious, depressed, and dysphoric.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    From June 11, 2015 to July 17, 2015, Plaintiff participated in an outpatient day program. (AR 692-717). Notes from the program reflect Plaintiff being observed as \"upset\" and \"really depressed.\" (AR 690; 694). Dr. Nesr, a psychiatrist, diagnosed Plaintiff with PTSD, depression, and anxiety. (AR 706). In addition, she was assigned a GAF score of 45. (AR 710).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    On June 16, 2015, Plaintiff presented to the ER for facial numbness. (AR 740). It was noted that due to her ongoing seizures, \"all seizure precautions apply for 6 months from the date of the last seizure.\" (AR 741). The same day, Plaintiff had a CT scan of her head that revealed no acute abnormalities and was unchanged from the prior scan in January 2014. (AR 747). The next day, Plaintiff treated with Dr. Gobeil. She appeared anxious and depressed. (AR 62). On June 30, 2015, Plaintiff reported intense anxiety to Ms. Pagan. On July 22, 2015, Plaintiff reported to Ms. Pagan that she was feeling better after a three-day hospitalization. (AR 858).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    On July 14, 2015, Plaintiff again presented to UMass memorial Medical Center complaining of suicidal thoughts, stating that she did not want to live and wanted to take pills. (AR 762). On examination, the attending provider found Plaintiff alert and oriented to three spheres, her affect was anxious, she was crying, and her speech was normal. (AR 763, 767). The same day, Ms. Pagan submitted a Mental Medical Source Statement. (AR 661-666). Ms. Pagan noted that she had been treating Plaintiff biweekly since June 20, 2014 and wrote that Plaintiff had \"severe symptoms of depression according to a major depression inventory (7/14/15) severe symptoms of anxiety according to the Hamilton [A]nxiety [S]cale.\" Further, Ms. Pagan noted Plaintiff's \"severe difficulties\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    recovering and need for long-term continued care to overcome her symptomology. (AR 661). According to Dr. Pagan, Plaintiff would be unable to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions form her symptom's accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism, respond properly to changes in routine work setting, deal with normal work stress, be aware of normal hazards, and take appropriate precautions. She found Plaintiff would be off task 25% of the day and absent six days or more a month due to her mental health symptoms. (AR 666).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Similarly, on July 16, 2015, Dr. Gobeil completed a Mental Medical Source Statement. He concluded that Plaintiff would be unable to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from her symptoms, accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism, respond properly to changes in routine work setting, deal with normal work stress, and be aware of normal hazards and take appropriate precautions. According to Dr. Gobeil, Plaintiff \"would be off task 33% of the day and absent six days or more a month due to her mental health symptoms.\" (AR 666).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    On July 22, 2015, Dr. Cruz again concluded that Plaintiff was disabled because \"she gets anxious at work. She has no energy to do things due to depression.\" (AR 720). In his opinion, Plaintiff would be absent from work more than three days per month and off task more than 30% of the day if she returned to work.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Therefore, he concluded \"within a reasonable degree of medical certainty\" that Plaintiff was \"unable to obtain and retain work in a competitive work environment, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20405\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    <em>\n     3. Hearing Testimony\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    On July 28, 2015, Plaintiff testified at a hearing before the ALJ. She testified that she did not feel like she had improved since March of 2015 and that she continued to treat at a mental health facility Monday to Friday 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (AR 54). Further, she said that she left her previous job because of stress and worsening depression. (AR 55). Plaintiff told the ALJ that she cries frequently, struggles with concentration, and has panic attacks approximately three times per week. (AR 56; 62). Finally, Plaintiff testified that she tried to work as a housekeeper but she \"was very, very slow and ... got a complaint from [her] supervisor, and ... somedays [she] was okay, and other days [she] was very anxious, and depressed and crying and ... couldn't do the job.\" (AR 62).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Standard of Review\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    This Court may not disturb the Commissioner's decision if it is grounded in substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. 405(g) ; 1383(c)(3).

[his] view.\") (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Plaintiff argues that the ALJ substituted his lay knowledge for uncontroverted medical evidence to formulate Plaintiff's RFC. The ALJ concluded that Plaintiff \"has the residual functional capacity to perform the full range of light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b), however she could not be exposed to hazardous equipment or unprotected heights, and could remember and carry out no more than simple instructions, and could have no more than occasional contact with others.\" (AR 40). Defendant argues that in formulating this RFC, the ALJ relied on the opinions of Dr. Bahnassi, Dr. Nesr, and Courtney Petter, LMHC, all of which he gave moderate weight. (AR 38-39).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <em>\n     a. Dr. Bahnassi\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    On March 12, 2013, Dr. Bahnassi found that Plaintiff was alert and oriented to three spheres, there was no evidence of overt psychosis, her memory and cogntivie functioning were at baseline, her thought process was goal-oriented, her speech was normal, and she had no looseness of associations or flights of ideas. (AR 379). Two months later, Dr. Bahnassi observed that Plaintiff was again oriented to three spheres, her affect was appropriate, her speech was normal, her memory and cognitive functioning were at baseline, her insight and judgment were fair, and there was no evidence of overt psychosis or suicidal ideation. (AR 378). Thereafter, however, it does not appear that Plaintiff continued treating with Dr. Bahnassi. Since Plaintiff alleged disability beginning on March 14, 2014, Dr. Bahnassi's records are simply not probative of a disability beginning almost one year later. Therefore, Dr. Bahnassi's findings do not support the ALJ's RFC determinations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <em>\n     b. Dr. Nesr\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Although Dr. Nesr assigned Plaintiff a GAF of 45, the ALJ concluded that Dr. Nesr did not feel Plaintiff's symptoms were work preclusive. (AR 37).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Querido v.

Mass. 2004) (concluding that a raw GAF score, \"without more, does not give a fact\n    finder significant insight into whether [Plaintiff] can perform some type of competitive work\" since a score of 41-50 indicates \"serious symptoms ... OR any serious impairment in social, occupational, or school functioning.\" (citing DSM-IV 34). The ALJ cited Dr. Nesr's findings that Plaintiff's memory was adequate, her mood was calm, and her manner cooperative as evidence that Dr. Nesr did not believe that Plaintiff's condition precluded employment. (AR 707; 37). This conclusion, however, is quite the inferential leap. Indeed, on the same page in the record, Dr. Nesr noted that Plaintiff was overwhelmed, depressed, and entertained thoughts of self-harm.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142073\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/344/236/#p246\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate from Dr. Nesr's findings that Plaintiff had the RFC to engage in meaningful employment especially when his description of Plaintiff's symptoms is considered in conjunction with the GAF assessment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <em>\n     c. LMHC Petter\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The ALJ also gave moderate weight to the opinion of LMHC Petter. Ms. Petter found that Plaintiff was depressed, anxious, and struggled to cope with the traumas she had experienced. (AR 863). Ms. Petter noted that Plaintiff's issues with her male coworker triggered her trauma issues.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9142073\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/344/236/#p246\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In Ms. Petter's opinion, Plaintiff \"was debilitated [by] her extreme depressive and anxious symptoms, as well as the seizures.\" (AR 863). Similar to the evidence from Dr. Nesr, it is difficult to infer an RFC permitting a full range of light work from Ms. Petter's conclusions. The only evidence in Ms. Petter's records that would seem to support the ALJ's finding is that she assigned Plaintiff a GAF score of 56. (AR 485). But \"[t]he GAF is a diagnostic tool developed by an association of medical professionals; it was not intended to be a yardstick for measuring disabilities within the scope of the Social Security Act.\"\n    <em>\n     Resendes v.

The ALJ contended that Dr. Gobeil, however, \"never explained why two years later, he deemed her disabled, and what caused such a radical change in her condition.\" (AR 39). That Plaintiff's condition worsened, does not inherently render Dr. Gobeil's internally inconsistent. Indeed, the inability to pinpoint the trigger of deepening depression and heightened anxiety is an unpersuasive rationale for discounting a treating medical opinion.

(AR 38). However, it is difficult to ascertain what the ALJ found inconsistent. Indeed, on July 16, 2015, Dr. Gobeil noted that Plaintiff was depressed and anxious. (AR 680). This is consistent with the anxiety and depression noted in his Medical Source Statement that he believed compromised her ability to maintain employment. (AR 667-673). Defendant argues that Dr. Gobeil noted the same day that Plaintiff was alert and oriented, her language was normal, she was not experiencing suicidal ideation, delusions, or hallucinations, her thought process was within normal limits, and she had no side effects from her medications.

(AR 663-664). In addition, Ms. Pagan found Plaintiff unable to meet competitive standards in completing a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms, accepting instructions and responding appropriately to criticism from supervisors, responding appropriately to changes in a routine work setting, dealing with normal work stress, and being aware of normal hazards and taking appropriate precautions.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20374188\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    It is unclear how these functional limitations are \"internally and materially inconsistent\" with a finding of disability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The ALJ additionally found that the GAF score assigned by Ms. Pagan to Plaintiff was inconsistent with a finding of disability. On July 22, 2014, Ms. Pagan assigned Plaintiff with a GAF score of 56. (AR 541). This score indicates moderate symptoms or moderate difficulty in social, occupational or school functioning.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DSM-IV 34.

For example, he observed at Exhibit 21F that the claimant was\n    <em>\n     likely\n    </em>\n    to suffer a variety of side effects from medication, though he did not say she actually did suffer from any of them.\" (AR 39) (emphasis in original).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    As Dr. Cruz is a treating physician, the ALJ's rationale for discounting his opinion must be persuasive.\n    <em>\n     Santana\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207428223\">\n     2016 WL 7428223\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3. The ALJ argues that Dr. Cruz's opinions are flawed because he does not say if Plaintiff suffered side effects. The ALJ is apparently impugning Dr. Cruz's credibility because he answered the questions asked by the Medical Source Statement. The questionnaire only asks if there is \"a reasonable medical probability that [Plaintiff] will experience side effects from the medication(s)?\" (AR 719). Dr. Cruz found concluded that there was.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207428223\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Further, even if Dr. Cruz failed to properly support these observations, his disability determination was not grounded only on the likelihood of side-effects from Plaintiff's medications.

While he believed that side-effects would \"frequently\" interfere with Plaintiff's attention and concentration, he noted that Plaintiff's stress would \"constantly\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    interfere.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207428223\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Further, Dr. Cruz notes that \"she gets\n    <em>\n     anxious\n    </em>\n    at work. She has no energy to do things due to\n    <em>\n     depression\n    </em>\n    .\" (AR 720) (emphasis added). Neither Plaintiff's anxiety nor her depression are side-effects of her medications.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    At most, it was reasonable for the ALJ to dismiss Dr. Cruz's conclusions with respect to limitations resulting from Plaintiff's medications. However, this does not create internal inconsistencies in Dr. Cruz's findings as none of his conclusions imply that Plaintiff is not disabled. Moreover, the ALJ does not point to any specific parts of the record he finds inconsistent with Dr. Cruz's determinations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Arruda\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241735\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/314/52/#p72\">\n     314 F.Supp.2d at 72\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (concluding that internal inconsistencies or contradictions with the larger record are acceptable reasons to downplay a treating physician's opinion).

Credibility Assessment\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Finally, Plaintiff argues that the ALJ's credibility assessment was not sufficient. In determining whether a claimant is disabled, the ALJ must consider statements or reports from the claimant regarding their symptoms and functional limitations.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1529\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) ; 416.929(a). However, a claimant's subjective description of symptoms alone cannot establish disability; the ALJ must also consider any other available evidence, including objective medical evidence, to determine whether the claimant's testimony is consistent with the remainder of the record.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1529\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), (c) ; 416.929(a), (c).\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Grady v.

First, the ALJ's assessment of Plaintiff's credibility with respect to her mental impairments fails simply because it misrepresents the record. On December 15, 2013, LMHC Petter noted that Plaintiff experienced anxiety because of experiences with a specific male coworker. (AR 427).\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    While this observation was before the onset of Plaintiff's alleged disability, on August 15, 2015, LMHC Petter again noted the problems Plaintiff had with the\n    coworker. (AR 863). But concluding that Plaintiff's symptoms are debilitating only in the presence of external exacerbation is belied by a complete reading of LMHC Petter's findings. LMHC Petter recounted Plaintiff's past traumas only to explain her psychological condition. For instance, LMHC Petter noted that Plaintiff grew up in Nicaragua during the civil war and \"lived in chaos.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232326\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/113/181/#p187\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    She fears her father \"since his temper was erratic.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232326\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/113/181/#p187\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    She felt \"unsafe in her home as a child\" because \"[h]er house had an open section of roof, and at night people would sneak in and walk around.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232326\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/113/181/#p187\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \"She felt unsupported emotionally\" by her husband.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232326\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/113/181/#p187\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Finally, she worked with someone \"who tried to intimidate her, and triggered her trauma issues.

That certain triggers exacerbate Plaintiff's symptoms is an unremarkable proposition. This does not mean, however, that she can calmly and happily work in a building until the roof is removed. Moreover, the record contains opinions that the ALJ improperly disregarded stating that her psychological conditions preclude employment without reference to any triggering conditions.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lappen v.

Contrary to Defendant's contentions, the ALJ seems to suggest that Plaintiff's testimony is presumptively untrue insofar as it contradicts the ALJ's RFC assessment. The ALJ implies that the Plaintiff has the burden of presenting objective evidence to overcome this presumption but \"the absence of objective medical evidence supporting an individual's\n    statements about the intensity and persistence of pain or other symptoms is only one factor that the adjudicator must consider in assessing an individuals' credibility and must be considered in the context of all the evidence.\" SSR 96-7p,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20374186\">\n     1996 WL 374186\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Conclusion\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    For the reasons stated above, I conclude that the ALJ improperly relied on his lay opinion in crafting Plaintiff's RFC.
