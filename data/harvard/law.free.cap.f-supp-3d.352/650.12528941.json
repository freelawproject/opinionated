Doc. 50)\n   </strong>\n   filed by Defendants, Iberville Bank, through its successor The First, A National Banking Association, and The First Bancshares, Inc. The Parties have briefed the former (Rec. Doc. 37) extensively; both Parties have been given leave to file supplemental memoranda. The motion for partial judgment (Rec. Doc. 50) is limited to causation of certain damages and is unopposed, so it will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Having considered the Motion and legal memoranda, the record, and the applicable law, the Court finds that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Rec. Doc. 37) should be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case involves the termination of a bank's regulatory compliance officer, allegedly motivated in part by a desire to retaliate against the officer for whistleblowing on a fraud committed by an employee at the bank. The bank, Iberville Bank, is now defunct; its successor is The First, A National Banking Association. From 1931 until 2017, Iberville bank was owned by A. Wilbert's Sons Lumber and Shingle Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Lumber and Shingle\"). (Rec. Doc. 44 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning around 2008, Iberville Bank began experiencing safety and soundness issues. According to the CEO and chairman of Lumber and Shingle, Klein Kirby, the bank owners did not receive a dividend from 2009 to 2011. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 2). On May 20 of 2010-amid these problems-Iberville Bank hired Plaintiff Jessica Kell as the bank's Compliance Officer and Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\") Compliance Officer (Rec. Doc. 44 at 3). As BSA Compliance Officer, Plaintiff was responsible for the\n   supervision and administration of the bank's compliance with anti-money laundering laws, including the BSA. Among other things, the BSA requires financial institutions to report suspicious activities that might signify criminal conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205311\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 5330. Federal regulations clarify that banks are required to submit a suspicious activity report (\"SAR\") to the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\"FinCEN\") if the bank detects insider abuse involving any amount within 30 days of discovering the conduct.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20353.3\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The record indicates, and Defendants do not dispute, that between 2010 and 2014 Plaintiff received excellent ratings in her performance evaluations. In February of 2014, Plaintiff was promoted to Vice President and she received her first bonus at the end of 2015 for her performance. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 4-5). Robert Smith, the President and CEO of Iberville Bank, testified that \"Jessica Kell is one of the brightest people I know\" and noted that her job performance is \"[a]lways good.\" (Rec. Doc. 44 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 15, 2015, Smith became aware of a loss in the insurance division of the bank-Iberville Insurance Agency, a wholly-owned subsidiary. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 5). The manager of the division, Robert Martin, was covering up that premiums on a policy insuring buses were uncollectible. The auditors who had discovered the loss found that receivables were being booked as negative payables. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 5). In total the bank lost $764,362.87. Plaintiff argues Martin was an insider of Iberville Bank. Thus, under the BSA, Iberville Bank was required to file an SAR within 30 days of discovering the loss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20353.3\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   However, Smith did not inform Plaintiff of the loss until October 19, 2015. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 6). Smith informed the Board of the loss the next day. Plaintiff testified that after the loss she found Smith to be less forthcoming with information and that she began to unexpectedly receive criticism from Smith regarding her performance, a first. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 6). She also testified in her deposition that Smith told her not to file a SAR with local law enforcement, despite a recommendation in the federal regulations that a bank do so in that circumstance. (Rec. Doc. 40-5 at 31-32).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20353.3\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A bank is encouraged to file a copy of the suspicious activity report with state and local law enforcement agencies where appropriate.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 16, 2015, regulators began the FDIC Compliance and Community Reinvestment Act exam. The Safety and Soundness exam began on December 7, 2015. On January 20, 2016, Smith informed Plaintiff that she could no longer work from home and reminded her that she was \"an at-will employee, meaning that the Bank or [Plaintiff] may terminate the employment relationship at any time.\" (Rec. Doc. 40-3 at 56). A week later, the bank rehired Jeannie Guillory with the intention she become the new BSA Officer. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 5). On February 5, 2016, regulators informed in bank in its exit interview for the Safety and Sound exam that the bank was not completing its obligations under the BSA in a satisfactory manner. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 8). A reason for this was that SARs were not being filed timely, which contributed to the evaluator's conclusion that \"[t]he BSA Office is unable to devote sufficient time to BSA-related duties because of other significant duties at the bank.\" (Rec. Doc. 40-5 at 64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 22, 2016, the bank placed Plaintiff on a 90-day probation, purportedly because of the bank's poor performance on the compliance and safety and soundness exams. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 9). That same day, Plaintiff called the FDIC ombudsman\n   by dialing an 800 number. (Rec. Doc. 40-5 at 241-242). Plaintiff recalls that during her 26-minute phone call, she summarized the events described above and said that she believed the bank was attempting a cover-up of some type. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 9). On March 2, after a phone call with a special agent at the FDIC, Plaintiff e-mailed to that agent over 400 pages of documents concerning the loss in the insurance division. (Rec. Doc. 40-5 at 51). Plaintiff had stored these documents on the cloud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 11, 2016, the bank's IT manager, Robin Pitre, discovered that Plaintiff had stored these documents on the cloud. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 10). Plaintiff knew that Pitre would have to report this as a security violation but asked whether Pitre would have to report the names of the files. (Rec. Doc. 40-5 at 24). The names on the files stored in the cloud revealed that they related to the insurance loss. Pitre took screen shots of the names of the documents. When Pitre met with Charlette Williams, Plaintiff's supervisor and Smith the following week, Pitre did not bring screenshots of the file names with her to the meeting. However, she was under the impression Smith was familiar with the screen shots. (Rec. Doc. 40-8 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff discovered that Smith and Williams also had been granted access to her Outlook account. It is unclear whether this access extended beyond the calendar to Plaintiff's e-mail from which Plaintiff had sent the documents to the FDIC. (Rec. Doc. 45-2 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 14, 2016, Smith called Plaintiff to inform her that she was being put on paid leave of absence, so the Bank could investigate her storing the documents on the cloud. During this conversation, Smith allegedly said that he \"had never known the FDIC to circumvent senior management.\" (Rec. Doc. 44 at 10-11). Smith terminated Plaintiff's employment on March 17, 2016, \"because [Plaintiff] breached the Bank's IT policy while on probation as a result of the FDIC's and OFI's criticism of her performance as the bank's BSA officer.\" (Rec. Doc. 37-1 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed suit on February 22, 2017. In her amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Iberville Bank illegally retaliated against her for providing information to the FDIC in violation of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j(a) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205328\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff also claimed Defendant was liable under Louisiana Civil Code article 2315 for outrageous and harassing conduct that caused her undue humiliation, embarrassment, and anxiety. (Rec. Doc. 12). Defendant then filed its Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PARTIES' ARGUMENTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's whistleblower claim is subject to summary judgment because Plaintiff cannot prove that Smith knew of her decision to contact the FDIC regarding the alleged coverup. Defendant alleges that Plaintiff simply has no proof that Smith knew she had contacted the FDIC when the bank terminated her. Second, Defendant argues that only one whistleblower statute can apply, and because 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j does apply,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205328\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   does not. Finally, Defendant argues that ordinary employment disputes do not give rise to a claim for infliction of emotional distress claim, and that Plaintiff cannot prove a pattern of repeated harassment. (Rec. Doc. 37-1 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the record indicates that there are questions of fact as to whether Smith knew of Plaintiff's protected activity at the time of termination. Plaintiff argues that she was placed on leave so that the Bank could investigate her placing the insurance loss documents on the cloud. Furthermore, Plaintiff argues\n   that Smith's comment that he \"had never known the FDIC to circumvent senior management\" at the March 14, 2016 meeting gives rise to the inference that Smith knew why Plaintiff had placed these documents on the cloud. Plaintiff also points to Smith's alleged access to her e-mail as another way Smith knew she was communicating with the FDIC. Plaintiff also points to the temporal proximity of her firing and the protected activity as circumstantial evidence of the bank's motivations for terminating her. Finally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant has failed to demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence that Defendant had a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for firing her. (Rec. Doc. 14-16), Plaintiff also alleges that there are questions of fact as to whether Defendant violated a state whistleblower statute. Finally, Plaintiff argues that the circumstances of this employment dispute are sufficient to support an infliction of emotional distress claim, because Smith knew she was pregnant and that the day after she was put on probation, she miscarried.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In its reply, Defendant argues that the file names do not prove that Smith knew that the files were being provided to a third party and points out that the evidence provided indicates that Smith at most had access to Plaintiff's Outlook calendar, not her e-mails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, in supplemental briefing (Rec. Doc. 60), Plaintiff cites to deposition testimony of Jeannie Guillory-who was re-hired by Iberville Bank to be BSA compliance officer-indicating that Plaintiff had told her before Plaintiff was terminated that she was going to complain to the FDIC. Defendant argues that this evidence does not give rise to a permissible inference that Smith-the ultimate decision maker-knew that Plaintiff had actually gone forward with the complaint. (Rec. Doc. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Iowa 1994) (\"[T]he plaintiff under this whistle-blower statute must establish both temporal proximity\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   actual or constructive knowledge of the defendant of the disclosures at the time of the employment decision to meet the 'contributory factor' test.\"). Although, the preceding phrase, \"such as,\" lends doubt to Defendant's preferred interpretation, the Court assumes arguendo that Plaintiff cannot rely only on temporal proximity evidence alone to prevail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Even so, Plaintiff has made her prima facie case because the temporal proximity\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   other evidence submitted, considered together, give rise to the reasonable inference that Smith knew of Plaintiff's disclosures and that this knowledge contributed to his decision to terminate Plaintiff. First, it is undisputed that Defendant regarded Plaintiff as an excellent employee before late 2015; around the same time that Defendant became aware of the loss in the insurance division- the subject of Plaintiff's protected disclosures. From the time she started till 2014, Plaintiff never received a performance evaluation of less than 8.55 out of 9 available points. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 4-5). Already, this\n   distinguishes this matter from one of the two district court opinions Defendant relies upon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cosgrove v. Fed. Home Loan Bank of New York,\n   </em>\n   No. 90 CIV. 6455 (RPP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20163218\">\n    1999 WL 163218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 1999) (\"Plaintiff's claim that she was an 'exemplary' employee throughout her employment at FHLBNY is belied by the evidence submitted by both parties\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, Defendant does not contest that Plaintiff's disclosures are close in time to Defendant's adverse employment decisions. Plaintiff sent the documents relating to the insurance loss on March 2, 2016. The bank learned that Plaintiff had placed these same documents on the Cloud on March 11. Three days later, Defendant placed Plaintiff on leave and three days after that, on March 17, the bank terminated Plaintiff. The Fifth Circuit has found that two full years elapsing between protected conduct and retaliatory discharge renders a \"theory of retaliation quite doubtful\" but is not dispositive.\n   <em>\n    Chaney v. New Orleans Pub. Facility Mgmt., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844495\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/164/#p169\">\n    179 F.3d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 169 (5th Cir. 1999) (considering alleged unlawful retaliation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3 ) ). In contrast, the close temporal proximity in this case-a matter of weeks-is evidence that Plaintiff's disclosures were a contributing factor in Defendant's personnel decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Third, Plaintiff has submitted other circumstantial evidence that Defendant knew of Plaintiff's disclosures. Defendant's proffered reason for firing Plaintiff is that Plaintiff, while on probation, violated the bank's IT policy by placing documents on the cloud. Storing these documents on an outside, unauthorized server was a security violation, which Plaintiff admits. (Rec. Doc. 37-1). However, Defendant makes no attempt to address the fact that these were the same documents that\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff sent to the FDIC in her whistleblowing e-mail\n   </em>\n   . The names of the documents-visible in screen shots taken by the bank's IT staff member on March 11-clearly convey that they pertain to the insurance loss. (Rec. Doc. 45-2 at 3). Defendant suggests that Smith's knowledge that Plaintiff had stored these documents outside of Defendant's servers is not proof that Smith knew that Plaintiff had sent this information to the FDIC. The Court agrees that it is not\n   <em>\n    conclusive proof\n   </em>\n   , but the fact that the bank's compliance officer had made a move to preserve evidence of wrongdoing at the bank would certainly suggest that Plaintiff was disclosing this same information to the appropriate federal agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff also provides copies of notes she took regarding the March 14, 2016 meeting, when Smith put her on leave of absence to investigate her storing documents on the cloud. (Rec. Doc. 40-5 at 59). The note indicates that Plaintiff recalls Smith stating that \"he's never known the FDIC to circumvent senior management for investigation.\" (Rec. Doc. 40-5 at 59). Again, while inconclusive in and of itself, it is circumstantial evidence that Smith knew Plaintiff' was cooperating with the FDIC when he decided to put her on leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant insists that what is offered above is not enough to withstand summary judgment. Defendant relies on two district court opinions which found that plaintiffs had failed to establish that the defendants knew of protected disclosures. Both are easily distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Rouse v. Farmers State Bank of Jewell, Iowa\n   </em>\n   , the court found that the plaintiff had demonstrated temporal proximity but had failed to demonstrate that the defendant had any knowledge of the protected disclosures.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9283\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/866/1191/#p1209\">\n    866 F.Supp. 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1209 (N.D. Iowa 1994). Quite clearly, the reason Defendant failed this burden was because he could not show that\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   other than himself or the FDIC knew of his disclosures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9283\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/866/1191/#p1209\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9283\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/866/1191/#p1209\">\n    at 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the plaintiff in that case had not\n   told anyone else he was disclosing to the FDIC, the court determined it could only find that the disclosures contributed to the defendant's personnel action if the FDIC had breached its promises of confidentiality. There was simply no evidence that it had.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9283\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/866/1191/#p1209\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Similarly, the other case Defendant relies upon,\n   <em>\n    Cosgrove v. Fed. Home Loan Bank of New York\n   </em>\n   , does not resemble the facts of this case. No. 90 CIV. 6455 (RPP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20163218\">\n    1999 WL 163218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 1999). There, the court began by finding that the plaintiff had been at most a \"satisfactory\" employee and then found the protected disclosures and termination-separated by 16 months-were not temporally proximate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10. The court ended its opinion by finding that the Defendant had proved by clear and convincing evidence that the plaintiff had been fired for her lack of interpersonal skills and for the poor quality of her work, as demonstrated by many internal reviews.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (quoting from an evaluation complaining that \"plaintiff did not present information in a logical manner and basic information often was missing in work papers.\"). In between these findings the court noted that the plaintiff had failed to provide \"any evidence from which it can be inferred that those responsible for her termination were aware of any whistleblowing activities by plaintiff during this period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, applying the\n   <em>\n    Rouse\n   </em>\n   court's disjunctive analysis, the court finds that at the summary judgment stage the court must make the reasonable inference that Smith knew that Plaintiff had made protected disclosures and that this factored in the decision to terminate Plaintiff. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Rouse\n   </em>\n   , it is undisputed that Plaintiff informed a co-worker of the Defendant that she intended to make a protected disclosure. (Rec. Doc. 66). Moreover, it is Defendant's position that Smith fired Plaintiff for storing the documents she had delivered to the FDIC on the Cloud. Smith did so only after an \"investigation\" into Plaintiff's conduct. The Court must infer then that Smith knew what documents Plaintiff was storing off-site and must also infer that Smith understood this act by Plaintiff to mean that Plaintiff was acting as a whistleblower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Having found that Plaintiff has staked out a prima facie case, the Court must determine whether Defendant has proved by clear and convincing evidence that it still would have terminated Plaintiff regardless of Plaintiff's disclosures. The Court finds that the Defendant falls short of satisfying this tall burden. As the Court has already explained above, this case does not resemble\n   <em>\n    Cosgrove\n   </em>\n   . There, Defendant demonstrated with extensive citation to performance evaluations and affidavits that the Plaintiff put in below satisfactory work and clashed with co-workers for a period of about 16 months.\n   <em>\n    Cosgrove\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20163218\">\n    1999 WL 163218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Mann v. Fifth Third Bank\n   </em>\n   , the court was convinced that the defendant had indeed fired the plaintiff for what were clearly inappropriate e-mails. No. 1:09-CV-014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201575537\">\n    2011 WL 1575537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 25, 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, Defendant alleges it put Plaintiff on probation because of criticism of the bank's BSA program, and that it terminated her for violating the bank's IT policy. (Rec. Doc. 37-1 at 14-15). However, Plaintiff asserts that the bank's BSA program was criticized because she was prevented from doing her job due to the bank's resistance to providing her relevant information in a timely fashion. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 7). She also alleges that she was terminated because of the content of the information she saved onto the cloud, not for the act itself. (Rec. Doc. 44 at 16). Unlike in the cited cases where the employers had persuasive reasons for firing that were independent of\n   any whistleblower activity, here it is unclear who is at fault for the bank's poor performance on the BSA examination. That is something the trier of fact will need to decide. Considering Plaintiff's record of exemplary performance, the temporal proximity, and the other circumstantial evidence provided by Plaintiff, the Court is not convinced that Plaintiff was terminated for the reasons that Defendant provides. Summary judgment is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PLAINTIFF'S LOUISIANA WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In its opposition, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant personnel decisions violated the Louisiana Whistleblower Statute, La. R.S. 23:967. Defendant argues this Court should not consider a claim not raised in the complaint. However, the Fifth Circuit has held: \"Under our precedent, when a claim is raised for the first time in response to a summary judgment motion, the district court should construe that claim as a motion to amend the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

Plaintiff filed her opposition, raising this new state law claim over a year later. Courts have found that allowing amendment would unduly prejudice defendants where it would be necessary to reopen discovery, reexamine witnesses, and cause defendants to undergo additional litigation costs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

La. Aug. 16, 2010). At first glance, one might assume that Louisiana's whistleblower statute is sufficiently similar to its federal counterpart that amendment would not require additional discovery or otherwise disrupt these proceedings. Section 967 prohibits an employer from retaliating \"against an employee who in good faith, and after advising the employer of the violation of law: ... [d]iscloses or threatens to disclose a workplace act or practice that is in violation of state law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   However, Louisiana courts have interpreted Louisiana's whistleblower statute to place rather sever limitations on who can bring a claim. Besides for the obvious addition of a notice requirement, Louisiana courts have also held that the state law action is only available to plaintiffs who know of an actual violation of state law.\n   <em>\n    Hale v.

In contrast, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831j protects an employee who discloses \"a possible violation of any law.\" Thus, allowing Plaintiff to add a state law whistleblower claim would expand the scope of the litigation to include the determination of whether the conduct of a third party, the manager of the bank's insurance division-constituted bank fraud or theft.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court declines Plaintiff's implicit request to expand the scope of this litigation at this late hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

La. Nov. 7, 2014) (finding dismissal of intentional infliction of emotional distress claim appropriate because even assuming that terminating employee in the late stage of pregnancy could qualify as extreme and outrageous, plaintiff produced no evidence to support second prong). Plaintiff explicitly references her miscarriage only to demonstrate the outrageousness of Defendant's conduct; she does not allege that Defendant's conduct caused her miscarriage. (Rec. Doc. 57). It is not enough that Plaintiff was potentially more vulnerable than an ordinary plaintiff; to satisfy the second element she must also point to the evidence in the record that demonstrates she suffered severe distress due to Defendant's actions. This she has not done. The potions of the deposition testimony cited by Defendant demonstrate that Plaintiff was \"very emotional\" upon being terminated (Rec. Doc. 51-6), but nothing in her testimony suggest the sort of mental anguish that an intentional infliction of emotions distress claim is intended to recover for.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gressett v.
