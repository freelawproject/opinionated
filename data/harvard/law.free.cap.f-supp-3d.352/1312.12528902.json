Before the court is a motion for summary judgment brought by Defendant Greenlight Organic, Inc. (\"Greenlight\") against Plaintiff United States (\"Government\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., July 9, 2018, ECF No. 89;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mem. L. Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., July 9, 2018, ECF No. 89 (\"Def.'s Mem.\"). Greenlight asserts that the Government's action is time-barred by the five-year statute of limitations set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201621\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because the Government\n   became aware of Greenlight's fraudulent activities in 2011, more than five years before filing the summons and complaint in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. 1.
