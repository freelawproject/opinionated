On December 17, 2018, the Intervenor Defendants moved the Court to clarify that the December 14, 2018 Order is not binding or to enter a stay if the Order is binding and to enter final judgment or certify the Order for immediate appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 213.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Am. Compl. 2, ECF No. 27. Their theory is that, because the TCJA eliminated the shared-responsibility tax, the tax-based saving construction developed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    National Federation of Independent Business v.

Because the Federal Defendants argued a judgment, as opposed to an injunction, was more appropriate, the Court provided notice of its intent to resolve the issues raised by the Application for Preliminary Injunction on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 16, 2018 Order, ECF No. 176 (citing FED.

For all this, the Court is grateful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Having reviewed the briefing and applicable law, the Court finds it is most efficient and appropriate to\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the Intervenor Defendants' request for final judgment on the December 14, 2018 Order granting summary judgment on Count I of the Amended Complaint and to\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the Intervenor Defendants' request for a stay of that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court Will Enter Partial Final Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Given the Parties' inquiries about whether the Court's December 14, 2018 Order is final and binding-and the unanimous agreement that the Order should be immediately appealable\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -the Court finds it is most efficient to enter a partial final judgment under Rule 54(b) on the Order and then stay it pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Federal Defendants suggest it would be inappropriate for the Court to enter partial final judgment under Rule 54(b)\"because the Amended Complaint presents only one claim for purposes of Rule 54(b) -that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that it is not severable from the rest of the ACA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   They assert that \"Counts I through V represent merely alternative theories of relief or different forms of remedy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that Counts I through V of the Amended Complaint are not mere redundancies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Count I, for example, asks for a declaratory judgment that the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count II, however, raises a Due Process Clause claim and asserts that because \"Section 5000A's individual mandate is unconstitutional, the rest of the ACA is irrational under Congress's own findings\" and that \"[t]he ACA lacks a rational basis now that the individual mandate's tax penalty has been repealed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It\n   is true this claim is likely moot if the Court's December 14, 2018 Order is affirmed on appeal; but if the Order is reversed in whole or in part, the Plaintiffs could still seek relief under the theory put forth in Count II. And Count IV, for example, presents an APA claim that presupposes the ACA's unconstitutionality but seeks different relief entirely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claims, in other words, are related but distinct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, the Court finds that summary judgment on Count I is an \"ultimate disposition of an individual claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Pilgrim Enterprises\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11586754\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/536/#p539\">\n    170 F.3d at 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

In their briefing, the Intervenor Defendants address all four factors relevant to a district court's analysis of whether to exercise its discretion to grant a stay pending appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds the Intervenor Defendants cannot carry their burden on the first relevant factor-likelihood of success on the merits. But the Intervenor Defendants prevail on the remaining elements, and the Plaintiffs do not argue otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Intervenor Defendants Are Unlikely to Succeed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Intervenor Defendants put forth a very powerful narrative in this case-one they assert the Fifth Circuit is likely to adopt. In truth, the narrative presents a forceful, surface-level appeal. It goes something like this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Individual Plaintiffs have no standing because they suffer no injury. After the TCJA, there is no tax penalty for non-compliance with the Individual Mandate. And anyways, the Individual Mandate is purely optional. So, at most, the ACA presents the Individual Plaintiffs with a simple choice between buying ACA-compliant insurance or \"paying\" a $0 tax. No harm, no foul.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But even if the choice between buying insurance and doing nothing creates standing, the Intervenor Defendants continue, the Individual Mandate is constitutional. It is constitutional as an exercise of Congress's Tax Power because the now-eliminated shared-responsibility payment still satisfies a number of the tax factors discussed in\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   . And even if the Individual Mandate is no longer salvageable as an exercise of the Tax Power, it may now be viewed as a proper exercise of Congress's Interstate Commerce Power because it does not compel anyone to do anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, even if the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional, it is severable from the remainder of the ACA. We know that because the 2017 Congress that passed the TCJA eliminated the shared-responsibility payment but left the rest of the ACA intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   So stated, this narrative is compelling. But it rests on two crucial premises, without which it falls apart. First, it is premised on a belief that written law is not binding. Second, it is premised on the view that the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   did not simply craft a saving construction but instead permanently supplanted Congress's intent by altering the very nature of the ACA. In the Court's view, neither of these premises hold and therefore neither does the narrative. The Court therefore finds the Intervenor Defendants are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their appeal for at least the following basic reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    a. Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Intervenor Defendants assert that, on appeal, they \"are likely to establish that the Individual Plaintiffs do not have standing to maintain this action\" because, after January 1, 2019, the Individual Plaintiffs will not be put to a choice \"between purchasing minimum essential coverage, on the one hand, and paying the penalty for not doing so, on the other.\" Intervenor Defs.'

Mot. Stay 8, ECF No. 213-1 (\"Beginning January 1, 2019, the Individual Plaintiffs will no longer be on the horns of that dilemma; as a result, the Fifth Circuit is likely to hold that they lack standing.\"). But standing analysis and merits analysis are fundamentally separate inquiries, and this line of attack conflates them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is, it rests on the premise that written law, like \u00a7 5000A(a), is not binding-which is one of the Intervenor Defendants' premiere merits arguments in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   That the Individual Mandate does nothing is the Intervenor Defendants' leading argument for why the mandate permissibly \"regulates\" interstate commerce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Putting aside the logical difficulty of that argument, the Supreme Court has made clear that whether a challenged \"statute in fact constitutes an abridgment of the plaintiff's\" constitutional protections \"is, of course, irrelevant to the standing analysis.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, the Fifth Circuit is unlikely to skip ahead to the merits to determine \u00a7 5000A(a) is non-binding and therefore constitutional and then revert to the standing analysis to use its merits determination to conclude there was no standing to reach the merits\n   in the first place. It is instead likely to hold that the Intervenor Defendants' merits argument that the Individual Plaintiffs need not comply with the law is an inappropriate ground for challenging standing\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   -and likely inappropriate on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This then brings into focus the proper injury inquiry for the Individual Plaintiffs' constitutional challenge: Do the Individual Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that the Individual Mandate\n   <em>\n    operates\n   </em>\n   to injure them? The inquiry is not whether the Individual Plaintiffs are injured if they break the law-i.e., if they\n   <em>\n    disobey\n   </em>\n   the Individual Mandate. The Court does not ask whether a plaintiff is injured by a challenged law if they choose to disregard the law they challenge as unconstitutional-the injury arises from following the law as Congress intended. That is the entire point of a constitutional challenge. Were courts to assess whether plaintiffs are injured by\n   <em>\n    disregarding\n   </em>\n   allegedly unconstitutional laws, courts would not only be implicitly sanctioning lawlessness but would be foreclosing a large swath of constitutional challenges already entertained by the Supreme Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In this regard, the Individual Plaintiffs' alleged injury-the requirement to purchase an unwanted product-is not self-inflicted, it is congressionally inflicted. Congress intended to achieve something through the Individual Mandate, the Individual Plaintiffs allege, that is beyond its constitutional reach. It would be illogical to ask whether the allegedly unconstitutional Individual Mandate injures the Individual Plaintiffs when it is ignored. The answer is obviously \"no,\" but it is also\n   obviously irrelevant. Answering whether the Individual Mandate injures the Plaintiffs by unconstitutionally requiring them to do something requires analyzing what the law requires them to do, not whether the Plaintiffs can get away with not doing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In sum, the pleadings satisfy\n   <em>\n    Hotze\n   </em>\n   and otherwise sufficiently state a constitutional injury sufficient to meet the Article III requirements of standing. And to the extent an independent, justiciable injury other than regulation by unconstitutional legislation is necessary, the Individual Plaintiffs have alleged that, too-they are required to purchase a product that, in the absence of \u00a7 5000A(a), they allege they would not purchase. If the Fifth Circuit has held that an allegation of death to whooping cranes-majestic as they are-is sufficient injury-in-fact to confer standing on an individual,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   surely it is unlikely to hold that an allegation of unconstitutional coercion is not. And while it may not agree on the merits of that allegation, it may not thereby dismiss it at the threshold. The Court therefore finds the Intervenor Defendants are unlikely to succeed on their standing argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    b. Merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Intervenor Defendants also contend they are likely to succeed on the merits of the Plaintiffs' claims. First, the Intervenor Defendants assert they are likely to succeed in arguing the Individual Mandate \"can still be upheld as a lawful exercises of Congress's taxing power\" because \" Section 5000A will retain most of the features that the Supreme Court pointed to in concluding that it could fairly be construed as a tax\" and because \"the Fifth Circuit is unlikely to share this Court's view that the production of revenue at all times is the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of a tax.\" Intervenor Defs.'

The more courts step into breaches for Congress, the more courts will be called upon to step into breaches for Congress. That would represent a fundamental shift in the Constitution's careful balancing of powers-not only on the Judiciary-Legislature plane, but also on the citizen-government plane. If the judicial power encompasses ignoring unambiguous enacted text-the text citizens read to know what their representatives have\n   done-to approximate what a judge believes Congress meant to do,\n   <em>\n    but did not,\n   </em>\n   then policymaking lies in the hands of unelected judges and Congress may transfer politically unwinnable issues to the bench. This the Constitution does not allow. This the Supreme Court does not allow.

The\n    <em>\n     Ardoin\n    </em>\n    decision does not abrogate the Supreme Court's holding that the generation of revenue is the essential feature of a tax-and not only because a Fifth Circuit opinion ought not be read to contravene Supreme Court precedent. The two attacks on the constitutionality of the tax provisions in\n    <em>\n     Ardoin\n    </em>\n    were that they (1) taxed an activity that was no longer legal and (2) were no longer enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF).

The illegality of the activity did not render the legislation a nullity. Here, even though applicable individuals are required to purchase ACA-compliant health insurance, if someone disobeyed that requirement they would not be subject to a tax-because it is gone. The Intervenor Defendants make that point repeatedly. As to the second challenge, the court reasoned that, whatever the agency's enforcement decisions, the\n    <em>\n     legislation\n    </em>\n    continued to give \"ATF ... the authority to tax now-illegal machineguns ... Thus, the basis for ATF's authority to regulate-the taxing power-still exists; it is merely not exercised.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10503762\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/177/#p179\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Here, however, the IRS's authority to tax noncompliance is gone.

Mot. Stay 10 n.5, ECF No. 213-1. This is a mischaracterization of the Court's reasoning and conclusion. The Court did not conclude \"the 2017 Congress demonstrated an intent to unwind the entire ACA\"-it concluded exactly the opposite. The Court concluded that, if any intent can be inferred from the 2017 Congress's budget and reconciliation legislation at all, it is that Congress intended to\n    <em>\n     preserve\n    </em>\n    the Individual Mandate-which remains on the books-because it understood the mandate was \"essential\" to the remainder of the ACA. In other words, the enacted text the Court has to work with unequivocally communicates that (1) the Individual Mandate is essential to the ACA functioning as Congress intended, (2) the mandate operates independently of the tax penalty, and (3) the mandate remains on the books. And because courts are better positioned to interpret written law than pick policy, Congress must be the one to repeal the Individual Mandate if that is what it intends to do. It has not.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"75\">\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Brett M.

We would be exercising the judicial power if one Act was-one provision was stricken and the others remained to impose a risk on insurance companies that Congress had never intended. By reason of this Court, we would have a new regime that Congress did not provide for, did not consider.
