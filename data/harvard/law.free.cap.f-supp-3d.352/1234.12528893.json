The Court finds that Plaintiff lacks the requisite standing on the representative claims alleged in the Amended Complaint. Accordingly, the Court grants the Defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   THIS CAUSE came before the Court upon Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (D.E. 10) filed on\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     May 16, 2018\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   THE COURT has considered the motion, the pertinent portions of the record, and being otherwise fully advised in the premises, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that the motion is GRANTED and the case is DISMISSED without prejudice.

Plaintiff, MSPA Claims 1, is the assignee of numerous Medicare Advantage Organizations, Medicare Service Organizations, and Independent Physician Associations, and by virtue of those assignments, it claims entitlement to pursue claims against \"primary payers,\" such as liability insurance carriers, who settled with Medicare beneficiaries for the cost of medical expenses arising from an accident. In this case, Plaintiff is suing to recover payment from the Defendant, Scottsdale Insurance Company, the primary insurance plan, for accident-related expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff originally filed this lawsuit on May 16, 2016 in the Circuit Court in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida. Defendant removed the suit and the case was\n   remanded on August 29, 2017. Upon remand, Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend to add a federal claim on March 21, 2018, which the state court granted on April 4, 2018. On April 18, 2018, the Defendant removed this case again a second time and it is presently before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Amended Complaint identifies two assignors: (1) the first is Florida Healthcare Plus, an entity that is in a receivership; (2) the second is Professional Health Choice, a Medicare Services Organization. This case is filed as a class action, but the complaint focuses on two representative claims. The first one stems from the assignment to Plaintiff from Florida Healthcare Plus and the claims of Medicare beneficiary F.T. The second claim stems from the assignment to Plaintiff from a Medicare Services Organization called Professional Health Choice, which managed a Medicare Advantage Organization called Amerigroup. Professional Health Choice paid for medical services for D.T., Amerigroup's enrollee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"To survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must do more than merely state legal conclusions,\" instead plaintiffs must \"allege some specific factual basis for those conclusions or face dismissal of their claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Factual Challenge to Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The first identified claim arises from an accident and injuries sustained by F.T., who was enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan issued and administered by a Medicare Advantage Organization, Florida Healthcare Plus. Florida Healthcare Plus assigned its claims to recover reimbursement to Plaintiff, who is suing Defendant Scottsdale, as a primary payer under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act. Scottsdale, acknowledges it is a primary payer and claims it paid the full benefits in satisfaction of the lien within sixty days of receiving notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This factual attack to standing allows the Court to consider matters outside the pleadings. In support of its position, Defendant attaches an email exchange where Plaintiff acknowledges receipt and deposit of $5,000 from Defendant. In its response brief, Plaintiff does not rebut this evidence of payment, which Defendant claims constitutes a full payment. Once a plaintiffs standing is challenged, the plaintiff bears the burden to establish its standing.\n   <em>\n    DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276173\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/332/\">\n    547 U.S. 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276173\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/332/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276173\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/332/\">\n    164 L.Ed.2d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Without anything to rebut this contention, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met its burden establishing standing because Scottsdale has provided evidence showing payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Even if Plaintiff established Defendant failed to reimburse it, Plaintiff nevertheless lacks standing because Florida Healthcare Plus did not approve this assignment, as contractually required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Multiple courts in this district have consistently held that Plaintiff lacks standing to assert Florida Healthcare Plus's claims because Plaintiff did not possess a valid assignment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those decisions rest on two factual findings. First, the Florida Department of Financial Services, the Receiver for Florida Healthcare Plus, repudiated the services agreement between Florida Healthcare Plus and La Ley Recovery via the liquidation order on December 10, 2014 and expressly on February 5, 2015. That action precluded La Ley's ability to assign or pursue Florida Healthcare Plus's claims. Second, the La Ley Agreement required approval from Florida Healthcare Plus before there could be an assignment of rights to Plaintiff, and since the Receiver controlled Florida Healthcare Plus when the purported assignment to Plaintiff\n   took place, the Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that approval. In reaching that dismissal result, the courts also found that subsequent to the June 1, 2016 settlement agreement between Plaintiff and the Receiver, the agreement could not retroactively cure the lack of standing. Plaintiff, in this case, originally filed this lawsuit on May 16, 2016. Consistent with the past case law, the Court finds Plaintiff's assignment was invalid and the Plaintiff lacks standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff argues that because the claim for F.T.'s care predated the original assignment agreement from Florida Healthcare Plus to La Ley Recovery, the Receiver had no authority to repudiate that assignment. That is not the issue. The lynchpin missing from Plaintiff's position is that once the Receiver controlled Florida Healthcare Plus, there is nothing demonstrating that the Receiver approved the assignment of rights from La Ley Recovery to Plaintiff MSPA Claims 1, LLC. Because it cannot show the approval after the Receiver took over Florida Healthcare Plus, Plaintiff argues that Florida Healthcare Plus approved the assignment from La Ley to MSPA Claims 1, LLC prior to the receivership. However, the assignment from La Ley to MSPA Claims did not predate the receivership and was dated February 20, 2015 (after the express repudiation by the Receiver). (D.E. 1-1 at 730). It is unclear how Florida Healthcare Plus could have approved the assignment, or how the assignment could have been valid, if MSPA Claims, 1, LLC was not yet formed as a company in December 2014 when the receiver took over Florida Healthcare Plus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allstate\n   </em>\n   , 276 F.Supp.3d at 1315.

Cause of Action under the MSP Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Plaintiff also lacks standing on the second representative claim. The Eleventh Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Humana v.

The Court explained that \"because the plaintiff's assignors ... are not MAOs, Medicare beneficiaries, or medical providers\n   that directly treated the Medicare beneficiaries in the claims presented, they lacked standing to bring a private cause of action under the MSP Act, and so the plaintiffs also lacked standing to bring a section 1395y(b)(3)(A) claim based on the assignors' purported assignment of rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205112998\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing with approval\n   <em>\n    MSPA Claims 1, LLC v.

Because Professional Health Choice is not a Medicare Advantage Organization, and Medicare Service Organizations do not possess a right of action under the Act, the representative claim fails to state a valid cause of action. Critically, the Complaint does not allege nor attach an assignment from Amerigroup, the Medicare Advantage Organization, to Professional Health Choice or to Plaintiff. Rather, the Complaint alleges that Amerigroup pays Professional Health Choice a fixed fee per month for the assigned enrollee. In exchange, Professional Health Choice agrees to pay for an enrollee's accident-related expenses. These allegations conclusively establish that Professional Health Choice is not a Medicare beneficiary, a Medicare Advantage Organization, nor a direct provider of medical services, which are the three categories of plaintiffs with rights of action under the Act.\n   <em>\n    ACE American\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201547600\">\n    2018 WL 1547600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at Miami, Florida, this\n   <em>\n    12\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   of December 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The La Ley Agreement contained a provision restricting further assignment of Florida Healthcare Plus's claims.
