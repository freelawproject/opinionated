Essentially, insider trading is a variation of\n   the species of fraud known as embezzlement, which is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as \"[t]he fraudulent taking of personal property with which one has been entrusted, especially as a fiduciary.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). In the case of insider trading, the property is a company's material confidential information that has value to the embezzler because of its potential use in the purchase and sale of securities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. O'Hagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p654\">\n    521 U.S. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 654,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p654\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p654\">\n    138 L.Ed.2d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). Insider trading occurs when someone to whom this property has been entrusted pursuant to a fiduciary or similar relationship secretly embezzles, or \"misappropriates,\" the information in order to take advantage of its securities-related value. If the embezzler, instead of trading on the information himself, passes on the information to someone who knows it is misappropriated information but still intends to use it in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, that \"tippee\" is likewise liable, just as any knowing receiver of stolen goods would be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   It is just that simple - or, conceptually, should be. But, as described below, some judicial decisions appear to have added complications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   These observations are prompted by the instant motion to dismiss of defendants Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz and Jeremy Millul, who are charged in a superseding indictment (\"the Indictment\") with substantive securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Indictment alleges that Pinto-Thomaz, having received in a fiduciary capacity material nonpublic information concerning the forthcoming acquisition of the Valspar Corporation by the Sherwin-Williams Company, secretly misappropriated the information and provided it to Millul \"with the intention to benefit\" Millul by enabling him to trade profitably on the acquisition prior to its public announcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 5, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In their motion, defendants argue that the Indictment should be dismissed as to both the tipper (Pinto-Thomaz) and the tippee (Millul) because the Indictment fails to allege that they shared a \"meaningfully close personal relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although sometimes referred to as the \"classical theory\" of insider trading,\n   <em>\n    O'Hagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p654\">\n    521 U.S. at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p654\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this was in fact a rather narrow approach, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") itself had to labor somewhat to apply it even to the situation where a company executive or his agent used the company's negative inside information to sell short.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chiarella v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    445 U.S. 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 227 n.8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    63 L.Ed.2d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) (briefly describing this development). The Government also was only gradually able to extend the classical theory to \"tippees\" who traded on inside information supplied by the tipper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dirks v.

Thus, by the time the classical theory of insider trading reached its first challenge in the Supreme Court in 1980, it was clear that there were formidable limits on its application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chiarella\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    445 U.S. at 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reversing attempt to extend the classical theory to embrace fraud on shareholders to whom no fiduciary duty was owed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the reversal in\n   <em>\n    Chiarella\n   </em>\n   , however, the Government, acting on a suggestion in Chief Justice Burger's dissent,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    445 U.S. at 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1777832\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/445/222/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , set about devising a more straightforward theory of insider trading liability - a theory based on the well-established law of embezzlement and known as the \"misappropriation theory.\" In 1997, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    O'Hagan\n   </em>\n   , endorsed this theory and held it broadly applicable to both insiders and outsiders, tippers and tippees, who traded on information they knew to be embezzled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Hagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p654\">\n    521 U.S. at 652-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915949\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/642/#p654\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the misappropriation theory outlaws trading on the basis of nonpublic information by a corporate 'outsider' in breach of a duty owed not to a trading party, but to the source of the information\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Well before the approval of the misappropriation theory in 1997, however, the Supreme Court was confronted in 1983 with a rather unusual case brought under the classical theory,\n   <em>\n    Dirks v.

In that case, Ronald Secrist, the \"tipper,\" contacted Raymond Dirks, the \"tippee,\" and provided material nonpublic information concerning a corporation where Secrist formerly worked.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    at 648-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Secrist was acting solely in a whistleblower capacity, informing Dirks, an investment specialist, that the corporation's assets were \"vastly overstated\" as the result of fraud and that the SEC had failed to act on reports of the fraud.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Yet the SEC found Dirks liable for insider trading because Dirks had disclosed to some of his firm's clients material information received from Secrist before the information was disclosed to the public.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    at 650-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Supreme Court reversed. Rejecting the SEC's determination, the Supreme Court explained that Dirk's disclosure to his firm's clients of the nonpublic information he received from Secrist could serve as the basis of insider trading liability only where Secrist's prior disclosures to Dirks were a breach of Secrist's fiduciary duty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both sides acknowledged as much.

The Court in\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   explained that the fraud required to establish insider trading pursuant to Rule 10b-5 \"derives from the inherent unfairness involved where one takes advantage of information intended to be available only for a corporate purpose and not for the personal benefit of anyone.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 655 n.14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The basis for recognizing this fiduciary duty is not simply that such persons acquired nonpublic corporate information, but rather that they have entered into a special confidential relationship in the conduct of the business of the enterprise and are given access to information solely for corporate purposes.\").

For example, in giving a non-exclusive list of possible personal benefits, the Court stated that a benefit may be \"such as a pecuniary gain\n   <em>\n    or a reputational benefit\n   </em>\n   that may translate into future earnings,\" or may be inferred from \"a relationship between the insider and the recipient that suggests a quid pro quo from the latter,\n   <em>\n    or an intention to benefit the particular recipient\n   </em>\n   ,\" or may be satisfied \"when the insider\n   <em>\n    makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend\n   </em>\n   \" that \"resemble[s] trading by the insider himself followed by a gift of the profits to the recipient.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    at 663-664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198411\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/646/#p659\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

MBP at 6-7. However, the Indictment clearly describes the overall nature of the information here in issue, at what time and in what capacity Pinto-Thomaz acquired this information, Pinto-Thomaz's subsequent contact with Millul, and Millul's trades thereafter. This is sufficient, especially given the fact that the discovery provided to the defense, encompassing the results of multiple search warrants and in electronically-searchable form, included all\n   the material nonpublic information that Pinto-Thomaz received in connection with the acquisition.

This is a demand for exactly what a bill of particulars is specifically barred from doing: compelling the Government to \"disclos[e] the manner in which it will attempt to prove the charges, the precise manner in which the defendant committed the crime charged, or a preview of the Government's evidence or legal theories.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

MBP at 4, 10. The Government does not address this request in its opposition. In considering whether the Government should be required to identify unindicted co-conspirators, the Court must balance the risk of surprise to the defendant, which is enhanced if \"there are a large number of co-conspirators and a long-running conspiracy\" with legitimate law enforcement concerns, such as the \"potential danger to co-conspirators and the risk of compromising continuing investigations.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, while there is no allegation of a long-running conspiracy and Millul is only alleged to have conspired with Pinto-Thomaz, it would meaningfully alter the nature of the charges and, accordingly, Millul's preparation for trial if it were revealed that the Government considered him to be conspiring with other individuals, rather than only Pinto-Thomaz.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government has made no showing that there would be any risk of compromising a continued investigation or other dangers resultant from identifying unindicted co-conspirators. In fact, the Government represents that the underlying conduct concerns \"only two defendants,\" Govt. Opp. at 66; if this is in fact the scope, there should be little burden to the Government in confirming that there are no unindicted co-conspirators whose identities are known at this time.

Of the categories that did not include such a limitation explicitly, two were effectively time-limited as they were limited to evidence relating to the acquisition of Valspar by Sherwin-Williams, which the supporting affidavit clearly sets forth was initiated in June 2015 and publically announced in March\n   2016.

These categories were not overbroad as probable cause clearly justified seizing such evidence without temporal limitation because, as discussed above, evidence of the relationships between tipper and tippee is relevant to determining whether the tipper received a personal benefit in making the tip and evidence concerning past trades in Valspar is relevant to determining whether receipt of inside information motivated the trades at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants also argue that the warrants were overbroad and lacked particularity in seeking information \"regarding the relationship\" between Pinto-Thomaz, Millul, and Oujaddou without further specifying the type of evidence required. However, as discussed above, evidence concerning the general tenor of the relationships between tipper and tippees is relevant to proving the requisite personal benefit under\n   <em>\n    Dirks\n   </em>\n   , and as such by its nature cannot be confined to the specific timeframe of the alleged illegal trades.

The affidavits set forth evidence that Pinto-Thomaz was in communication with both Millul and Oujaddou, as was another relevant person referenced in the affidavit, so the authorizing judges \"look[ing] to the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men act\" had ample reason to think there was a probability that Millul and Oujaddou might have a relationship.\n   <em>\n    Walczyk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5706180\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/139/#p156\">\n    496 F.3d at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Millul also argues that the Millul iPhone Warrant's \"failure to specifically list insider trading as the type of securities fraud under investigation\" constitutes a lack of particularity, given that the Gmail Warrant identified the crime specifically as \"securities fraud/insider trading.\" MMTS at 29.

But quite aside from the fact that the Second Circuit itself has not adopted such a rule, it is irrelevant here since, while securities fraud is susceptible to different theories of proof, it is by no means so broad a statute that it provides no limitation to law enforcement officers in executing a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Pinto-Thomaz advances the separate argument that the iCloud warrant was overbroad because it included \"intrusive and general categories such as his constant geographic location' for an approximate two week period in 2016.\" PTMTS at 5. However, there is no question that this was supported by probable cause: the two-week period was the one in which he was allegedly coordinating, at times in person, with Oujaddou and Millul to provide them with material nonpublic information for trading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In sum, the affidavits set forth detailed information concerning the evidence of insider trading obtained and the connection between the devices and accounts concerned and probable additional evidence. The warrants were particularized and their breadth tied to the evidence relevant to the charges. Moreover, the warrants were reviewed and approved by two different magistrate judges acting independently, which provides a clear presumption of validity. Accordingly, defendants' arguments that the evidence should be suppressed because the warrants lack particularity, are overbroad, and/or lack sufficient probable cause are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Pinto-Thomaz argues that the phone must be returned on the ground that the time for executing it has expired, either because the deadline for execution listed on the face of the warrant has passed or because a reasonable amount of time for execution has passed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PT MFR at 2-3.

However, Rule 41 is clear that, for warrants seeking electronically stored information, \"[t]he time for executing the warrant in Rule 41(e)(2)(A) and (f)(1)(A) refers to the seizure or on-site copying of the media or information, and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to any later off-site copying or review.\" Fed.

The Second Circuit has viewed the advisory committee' notes to the 2009 amendment of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as \"shed[ding] some light on what is reasonable\" in the context of electronic data review, noting the advisory committee specifically provides that factors such as \"difficulties created by encryption\" \"might justify an off-site review lasting for a significant period of time.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As the subsequently-filed superseding indictment does not contain wire fraud counts, the motions to dismiss these counts are denied as moot.

This argument attempts to graft on a higher standard of evidence than probable cause requires. The affidavit specifically alleges that Millul exchanged text messages and phone calls with Pinto-Thomaz at the time of the alleged crime, permissibly relying on the agent's experience and commonsense that data is often transferred from old to new cell phones.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Illinois v.
