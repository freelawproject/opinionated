Dkt. # 1. Plaintiffs now move for summary judgment. Dkt. # 13. Defendants United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") and the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), responded, and also cross-moved for summary judgment. Dkt. # 14. The parties both filed replies to the competing motions. Dkt. ## 15, 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After considering the Administrative Record (Dkt. ## 8, 10) and the parties' arguments, for the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Mr. Naiker is a United States citizen who was born in Fiji, and currently lives in Des Moines, WA. P95, P413-417.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff Ms. Pillay is a citizen and resident of Fiji.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiffs, Mr. Naiker first met Ms. Pillay briefly in July 2004, at a community prayer event while he was visiting Fiji, and again in 2012 when Mr. Naiker attended a friend's wedding. P95. At that wedding, they talked and exchanged phone numbers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the wedding, Mr. Naiker and Ms. Pillay began talking and text messaging each other.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Mr. Naiker returned to the United States, he maintained contact with Ms. Pillay through e-mail and social media.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In October 2013, Mr. Naiker traveled to Fiji and married Ms. Pillay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 29, 2013, Naiker filed an I-130 immigrant petition with USCIS, which approved the application on June 9, 2014 on the basis of the couple's marriage. P414, P444. Subsequently, embassy officials in Fiji interviewed Ms. Pillay to determine if she was eligible for a visa. P60. During the interview, embassy officials apparently showed Ms. Pillay an e-mail purporting to be written by her, which contained the details of her visa appointment, stated that the marriage is a fraud, stated that Pillay did not want to immigrate to the United States, and requested that her visa not be issued. Ms. Pillay denied writing the e-mail and stated that she did not use that address.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the interview,\n   the Department of State determined \"that the beneficiary is ineligible for the benefit sought\" and returned the petition to USCIS for reconsideration of the I-130 petition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 4, 2016, USCIS issued a Notice of Intent to Revoke (\"NOIR\") the previously approved I-130 petition. P60-62. The NOIR explained that the petition was originally approved \"based on the petitioner's marriage to the beneficiary,\" but that USCIS subsequently received the following additional information: (1) based on birth certificates of the couple's parents, Plaintiffs were biological first cousins; (2) Ms. Pillay, during her interview, denied being related to Mr. Naiker, and signed a sworn statement to that effect in January 2015; (3) Pillay mistakenly stated that she had an aunt in Washington that was deceased, even though she had an aunt (Mr. Naiker's mother) that was alive; (4) the embassy received e-mails from multiple sources indicating that Mr. Naiker and Ms. Pillay were siblings and the sole purpose of their wedding was for immigration purposes; (5) the embassy received an e-mail from Pillay or someone purporting to be her that contained the details of her visa appointment, stated that the marriage is a fraud, stated that Pillay did not want to immigrate to the United States, and requested that her visa not be issued; and (6) there is a ten-year age gap between Ms. Pillay and Mr. Naiker. P60-61. Based on those issues, USCIS determined that Mr. Naiker did not show that he and Ms. Pillay have a bona fide marital relationship. P61. USCIS offered Mr. Naiker the opportunity to submit additional evidence to oppose the proposed revocation. P62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 6, 2016, counsel on behalf of Mr. Naiker filed a response to the NOIR and included numerous documents, including (1) written statements from both Plaintiffs; (2) letters from family members, friends, a member of Fiji parliament, and coworkers; (3) Facebook posts and messages for a 4-year period; (4) e-mails exchanged between Mr. Naiker and Ms. Pillay; (5) records of the couple's conversations via different telephone applications; (6) proof of Mr. Naiker providing money for Ms. Pillay's education and their wedding expenses; (7) evidence that Ms. Pillay is listed as a beneficiary on Mr. Naiker's investment and retirement accounts; (8) evidence that the couple stayed together in a hotel; (9) itineraries for Mr. Naiker's trips to Fiji; (10) a scrapbook containing purported photos and memories from the couple's relationship; (11) photographs of the couple, including photographs of their marriage ceremony; (12) explanations that cross-cousin marriage was legal and accepted in Fiji; and (13) an explanation that Mr. Naiker never told Ms. Pillay about their biological relationship, as Mr. Naiker's mother was adopted out at an early age and he didn't consider their relationship familial. P75-401.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 1, 2016, Defendant Gregory Richardson, the Director of the USCIS Texas Service Center, issued a decision that acknowledged the rebuttal evidence but explained that based on \"the totality of the non-partisan material evidence coupled with indications that you and your husband the deficiencies [sic] noted in the interview prevent you from meeting your burden of proof in establishing the validity of your marriage.\" P52. On June 20, 2017, Mr. Naiker then filed an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"). P7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 20, 2017, the BIA considered the appeal. P1-5. The BIA found that that plaintiffs did not submit \"sufficient evidence to overcome the derogatory information\" articulated in the NOIR or to establish the bona fides of their marriage. P4. The BIA also found that Mr. Naiker's claim that Ms. Pillay \"was not aware of\n   their familiar relationship until after a consular interview not worthy of belief.\" P4. The BIA explained that Mr. Naiker knew of the couple's biological familial relationship, and \"claims unconvincingly that he did not discuss the matter with the beneficiary\" because he did not find the familial relationship \"relevant.\" P4. The BIA explained that USCIS \"reasonably found unpersuasive the petitioner's explanation that the derogatory information was 'false allegations' sent by certain people who may be opposed to his marriage to the beneficiary,\" noting that Mr. Naiker did not raise those concerns about people opposed to his marriage during his consular interview. P4. The BIA also noted that Mr. Naiker claimed on appeal that he and Ms. Pillay received threatening messages on Facebook from relatives who disapproved of their marriage, and that those relatives may have been involved in providing the derogatory information to the consular office, but did not provide USCIS or the BIA with any such evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The BIA denied the appeal, finding that Naiker \"did not meet his burden of establishing eligibility for the benefit sought\" and finding that \"good and sufficient cause to revoke the approval of the visa has been shown.\" P5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Complaint with this Court on November 27, 2017 pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"). Dkt. # 1. They challenge the BIA's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

It is certainly true that Plaintiffs submitted a large quantity of information to support their application. Plaintiffs submitted a marriage certificate, pictures from their wedding, written statements from friends and family attesting to the closeness of the couple and their relationship, evidence of commingling of financial assets, evidence of a bevy of social media and text contacts, and information concerning the legality of cousin marriage in Fiji and the rest of the\n   world. Taken in isolation, this evidence may be compelling.

Moreover, although there is a lack of disclosure about certain derogatory e-mails, it is unclear whether this information is truly dispositive, and whether the nondisclosure matters from a notice standpoint. For instance, there is at least some evidence in the record that Plaintiffs were familiar with the derogatory emails: the NOIR suggests Ms. Pillay was shown at least one of the derogatory e-mails in question during her interview at the embassy in Fiji, and she responded by saying she did not send the e-mail, pointing to typos in her name.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070421\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/1149/#p1156\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   P77.

This Court also finds limited support for\n   <em>\n    Mattson\n   </em>\n   's view of the BIA's \"interpretation of the regulation,\" as the BIA's previous interpretations generally uphold the view that the derogatory information must be based on evidence contained in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Estime\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20450\">\n    19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 450 (BIA 1987) (\"A determination of statutory ineligibility is not valid unless based on evidence contained in the record of proceedings.\"). In\n   <em>\n    In re: Shinmoto\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the BIA remanded a decision revoking a previously approved marriage-based visa petition because the NOIR was based on an undisclosed site visit report.\n   <em>\n    In Re: Shinmoto\n   </em>\n   , No. AXX XX5 296,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20486920\">\n    2008 WL 486920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (BIA Jan. 30, 2008). At the very least, previous BIA decisions do not definitively reject\n   <em>\n    Ghafoori\n   </em>\n   , as the\n   <em>\n    Mattson\n   </em>\n   court claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Ghafoori\n   </em>\n   remains persuasive in holding immigration agencies to the recording and disclosure standards set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(16)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court concludes that Defendants violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(16)(ii) by denying Plaintiffs' statutory eligibility based on derogatory information that was not in the record and not disclosed to the petitioner, Mr. Naiker. The question then turns to what remedy is warranted. The Ninth Circuit requires a showing of prejudice before relief can be granted based on an agency's violation of its own regulation.\n   <em>\n    Kohli v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2540469\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/1061/#p1066\">\n    473 F.3d 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1066 (9th Cir. 2007). As in\n   <em>\n    Ghafoori\n   </em>\n   , there is not enough evidence at this point to determine if Plaintiffs will ultimately be able to rebut\n   all of the derogatory information, as some of the underlying derogatory information is not presently in the record. Without a full record, this Court is limited in its review of the BIA's decision. The Court is not required, and does not intend to guess as to the full scope of the derogatory e-mails' contents; instead, the Court holds that by not including the derogatory information anywhere in the record, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of the ability to have a decision on statutory eligibility based solely on information in the record that was disclosed to the petitioner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ghafoori\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026964\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/713/871/#p881\">\n    713 F.Supp.2d at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Since the Service's violation deprived Plaintiff of the ability to make a meaningful rebuttal, that is itself sufficient prejudice to justify relief.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    on this basis only\n   </strong>\n   , the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion. The Court will thus remand this case to USCIS for further proceedings in accordance with this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 13) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and Defendants' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   (Dkt. # 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In so ruling, the Court takes no position on whether Plaintiffs actually meet the criteria for statutory eligibility for a marriage-based visa. Instead, this matter is\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   to USCIS with orders that it reconsider the I-130 petition and base its determination of statutory eligibility only on evidence in the record which is disclosed to the petitioner, Plaintiff Mr. Naiker, in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(16)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The Administrative Record is on file with the Court (Dkt. # 8), and record citations are made to page numbers as indicated in the Record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Likewise, the Court is not in a position to second-guess credibility determinations made by the BIA as to whether Ms. Pillay's statement she did not know of the familial relationship at the time of her interview was \"worthy of belief.\" P4.
