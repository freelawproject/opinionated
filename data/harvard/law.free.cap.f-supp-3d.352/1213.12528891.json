Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. On February 14, 2018, Nicholas Cruz allegedly murdered 17 Stoneman Douglas students and injured many others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On March 19, 2018, after students had been dismissed for the day, Plaintiff skateboarded onto the grounds of Stoneman Douglas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. While on school grounds, Plaintiff did not make threats, approach anyone, or otherwise behave in an odd manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.

When asked why Plaintiff was on school grounds, Plaintiff replied that he was \"trying to soak it all in.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Upon learning Plaintiff's identity, Plaintiff was arrested for trespassing and booked into custody at the Broward County Main Jail (the \"Main Jail\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's bond on his misdemeanor trespass charge, initially set at $25, was paid at 9:54 p.m. while Plaintiff was booked at the Main Jail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.

Motion at 2-5. Captain Green further argues that Plaintiff's false imprisonment claim must also be dismissed because Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged that Captain Green acted in bad faith or with a malicious purpose in continuing to detain Plaintiff. Motion at 12-13. In response, Plaintiff argues that because Captain Green acted with \"intentional malice\" in detaining Plaintiff after his bond was posted and then sanctioned the torture of Plaintiff by keeping him under constant, bright light 24 hours per day, Captain Green is not entitled to qualified immunity and is liable for false imprisonment.

The Eleventh Circuit reasoned that although cases involving \"over-detentions\" could be brought under the Fourteenth Amendment, the facts of\n   <em>\n    Alcocer\n   </em>\n   more directly implicated the Fourth Amendment because (i) the plaintiff's detention was based upon facts that were not part of the probable cause that supported the plaintiff's original detention and (ii) the text of the Fourth Amendment \"provide[d] an explicit source of protection for the right that [the d]efendants allegedly violated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 955.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Alcocer\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff was arrested for a misdemeanor trespass offense and posted bond, but was nonetheless detained by jail staff, including Captain Green, overnight and until his subsequent bail hearing before Judge Kim Mollica. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-22. Moreover, the \"over-detention\" cases considered by the Eleventh Circuit under the Fourteenth Amendment framework generally concerned administrative errors by jail staff that led to continued detentions following postings of bond.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West v.

Here, no such errors were alleged; instead, Captain Green and her subordinates purposely detained Plaintiff after he posted bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nonetheless, Plaintiff's initial arrest was, at least in part, based upon the same facts that supported Plaintiff's detention following his bond payment. As Plaintiff himself alleges, upon confronting Plaintiff for skateboarding on school property, BCSO Deputies \"were preparing to issue a trespass warning to [Plaintiff]\" but, \"upon learning who he was ... arrested [Plaintiff] instead.\" Compl. \u00b6 17. Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Alcocer\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff was arrested solely for driving with a suspended license, and then suspected of having committed another crime only while in custody, Plaintiff was detained after posting bond largely for the same reasons that he was initially arrested. While the\n   <em>\n    Alcocer\n   </em>\n   plaintiff continued to be detained because of a suspicion of another crime-illegal presence in the United States-Plaintiff was not suspected of any other crime and was detained after posting bond based upon a fear of Plaintiff \"being released to the streets,\" with \"the entire community\" feeling \"at unease.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 19; Motion at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although a close call, the Court finds that the precise right allegedly violated is Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from continued detention after law enforcement should have known that he was entitled to release, rather than his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures. First, as stated, the reasons underlying Plaintiff's continued detention following the satisfaction of his bond are substantively the same reasons supporting probable cause for his initial arrest. This distinguishes the instant case from those like\n   <em>\n    Alcocer\n   </em>\n   , where the plaintiff was detained following the posting of bond because of suspicion of an unrelated or independent offense.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518966\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/944/#p947\">\n    906 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   949-950 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.F.C. v.
