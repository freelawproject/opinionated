Under the Policy Guide, \"safe and timely release must occur within a setting that promotes public safety and ensures that sponsors are able to provide for the physical and mental well-being of children,\" and ORR must abide by its duty to \"protect children from smugglers, traffickers, or others who might seek to victimize\" them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Policy Guide details a multistep process for securing an unaccompanied minor's release. First, the \"case manager,\" typically an employee of the facility in which the minor is being held, interviews the child to explore possible sponsors and ranks the possibilities into four categories in order of preference: (i) a parent or legal guardian; (ii) an immediate relative (a sibling, aunt, uncle, grandparent, or first cousin, including relatives by marriage); (iii) a distant relative or unrelated adult; and (iv) no identifiable sponsor.

It identifies ten criteria that ORR \"considers ... when evaluating family members and other potential sponsors,\" including the \"nature and extent of the sponsor's previous and current relationship with the child\"; the \"sponsor's motivation for wanting to sponsor the child\"; whether the minor \"wants to be released to the individual\"; the \"sponsor's understanding of the [minor's] needs\"; \"[t]he sponsor's plan to provide adequate care, supervision, access to community resources, and housing\"; the sponsor's \"understanding of the importance of ensuring the ... child's presence at all future hearings or proceedings\"; and the \"sponsor's strengths, resources, and mitigating factors in relation to any risks or special concerns of the child or sponsor, such as a criminal background, history of substance abuse, mental health issues, or domestic violence and child welfare concerns.\" Policy Guide \u00a7 2.4.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, the Policy Guide establishes the decisionmaking process for family reunification applications. An application will not proceed unless and until a case manager recommends to the ORR Director that the minor be released to a sponsor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Policy Guide \u00a7 2.7. The Director may grant or deny the application or remand to the case manager for additional factfinding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2.7.3-.5.

Release from custody is not the type of official conduct that normally triggers the concerns animating the voluntary cessation doctrine, and courts are reticent to assume that officials will re-seize released individuals the moment their claims are declared moot.

Because the remaining plaintiffs claim that they are injured not only by the possible denial of their family reunification application but also by the process through which ORR will reach a decision (or fail to act) on that application, their claims are ripe, and there is no prudential reason why the Court should decline to adjudicate them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The last of defendants' justiciability-based arguments is that the remaining plaintiffs lack standing to challenge ORR's policy of demanding biographical and biometric information from all adult members of a sponsor's household and of systematically sharing that information with DHS (the \"information-sharing policy\").

Nor is the rule being challenged merely a gap-filling interpretation that does not bind regulated parties or the agency.

Indiscriminately sharing sensitive information about all adults in a sponsor's household with DHS could result in DHS's taking immigration enforcement action against those individuals, which could destabilize the home environments into which unaccompanied minors may be released.

Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief filed on behalf of the Human Trafficking Legal Center confirms what common sense dictates, namely that the information-sharing policy could dissuade otherwise qualified sponsors from filing family reunification applications, forcing ORR to hold unaccompanied minors in custody for longer than necessary or to release them to less qualified or unrelated sponsors.

The Fourth Circuit has squarely held in a similar context that where, as here, the government must determine whether a potential guardian is fit to care for the child, \"the constitutionality of state actions that interfere with family integrity depends on the adequacy of the procedures available\" to contest those actions.\n   <em>\n    D.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325696\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/721/#p732\">\n    826 F.3d at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
