FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or about May 8, 2006, Defendants Veisinia and Filimone Tuavao gave Resmae Mortgage Corp. (\"Resmae\") a $316,000 promissory note (\"the Note\") in\n   exchange for funds in that amount to purchase real property at 4461 Reddawn Drive, Reno, Nevada, 89523 (\"the Property\"), secured by a deed of trust (\"the DOT\") against the Property. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7-9 &amp; Ex. 1, ECF No. 1). On February 26, 2015, Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\") assigned the Note and DOT to Plaintiff U.S. Bank National Association (\"US Bank\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 &amp; Ex. 2). On November 21, 2014, however, Defendant Nevada Association Services, Inc. (\"NAS\") had held an HOA sale of the Property on behalf of Defendant Renovista Ridge Master Property Owners Association (\"the HOA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 13 &amp; Ex. 3). Defendant Thunder Properties, Inc. (\"Thunder\") purchased the Property at the HOA sale for $135,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 13 &amp; Ex. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   US Bank sued Defendants in this Court to quiet title to the Property, asking the Court to rule that the HOA sale was either altogether void, or, in the alternative, that the DOT survived the sale for reasons of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , due process and commercial unreasonableness. The Clerk entered default against all Defendants except Thunder. US Bank moved for summary judgment.

As the Court has noted, an HOA foreclosure sale under NRS 116.3116 is analogous to the tax sale in\n   <em>\n    Mennonite Board of Missions\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [A] mortgagee possesses a substantial property interest that is significantly affected by a[n HOA] sale. Under [Nevada] law, a mortgagee acquires a lien on the owner's property .... A mortgagee's security interest generally has priority over subsequent claims or liens attaching to the property, and a purchase money mortgage takes precedence over virtually all other claims or liens including those which antedate the execution of the mortgage. The [HOA] sale immediately and drastically diminishes the value of this security interest by granting the [HOA]-sale purchaser a lien with priority over that of all other creditors. Ultimately, the [HOA] sale may result in the complete nullification of the mortgagee's interest, since the purchaser acquires title free of all liens and other encumbrances ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Neither notice by publication and posting, nor mailed notice to the property owner, are means \"such as one desirous of actually informing the [mortgagee] might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\" Because they are designed primarily to attract prospective purchasers to the tax sale, publication and posting are unlikely to reach those who, although they have an interest in the property, do not make special efforts to keep abreast of such notices. Notice to the property owner, who is not in privity with his creditor and who has failed to take steps necessary to preserve his own property interest, also cannot be expected to lead to actual notice to the mortgagee. The County's use of these less reliable forms of notice is not reasonable where, as here, \"an inexpensive and efficient mechanism such as mail service is available.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Personal service or mailed notice is required even though sophisticated creditors have means at their disposal to discover whether [HOA dues] have not been paid and whether [HOA] sale proceedings are therefore likely to be initiated. In the first place, a mortgage need not involve a complex commercial transaction among knowledgeable parties, and it may well be the least sophisticated creditor whose security interest is threatened by a tax sale. More importantly, a party's ability to take steps to safeguard its interests does not relieve the State of its constitutional obligation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194044\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/791/#p798\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194044\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/791/#p798\">\n    at 798-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). In summary, a foreclosing entity must make reasonable attempts-meaning attempts that a person desirous of actually informing the interested party might take, e.g., via personal service or mail-to notify known or reasonably identifiable parties who stand to lose security interests; publication or other notice schemes requiring special efforts of interested parties are not usually reasonable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194044\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/791/#p798\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court of Appeals has ruled that Chapter 116 foreclosure sales constitute state action under the Due Process Clause. The Nevada Supreme Court's recent ruling as to what notice state law previously required does not affect the applicability of the Due Process Clause to Chapter 116 sales but only the analysis of whether Chapter 116 was previously sufficient under the Due Process Clause. The question is whether the notice previously required was notice \"reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\"\n   <em>\n    Mullane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"362818\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/339/306/#p314\">\n    339 U.S. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"362818\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/339/306/#p314\">\n    70 S.Ct. 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Bourne Valley\n   </em>\n   determined that because Chapter 116 required a first deed of trust holder to affirmatively request notice in order to receive it, the statutes were facially invalid under the Due Process Clause. The Nevada Supreme Court has now ruled that notice to a first deed of trust holder of the fact of an impending Chapter 116 sale was required without opting in.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that is not necessarily enough to satisfy due process \"under all the circumstances\" in the unique context of Chapter 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Where a lienor foreclosing with the power of the state makes reasonable attempts to notify interested parties of the time and place of the sale, it usually satisfies its obligations under the Due Process Clause without more. That is because in a typical situation, e.g., where a municipality seeks to foreclose a tax lien, the lien being foreclosed is senior to all other encumbrances by law, and notice of an impending tax sale puts interested parties on notice that if the entire tax delinquency (as specified in the notice of default and/or notice of sale) is not satisfied before the sale, all other security interests against the property will be extinguished. A junior lienor therefore has the opportunity to present his objections upon mere notice of the time and place of sale. He knows that he must satisfy the entire delinquency to prevent the sale and the extinguishment of his security interest. But an HOA lien under Chapter 116 is atypical in a fundamental and critical respect. It consists of two legally distinct pieces: one senior to a first deed of trust (\"the superpriority piece\"), and one junior thereto (\"the subpriority piece\").\n   <em>\n    SFR Invs. Pool 1, LLC v. U.S. Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    SFR I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20Nev.%20742\">\n    130 Nev. 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%20408\">\n    334 P.3d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 411 (2014). The Nevada Supreme Court has declined to address whether Chapter 116 previously required the superpriority piece to be specified in the notice of sale or otherwise,\n   <em>\n    SFR II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12568820\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/422/1248/\">\n    422 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1250 n.2, 1253 n.5, but it is clear that the statute the\n   <em>\n    SFR II\n   </em>\n   Court determined was incorporated into the previous notice scheme under Chapter 116 required only \"notice of time and place of sale,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20107.090\">\n    Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 107.090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because of the dual nature of a Chapter 116 lien, notice only of the total amount of such a lien is not necessarily constitutionally sufficient under all the circumstances as to a first deed of trust holder, whose\n   lien is partially senior to the HOA's lien.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   First deed of trust holders cannot reasonably have been expected to satisfy not only the superpriority piece, but also the subpriority piece. As a general matter, it is not reasonable to require a lienholder to satisfy a junior lien in order to protect a senior interest. It is particularly unreasonable where the subpriority piece greatly exceeds the superpriority piece. But that is precisely what a notice scheme not mandating that the superpriority piece of a mixed-priority lien be specified forces a mixed-priority lienholder to do. A notice lacking this critical information might not be constitutionally reasonable, because it does not give the interested party the information required to protect his interest without paying additional amounts for which he is not liable and which are junior to his own interest, or without taking an incredible risk that his estimation of the superpriority piece will be found to have been insufficient in a later proceeding. Such circumstances are not present in traditional foreclosures, where the lien being foreclosed is of unified priority and is specified in the notice of default, the notice of sale, and/or at the sale itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It could be argued that bare notice of an impending sale is enough to satisfy due process. After all, notice of an impending sale warns a first deed of trust holder that he must take action of some kind to prevent losing his interest, and that may require him to make further inquiries. But in many of these cases where a first deed of trust holder actually received notice of an impending sale, directly or indirectly, it has made such further inquiries, requesting the HOA or its agent to identify the superpriority piece so that it may protect the first deed of trust by tendering that amount prior to the sale. The Court cannot recall a case where an HOA or its agent has done anything but refuse when so asked, and certainly no case where the superpriority piece was specified on the initiative of the HOA or its agent, whether in the notice of sale or some other writing, or even by the auctioneer at the sale itself. Events occurring after notice is initially dispatched can be relevant. Just as one \"desirous of actually informing\" an interested party would not simply say \"I tried\" after watching a postman drop a notice down a storm drain,\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Flowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p229\">\n    547 U.S. 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 229,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p229\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p229\">\n    164 L.Ed.2d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), a person actually desirous of giving an interested party with a mixed-priority lien the opportunity to cure the superpriority piece of the default would not simply say \"no\" or \"guess\" when asked to specify the superpriority piece after providing notice only of the total delinquency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A person \"actually desirous\" of giving a first deed of trust holder the information necessary to protect his interest would specify the superpriority piece, at least where requested. It may or may not be unreasonable to provide bare notice of a sale and await a first deed of trust holder's inquiry as to the superpriority piece, but it is unreasonable not to specify the superpriority piece if asked. The Court finds that where a notice of sale specifies only the total amount of a default that by\n   law is only partially in priority to another's lien, the refusal of the foreclosing entity to specify the superpriority amount to the other lienholder when so requested is a denial of the opportunity to present objections. Despite initial efforts, \"[f]ailure to follow up [is] unreasonable\" where a need to follow up has become evident.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A request to specify the superpriority piece of a Chapter 116 lien-the only portion of the lien that must be satisfied to protect the first deed of trust-makes clear the need to follow up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Facts of Notice in the Present Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ultimately, the Court need not in this case determine whether the previous notice scheme as recently reinterpreted remains constitutionally suspect, either facially or as applied here, because the evidence previously submitted does not indicate that any party gave US Bank or its predecessor-in-interest notice of the time and place of sale that the Nevada Supreme Court has now determined it was required to give. US Bank's own evidence shows that notice of the time and place of sale were mailed to Resmae on August 26, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Sale Mailing List, ECF No. 33-3). Although there is no evidence of actual receipt by Resmae, as with some other addressees, (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p229\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), the proof of mailing is enough to show a reasonable attempt at actual notice for the purposes of due process. But Resmae was only US Bank's predecessor-in-interest as to the Note. As Thunder's own evidence showed, US Bank's predecessor-in-interest as to the DOT was not Resmae, but MERS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOT 2, ECF No. 39-1). MERS later assigned its own interest in the DOT, along with Resmae's interest in the Note, to US Bank. (Assignment, ECF No. 34-3). Resmae never had any interest in the DOT; only MERS (and later US Bank) did. The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled that a deed of trust such as the one in this case validly splits the interests in the note and deed of trust by contract.\n   <em>\n    Edelstein v. Bank of N.Y.

MERS' interest in the DOT and address were known at the time of sale, because the DOT identifying both had been recorded several years earlier.

Thunder adduced no evidence tending to show that the HOA or its agent had attempted to notify US Bank or any predecessor-in-interest of the DOT of the time and place of the sale by mail or any other constitutionally reasonable method. Thunder has not in its present motion changed its argument or proffered any additional evidence. There is no basis to reconsider summary judgment. Even assuming the Court is free to reexamine the due process issue and that the previous notice scheme under Chapter 116 (as recently reinterpreted by the Nevada Supreme Court) passed constitutional muster as to first deed of trust holders on its face, there is no evidence that the HOA or its agent provided the notice to US Bank or MERS that the Nevada Supreme Court has now determined was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thunder previously argued that certain recitals in the foreclosure deed as to notice having been given were conclusive under state law. But conclusive presumptions of notice under state law are inapposite to federal requirements of due process. Reasonable notice is a federal constitutional requirement of factual inquiry \"under all the circumstances\" that cannot be obviated by presumptions arising under state law (or even federal statute).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p229\">\n    547 U.S. at 226-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p229\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mullane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"362818\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/339/306/#p314\">\n    339 U.S. at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"362818\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/339/306/#p314\">\n    70 S.Ct. 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    Mennonite Bd. of Missions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194044\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/462/791/#p798\">\n    462 U.S. at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6125771,6194044\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/103/2706/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.
