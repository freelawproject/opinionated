(Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 78-88). The complaint alleges that the treatment that patients receive is medically unnecessary, inadequately or illegibly documented, non-reimbursable, similar or identical across numerous patients without regard for the patients' individual clinical conditions, or simply not rendered at all. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 89-205). In some cases, the documentation provided to State Farm allegedly \"contain[ed] no indication of any communication between or among any of the professionals rendering services that would suggest any attempt to coordinate their treatment.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 111). It is alleged that the treatments are selected in a formulaic fashion to maximize reimbursements under the applicable fee schedule. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76, 127, 158, 204-205). On occasion, Defendants will misrepresent the treatment provided by billing under improper billing codes, which are specifically selected to inflate reimbursements. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77, 94-95, 127, 139, 172, 182). State Farm also alleges that Defendants failed to appear for examinations-under-oath (\"EUO\") on request, thereby evading State Farm's efforts to verify the claims. (Am.

(McKenna Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7). Defendants have brought at least 2,300 lawsuits in New York state court and 20 American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") proceedings against State Farm to collect no-fault benefits in the aggregate amount of approximately $3.2 million. (ECF No. 58, at 1; McKenna Aff. \u00b6 8). The amount at issue in each case typically ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. (ECF Nos. 7-1; 7-2; 58-1; 58-2).

Surely this does not advance the goals of federalism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   To be clear, the Court is not invoking the exception to \u00a7 2283 solely on the grounds that its judgment may be precluded by an inconsistent judgment in state court. In a typical case with parallel state proceedings, the effect of issue or claim preclusion, \"far from requiring the federal court to stay proceedings in the state court, is a result which should [usually] be welcomed to avoid the task of reconsidering issues which have already been settled by another competent tribunal.\"\n   <em>\n    Ret.

However, these considerations are profoundly inapplicable where, as here, the fragmentation of the dispute into more than 2,300 individual actions would nullify State Farm's efforts to prove fraud at a systemic level, impair a federal declaratory judgment action over which the Court has taken jurisdiction precisely to eliminate such fragmentation, and deprive State Farm of an avenue toward complete relief in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   court. None of the relevant Supreme Court or Second Circuit precedents disapproving of the in-aid-of-jurisdiction exception\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   cases addressed a conundrum analogous to this one.

To obtain a preliminary injunction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65, the moving party must demonstrate \"(1) irreparable harm absent the injunctive relief and (2) either (a) a likelihood of success on the merits or (b) sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson Dairy, Inc. v.

State Farm also presents a sworn affidavit from Maiga Borisevica (\"Borisevica\") on behalf of Defendant Maiga Products Corporation, which had failed to appear for a scheduled EUO. (ECF No. 5-26). Borisevica claims that unsuccessful attempts were made to respond to the request, but State Farm avers that they have no record of any such communications. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 233; ECF No. 5-26 \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court finds that State Farm has \"adequately detailed a complicated scheme of alleged fraud activity,\"\n   <em>\n    Elzanaty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4044769\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/929/199/#p222\">\n    929 F.Supp.2d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and, in light of the exhibits on record, it cannot be said that their request for injunctive relief \"rest[s] on mere hypotheticals,\"\n   <em>\n    Hancock v. Essential Resources, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7408979\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/792/924/#p928\">\n    792 F.Supp. 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 928 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). Accordingly, the Court finds that there is a serious question going to the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Balance of hardships tipping decidedly in the plaintiffs' favor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Because the Court finds that there are \"serious questions going to the merits\" in lieu of a \"likelihood of success on the merits,\" it must further inquire as to whether that there is a \"balance of hardships tipping decidedly\" in State Farm's favor.\n   <em>\n    Jackson Dairy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"502931\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/596/70/#p72\">\n    596 F.2d at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court need not pause on this question for long, as the irreparable harm factors discussed above also tip the equities squarely in State Farm's favor. If the preliminary injunction is granted and State Farm fails to prove its claims, then, at worst, Defendants' recovery of the no-fault benefits to which they are entitled will be delayed; all Defendants can hope for in\n   pursuing their parallel state lawsuits and arbitrations is to accelerate their receipt of benefits to which they are already entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, State Farm's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in its entirety. Because the Court is temporarily staying Defendants' right to further commence and prosecute any no-fault arbitrations and state court actions, all discovery, potential dispositive motions, and a potential trial should proceed on an expedited basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Defendants are Jules Parisien, M.D.; Luqman Dabiri, M.D.; Ksenia Pavlova, D.O.; Noel Blackman, M.D.; Frances Lacina, D.O.; Allay Medical Services, P.C.; FJL Medical Services P.C.; JFL Medical Care P.C.; JPF Medical Services, P.C.; KP Medical Care P.C.; PFJ Medical Care P.C.; RA Medical Services P.C.; Darren Mollo, D.C.; Darren Mollo D.C., P.C.; ACH Chiropractic, P.C.; Energy Chiropractic, P.C.; Island Life Chiropractic Pain Care, PLLC; Charles Deng, L.A.c.; Charles Deng Acupuncture, P.C.; David Mariano, P.T.; MSB Physical Therapy P.C.; Maiga Products Corporation; Madison Products of USA, Inc.; Quality Custom Medical Supply, Inc.; Quality Health Supply Corp.; Personal Home Care Products Corp.; and AB Quality Health Supply Corp.
