For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are derived from the Amended Complaint and the documents appended thereto, and are assumed to be true for the purposes of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Lowell resides in White Plains, New York and typically uses a motorized scooter to travel. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12 - 13.) To assist her in travel throughout Westchester County and in her bi-monthly trips to New York City, Plaintiff Lowell would like to use Defendant's transportation services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 102.) Plaintiff WDOMI is a Yonkers, New York nonprofit, run largely by individuals with disabilities, and operates as an independent living center for individuals with disabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18 - 19.) WDOMI's mission includes the \"empower[ing] people with disabilities to control their own lives, advoca[ting] for civil rights and a society free of barriers to people with disabilities\" and \"ensuring that people with mobility disabilities are able to effectively use the transportation services they require.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20 - 21.) Members of WDOMI \"have been and will be injured\" as a result of Defendant's actions, described below. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By downloading Defendant's ride-hailing application, a customer can remotely hail a nearby vehicle, select her destination, and pay through a payment method saved in the application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Defendant operates both in White Plains and in Westchester County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 29.) Unlike New York's Boro Taxi services, or \"for hire\" livery services, Defendant is not subject to the Taxi and Limousine Commission's (\"TLC\") rules and regulations of accessibility for disabled individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) While Defendant requires that its New York City drivers register with the TLC, Defendant is not subject to the TLC's 2014 agreement to make fifty percent of all taxis operating in New York City wheelchair accessible by 2020. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendant \"pervasively and systematically\" excludes people with mobility disabilities from its convenient transportation services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) To support this allegation, Plaintiffs note that Defendant does not make wheelchair accessible vehicles (\"WAVs\") available in Westchester County; individuals who attempt to hail wheelchair accessible rides in\n   that county receive a text message with alternative transportation services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48.) In areas where WAVs are available, users with mobility disabilities must toggle to the \"Access Mode\" function in Defendant's smartphone application to be matched with a WAV, and those individuals often experience long wait times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49.) While there are transportation alternatives to the service offered by Defendant, none are replacements for Defendant's services. New York City's subway is largely impossible for people with disabilities to use and its bus system is limited and \"largely inefficient.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41 - 42.) Taxicabs do not offer the same convenience provided by Defendant's service, which includes the ability to pay without using cash or presenting a credit card to the driver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87 - 88.) Trips around Westchester County are difficult for Plaintiff Lowell because there is limited local paratransit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Lowell learned of Defendant's ongoing discrimination from \"friends and acquaintances who have mobility disabilities and have witnessed [Defendant]'s failure to provide equivalent, non-discriminatory service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100.) A friend from White Plains told Plaintiff he tried to order an accessible Lyft, was informed that none were available, and received a text message from Defendant telling him to obtain an alternate method of transit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because Defendant does not provide WAVs, Plaintiff Lowell and members of the putative class have been deterred from downloading Defendant's application or trying to access Defendant's services as any attempt would be futile even though access to Defendant's services would improve their lives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101, 116.) If Plaintiff Lowell had equal access to Defendant's services, she would be able to travel about Westchester County more often. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) Additionally, Plaintiff Lowell would be able to visit New York City on a more frequent basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) Currently, she goes to and from New York City approximately twice a month and, because she cannot use Defendant's services, she must rely on her husband to transport her in their WAV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Due to Defendant's failure to provide equal, accessible transportation, Plaintiffs cannot benefit from Defendant's services. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant's actions are in violation of the ADA, NYSHRL and NYCHRL. Plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief under the ADA and compensatory damages in addition to declaratory and injunctive relief under the NYSHRL and NYCHRL. Specifically, Plaintiffs request that the Court require Defendant to develop and implement a remedial plan to ensure full and equal access to its services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint due to lack of standing, the existence of an arbitration agreement in Defendant's terms of Service, and Plaintiffs' failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When a court lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate a case, it should dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    Nike, Inc. v.

Plaintiff WDOMI claims that it suffered injury \"in the form of diversion of [its] resources and frustration of its mission,\" but this allegation is conclusory and unsupported by any facts in the Amended Complaint.

The Amended Complaint does not include any facts, beyond the aforementioned conclusory allegation, to plausibly support that Defendant's conduct interfered WDOMI's ability to pursue its mission or that it was forced to divert resources to prevent an adverse consequence, like LIHS in\n    <em>\n     Olsen.\n    </em>\n    Thus, Plaintiff WDOMI fails to establish an injury to itself as an organization, the first element of organizational standing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Thus, because Plaintiff WDOMI cannot satisfy all of the elements for organizational standing and cannot satisfy all of the elements for associational standing specifically for its NYCHRL and NYSHRL claims, WDOMI only has standing to pursue its ADA claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <strong>\n     II.

It seems supremely unjust to hold individuals to an arbitration clause buried in the verbiage of a terms of service of agreement for a service that they did not sign up for, particularly when those individuals have not received any benefits from the agreement, direct or indirect.

The Amended Complaint contains numerous factual allegations surrounding Defendant's failure to provide WAVs.

(Compl. p. 28.) Drawing all reasonable inferences is Plaintiffs' favor, the Court interprets the allegations surrounding Defendant's deficient WAV offerings as support for Plaintiffs' claim that Defendant violates the ADA by discriminating against people with mobility disabilities and not as a request for relief. A request for injunctive relief requiring compliance with the ADA, such as Plaintiffs' request for relief, is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Reed v. 1-800-Flowers.com\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526920\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/327/539/#p550\">\n     327 F.Supp.3d 539\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 550 - 51 (E.D.N.Y. 2018).

Assuming Defendant also moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' ADA claim for failure to plausibly allege each of the elements of the claim, the Court would still deny the motion to dismiss.

Plaintiffs also satisfy the second element for the purposes of this motion to dismiss, that Defendant operates a public accommodation. Defendant disputes that it is a public accommodation in the business of transportation and a covered entity under Title III of the ADA, but Defendant acknowledges that Plaintiffs allege it is a transportation company and that the Court is required to accept Plaintiffs' allegations as true for the purpose of the motion to dismiss.

In\n    <em>\n     Snowden v. Trustees of Columbia University\n    </em>\n    , the Second Circuit held that the district court properly dismissed a plaintiff's NYCHRL claim after conducting a separate analysis and focusing on the \"broad and remedial\" aspects of the NYCHRL.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317362\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/612/7/#p10\">\n     612 F.

The issue is, according to Plaintiffs, that there are long wait times for WAVs in New York City for those individuals requiring WAVs because Defendant does not provide enough such vehicles. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 49.) There is no case law to indicate that extended wait times for a public accommodation is a NYCHRL violation. While it is a NYCHRL violation to entirely exclude a person with a disability from accessing a public accommodation, see\n    <em>\n     All Island Airport Serv., Inc. v. N.Y. State Div. of Human Rights\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4164958\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/127/967/#p968\">\n     127 A.D.3d 967\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 968 (NY. App. Div. 2015), that is not the situation before the Court. Defendant offers, albeit in a small number, WAVs in New York City. Analyzing Plaintiffs' NYCHRL claims separately, and construing the provisions broadly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs failed to state a facially plausible claim under the NYCHRL because they did not plausibly allege a NYCHRL violation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' NYCHRL claim is GRANTED and Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiff WDOMI's NYSHRL claim is GRANTED. Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' ADA claims and Plaintiff Lowell's NYSHRL claim is DENIED. The Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 31.
