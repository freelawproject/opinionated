(\"WEL\"), as the Buyer, and NFM/Welding Engineers, Inc. (\"NFM\"), as the Seller, executed an agreement entitled Technology Transfer Agreement (\"TTA\"), in which NFM,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"irrevocably assign[ed] to Buyer the entire right, title and interest in the Purchased Technology,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   free and clear of any Encumbrances.\" In exchange for the assignment and \"in settlement of any remaining dispute involving the 1998 License Agreement and/or the Cross-License Agreement, the total Consideration due from Buyer to Seller ... [wa]s USD 10,150,000, which amount [was to] be tendered by Buyer on the Closing Date.\" Section 2.4 of the TTA stipulated that \"Seller agree[d] to provide copies of all drawings (i) for spare parts for the Purchased Technology and (ii) as the case may be, for machines covered by the Cross-License Agreement[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 7, 2016, WEL filed this breach-of-contract action against NFM, essentially\n   averring that NFM failed to comply with Section 2.4's requirement that NFM provide to WEL copies of all drawings for certain machines and spare parts. WEL seeks specific performance of the agreement, compensatory damages, and \"a declaratory judgment that NFM is in material breach of the TTA, and the limited license agreements contained in the TTA are therefore terminated.\" [ECF 1]. In the answer, NFM denies the averments in the complaint and asserts counterclaims against WEL premised on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , trademark infringement; and counterclaims under the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . [ECF 17 at 14-29].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before this Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 56. Specifically, WEL seeks summary judgment on its breach-of-contract claim against NFM and on all of NFM's counterclaims. [ECF 57]. In turn, NFM seeks summary judgment on both of WEL's claims and on Counts One, Two, and Three of its counterclaims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [ECF 58]. The issues presented in the cross-motions for summary judgment have been fully briefed by the parties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and are ripe for disposition. For the reasons set forth, each motion is granted,\n   <em>\n    in part\n   </em>\n   , and denied,\n   <em>\n    in part.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As noted, WEL claims that NFM breached the TTA and, as a result of the breach, seeks specific performance requiring the delivery of all relevant drawings as well as compensatory damages for lost sales revenue caused by not having the drawings (Count I), and a declaration that NFM is in material breach of the TTA and, therefore, that the \"limited license agreements\" referenced in the TTA are terminated (Count II). [ECF 1]. In its answer, NFM denies the allegations and, in turn, asserts counterclaims against WEL for misappropriation and infringement of NFM's trademarks, specifically, the infringement of the \"Welding Engineers\" name and the \"W-E\" logo in violation of Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    115 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (Count II) and common law (Counts III, VII), and seeks damages for these violations. NFM also seeks declaratory judgments declaring\n   <em>\n    to wit\n   </em>\n   : that WEL has no right to use any of the relevant trademarks (Count I); that certain disputed devices do not fall within the scope of the TTA's definition of \"Turbulator Technology,\" and, thus, WEL is not entitled to royalties with respect to NFM's use of those devices (Count IV); that WEL is not entitled to drawings of a device called a \"vertical feeder\" (Count V); and that WEL is not permitted to offer barrels manufactured with hot isostatic pressing (\"HIP\") technology to customers and that NFM is entitled to sell HIP barrels to any customer in any \"field of use\" (Count VI). [ECF 17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Procedurally, discovery ensued and closed.

Welding Engineers Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , 5:15-cv-000652 (N.D. Ohio), ECF 1. In October 2015, the parties settled that lawsuit by executing the\n   <em>\n    Technology Transfer Agreement\n   </em>\n   (\"TTA\"). (ECF 22-7 (TTA) ). Pursuant to the TTA, WEL agreed to pay NFM $10,150,000 to settle the royalty dispute and to purchase NFM's rights to certain twin screw extruder technology (the \"Purchased Technology\"). NFM also agreed to provide WEL with all \"drawings\" for certain machines and spare parts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Sections 1.1.7, 2.4, 3.1). Specifically, as to the drawings, the TTA section entitled \"Perfection of Rights\" provides:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-30\">\n   As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Seller agrees to provide copies of all drawings (i) for spare parts for the Purchased Technology and (ii) as the case may be, for machines covered by the Cross-License Agreement, for the following companies: Lanxess, Inc., in Sarnia, Canada; Dyneon, LLC, in Decatur, Alabama; Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC, in Thorofare, New Jersey; and Zeon Corporation in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

Both licenses were to expire five years after the execution of the TTA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Section 4.1). Additionally, WEL granted NFM a third license to use the Turbulator Technology for work related to spare parts for Exxon Mobil Corporation and/or its affiliates.

An impasse resulted and in September 2016, WEL filed the instant breach-of-contract complaint averring,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that NFM had not provided it with drawings \"in detail that include[ ] the parts lists, drawings lists, component data sheets and serial numbers of the machines\" (collectively, \"the Data\"), and requesting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , specific performance by way of delivery of said drawings. (ECF 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 26). In October 2016, NFM produced a batch of drawings to WEL that did not include drawings related to the vertical feeder. (Pl.'s Br. [ECF 57-1] at 15). NFM asserts that the drawings produced were given to WEL \"as they were.\" (ECF 64 at 12; ECF 64-11 at 14). Many of the drawings contained the Data embedded directly on the drawings themselves.

WEL contends that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the meaning of the term \"drawings\" in Section 2.4 of the TTA and that the term unambiguously includes the external documents containing the Data, which were incorporated by reference into some of the produced drawings. Thus, WEL argues entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on its claim for the specific performance of the delivery of the external documents not produced.

They disagree, however, on the meaning of the unambiguous term. Under Pennsylvania law, \"mere disagreement between the parties over the meaning of a term is insufficient to establish that term as ambiguous.\"\n   <em>\n    Bohler-Uddeholm Am., Inc. v. Ellwood Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105823\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/79/#p94\">\n    247 F.3d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94 (3d Cir. 2001). After carefully reviewing the TTA, this Court finds that there is no ambiguity in the meaning of \"drawings\" as used in Section 2.4. In the context of the TTA, \"drawings\" clearly refers to drawings that can meaningfully assist WEL in manufacturing the relevant parts and machinery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court is unpersuaded by NFM's contention that professionally created drawings of complicated machinery, bereft of technical data incorporated by reference on the drawing itself, could satisfy the intent of the parties as evidenced by the TTA contract. Indeed, it is undisputed that many of the drawings NFM produced to WEL in October 2016 contained the Data embedded directly on the drawings, while other drawings provided by NFM to WEL referenced separate external documents that contained the Data. The essence of NFM's argument is that, under the negotiated terms of the TTA, \"a drawing is just a drawing\" and nothing more, and so long as NFM provided WEL with drawings of the relevant machinery and parts, NFM satisfied Section 2.4. However, consideration of the entire TTA simply does not support this contention. WEL paid over $10 million dollars for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the right to manufacture certain equipment and to purchase the rights, title and interest in the intellectual property related to the twin screw extruder technology. As part of the TTA, NFM was required to give WEL drawings necessary for WEL to accomplish that purpose. Further, for the drawings to meaningfully assist in manufacturing the equipment, these drawing must include or be accompanied by the Data referenced in the drawings. This is\n   true whether the Data is directly embedded on the drawings themselves, or incorporated by reference in the drawings but actually contained in external documents. NFM's implication that WEL should just \"figure it out\" without the benefit of the missing Data was not part of the bargain. Thus, this Court finds that NFM has not satisfied Section 2.4 in so far as some of the drawings produced did not provide the Data incorporated by reference on the drawings themselves. Accordingly, WEL's motion for summary judgment is granted with respect to its breach-of-contract claim and its request for specific performance of the delivery of the relevant external documents containing Data referenced in the drawings that NFM produced in October 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Count V of the Counterclaims - The Vertical Feeder\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   WEL next seeks summary judgment on Count V of NFM's counterclaims, in which NFM seeks a declaratory judgment that WEL is not entitled to drawings of the \"vertical feeder.\" NFM did not move for summary judgment on this counterclaim. Nonetheless, pursuant to Rule 56(f)(1), a court may, after giving notice and a reasonable time to respond, \"grant summary judgment for a nonmovant.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)(1).

WEL, by moving for summary judgment on Count V of NFM's counterclaims, had notice, and in fact requested, that this Court address the issue of the vertical feeder. WEL, as the movant, has had ample opportunity to present all evidence and arguments supporting its position on the matter, and \"to put its best foot forward\" in doing so. Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , WEL had sufficient notice for this Court to exercise its authority under Rule 56(f)(1) and grant summary judgment in NFM's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As noted, Section 2.4 of the TTA requires NFM to provide WEL with the drawings \"for machines covered by the Cross-License Agreement[.]\" At issue is whether the vertical feeder is a machine covered by the Cross-License Agreement. This Court concludes that the vertical feeder was not covered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At the outset, the Cross-License Agreement indicated that WEL and W-Bar-E were \"engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling extrusion machinery for the synthetic rubber processing industry.\" (Cross-License Agreement at page 1). The primary purpose of the Cross-License Agreement was for WEL to license certain single screw extruder technology to NFM (the \"Licensed Technology\"), so that NFM could \"make, use, market and sell the Products\" in North America. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Section 3.1). To this end, WEL \"agree[d] to provide to [NFM] sufficient information and materials relating to the Licensed Technology, to allow [NFM] to make, use, sell and market the Products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Section 3.3). The Cross-License Agreement in turn defined \"Products\" as \"any of the items listed on Exhibit A hereto, which are designed, manufactured and sold either individually or in combination, utilizing the Licensed Technology for the processing of polymers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Section 1.3). The vertical feeder was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   listed in Exhibit A to the Cross-License Agreement. In light of these facts, this Court concludes that there is no genuine issue of fact that the TTA's reference to \"machines covered by the Cross-License Agreement,\" was a reference to the \"Products\" specifically defined in the Cross-License Agreement. This product definition did not include the vertical feeder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, this Court finds that NFM is not required to produce drawings of the vertical feeder under Section 2.4 of the TTA.

NFM argues that Section 13 of the Cross-License Agreement, which outlined the parties' agreements regarding the use of their respective corporate names, is the sole source of WEL's legal right to use its corporate name and logo. NFM further contends that any rights obtained under the Cross-License Agreement, including the use of the corporate name, were extinguished by the following language of the TTA release:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    Each Party hereto voluntarily and with full knowledge of its significance, expressly waives, releases and relinquishes any and all rights with respect to the 1998 License Agreement and/or the Cross-License Agreement it may have under any state or federal statute, rule or common law principle, in law or equity, relating to limitations on general releases, specifically under California Civil Code Section 1542 (or any other law or regulation of similar effect, in any jurisdiction), which provides as follows: \"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    (TTA at Section 7.12). NFM's reliance on this provision is misplaced.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    When the language in this provision is parsed, it simply means that the parties release any rights they may have \"relating to limitations on general releases.\" The TTA, by way of illustration, cites to California Civil Code Section 1542, which limits general releases from extending to claims unknown at the time of the agreement. As WEL aptly argues in rebuttal, \"[t]he purpose of this language is clear and unambiguous: it enables the parties to\n    release both known and unknown claims arising under the License Agreement and Cross-License Agreement, as unknown claims cannot be released in some jurisdictions unless that right is waived explicitly.\" (ECF 57-1 (Pl.'s Br.) at 41). This Court agrees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    This Court finds that the plain language of Section 7.12 of the TTA clearly provides that the parties are releasing their rights relating to limitations on general releases. Section 7.12 cannot be read to state, as NFM suggests, that the parties are releasing\n    <em>\n     any and all\n    </em>\n    rights they have under the License and Cross-License Agreements, including WEL's rights to the use of its corporate name and logo.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    This Court further notes the context and circumstances of the execution of the TTA, as it relates to this issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bickings\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481305\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/82/402/#p406\">\n     82 F.Supp.2d at 406\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The TTA does not once mention or discuss any parties' rights to the corporate name and/or logo. Conversely, the Cross-License Agreement contained explicit language establishing the survival of the parties' rights in their respective use of the relevant trademarks. Specifically, Section 13.5 provided: \"The provisions of this Section 13 shall survive termination of the license under this Agreement and termination of any other provision herein.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at Section 13.5). Thus, given the plain and unambiguous language of Section 13.5, merely terminating the Cross-License Agreement was insufficient to extinguish any rights WEL had to the use of its corporate name and logo under the Agreement.\n    <footnotemark>\n     15\n    </footnotemark>\n    This context renders implausible NFM's contention that by executing the TTA, WEL intended to relinquish all of its rights to its corporate name, which it has used since 1958.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    For these reasons, summary judgment is granted in WEL's favor as to Counts I (declaratory judgment as to trademark infringement), II (violations of the Lanham Act), III (common law trademark infringement and unfair competition), and VII (unjust enrichment), of NFM's counterclaims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    <em>\n     Count VI of the Counterclaims - Turbulator Technology\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    At Count IV of the counterclaims, NFM seeks a declaration that certain \"disputed devices do not fall within the scope of the TTA's definition of Turbulator Technology and that NFM/Welding Engineers is not subject to any limitation or restriction in use of the devices, and WEL is not entitled to any royalty in relation [sic] NFM/Welding Engineers' use of such devices.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     16\n    </footnotemark>\n    Only WEL has moved for summary judgment as to this counterclaim. WEL argues that this counterclaim should be dismissed as not ripe under the Declaratory Judgment Act or, in the alternative, that it is entitled to summary judgment. As explained below, this Court disagrees with WEL as to both arguments, and concludes that this issue is ripe and that WEL is not entitled to summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The Declaratory Judgment Act creates a remedy by which federal courts \"may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration\" when there is a \"case of actual controversy.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, the dispute between the parties must be ripe for judicial intervention; it cannot be \"nebulous or contingent,\" but \"must have taken on fixed and final shape so that a court can see what legal issues it is deciding, what effect its decision will have on the adversaries, and some useful purpose to be achieved in deciding them.\"\n    <em>\n     Pub.

Clearly, the parties have adverse legal interests regarding the Turbulator Technology. NFM has alleged an actual dispute between the parties as to whether certain devices fall within the TTA's definition of Turbulator Technology, and whether NFM is required to pay royalties for the sale of those devices. This dispute is prevalent in that NFM is currently paying royalties under protest. The Court also finds that the issue lends itself to a conclusive judgment as there are concrete factual issues to be resolved,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , whether or not the disputed devices fall within the scope of Turbulator Technology. Finally, such a declaratory judgment would have utility to the parties in resolving any royalty dispute. Accordingly, this issue is ripe for adjudication under the Declaratory Judgment Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    With regard to WEL's merits argument, the Court concludes that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the disputed devices fall into the TTA's definition of Turbulator Technology, namely, a device invented and developed by WEL that meets the other relevant criteria.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cloverland-Green Spring Dairies, Inc. v.

As such, WEL's motion for summary judgment as to Count IV of NFM's counterclaims is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    <em>\n     Count VI of the Counterclaims - HIP Barrels\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    At Count VI of the counterclaims, NFM seeks two declarations;\n    <em>\n     to wit\n    </em>\n    : (1) that WEL is not permitted to offer HIP barrels to customers, \"as it is a proprietary technology used on NFM/Welding Engineers' counter-rotating twin screw extruders both inside and outside the field of use as described in the TTA\"; and (2) that NFM is entitled to sell HIP barrels to any customer in any \"field of use.\" Only WEL has moved for summary judgment on this counterclaim. As to the first requested declaration, WEL apparently concedes that the issue is ripe, arguing only that it\n    is entitled to summary judgment on the merits. WEL argues that the second requested declaration should be dismissed as not ripe under the Declaratory Judgment Act or, in the alternative, that it is entitled to summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The TTA expressly excluded barrels manufactured with HIP technology from the scope of the \"Purchased Technology\" that WEL acquired from NFM. (TTA at 1.1.7). The issues raised by NFM's counterclaims, however, revolve around the import of this exclusion as it relates to the parties' respective rights to HIP barrel technology.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    As to the first requested declaration-that WEL is not permitted to offer HIP barrels to its customers-WEL \"does not dispute that NFM's drawings of HIP barrels were excluded from the scope of transfer effected by the TTA, but certainly disputes that NFM has cornered the market on HIP barrel technology.\" (ECF 57-1 at 56). As such, WEL argues that it is permitted under the TTA to sell HIP barrels. These disputes have not been factually flushed out in the parties' motions. As with the Turbulator Technology dispute, this Court concludes that genuine issues of material fact exist as to what, if any, HIP barrel technology NFM may preclude WEL from selling. Accordingly, WEL's motion for summary judgment is denied on the first requested declaration in counterclaim VI.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    As to the second requested declaration-that NFM is entitled to sell HIP barrels to any customer in any \"field of use\"-WEL argues that the request should be dismissed as not ripe under the Declaratory Judgment Act, contending that \"[f]actual determinations such as the type of HIP barrel sold, to whom, and for what use are just examples of facts that would be needed in order for the court to adjudicate any such dispute.\" (ECF 57-1 at 57). This Court disagrees, and concludes that the matter is in fact ripe, given that the parties have adverse legal interests, the Court can issue a conclusive judgment, and such a judgment would have utility to the parties.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Step-Saver Data Sys.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047170\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/912/643/#p647\">\n     912 F.2d at 647\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As to WEL's request for summary judgment, this Court deems that the same issues WEL cited in arguing that the dispute is not ripe-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , factual determinations regarding the type of HIP barrel sold, to whom, and for what purpose-are genuine issues of material fact which preclude summary judgment. Accordingly, WEL's motion is denied with regard to the second requested declaration in Count VI of NFM's counterclaims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      NFM'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <em>\n     WEL's Counts I and II\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    As noted, at Count I, WEL claims that NFM breached the TTA by failing to provide WEL with the drawings. At Count II, WEL requests a declaratory judgment that such breach is material and, therefore, the \"limited license agreements\" referenced in the TTA should be terminated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    In its motion for summary judgment as to these two counts, NFM simply contends that it did not breach the TTA. As discussed above, this Court has concluded that NFM did breach the TTA when it failed to provide the drawings. On that basis, this Court granted WEL's motion for summary judgment as to WEL's request for specific performance on the breach-of-contract claim at Count I. Since the issue of a breach of contract has been decided, NFM's motion for summary judgment as to Count I (with regard to specific performance only), and Count II, is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    <em>\n     Damages for Breach of Contract\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    NFM moves for summary judgment on WEL's request for compensatory damages for the breach-of-contract claim, arguing that WEL has not provided any evidence of damages. In response, WEL asserts that it \"[h]as [p]roperly [p]led [d]amages,\" (ECF 61 at 9); that damages are easily identifiable; and that, at the very least, it is entitled to nominal damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    A party cannot overcome a motion for summary judgment with respect to damages by merely relying on pleadings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Berckeley Inv.

WEL's motion for summary judgment is denied as to its request for damages at Count I of its complaint, and as to Counts IV, V, and VI of the counterclaims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    NFM's motion for summary judgment is granted as to WEL's request for damages at Count I of its complaint. NFM is also granted summary judgment as to its request at Count V of the counterclaims for declaratory judgment that WEL is not entitled to drawings of the vertical feeder. NFM's motion for summary judgment is denied as to WEL's request at Count I of its complaint for specific performance of the relevant external documents; as to Count II of WEL's complaint; and as to Counts I, II, and III of the counterclaims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Separate Orders addressing each motion for summary judgment and consistent with this Memorandum Opinion follow.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"15\">\n    <p id=\"p-108\">\n     NFM argues that the TTA extinguished all of WEL's rights under the License Agreement to WEL's corporate name and logo because the TTA contained language stating it \"supersedes all prior agreements\" and that the License and Cross-License Agreements were terminated by its execution. This conclusion is clearly incorrect, given the language of Section 13.5 of the Cross-License Agreement.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"16\">\n    <p id=\"p-109\">\n     The TTA defines Turbulator Technology as \"a proprietary device invented and developed by [WEL] which integrates a cylindrical cutter and cylindrical die (fixed or variable), a pelletizer and a transport system of the comminuted particles either by air or another fluid.\" (TTA at Section 1.1.8). In the TTA, WEL granted NFM licenses to use the Turbulator Technology for work related to spare parts for Exxon Mobil Corporation and/or its affiliates, as well as another set of companies, in exchange for royalties. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at Section 4.4).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"17\">\n    <p id=\"p-110\">\n     With regard to Count II, this Court notes that the parties did not brief whether NFM's breach was material, or whether termination of the limited license agreements is an available remedy under the TTA. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     TTA at Section 7.1 (providing that, in the event of a breach, the available remedies \"shall be limited to a claim for actual damages and/or a possible injunctive relief or temporary restraining order, but neither party shall be entitled to any other equitable relief, including, but not limited to rescission, revocation or other similar remedy.\") ). Accordingly, this Court will not address these issues.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
