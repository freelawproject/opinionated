Plaintiffs Motion to Stay Proceedings 1-5 (Oct. 18, 2018), Doc. No. 53 (\"Mot. to Stay\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this action challenging Commerce's decision to not initiate an anti-circumvention inquiry with respect to the AD/CVD orders on hardwood plywood from China. Complaint, Doc. No. 9 (May 2, 2018). Commerce subsequently initiated a separate anti-circumvention inquiry concerning the same AD/CVD orders with respect to a subset of the merchandise covered by Plaintiff's request for an inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Certain Hardwood Plywood Products from China: Initiation of Anti-Circumvention Inquiry on the Antidumping Duty and Countervailing Duty Orders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2047%2C883\">\n    83 Fed.

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11911276,969381\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/1413/\">\n    124 F.3d 1413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1416 (Fed. Cir. 1997). A moving party must make out a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay will damage someone else.\n   <em>\n    Landis v. North American Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/#p255\">\n    299 U.S. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 255,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/#p255\">\n    57 S.Ct. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/#p255\">\n    81 L.Ed. 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1936) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tak Fat Trading Co. v.

Mot. to Stay at 3. Further, they contend that a stay would not cause harm to any party and would promote judicial economy and efficiency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20CIT%201376\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court is not persuaded. Plaintiffs fail to meet the standard for a stay because they merely attempt to show that no harm would result from the stay, rather than presenting a clear showing of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward. Plaintiffs ground their argument on a likelihood that their desire to proceed in this action may change. But this possibility does not rise to the standard of clear hardship or inequity from having to go forward with the litigation. Moreover, the outcome of the administrative proceeding is uncertain and a stay will likely delay the resolution of this action. Thus, absent a strong showing that a stay is necessary, plaintiffs request must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Accordingly, upon consideration of the motion to stay filed by plaintiffs, defendant's response in opposition thereto, and all other pertinent papers in this action, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that plaintiff's motion to stay is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
