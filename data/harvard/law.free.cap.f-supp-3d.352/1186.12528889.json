Plaintiff brings two constitutional claims for false arrest/detention and excessive force against Deputy Hernandez (Doc. 29, \u00b6\u00b6 42-50), and two state-law claims for false arrest/detention and battery against the Orange County Sheriff in his official capacity (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-60). Defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting qualified immunity for the claims against Deputy Hernandez and other defenses for the state-law claims. (Doc. 37 (\"\n   <strong>\n    Motion\n   </strong>\n   \").) Plaintiff, now proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 36), did not respond. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 38.) This Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's \"Best Case\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The evening of Thursday, August 21, 2014 started off like any other for Plaintiff Chantale Oniasse, Pastor at Source of Life Church in the Pine Hills area of Orlando. (Doc. 40-1, pp. 110:24-111:25.) The church was holding its weekly evening service, where congregants gathered anytime after 8:30 p.m. to worship. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104:23-105:12.) Service could include midnight prayer or dancing, with musicians performing and parishioners singing along. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105:4-12, 154:4-10:18-20.) This often lasted well into the night and \"got loud.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On a given night, between eighty or ninety people could filter through, and on August 21, 2014, in the ten o'clock hour, around 15-20 congregants were present. (Doc. 40-2, p. 230:4-232:16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sometime in that hour, a woman entered the church in an \"aggravated\" state. (Doc. 37-2, pp. 8:7, 9:12-10:19.) Pastor Oniasse believed she was \"drunk and violent.\" (Doc. 40-2, p. 152:11.) In tow was her five-year-old daughter. (Doc. 37-2, pp. 6:18-20, 9:18.) The woman lived across the street from the church and sought to complain about the noise at behest of her octogenarian grandmother. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:6-8, 7:11-8:17.) So she walked in, through the lobby to the sanctuary where service was taking place and started asking those present to turn the music down and stop being loud. (Doc. 40-2, pp. 152:13-21, 153:10-11; Doc. 37-2, pp. 8:12-17, 9:21-10:3.) Screaming, the woman told the parishioners she was going to unplug the music and microphones because of the noise. (Doc. 40-2, p. 157:14-23.) The woman was later identified as Sandra Ray Burnham (\"\n   <strong>\n    Ms. Ray\n   </strong>\n   \"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 179.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When Ms. Ray first came in, Pastor Oniasse was in the church office with her son. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152:13-21, 153:10-11.) The usher posted in the lobby knocked on the office door and alerted Pastor Oniasse that a woman came into the sanctuary distracting the service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pastor Oniasse then left the office and went into the sanctuary, where she saw Ms. Ray in the front with her daughter \"screaming\" about the noise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On seeing Ms. Ray \"acting up,\" Pastor Oniasse instructed another churchgoer, Witlan Saint Hilaire (\"\n   <strong>\n    Witlan\n   </strong>\n   \") to dial 9-1-1. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 154:21-155:3.) Pastor Oniasse sought police intervention because the church couldn't \"handle\" Ms. Ray and a police officer was \"the only person who can stop [Ms. Ray] from coming inside\" and intruding on the service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She told Witlan to report to the police that someone came into their church \"in the front trying to make chaos,\" and have the police \"pick her up or remove her.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 155:14-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to Pastor Oniasse, Ms. Ray then left the church because her daughter was crying. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 155:24, 161.) She came back about ten minutes later because the music hadn't stopped. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 161:19-25.) The second time, Ms. Ray was restricted to the lobby, as the doors to the sanctuary were closed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162:2-4.) When she came back, Ms. Oniasse reports that she told Ms. Ray the police had been called, and Ms. Ray responded by taking out her cell phone to snap a picture of Ms. Oniasse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164:18-165:7, 166.) The two exchanged words, and Ms. Ray threw her phone at Ms. Oniasse before running away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 166.) Pastor Oniasse instructed Witlan to call the police again; when she did, the dispatcher told Witlan that there was an officer in the area who was supposed to come after the first call but was taking longer than expected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174:3-10.) Pastor Oniasse and Witlan moved outside to wait for the police. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 167:24-168:10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Ray returned a third time, asking for her phone back while Pastor Oniasse and Witlan were standing outside the church. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 166-68.) Pastor Oniasse responded that she wasn't going to return the phone until the police came; she kept it so the police would know Ms. Ray was the person who came into the church. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Ray left again, and they stayed outside, waiting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 170:16-17.) Some minutes passed until a police officer-Deputy Hernandez-approached the two women standing outside. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178:16-179:23.) Pastor Oniasse recalled other people there as well: her son and two other parishioners, Carline and Evonett. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185:22-187:12.) Without saying anything, Deputy Hernandez went up to Witlan and grabbed her arm to handcuff her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178:16-179:23.) Witlan immediately reacted by saying it wasn't her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Deputy Hernandez asked, \"who have altercation with Sandra? [sic], who has the problem with Sandra?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Pastor Oniasse responded that she did, so Deputy Hernandez took his handcuffs and grabbed her arms to place them behind her back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At once, Pastor Oniasse started talking to Deputy Hernandez, asking him how he was arresting her when she was the one who called the police based on a woman coming into the church. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180:13-21.) Specifically, she recounted saying, \"sir, I was the one who called you. I'm in my church. Why would I be the one who get arrested and Sandra is the one to come in out church to do - to make the scene and you are arresting me?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 181:6-13.) Deputy Hernandez then started getting aggressive with her after handcuffing her, pushing her \"violently.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180:19-21, 181: 6-13.) At no point did he answer her questions, tell her she was under arrest, or recite her\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 181:14-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the same time, the others outside started protesting Deputy Hernandez's actions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182-89.) Witlan told him that his actions weren't \"right\"-they called the cops and now he was arresting her pastor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182:15-183:19.) As did Evonett, who immediately said to Deputy Hernandez, that's not right, you can't do that, don't arrest my pastor, she didn't do anything. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185:22-187:12.) Carline started screaming and crying, saying it's not fair and that Deputy Hernandez couldn't do this. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183:20-184:14.) Similarly, Pastor Oniasse's son started crying while trying to talk to Deputy Hernandez, pleading, don't arrest my mom, don't kill my mom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 184:15-185:11.) Yet Deputy Hernandez \"didn't listen\" to anyone, even though all present let him know that they were the ones who placed the call into the police and it wasn't fair to now arrest Pastor Oniasse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 187:12, 188:17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Those outside were soon joined by additional parishioners, as after Deputy Hernandez handcuffed Pastor Oniasse, Witlan went inside and told the congregation what was happening. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 190:4-10.) The group outside voiced the same concerns to Deputy Hernandez, who started leading Pastor Oniasse away from the church to his vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 187:18-21, 190:11-191:2.) While they were walking, Pastor Oniasse reported that Hernandez cursed at her, telling her to walk faster and telling the crowd to stop following them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 192:19-193:8.) He said to the crowd, \"shut up, shut up, you black nigger,\" telling them he'd shoot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 193:12-14, 194:2-6, 195-196:1.) He said the same to Pastor Oniasse, who he pushed more and told to walk faster as the others came out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198:18-199:20.) Pastor Oniasse then fell on her knees because of a \"big dip\" in the church parking lot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 200:13-21, 202:18-203:3.) Deputy Hernandez pulled her off the ground by her handcuffs to keep walking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 203:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As they came to cross the street, Pastor Oniasse instructed the others to not follow them across. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 205:7-206:1.) They walked up to Deputy Hernandez's vehicle, he opened the door and pushed her in the backseat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 219:16-220:3.) Even though her left leg was still outside the vehicle, he began closing the car door and hitting her leg with the car door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 219:16-220:3.) All this time, Deputy Hernandez was cursing at Pastor Oniasse, telling her, \"put your mother fucking feet inside, you black bitch.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 222:1-2.) She told him she couldn't, and he responded by saying, \"I'll put your mother fucking feet inside,\" and pushed her feet with his shoe inside the car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 222:2-10.) He then left her inside the car without air conditioning on. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 222:17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By then, the crowd of 15-20 parishioners had gathered on the grass by the church, not by the car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 233:9-24.) Pastor Oniasse noticed additional blue lights from other patrol cars once she was placed in the car, a sight which brought her relief that someone would hear her side of the story. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 234:4-25.) The supervisor emerged from his car, and Witlan spoke with him, telling him that Pastor Oniasse was inside Deputy Hernandez's car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 235:1-23.) The supervisor approached the car, opened the door, and took off Pastor Oniasse's handcuffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 235:15-23.) With the arrival of these other officers, according to Pastor Oniasse, Deputy Hernandez was put in another police car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 237:11-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After being released, Pastor Oniasse spoke to the supervisor and other officer present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 238:7-25.) She explained to them that she didn't know why she was arrested and Deputy Hernandez didn't read her her rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The supervisor told her that Deputy Hernandez called in a confirmed armed robbery so that's why all the police officers showed up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She asked how could she have robbed Ms. Ray, as Pastor Oniasse was in her church. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 238:14-22.) The supervisor responded, \"well, he's new,\" referring to Deputy Hernandez. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 238:23-239:4.) He asked Pastor Oniasse where Ms. Ray's phone was, and she told him it was on the table in the lobby. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 279:11-280:16.) He then had Deputy Hernandez come out and apologize to her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 238:2-239:10.) In front of the supervisor and other officer, Deputy Hernandez issued his apology, saying, \"I'm sorry for what happened.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 241:4-24.) She told him he mistreated her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 241:4-242:10.) She also told the officers she wanted to press charges against Ms. Ray for disrupting the services and throwing the phone at her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 271:1-23.) The supervisor asked Pastor Oniasse to write a report, but she was shaking and couldn't write. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 243: 1-20.) The supervisor spoke to her more, telling her to calm\n   down and take a deep breath. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also told her \"they're very sorry for what happened to [her].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 243:12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The supervisor stayed on scene for a while to talk to everyone, and then everyone went inside. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 247:16-20.) The officers tried checking for footage from the church's security cameras, but they weren't working. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 280:11-25.) They then retrieved the phone from inside the church and left. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 280:11-25.) The night concluded with Pastor Oniasse going inside, ending service, and then going home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 247:21-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At home, Pastor Oniasse felt pain in her shoulders and went to the emergency room the next day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 251:1-20.) Her knee also acted up following this event, so she went to the hospital and was given crutches. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 261.) Some time later, the State Attorney's office phoned her, asking if she'd like to continue proceedings against Ms. Ray. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 271:24-273:14.) She told them that she wasn't interested in pursuing charges against Ms. Ray; rather, she sought to press charges against Deputy Hernandez for \"bullying [her] like [an] animal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 272:11-20.) But when the State Attorney's office called again, she told them not to call anymore. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 272:24-273:14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Deputy Hernandez's Version\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to Deputy Hernandez, the events that evening unfolded quite differently. The Court recites his version, keeping in mind that where his story conflicts with Pastor Oniasse's sworn deposition testimony, the Court accepts Pastor Oniasse's at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Battle v. Bd. of Regents\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8454542\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/755/#p759\">\n    468 F.3d 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 759 (11th Cir. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 21, 2014, Deputy Hernandez was assigned to patrol the Pine Hills area of Orlando for the midnight shift. (Doc. 37-1, 7:19, 12:4-17.) At this time, he was three-and-a-half months out from riding along with a field training officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:4-7.) He had a \"zone partner\" patrolling the same area but was alone in his vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:14-20.) His supervisor that night was Corporal Irizarry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:8-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   While on patrol, a call came in about a disturbance reporting a suspicious person at the Source of Life Church, which Deputy Hernandez took. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:8-12.) As he was en route there, another call came in reporting a possible robbery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25: 15-16.) The dispatcher announced via radio that a robbery had just occurred, \"a complaint of a female of a cell phone,\" given \"Code 3\" priority at \"2254\" hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:8-21.) As Code 3 meant the highest priority, Deputy Hernandez responded to the report by telling the dispatcher to \"break [him] from his previous call\" and route him to the robbery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:24-14:25;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:12-18.) Two other officers radioed in, Deputy Matthew Bishop and Corporal Irizarry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:4-25.) The dispatcher let them know \"that the suspect is a [sic] the street at the church. The female grabbed the phone from the complaint [sic].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15:17-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Immediately after, Deputy Bishop asked whether \"she still [had] eyes on the suspect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:3-4.) The dispatcher couldn't answer (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6), and Deputy Bishop said, \"It might be related to that 13 p 134a that I was going to. It's right around the corner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18: 20-22;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:7-9, 17:4-5, 18:8-10.) Translated, Deputy Bishop radioed that the robbery call \"may be related to the other call\n   [Deputy Hernandez] was going to\"-the \"suspicious person\" from the church Deputy Hernandez was responding to when the robbery call came in. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:8-9, 18-19.) So Deputy Hernandez knew going in that these two calls were \"possibly\" related, and their relation was confirmed when he \"got on scene.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:23-26:6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On arrival at Ms. Ray's house, Deputy Hernandez radioed in. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:4-12.) He went to her first, not the church, because \"[his] priority was the robbery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:18.) There he spoke with Ms. Ray and recalls her telling him:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   That she went in there because her mother was complaining about the noise that was going on in church... She went in there and when she was leaving, she was trying to take a picture. She said she was pushed down, or she was pushed, like body against body, and then when she turned around to take a picture of the pastor, the pastor snatched the phone out of her hand and didn't allow her to take a picture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:12-20.) He asked her why she went to the church and she admitted it was to \"confront them about the music being played and if they could turn it down.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After Deputy Hernandez checked in that he was on scene, Corporal Irizarry asked him for a confirmation of \"what we have.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:20-21:2.) Deputy Hernandez responded that there was a confirmed robbery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Deputy Hernandez also told dispatch to \"dupe the calls,\"-\"link the calls together\"-because \"[Ms. Ray] was the suspect from the other call.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:18-42:8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   41:18-44:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After speaking to Ms. Ray outside her house, Deputy Hernandez asked her to take him to the church so she could \"show [him] where she last saw the suspect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:22-23.) In so doing, he elected to act without waiting for backup to arrive, two other officers were on their way (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:20-29:1); and without going to the church first to ask them what happened, despite knowing the church placed the first 9-1-1 call reporting Ms. Ray (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:24-23:10; 41-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As Deputy Hernandez and Ms. Ray walked to the church, Deputy Hernandez saw \"two black females\" outside. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:2-7, 31:11-12.) He described his reaction as \"oh, look. Here's one half. Here's the other half\"-the halves being the two 9-1-1 calls he was responding to. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:13-14.) So when they reached the women, Deputy Hernandez didn't greet them by asking what happened. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:10-14.) Rather, the three women started arguing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:14-15.) Deputy Hernandez responded by turning to Witlan-the other black woman present-and saying, \"Turn around and put your hands behind your back\" to arrest her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:12-18.) He did this without talking to either woman standing there, asking Ms. Ray to identify a suspect, or seeing Ms. Ray's phone anywhere. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:5-17.) Instead, his immediate reaction on approaching the two black women outside the church was to arrest one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35:5-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After Deputy Hernandez attempted to handcuff Witlan, he recalled that Ms. Ray said, \"She's not the one.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:16-18.) Deputy Hernandez then contended that Pastor Oniasse moved her right hand and he saw her holding a cell phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:21-25.) So he immediately handcuffed Pastor Oniasse without inquiry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:7-9.) Deputy Hernandez did not tell her she was under arrest but \"told her she was being detained,\" as he intended \"[t]o continue further investigating the crime.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:14-15.) To that end, he recalled his investigatory plan as \"to read her her Miranda and ... ask her certain questions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:16-20.) Yet he did no such thing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:22.) Instead, once he handcuffed\n   Pastor Oniasse, Deputy Hernandez began walking her directly to his car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:8-10.) He recalled multiple people following them, telling him he was being recorded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:8-10.) He said he told them, \"That's fine. Just take a step back.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:12-13.) According to Deputy Hernandez, at no point did Pastor Oniasse have difficulty walking across the parking lot or fall, and there was no trouble getting her in his vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-40.) Indeed, he never pushed her or closed the vehicle's door on her legs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39.) Also, the vehicle's air conditioning was on when he placed Pastor Oniasse in the backseat, and she was only in the car for eight minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:16-41:3.) Deputy Hernandez denied ever putting his hand on his holster and telling the crowd that if they didn't back up, he'd take out his gun; or threatening to shoot anyone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:18-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the time Deputy Hernandez put Pastor Oniasse in his vehicle, Captain McMullen had arrived on scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53:23-54:10.) Together, they controlled the crowd off the road and then went over to Captain McMullen's vehicle to debrief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:7-10.) Deputy Hernandez \"explained to [Captain McMullen] what [he] did,\" and Captain McMullen responded by \"encourag[ing Hernandez] to further investigate the crime.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:10-15.) In his deposition, Deputy Hernandez did not go into what happened next, but his affidavit relayed that Pastor Oniasse \"was released and unsecured from [his] patrol car, at which time [he] furthered [his] investigation.\" (Doc. 37-4, \u00b6 6.) The affidavit said that Pastor Oniasse \"then provided an account of Ms. Ray entering the church and disturbing their service by yelling and screaming,\" and expressed interest in prosecuting Ms. Ray. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Ray also provided a \"written statement\" and \"subsequently expressed the desire not to see [Pastor] Oniasse prosecuted for the crime of robbery,\" so she signed a \"Declaration of Intent form to memorialize her change of sentiment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Ultimately, no charges were filed against Pastor Oniasse, but a trespass warning was issued against Ms. Ray and \"[c]harges were filed with the State Attorney's Office on Ms. Ray for disturbing a school or religious assembly and simple battery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The next day, Corporal Irizarry sent an e-mail to his supervisors about this event. (Doc. 37-1, p. 46:14-19.) And although Deputy Hernandez couldn't recall its context, his 2014 yearly evaluation included a comment under \"Judgment and Decision Making\" that \"[t]here were times where Deputy Hernandez rushed to judgment and only took the call for face value.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:17-7:9, 8:2-11.) Deputy Hernandez now works for the Orlando Police Department as a patrol officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:11-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Ms. Ray's Version\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ms. Ray's version of events mirrors Deputy Hernandez's. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 37-2.) Still, the Court recaps her account of that night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Ms. Ray lives across the street from the Source of Life Church with her young daughter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:6-8, 7:16-19.) At the time of this incident, her grandmother lived next door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:18-24.) And before August 21, 2014, Ms. Ray had frequently phoned the police to make noise complaints about the church's evening services-\"about 12, 13 times.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:22.) So on that day, something snapped and Ms. Ray decided to take matters into her own hands. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:24-58:15.) Earlier that evening, she had been drinking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:25-27:2.) When the music started getting \"very loud\" after 10:00 p.m. she took her daughter and walked over to the church, per her grandmother's request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8:7-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   She walked into the church, down a long hallway to a group of people standing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:21-25.) In an aggravated, nervous state, she asked them to \"turn this down.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:24, 10:4-10.) She said they \"pushed her in this room where these people were like flopping around like fish or something, on the floor,\" which \"was just very loud and very strange.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:25-10:3.) There, Ms. Ray said Pastor Oniasse pushed her so she \"told [her] daughter to run and tell her grandmother to call 9-1-1.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:17-18.) Her daughter left so Ms. Ray, \"trying to get out of there,\" tried to \"pocket call\" 9-1-1 with her phone still in her pocket (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:23-25.) As she backed out of the room, she took her phone out to snap a picture of Pastor Oniasse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:17-12:2, 18:9-21:11.) When she did so, Ms. Ray recalled that Pastor Oniasse grabbed it and scratched her hands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:12-17.) To that, Ms. Ray \"was like, 'Give me my phone back.' [a]nd ... just got the heck out of there and went to my grandma's.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She then called 9-1-1 from her grandmother's house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On that 9-1-1 call, Ms. Ray told the dispatcher that she already called 9-1-1 about the church and the lady that pushed her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:18-23.) She reported that her daughter went with her across the street and a lady took her phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:1-26:19, 27:13-28:16.) She specifically told the dispatcher that \"[the lady] stole my phone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   While she was on the phone, Deputy Hernandez arrived on the scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:21-29:4.) She recalled telling him what happened and him asking her if she wanted to prosecute the person who took her phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:14-21.) But he didn't ask her to describe the appearance of the person who took her phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:7-9.) They then \"went to get [her] phone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:22-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Walking up to the church, Ms. Ray recalled seeing \"[t]wo females, one being [Pastor] Oniasse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31:13-18.) When they arrived, Ms. Ray remembered Deputy Hernandez \"was going to put the handcuffs on the other lady.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   32:7-21.) So Ms. Ray said, \"That's not her. It's her,\" pointing to Pastor Oniasse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:7-15.) She recalled that both women were black and it was dark, so \"they all looked alike to [her].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:16-21;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 68:10-69:9.) According to Ms. Ray, Pastor Oniasse \"said she had [Ms. Ray's] phone,\" and Ms. Ray saw Pastor Oniasse \"in possession\" of her phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:11-20.) Somehow Deputy Hernandez got the phone and then told Ms. Ray to go back across the street because of the crowd, who she claimed were \"ranting and raving.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:13-16.) So she left, back to her grandmother's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:17-22.) \"[C]haos\" ensued, as \"everybody was screaming and yelling and videoing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:14-35:1.) She didn't see Deputy Hernandez handcuff Pastor Oniasse or place her in his vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:21-24, 35:19-36:1.) She recalled hearing him telling the crowd to back up and stay away, but didn't remember: (1) hearing him use profanity or racial slurs; (2) Deputy Hernandez drawing his gun at the crowd; (3) him threatening to shoot; (4) seeing Pastor Oniasse fall; (5) or Deputy Hernandez using any force on Pastor Oniasse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:9-41:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   During \"all the chaos,\" another officer arrived and the situation defused. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:20-44:1.) \"[E]verything had changed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:1.) The arriving officer spoke to Deputy Hernandez and came to talk to Ms. Ray. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:4-11.) They both told her that she \"could get in trouble for going on the property, and that [Pastor Oniasse]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   was going to press charges against [Ms. Ray] for going on the property, unless [Ms. Ray] drop[ped] the charges for her taking the phone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:4-9.) In her words, \"everything had just changed and then everybody's calming down.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:9-11.) The tables were turned-because the \"other higher ranking officer appeared,\" Ms. Ray was \"now the subject of a potential criminal charge ... whereas before, when [she] interacted with Deputy Hernandez, it was directed towards [Pastor] Oniasse being the subject of the criminal charge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:16-47:2.) That officer told Ms. Ray that she was \"not allowed to go over [to the church], at any reason [sic].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:5-8.) Since she had gone onto the property, that officer told Ms. Ray that she \"was going to go to jail\"-Pastor Oniasse would press charges if Ms. Ray didn't drop the robbery charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:10-16.) In the end, Ms. Ray dropped the charges, after which Deputy Hernandez returned her phone to her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:10-48:19.) Ms. Ray \"was done.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48:17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    D. This Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This action originated in state court on May 8, 2017 with Pastor Oniasse, then represented by counsel, bringing three claims against Deputy Hernandez. (Doc. 2.) After answering (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 3), Deputy Hernandez removed the action to this Court on July 6, 2017 on the basis of federal-question and supplemental jurisdiction. (Doc. 1.) Pastor Oniasse twice amended her complaint, now bringing claims against Deputy Hernandez and Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings in his official capacity. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 19, 29.) Following a failed attempt at mediation (Doc. 32), Pastor Oniasse's attorney successfully moved to withdraw from representation, citing irreconcilable differences. (Docs. 33, 35, 36.) Pastor Oniasse hasn't acquired new representation since, and following Defendants' Motion, failed to submit a response, despite the Court issuing a\n   <em>\n    Milburn\n   </em>\n   order granting her additional response time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 38.) Thus, the Motion is ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. 29, \u00b6\u00b6 42-50.) She also brings state-law claims for battery and false arrest/detention against Sheriff Demings in his official capacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-60.) For the federal claims, Defendants invoke the protection of qualified immunity, claiming that the force Deputy Hernandez used was reasonable under the circumstances and that Deputy Hernandez had actual probable cause to arrest Pastor Oniasse. (Doc. 37, pp. 9-22.) For the state claims, Defendants point out that Pastor Oniasse failed to provide presuit notice as required to pursue these claims, so they are time-barred; and the claims also fail because Deputy Hernandez's actions were reasonable and supported by probable cause.

Defendants base this conclusion on these facts they offer from the record: (1) Deputy Hernandez was dispatched to Ms. Ray's grandmother's house to investigate a robbery call; (2) on arrival, Deputy Hernandez spoke to Ms. Ray, and she told him that she walked over to the church and that when she tried taking a picture of Pastor Oniasse, Pastor Oniasse pushed her down and stole her phone; (3) Deputy Hernandez walked to the church where Ms. Ray positively identified Pastor Oniasse; and (4) Pastor Oniasse admitted she was involved in an altercation with Ms. Ray. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Now, if this sequence of events were all that happened on August 21, 2014, surely Defendants would establish the existence of arguable probable cause. But it's not. Defendants' picture leaves an unfinished canvas-when the full palette is used, a pointillistic portrait emerges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The record before this Court, viewed in\n   Plaintiff's favor, establishes the following:\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While on patrol in the Pine Hills area on August 21, 2014, Deputy Hernandez first received a call from the Source of Life Church about a suspicious person-a white woman who came storming into the church, disrupting evening service. Deputy Hernandez took the call. While en route to respond, another call came in about a robbery near the church-a woman reported her cell phone had been stolen by someone in the church. Deputy Hernandez heard the call and told the dispatcher to \"break him\" from the suspicious person call so he could take the robbery call. Once he did that, Deputy Bishop got on the radio to report that the two calls might be related, so Deputy Hernandez arrived on scene armed with that insight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Deputy Hernandez then went directly to Ms. Ray's house and spoke with her. She was safe. He took her with him across the street so she could identify the suspect. While walking, they both noticed two black females outside. Ms. Ray didn't identify either of them as the phone-grabber before she and Deputy Hernandez reached them. Once in front of the two women, Deputy Hernandez attempted to handcuff Witlan, the other black female. Witlan and Pastor Oniasse interjected, and Deputy Hernandez asked who had the altercation with Ms. Ray.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pastor Oniasse responded that she did. She was not holding Ms. Ray's phone at the time. Without saying or asking anything else, Deputy Hernandez handcuffed Pastor Oniasse and started leading her away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   When placing Pastor Oniasse in his vehicle, Deputy Hernandez's supervisor arrived on scene-Captain McMullen. They controlled the crowd together, and Captain McMullen asked Deputy Hernandez what he had done. Deputy Hernandez told him, and Captain McMullen informed him that more investigation was needed. Captain McMullen then released Pastor Oniasse from custody. He spoke to Pastor Oniasse to hear what happened, along with Deputy Bishop who had joined the scene. They apologized to Pastor Oniasse, told her that Deputy Hernandez was new, and asked her if she wanted to press charges against Ms. Ray. They also talked to Ms. Ray, informing her that she wasn't supposed to go in the church and could go to jail for her actions. The evening concluded with charges filed against Ms. Ray, not Pastor Oniasse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   With this, the Court finds that the totality of the circumstances do not favor Deputy Hernandez's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cozzi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517200\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1288/#p1293\">\n    892 F.3d at 1294-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, a reasonable officer in Deputy Hernandez's circumstances, possessing the same knowledge, could not have believed that probable cause existed to arrest Pastor Oniasse for robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, on this record, Deputy Hernandez \"chose to ignore information that ha[d] been offered to him\" and \"elected not to obtain easily discoverable facts\" before handcuffing and detaining Pastor Oniasse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kingsland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2190374\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/1220/#p1229\">\n    382 F.3d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Several facts drive this conclusion home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For starters, Deputy Hernandez ignored the relation between the calls. This is something a reasonable officer would not have done (and actually didn't because Deputy Bishop pointed this out on the radio). This connection was critical to understanding what happened leading up to the alleged robbery-that the person who claimed her phone was stolen had just gone into the church to complain and was told to leave because the church called the police on her. Such knowledge adds quite the different tinge to Ms. Ray's account of events, certainly staining its reliability.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cozzi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517200\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1288/#p1293\">\n    892 F.3d at 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing officers' obligations to assess and establish the reliability of tips before acting on them, including from anonymous sources). But ignoring the first call allowed Deputy Hernandez to rely on Ms. Ray's account hook, line, and sinker. This enabled him to charge the two black women he saw outside Source of Life Church and indiscriminately attempt to handcuff one. In so doing, Deputy Hernandez's actions strayed from those of a reasonable officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   What's more, Deputy Hernandez elected not to obtain easily discoverable facts-Pastor Oniasse's account or Witlan's or anyone else on scene. According to Pastor Oniasse, all he asked was who had an \"altercation\" with Ms. Ray before handcuffing her-nothing about the earlier suspicious person call or Ms. Ray's cell phone, which Pastor Oniasse maintains she wasn't holding at the time. In Pastor Oniasse's version, Deputy Hernandez didn't ask Ms. Ray to identify the phone-grabber-it was Pastor Oniasse who volunteered herself as having the \"altercation\" with Ms. Ray after Deputy Hernandez attempted to handcuff her parishioner. And she did have the altercation-after all, Deputy Hernandez at that point knew Ms. Ray instigated the disturbance at the church. So all Deputy Hernandez had for \"probable cause\" at the time he handcuffed Pastor Oniasse was the 9-1-1 call, Ms. Ray's suspect account, and Pastor Oniasse's admission that she was involved in the earlier \"altercation.\" To the Court, such scant evidence belies arguable probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Last, that Deputy Hernandez acted unreasonably in handcuffing and detaining Pastor Oniasse in these circumstances is undergirded by the actions of the other officers who joined him on scene-they adopted the reverse approach, which was undoubtedly \"reasonable.\" Unlike Deputy Hernandez, they assessed the scene by releasing Pastor Oniasse from custody and speaking to her so she could recount the evening. They also spoke to Ms. Ray to hear her version. They asked whether security camera footage existed, spoke with everyone at the scene, looked for the phone, and asked both parties to submit written statements. Only then did they act-issuing a trespass warning against Ms. Ray and filing no charges against Pastor Oniasse. This tack was reasonable given the totality of these circumstances. Deputy Hernandez went his own way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   All in all, on this record, Deputy Hernandez elected to act fast without sufficient basis to support his actions. \"Under [binding] precedent, this failure was unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Cozzi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517200\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1288/#p1293\">\n    892 F.3d at 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Where a police officer 'unreasonably disregarded certain pieces of evidence to establish probable cause or arguable probable cause, ... reasonable officers in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as the [officer] could not have believed that probable cause existed to arrest the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517200\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/1288/#p1293\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original).

First, because Deputy Hernandez illegally arrested her, any force was excessive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 223-27.) At the same time, she admits that a crowd had formed outside, following Deputy Hernandez as he took her to his vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 198-200.) Deputy Hernandez disputes Pastor Oniasse's account, but the Court must view the record in Pastor Oniasse's favor.

And under the totality of these circumstances, as told by Pastor Oniasse, Deputy Hernandez's use of force was not excessive. Perhaps careless but still permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Sans question, Deputy Hernandez faced circumstances that were \"tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\"-with a crowd of unhappy (to say the least) parishioners chastising Deputy Hernandez for handcuffing their pastor. So to quickly secure her, Deputy Hernandez briskly walked Pastor Oniasse across the parking lot, where she fell in a dip. He picked her up, pushed her to keep moving, and placed her-albeit haphazardly-in the back of his vehicle. He then attempted to close the car door with her left leg lingering outside, so he pushed her leg in with his foot. There he left her, without air conditioning, while waiting for backup. When they arrived, she was released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Taking this all into account, the Court finds that Deputy Hernandez's use of force was not unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Nolin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457417\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/207/1253/#p1257\">\n    207 F.3d at 1257-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
