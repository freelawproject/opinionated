Varholak (Doc. # 36), wherein he permitted Sam C. Brown to intervene as an Intervenor Defendant (Doc. # 27). For the following reasons, this Court overrules Plaintiff's Objection and affirms Magistrate Judge Varholak's Order. The Order is incorporated herein by reference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) ; Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 23, 2017, Plaintiffs Eco-Site, LLC and T-Mobile West, LLC (\"Plaintiff T-Mobile\") brought an action under the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (\"TCA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against Defendant County of\n   Pueblo, Colorado, through its Board of County Commissioners (\"Defendant Board\"), for allegedly unlawfully denying Plaintiffs a special use permit to construct a wireless communications facility. (Doc. # 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 7, 2018, Sam Brown, a private citizen of and property owner in Pueblo, filed a Motion to Intervene as a defendant in the matter. (Doc. # 27.) Mr. Brown argued that his quiet enjoyment of his land and his property value will diminish if the Court orders Defendant Board to issue Plaintiffs a special use permit because his property is adjacent to the proposed site for the wireless communications facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) After both Plaintiffs opposed Mr. Brown's Motion to Intervene on May 25, 2018 (Doc. ## 30, 32), Mr. Brown filed a reply in support of intervention on June 4, 2018 (Doc. # 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 11, 2018, Magistrate Judge Varholak held a hearing on Mr. Brown's Motion to Intervene. (Doc. # 35.) Magistrate Judge Varholak subsequently concluded that Mr. Brown may intervene as a defendant as a matter of right and granted his Motion to Intervene on June 21, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. # 36 at 8.) Magistrate Judge Varholak therefore declined to address Mr. Brown's alternative argument regarding permissive intervention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) On June 22, 2018, Mr. Brown filed his Answer to Plaintiffs' Complaint (Doc. # 37), as Magistrate Judge Varholak had ordered (Doc. # 35 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff T-Mobile now objects to Magistrate Judge Varholak's conclusion that Mr. Brown may intervene as a matter of right. (Doc. ## 38, 40.) Plaintiff T-Mobile further argues that Mr. Brown may not permissively intervene in the matter. (Doc. # 40 at 16- 17.) Accordingly, it urges this Court to reverse Magistrate Judge Varholak's Order and deny Mr. Brown's Motion to Intervene.

DIRECT, SUBSTANTIAL, AND LEGALLY PROTECTABLE INTEREST RELATED TO THE PROPERTY IN DISPUTE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Magistrate Judge Varholak determined that Mr. Brown has a direct, substantial, and legally protectable interest in this matter because the construction of the wireless telecommunications facility will adversely impact the aesthetic and value of his property and that Mr. Brown therefore satisfies the second element of Rule 24(a)(2). (Doc. # 36 at 5.) Plaintiff T-Mobile objects to that determination and argues that neither aesthetics nor property value are legally protectable interests when evaluated in the context of Section 332. (Doc. # 40 at 9.) Further, Plaintiff T-Mobile asserts the cited legal authority in the Order is contrary to law and does not support this conclusion, primarily because the cited authority does not stem from Section 332 issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[T]he inquiry [for determining a legally protectable interest] is highly fact-specific, and the interest test is primarily a practical guide to disposing of lawsuits by involving as many apparently concerned persons as is compatible with efficiency and due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Utah Ass'n of Ctys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11091527\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/1246/#p1251\">\n    255 F.3d at 1251-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Tenth Circuit has not expressly addressed whether an applicant's interest must be protected by Section 332 of TCA when that applicant seeks to intervene in an action brought under that statute. Therefore, the Court looks to other persuasive authority, including other federal Circuit Courts of Appeals. For example, in a similar posture, the Ninth Circuit previously imposed a categorical prohibition of interested parties from intervening as a matter of right based on the merits of claims brought under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\").\n   <em>\n    Wilderness Soc. v. U.S. Forest Serv\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n    630 F.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1176 (9th Cir. 2011). Private parties and state and local government entities were prohibited from intervening as defendants in NEPA cases because the federal government was believed to be the only proper defendant in a NEPA governmental compliance action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n    at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The\n   rationale for this rule is that such parties lack a 'significantly protectable' interest warranting intervention of right ... because NEPA is a procedural statute that binds only the federal government.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n    at 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   However, after finding the prohibition was \"at odds with the text of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) and the standards ... appl[ied] in all other intervention of right cases,\" the Ninth Circuit abandoned the prohibition of private parties to a lawsuit when the statute governing the Plaintiff's claim focused on governmental compliance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n    at 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit reasoned that the prohibition \"mistakenly focuses on the underlying legal claim instead of the property or transaction that is the subject of the lawsuit. No part of Rule 24(a)(2)'s prescription engrafts a limitation on the intervention of right to parties liable to the plaintiffs on the same grounds as the defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n    at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit then \"clarified that a prospective intervenor's asserted interest\n   <strong>\n    need not be protected by the statute under which the litigation is brought\n   </strong>\n   to qualify as 'significantly protectable' under Rule 24(a)(2).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n    at 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted). Therefore, the Ninth Circuit changed the intervention inquiry to deciding whether \"the interest is protectable under\n   <strong>\n    some\n   </strong>\n   law,\" and whether \"there is a relationship between the legally protected interest and the claims at issue instead of prohibiting intervention on the merits of a specific claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court is persuaded by the Ninth Circuit's reasoning because like the Tenth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit interprets Rule 24\"broadly in favor of proposed intervenors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1179 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Utah Ass'n of Ctys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11091527\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/1246/#p1251\">\n    255 F.3d at 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff T-Mobile cites the interest inquiry in\n   <em>\n    Wilderness\n   </em>\n   to argue that Mr. Brown, as a private citizen, does not have a legally protectable interest in this case because Mr. Brown's interests will not add any further clarity or insight to its asserted claims, which are focused on the local government's compliance with the TCA. (Doc. # 40 at 8-11.) Plaintiff T-Mobile further argues that Section 332 of the TCA is \"a very specific provision of federal law\" that limits both local government authority and standing, therefore there is not a relationship between Mr. Brown's interests and the claims at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11091527\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/1246/#p1251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, Plaintiff T-Mobile fails to realize its argument is one that the Ninth Circuit expressly rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilderness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053799\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1173/#p1176\">\n    630 F.3d at 1178-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The interest inquiry is not whether Mr. Brown's interests will add value to the asserted underlying legal claims, but rather whether his interests are protected by some law and relate to the claims in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Applying this logic to the matter presently before the Court, Mr. Brown's asserted interest need only be protected by\n   <strong>\n    some\n   </strong>\n   law, instead of protected by Section 332. The Court therefore considers whether Mr. Brown's stated interests are protectable under \"some law.\" In Colorado, \"a complaining property owner ... has a legally protected interest in insulating its property\" that is subject to land use decisions that would diminish the value of their property from \"adverse effects\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs of Adams Cty. v.

Therefore, if the City's interest in maintaining the value of its property is legally protected, the [ ] test for standing has been met.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mr. Brown's asserted interests are, therefore, legally protectable under some law. As for the second prong of the interest inquiry, Mr. Brown's interests in his\n   land adjacent to the property in dispute demonstrate a relationship between his legally protected interests and the claims at issue. Accordingly, the Court finds Magistrate Judge Varholak's determination that Mr. Brown's stated interests are sufficient to satisfy the interest inquiry is not erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. IMPAIRED OR IMPEDED INTEREST\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After finding that Mr. Brown has legally protectable interests in this case, Magistrate Judge Varholak determined that the disposition of the case may impair or impede Mr. Brown's ability to protect his interests. (Doc. # 36 at 5-6.) Magistrate Judge Varholak reasoned that if Plaintiffs are successful in overturning Defendant Board's decision, then the wireless communications facility will be built, which may impair Mr. Brown's legally protected interests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Plaintiff T-Mobile objects to that conclusion and argues that Mr. Brown does not possess a legally protectable interest, so his interests will not be impaired as a result of the outcome of this case. (Doc. # 40 at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The applicant must establish that the disposition of the lawsuit \"may as a practical matter impair or impede [his] ability to protect [his] interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Stable Econ.

ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION BY EXISTING PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, Magistrate Judge Varholak concluded that Mr. Brown's protected interests would not be adequately represented by Defendant Board because there is a possibility that the convergent interests of the government and Mr. Brown may diverge.

Thus, the Court finds that Magistrate Judge Varholak did not err in finding that Mr. Brown has satisfied the minimal burden of showing inadequate representation at the fourth and final element of Rule 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For these reasons, Magistrate Judge Varholak's Order permitting Mr. Brown's intervention as a matter of right is not clearly erroneous or contrary to law.
