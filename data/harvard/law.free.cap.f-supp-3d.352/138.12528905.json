That day, Plaintiff was also granted a mortgage loan, secured by the Property, in the amount of $349,200.00 (the \"Mortgage\"). The Mortgage was subsequently assigned to several entities the last being U.S. Bank on June 29, 2017. On July 14, 2017, U.S. Bank recorded the assignment. Fay Servicing is the loan servicer for U.S. Bank for the Mortgage.\n   </attorneys>\n   <opinion>\n    <div id=\"p-22\">\n     <em>\n      <strong>\n       Discussion\n      </strong>\n     </em>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"p-30\">\n     <strong>\n      SO ORDERED\n     </strong>\n    </div>\n    <footnote label=\"1\">\n     <p id=\"p-33\">\n      I find that the Mortgage has been sufficiently referenced in Plaintiff's Complaint as to be incorporated by reference.

Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d), however, \"a party may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements, the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.\" Accordingly, Plaintiff argues that he never received any notice. This fact makes the inference that no notice was sent a plausible one. In the alternative, Plaintiff argues that hypothetically, even if notice was sent, it did not contain the required information. At this stage, nothing about Plaintiff's alternative claims is improper.\n     </attorneys>\n    </footnote>\n    <div type=\"majority\">\n     <p id=\"p-7\">\n      <em>\n       <strong>\n        MEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO DISMISS\n       </strong>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      Dennis Lamonica (\"Plaintiff\") alleges that Fay Servicing, LLC and U.S. Bank\n     (\"Defendants\") wrongfully foreclosed on his property at 60 Latisquama Road, Southborough, Massachusetts (the \"Property\"). His Complaint asserts three claims: wrongful disclosure (Count I), breach of contract (Counts II), and declaratory judgement that Defendants' lacked standing to foreclose (Count III). Defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted as to all three claims. (Docket No. 7).

Here, because the contract at issue is the Mortgage, both claims are predicated on an alleged breach of the Mortgage agreement between the parties.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-24\">\n      Defendant argues that \"Plaintiff's allegation that he did not receive notice fails to support his claim for violation of the Mortgage's power of sale clause only requires the mortgagee to 'give notice.' \" (Docket No. 8, at 6).

Defendant does not, however, acknowledge the reasonable inferences that that may be drawn (and at this stage in the litigation must be drawn in Plaintiff's favor) from the fact that Plaintiff never received notice. It is certainly a\n     reasonable inference that, since Plaintiff alleges to have not received notice, one was never sent.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       U.S. ex rel.
