Nathan Tooley, the Chief Financial Officer of Specter, signed the Customer Profile Form and it was submitted to NTG on June 7, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next day, Scepter asked NTG to pick up 44,487 pounds of aluminum ingot from its facility in Waverly, Tennessee, and deliver it to Scepter's customer in Shelbyville, Indiana. The customer agreed to pay $40,532.55 for the ingot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   NTG informed Scepter that a driver would pick-up the ingot on June 14, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. When the driver did not show as scheduled, both Scepter and NTG called his cell-phone number. The driver stated that he was nearing Scepter's facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A tractor, with the words \"18 Wheeler\" emblazoned on the sleeper, finally arrived at 4:30 p.m. The driver provided Scepter with the appropriate passcode, and then left with the ingot. The driver, tractor trailer, and ingot then vanished, never to be seen by the parties again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 18, 2018, NTG informed Scepter that it had lost the tracking signal from the tractor trailer and that the cargo was presumed stolen. NTG also told Scepter that it did not believe the driver was actually employed by 18 Wheeler Transport. Specter then filed a police report. It also contacted 18 Wheeler Transport in Tucson, Arizona, but was informed that 18 Wheeler Transport did not transport goods that far east.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result of these events, Scepter filed suit in the Chancery Court alleging breach of contract, negligence, and violation of the Tennessee Consumer Protections Act. It seeks to recover damages (including the $40,532.55 that the Shelbyville customer promised Specter), plus prejudgment interest, attorney's fees, and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Application of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Where a case is improperly filed in contravention of a forum selection clause, the Court has the discretion to either dismiss the action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or to transfer the case in accordance with Rule 1404(a).\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

No. 8 at 4). NTG then notes that Specter \"does not challenge the validity of the Contract Provisions\" and that \"[t]he Forum-Selection Clause broadly covers not only claims for breach of contract\" but also tort claims to the extent that they arise out of the agreement between the parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). All of this may be true, but the argument hinges on there being a forum selection clause that required Specter to file suit in Fulton County, Georgia. The Contract Provisions contain no such requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A forum selection clause (sometimes abbreviated as an FSC) can be either mandatory or permissive. As the Fifth Circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A mandatory FSC affirmatively requires that litigation arising from the contract be carried out in a given forum. By contrast, a permissive FSC is only a contractual waiver of personal-jurisdiction and venue objections if litigation is commenced in the specified forum. Only mandatory clauses justify transfer or dismissal. An FSC is mandatory only if it contains clear language specifying that litigation must occur in the specified forum-and language merely indicating that the courts of a particular place \"shall have jurisdiction\" (or similar) is insufficient to make an FSC mandatory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Weber v.

No. 12 at 2). This is an exceedingly short argument (consisting of less than a paragraph) perhaps because Specter brought suit in this Court and is waiving nothing. As for\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , there is nothing before the Court to indicate that this is an inconvenient forum. Indeed, NTG does not make the argument even though \"the defendant carries the burden of establishing an adequate alternative forum and showing that the plaintiff's chosen forum is unnecessarily burdensome based on public and private interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Hefferan v.

The only thing before the Court are allegations that (1) Specter, a Tennessee corporation, has a principal place of business in Humphreys County, Tennessee; (2) NTG has a place of business in Davidson County, Tennessee; (3) Specter contacted NTG to have aluminum ingot picked up in Waverly, Tennessee; and (4) the ingot disappeared after being picked up in Waverly.

The website identifies Customer Terms and Conditions which, among other things, contains a \"Governing Law and Forum\" provision that reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   These Terms will be deemed to have been drawn in accordance with the statutes and laws of the state of Georgia and in the event of any disagreement or dispute, the laws of Georgia will apply,\n   without regard to its choice or conflict of law rules, and suit must be brought exclusively in Georgia as each Party specifically submits to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts for disputes involving these Terms or the Services.

However, in its Complaint, Scepter alleges that there were no such terms and conditions on the website when Tooley signed the Customer Profile Form, and that Scepter first saw the Customer Terms and Conditions two weeks after the apparent theft when those provisions were sent to Specter by NTG.
