The case arises out of a $504,611.13 wire transfer that Plaintiff initiated to an account at Defendant, Wells Fargo Bank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shapiro had a client, a car dealership, that needed to repay a loan, and Shapiro facilitated that transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-9. On November 16, 2017, the client forwarded Shapiro an email from the lender's lawyer, James Messenger, containing wire transfer instructions for repaying the loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. That email identified Mr. Messenger's bank as M &amp; T Bank in Syracuse, New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The next day, the client forwarded Shapiro another email purportedly from Mr. Messenger that directed repayment to a different account: a Wells Fargo account based in Texas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. The second email stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Please here are [sic] my escrow account for today [sic] payoff wire transfer instructions. Our M &amp; T bank [sic] is currently on audit [and] as a result can't receive funds for now. Please let the wire transfer be made to this our Wells Fargo bank [sic]. Find attached our bank details.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Despite receiving these two sets of wire transfer instructions, Plaintiff did not\n   email or speak to Mr. Messenger. D.E. 53-1, 53:16-19 (Deposition of Peter Shapiro). And despite the five typographical and capitalization errors in the second email, Shapiro chose to rely on it because it was more recent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   54:19-55:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The same day that Shapiro received the second email, he initiated the wire transfer to the Wells Fargo account. D.E. 53 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Ex. G. But Mr. Messenger never received the funds, because the Wells Fargo account did not belong to him. D.E. 71 \u00b6 5. It belonged instead to someone named Chris Achebe, who promptly removed the funds from the account. D.E. 53 \u00b6\u00b6 17, 37. On December 14, Plaintiff's bank sent Wells Fargo a recall request, but Wells Fargo denied it because the funds were already gone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Wells Fargo's Wire Transfer Procedures\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wells Fargo processes wire transfers through an electronic system called the Money Transfer System (\"MTS\"). D.E. 53 \u00b6 19. When a wire transfer identifies a valid Wells Fargo account number, the MTS processes the transfer through an automated\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 24. MTS creates an automated audit trail that documents the various automated steps in the process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. In this case, the automated audit trail included an entry that reads, \"possible name mismatch in CDT party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. This possible name mismatch entry was not seen by anybody at Wells Fargo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Possible name mismatch entries are common in wire transfers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The wire transfer included the partial word \"ATTORN.\" Id. \u00b6 30. This triggered Wells Fargo's Office of Foreign Asset Control (\"OFAC\") to review the transfer for possible United States sanctions violations because of the similarity of \"ATTORN\" to \"ATTOUN,\" a name which appears on the sanctions list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This review was conducted by a person, who determined that there was no match between \"ATTORN\" and \"ATTOUN.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. The OFAC screening process does not consider whether there is a name mismatch between the intended beneficiary and the name attached to the receiving account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff filed the complaint on February 5, 2018, which included one claim for violating the Uniform Commercial Code's (\"UCC\") wire transfer statute as adopted in Florida Statutes section 670.207, and one claim for negligence. D.E. 1. The Court dismissed the negligence claim with prejudice because it was preempted by the wire transfer statute. D.E. 14.

The Court explained, \"[i]f Wells Fargo did not know [of the mismatch], then it was entitled to rely on the account number, and thus did not violate the statute when it transferred the funds to Chris Achebe.\" D.E. 14, p. 4. Wells Fargo now moves for summary judgment on the basis that there is no evidence tending to show that Wells Fargo had actual knowledge of the mismatch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In opposition, Plaintiff first argues that Wells Fargo knew about the mismatch because it opened the receiving account in Chris Achebe's name and the automated audit trail identified a possible name mismatch. And second, it argues that the statute imposes a due diligence requirement on Wells Fargo, which the bank failed to meet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     The Florida Banking Statutes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Florida has adopted the Uniform Commercial Code's (\"UCC\") relevant banking statutes. This case is governed by section 670.207 of the Florida Statutes. Section 670.207 (which is materially identical to\n   UCC \u00a7 4A-207 ) entitled \"Misdescription of beneficiary,\" provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (2) If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the following rules apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (a) [I]f the beneficiary's bank does not\n   <strong>\n    know\n   </strong>\n   that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (b) If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or\n   <strong>\n    knows\n   </strong>\n   that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer.

Comment 2 to the statute reads, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A very large percentage of payment orders issued to the beneficiary's bank by another bank are processed by automated means using machines capable of reading orders on standard formats that identify the beneficiary by an identifying number or the number of a bank account. The processing of the order by the beneficiary's bank and the crediting of the beneficiary's account are done by use of the identifying or bank account number without human reading of the payment order itself. The process is comparable to that used in automated payment of checks. The standard format, however, may also allow the inclusion of the name of the beneficiary and other information which can be useful to the beneficiary's bank and the beneficiary\n   <strong>\n    but which plays no part in the process of payment\n   </strong>\n   . If the beneficiary's bank has both the account number and name of the beneficiary supplied by the originator of the funds transfer, it is possible for the beneficiary's bank to determine whether the name and number refer to the same person,\n   <strong>\n    but if a duty to make that determination is imposed on the beneficiary's bank the benefits of automated payment are lost\n   </strong>\n   . Manual handling of payment orders is both expensive and subject to human error. If payment orders can be handled on an automated basis there are substantial economies of operation and the possibility of clerical error is reduced. Subsection (b) allows banks to utilize automated processing by allowing banks to act on the basis of the number without regard to the name if the bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons. \"Know\" is defined in Section 1-201(25) to mean actual knowledge, and Section 1-201(27) states rules for determining when an organization has knowledge of information received by the organization. The time of payment is the pertinent time at which knowledge or lack of knowledge must be determined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the clear trend is for beneficiary's banks to process payment orders by automated means,\n   <strong>\n    Section 4A-207 is not limited to cases in which processing is done by automated means.

The efficiency benefits of an automated system are undermined if a bank is not able to rely on its automated system but must independently verify there is no conflict between a beneficiary name and an account number.

True, a person reviewed the transaction for sanctions compliance, but it is undisputed that the person did not look at whether the name and account number matched. D.E. 53 \u00b6 33. At no point in the process did anyone become consciously aware that the name and account did not match. The audit report noted a possible name mismatch, but this digitally stored information did not come to anyone's attention at the time of the transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wetherill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1344478\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/145/1187/#p1192\">\n    145 F.3d at 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that date stored in a computer system, which if inspected would have revealed wrongdoing, was not actual knowledge). There is, therefore, no evidence that Wells Fargo had actual knowledge of the mismatch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Wells Fargo had knowledge because it had opened the receiving account in Chris Achebe's name and it had processed a fraudulent wire to his account previously. But these facts do not create actual knowledge of a mismatch in the wire transfer at issue. They do not even create constructive knowledge of a mismatch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that Wells Fargo would have had knowledge if it exercised due diligence, and due diligence required Wells Fargo to put in place systems to catch name mismatches like this one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument fails for several reasons. First, the due diligence requirement from section 671.201(27) applies only to \"the \"individual conducting the transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20671.201\">\n    Fla.

And this automation is not only permitted, but encouraged and protected by Article 4A so as to remove the possibility of human error. Fla Stat. \u00a7 670.207, cmt 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, even if this due diligence standard applied here, it would not impose on Wells Fargo a duty to determine whether the name and account matched; the statute expressly relieves banks of that duty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20670.207\">\n    Fla.

The court there interpreted an identical UCC provision in a similar mismatch case and held that even where the transaction was reviewed by a person, the \"due diligence\" requirement did not override section 207. The bank, therefore, was not required to exercise due diligence in determining whether the name and account matched.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [M]achines will be instructed to read the numbers and to credit the amount represented by the numbers in the numbered account\n   <strong>\n    in complete obliviousness to the name on the account\n   </strong>\n   .
