ECF No. 31. After examining the briefs and record, the Court finds that oral argument is unnecessary because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented, and oral argument would not aid in the decisional process. Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b) ; E.D. Va. Loc. R. 7(J). For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, Dena Lindsay-Felton (\"Plaintiff\") is a former KBP employee/store-manager who resigned from her employment on September 20, 2016, based on what she characterizes as a hostile work environment and discrimination based on her race (African-American). During the period immediately prior to her resignation, Plaintiff was a manager of a KBP restaurant, and her supervisor, Susheel \"Shue\" Kumar (\"Shue\"), was a KBP \"Area Coach\" responsible for overseeing multiple restaurant locations. During her deposition, Plaintiff testified that her relationship with Shue began to break down during the last several months of her employment, beginning with a disagreement over inventory numbers because Plaintiff would not falsify records as Shue purportedly directed. From that point forward, Shue repeatedly yelled at Plaintiff, demeaned her in front of her store employees, pointed his finger in her face on at least one occasion, and engaged in other harassment that Plaintiff asserts ultimately caused her to resign. Shue also engaged in behavior that Plaintiff asserts demonstrates a link between her race and Shue's harassment. Now at issue on summary judgment are Plaintiff's race-based hostile work environment claim, constructive discharge claim, and retaliation claim advanced under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

While Shue's alleged use of such toxic term was not directed at Plaintiff, it was used in the workplace and in Plaintiff's presence. Additionally, the context of Shue's use of such degrading term involved referencing workplace conduct of individuals subordinate to Shue, as contrasted with its use while telling a crude joke or in the course of recounting someone else's prior statement. Moreover, the speaker was an area manager who was superior to all other employees in the store, including Plaintiff. When considered in conjunction with Mr. Davis' and Ms. Foreman's declarations, the record demonstrates that Shue's use of such term to reference workplace conduct of subordinate African-American employees was\n   <em>\n    not an isolated incident\n   </em>\n   . Finally, as set forth in both Plaintiff's deposition and Ms. Foreman's affidavit, the context of Shue's use of such word is sufficient to support a reasonable juror in concluding that Shue repeatedly voiced his racist belief that there is a link between African Americans and stupidity.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Savage v. Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517722\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/896/260/#p277\">\n    896 F.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277 (4th Cir. 2018) (noting that when racial slurs are used repeatedly to insult African-American \"employees and customers,\" such slurs can create \"an unlawful hostile work environment\" even if they are \"not directed specifically at the complaining employee\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   While a single use of the n-word in the workplace directed at someone other than the complainant is likely insufficient to establish a race-based hostile work environment, here, Plaintiff has presented evidence illustrating more than a single incident. Moreover, Plaintiff's efforts to link the \"unwelcome conduct\" to her race do not rely solely on Shue's use of the n-word, instead highlighting Shue's repeated workplace statements referring to Plaintiff's employees (all but one of whom were African-American) as \"cockroaches.\" Furthermore, Plaintiff's evidence on the use of this term goes beyond her own sworn statement, as another employee similarly attests that Shue directed such term at African-American employees. Accordingly, when coupled with Shue's use of the n-word and other relevant evidence, such additional statements bolster Plaintiff's contention that Shue's ongoing mistreatment of her was motivated by her race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, in addition to the racial slurs, Plaintiff's evidence is subject to being reasonably interpreted as demonstrating that Shue went a step further by directly injecting Plaintiff's race into the equation by \"consistently\" explaining to Plaintiff that women\n   <em>\n    of her culture\n   </em>\n   were \"beneath him.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strothers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517609\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/317/#p328\">\n    895 F.3d at 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In line with his expressly stated belief, for several months near the end of Plaintiff's employment, Shue consistently treated Plaintiff as if she was, in fact, \"beneath him.\" Pl. Depo. Tr. 174-75.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, when the\n   relevant facts are construed in Plaintiff's favor, Shue's workplace statements can be interpreted as evidencing his racist belief that African-Americans are stupid, and he similarly called Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    stupid\n   </em>\n   or dumb at nearly every opportunity near the end of her employment. To the extent that questions exist as to whether Shue could have harassed Plaintiff simply because she was his subordinate (i.e., he mistreated everyone that worked for him), or simply because she was a woman (i.e., he mistreated all women that worked for him), determining his motivation is a\n   <em>\n    question for the jury\n   </em>\n   in light of all the relevant facts and circumstances, which include evidence of racial animosity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, because the record reasonably supports a finding that there were multiple instances of race-based harassment during the relevant timeframe, directed by a manager of multiple stores at both Plaintiff and her primarily African-American workforce, the Court rejects Defendant's contention that no reasonable juror could find that Plaintiff was subjected to severe and pervasive harassment\n   <em>\n    as a result of her race\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyer-Liberto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190918\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/264/#p280\">\n    786 F.3d at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the fact that: (1) \"harassment perpetrated by a supervisor against her subordinate\" typically has a \"particular threatening character\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) that a reasonable jury could find that a hostile work environment existed based on a\n   <em>\n    single incident\n   </em>\n   if it was sufficiently severe).

Accordingly, the purported hearsay comments of other employees may be admissible not for their truth, but to demonstrate Plaintiff's subjective reaction when trying herself to understand\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    Shue was treating her so poorly in the workplace.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Mr. Davis' declaration expressly states that he has \"personal knowledge\" of the facts set forth therein.

However,\n    <em>\n     King\n    </em>\n    expressly states that \"[t]estimony from other employees describing their own experiences of harassment by the defendant is often relevant to a plaintiff's hostile work environment claim,\" thereafter recognizing that even if the plaintiff lacked knowledge of such events during the course of his or her employment, such evidence\n    <em>\n     remains relevant\n    </em>\n    to the second element of the hostile work environment test.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522403\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/301/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522403\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/301/\">\n     at 310\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Ms. Foreman's declaration expressly states that she has \"personal knowledge\" of the facts set forth therein.

For example, the fact that Plaintiff stated in her deposition that she had one Caucasian employee working at her store does not establish that Shue's \"cockroach\" comments were addressed collectively at employees of multiple races as there is\n    <em>\n     no evidence\n    </em>\n    that the lone Caucasian store-employee was even present when Shue made such comments. Similarly, Defendant's efforts to explain away Shue's comments, that women of Plaintiff's culture were \"beneath him,\" require a parsing of words in a manner that favors Defendant, which is simply not proper when evaluating\n    <em>\n     Defendant's\n    </em>\n    motion for summary judgment. On such latter point, Defendant also relies on a page of Plaintiff's deposition (page 176) that Defendant did not present to the Court.

To the extent that the workforce at the KBP location where Plaintiff was working prior to her promotion was similarly dominated by African-American employees, Plaintiff's earlier-in-time promotion could ultimately prove irrelevant to the calculus.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Here, not only was Shue Plaintiff's supervisor, but Plaintiff's facts indicate that Shue expressly told Plaintiff that company management would always believe his word over hers in the event of a dispute, thus illustrating the leverage he exerted over Plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Construed in Plaintiff's favor, the record evidence illustrates that Shue got too close to Plaintiff in a threatening manner on multiple occasions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.
