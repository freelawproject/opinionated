Ellen L. Hollander, United States District Judge\n   The State of Maryland (\"State\" or \"Maryland\") filed a 168-page Complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City against approximately sixty-five defendants, seeking to redress the alleged contamination of the State's waters with methyl tertiary butyl ether (\"MTBE\"), an oxygenate additive that was commonly blended into gasoline in the 1980s and 1990s. ECF 2 (Complaint). Defendant Atlantic Richfield Company (\"ARCO\") removed this case to federal court. ECF 1. Thereafter, the State filed a Motion to Remand (ECF 283), supported by a memorandum (ECF 283-1) (collectively, \"Remand Motion\"), and many exhibits. Defendants have filed an opposition to the Remand Motion (ECF 299), along with numerous exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State has replied. ECF 303.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   No hearing is necessary to resolve the Remand Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105-6. For the reasons that follow, I shall deny the Remand Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    MTBE and Water Contamination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   MTBE is a chemical compound made by combining methanol (a derivative of natural gas) and isobutylene (a by-product of the gasoline-refining process). ECF 2, \u00b6 103. It was commonly blended into gasoline in the 1980s and 1990s as an \"oxygenate\" and \"octane enhancer\" to reduce carbon monoxide tailpipe emissions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 107, 117-129. Compared with other oxygenates like ethanol, MTBE was inexpensive to manufacture because it was made from readily available refinery byproducts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 103, 127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gasoline is made by processing crude oil at a refinery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105. It is then transported through pipelines, tank ships, and barges to \"common storage tanks\" located at terminals around the country.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106. From there, it is further \"transshipped\" by pipeline or other means to \"secondary terminals\" or \"depots,\" and then taken by trucks to gas stations for retail sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MTBE was blended into the gasoline at the refinery itself, or \"splash blended\" at terminals by adding it to truck tanks after those tanks were filled with gasoline from the terminal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105. Because MTBE-enhanced gasoline is fungible, batches were frequently comingled from different sources during the production and distribution process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MTBE allegedly enters the environment \"through disposals, deposits, releases, leaks, overfills, spills, discharges and evaporative releases,\" and is \"principally release[d]\" while in underground storage tanks or during delivery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 109. When released, MTBE is highly soluble in groundwater, spreads rapidly, does not naturally degrade, resists removal and treatment from groundwater, and is difficult to locate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 110-11, 113. It can also migrate into subsurface-soil regions and penetrate into aquifers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 112, 114. For these reasons, the State claims that MTBE \"is and has been more difficult and more expensive to remove from groundwater than other contaminants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The United States Geological Survey has reported that MTBE is the \"second most frequently detected volatile organic chemical in groundwater in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130. Around the United States, MTBE has been detected in \"over 20% of aquifers tested in places where high MTBE-content gasoline was used.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MTBE has also been found in \"varying concentrations and at varying times\" in public water systems and private drinking-water wells in Maryland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 218, 220. Studies allegedly show that MTBE \"is a probable human carcinogen,\" can cause \"significant adverse health effects when ingested,\" and \"can render drinking water putrid and unfit for human consumption.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 137.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    History of MTBE Use and Legislative Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1979, before defendants allegedly knew the harmful effects of MTBE, the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") granted a waiver for the use of 7% MTBE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   in unleaded gasoline, finding that MTBE as a fuel additive did not cause or contribute to the failure of any emission control device or system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 117, 134; Application for Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether, Decision of the Administrator,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20Fed.%20Reg.%2012%2C242\">\n    44 Fed.

However, defendants' argument that the RFG Program included an \"explicit balancing test\" (ECF 299 at 19) merely shows that the RFG Program is part of the comprehensive federal scheme of the CAA,\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    that Section 1503 is a part of that same comprehensive scheme. Instead, Section 1503 provides the option of a federal forum for actions relating to the contamination of one type of fuel additive that could qualify under these programs. Section 1503 became effective 15 years after the 1990 CAA Amendments and 42 years after the CAA was initially passed. By that point, MTBE production was decreasing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     New Jersey Dep't of Envtl. Prot. v.

In\n    <em>\n     Hartford Fire Ins.

The inquiry is a \"practical\" one, \"focused on the particular facts and circumstances of a case.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3726956\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/255/#p259\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    The facts in this case justify a finding that GPMI is a nominal party. GPMI's registration in Maryland has been revoked since 2012 because of its failure to pay taxes. Because its registration has been revoked, it is no longer a legal entity in the State. The corporation filed for bankruptcy in 2011, and the materials presented by the parties show that its liquidation process began in 2012 and was completed by 2015, with only a supplemental distribution occurring in 2016.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    Under the circumstances presented, I conclude that GPMI was a nominal party not capable of concurring in removal. Again, its lack of consent does not justify remand.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    <strong>\n     c. Notice of Removal and Response to Standing Order\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    Plaintiff also argues the defendants have not met their burden of pleading the precise reasons why Vitol S.A. and GPMI did not consent in their Notice of Removal.

Even assuming unanimous consent is required, the Notice of Removal states that \"all defendants properly joined and served in this action have consented to removal,\" and attaches both a list of all defendants (including Vitol and GPMI) and all defendants who had consented, which did not include Vitol and GPMI. ECF 1, \u00b6 8; ECF 1-1 at 3-4, ECF 1-2 at 2-3. The response to the Standing Order on Removal, filed two weeks after the Notice of Removal, states: \"There is no defendant that was served in the state court action prior to the time of removal that did not formally join in or consent to the notice of removal.\" And, it attaches a list of joining defendants and respective dates of service, which does not contain Vitol or GPMI. ECF 256, \u00b6 5; ECF 256-1. Under the facts of this case, these allegations are sufficient to overcome any pleading defect of the kind that the court found in\n    <em>\n     Egle\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
