WOODLOCK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   At issue in the motion to dismiss before me is whether the two-year statute of limitations under the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, May 28, 1999, S. Treaty Doc. No. 106-45 (entered into force Nov. 4, 2003) (the \"Montreal Convention\") forecloses a passenger's claim against an airline. The passenger's overnight flight took off from Boston on March 30, 2015, arriving in London on March 31, 2015, where the passenger says he was confined without justification\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by Delta employees at Heathrow Airport. The passenger did not commence this action based on that confinement until March 28, 2018, nearly three years after the incident. If the Montreal Convention applies, this suit is time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Concluding that the Montreal Convention applies because the personal injury alleged by plaintiff did not extend beyond his disembarkation process and, consequently, that potentially applicable municipal law - which would provide a more generous limitation period of not less than three years - is preempted by the international law regime of the Montreal Convention, I will allow the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The facts alleged in the operative complaint can be summarized briefly; they are recited more fully when relevant to the analysis in Section III of this Memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As the aircraft on which the plaintiff, T. Forcht Dagi, M.D., began descent to Heathrow Airport, the bag of a Delta airline flight attendant (the \"Attendant\") was reported over the aircraft intercom as having disappeared. The Attendant loudly and falsely accused Dr. Dagi of stealing the bag. Dr. Dagi's onboard luggage was searched by the Attendant, but the missing bag was found elsewhere on the plane. The Attendant then \"loudly accused\" Dr. Dagi of \"probably\" having \"thrown\" the bag to the other location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Once the aircraft landed, the Attendant prevented Dr. Dagi from leaving the aircraft before the other passengers. Upon reaching the mobile section of the Jetway connecting the aircraft to the terminal, the Attendant directed a uniformed Delta ground employee to detain Dr. Dagi and turn him over to authorities. The Attendant ordered Dr. Dagi to surrender his passport to the Delta ground employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Delta ground employee then ordered Dr. Dagi to follow her to another location within the Heathrow Airport terminal until the police arrived. This involved a walk of ten to fifteen minutes to a location four hundred yards from the aircraft and the Jetway. The terminal through which Dr. Dagi was marched was not itself leased or under the control of Delta; it was also utilized by other airlines and their passengers. Dr. Dagi was subject to the sole direction of Delta employees during his relevant passage through the terminal. Following the initial walk through the terminal, Dr. Dagi was marched back to the vicinity of the aircraft where he was handed over to a Delta supervisor. Dr. Dagi, who was recovering from leg surgery, suffered significant pain while being forced to transport his carry-on luggage without assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the Delta supervisor to whom Dr. Dagi was delivered talked with a British police officer by phone, the phone was turned over to Dr. Dagi who was interviewed by the police officer. Following this phone interview, the police officer told Dr. Dagi he was free to go, and he proceeded through immigration without further restraint by Delta employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For purposes of determining whether claims arise from \"any of the operations of ... disembarking,\" Art. 17, \u00b6 1, under the Montreal Convention, the First Circuit has outlined a \"three-pronged inquiry\" involving evaluation of \"(1) the passenger's activity at the time of injury, (2) his or her whereabouts when injured, and (3) the extent to which the carrier was exercising control at the moment of injury.\"\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nw.

The\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   court stated that it did \"not view the three factors-activity, location, and control-as separate legs of a stool, but, rather, as forming a single, unitary base.

The First Circuit held the plaintiff was not \"embarking\" because she had yet to fulfill most of the conditions of boarding (e.g., she had not reached the area restricted for travelers), was not under the defendant's control, and was too remote \"temporally and spatially\" from the act of embarking.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11324875\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/313/#p317\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11324875\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/313/#p317\">\n    at 317-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   With that general framework in mind, I now turn to unbundling the three distinctive factors identified by the First Circuit for consideration in the analytical process. It must bear reemphasis, however, that these factors should not be conceived as separate strands, but rather are \"inextricably intertwined.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11324875\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/313/#p317\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11324875\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/313/#p317\">\n    at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Location\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The relevant locational facts, as alleged, began onboard the aircraft with the initial accusation by the Attendant. Dr. Dagi avers that \"[o]nce the Aircraft landed, the Attendant prevented the Plaintiff from leaving the Aircraft before the other passengers had done so.\" This allegedly tortious conduct then continued on the Jetway, which \"connect[s] the Aircraft to the Terminal.\" It was from that point other airline employees took Dr. Dagi on a walk of ten to fifteen minutes duration through the terminal to a point approximately 400 yards away, kept him at that location for 15 minutes, and then escorted him on another walk of ten to fifteen minutes back to the vicinity of the aircraft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The location of the alleged incident through the terminal justifies classifying it as occurring during disembarking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    MacDonald\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Air Canada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"755618,755622\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/439/1402/\">\n    439 F.2d 1402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1405 (1st Cir. 1971), before the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   outlined the three factors to guide analysis, the court deployed a bright-line test focusing on location where the court stated \"it would seem that the operation of disembarking has terminated by the time the passenger has descended from the plane by the use of whatever mechanical means have been supplied and has reached a safe point inside of the terminal ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"755618,755622\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/439/1402/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even using that mechanistic formulation, it is clear that Dr. Dagi here was still disembarking when he left the Jetway connection between\n   the plane and the terminal because he remained under the supervision and express control of Delta employees who directed him to points, safe or otherwise, of their choice within the terminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Spatially, the relevant events began on and continued seamlessly at Delta's direction directly from the aircraft and then back to its vicinity during the process of disembarkation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Temporally, the events in question began on the aircraft and unfolded in an unbroken chain until the police officer terminated the airline's direction and control. There was no intervening period between Dr. Dagi leaving the aircraft itself and the alleged tortious conduct. Instead the tortious conduct involved a continuous course of conduct of slightly less than an hour that began with directions inside the cabin of the plane and ended within the terminal, just a walking distance away from the aircraft.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As is apparent, and as anticipated by the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   , the factor of control is intertwined with the factor of location.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11324875\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/313/#p317\">\n    56 F.3d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, where an airline continues to wield effective control over an individual even at some distance from the curtilage of the airplane, disembarkation may still be occurring. While the concept of control will be separately discussed below, it is important to observe at this point that Dr. Dagi admits to being in the uninterrupted and exclusive control of Delta on the plane, on the Jetway, and in the terminal until told by the police he could go on his way.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Amended Complaint [Dkt. No. 5 at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27, 28, 33-35, 38, 42, 46-49, 52, 60] (notably, the Plaintiff uses the words \"detention,\" \"custody,\" \"duress,\" and \"forced\" in his complaint which all denote determinative degrees of control). The determinative control Delta is alleged to have had over Dr. Dagi suffuses the \"location\" and related \"duration\" analysis. The exercise of control by Delta undergirds the role of location and duration in supporting the classification of the conduct as occurring during disembarkation operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To use the words of\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   , the incidents alleged were never \"far removed\" from the threshold point in the process of disembarkation,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11324875\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/313/#p317\">\n    56 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   318 ; instead, they were inextricably connected both temporally and spatially to Dr. Dagi's ongoing process of disembarking from the airplane.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11324875\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/56/313/#p317\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

The word \"control\" is not limited to \"routine\" circumstances. In the Oxford English Dictionary, the word control means in this context \"[t]he act or power of directing or regulating; command,\n   regulating influence.\"\n   <em>\n    Control\n   </em>\n   , The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (4th ed. 1993). The American usage of the word is similarly defined.\n   <em>\n    Control\n   </em>\n   , American Heritage Dictionary (4th ed. 2000) (\"To exercise authoritative or dominating influence over; direct.\") To redefine the word as suggested by Dr. Dagi would be to introduce without justification an anomalous linguistic limitation to the scope of the Montreal Convention and to the First Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, Dr. Dagi suggests that a broad definition of control would be \"pernicious\" because it would \"empower an airline, with legal impunity under both the Convention and local law, to detain an arriving passenger at any location of its choosing in an arrival 'secure area,' and, further, to do so for as long as is its pleasure.\" Other courts have rejected such \"policy\" arguments for ignoring the plain understandings reached in the Convention. I do so as well.

The English and Wales Court of Appeal has provided guidance for juries stating that basic damages (to compensate for the loss of liberty) of \u00a3500 for the first hour of false imprisonment is appropriate, with sums awarded after the first hour to be awarded on a \"reducing scale.\"\n   <em>\n    See Thompson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis\n   </em>\n   [1998] Q.B. 498 (EWCA) 515.

That is similarly the law of England,\n   <em>\n    see Rookes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnard\n   </em>\n   [1964] A.C. 1129 (HL) (limiting exemplary damages to three limited scenarios, none of which are applicable in Dr. Dagi's case), and Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aleo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    SLB Toys USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224157\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/466/398/\">\n    466 Mass. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=995%20N.E.2d%20740\">\n    995 N.E.2d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753 (2013) (\"Under Massachusetts law, punitive damages may be awarded only where authorized by statute.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For all practical purposes, then, the Montreal Convention does not by terms categorically provide the potential for any less generous damage recovery than would the law of England or Massachusetts if, absent preemption, the municipal law supplied by either of those jurisdictions were to govern this dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In short, even if I were authorized - which I am not - to rewrite the terms of the Montreal Convention to avoid preemption and employ the substantive law of England or Massachusetts, it does not appear that any significant benefit involving more generous damages would accrue to Dr. Dagi. Thus, by permitting the statute of limitations for the Montreal Convention to run, Dr. Dagi lost not only the right to pursue damages essentially no less generous than would have been available under the law of England or Massachusetts, he also lost the opportunity to deploy the Convention as a tool to deter airlines from the \"pernicious\" conduct of unlawfully and unreasonably detaining passengers during disembarkation operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D.

Instead, here the acts as alleged arose on the plane near the end of the flight, continued after landing, and proceeded through the airline's Jetway into the terminal during which time Dr. Dagi was under the control of Delta employees who directed his movement from location to location at all points. The alleged tortious conduct occurred during disembarkation operations for Dr. Dagi. Liability is governed exclusively by the Montreal Convention. Under the Montreal Convention, that liability was extinguished on March 31, 2017, two years after Dr. Dagi's arrival in London where he says the wrongful conduct took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dr. Dagi's complaint must be read to allege that he was engaged in operations of disembarking at the time of the challenged conduct by Delta and its employees. Dr. Dagi's municipal law claims are, therefore, preempted by the Montreal Convention because the Convention's limitation provision extinguished the liability for the injury alleged in his complaint well before this action was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, Delta's motion [Dkt. No. 7] to dismiss based on the statute of limitations established by the Montreal Convention is hereby GRANTED and Delta's belated motion [Dkt. No. 16] to file an amended motion to dismiss is therefore treated as MOOT. The Clerk shall terminate this case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    I share the concern of the Reporter to an ongoing Restatement of the Law (Third) Torts project that conventional nomenclature for the torts of false imprisonment and, derivatively, false arrest may be confusing or misleading.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Restatement (Third) Torts: Intentional Torts to Persons \u00a7 7 Reporter's Notes cmt. a ( Am.

Greater doctrinal precision seems especially important in framing my approach to the claims of \"false [or 'wrongful'] imprisonment\" and \"false arrest\" asserted by conventional name in plaintiff's complaint since those claims may need to be addressed under the personal injury law of one or another of several different liability regimes: the Montreal Convention, the municipal law of England, or the municipal law of Massachusetts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Consideration of the case law regarding two international air carriage Conventions is appropriate, although only the Montreal Convention is directly applicable in this case.

Dr. Dagi's effort to transmute his claims into more than one cause of action (i.e., pre-Jetway, presumably governed by the Montreal Convention, and post-Jetway, presumably covered by the law of England) to avoid the preemptive effect of the Montreal Convention (and its associated statute of limitations) for the post-Jetway operations distorts beyond recognition the gravamen of the single tort by a single defendant alleged in the factual assertions of the Amended Complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    This circumstance effectively distinguishes Dr. Dagi's case from other disembarkation cases in which under settled case law a plaintiff's passage through the terminal after emerging from the aircraft was held not to be part of the airline's operations of disembarkation.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Elnajjar\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Northwest Airlines, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201949545\">\n     2005 WL 1949545\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (S.D.
