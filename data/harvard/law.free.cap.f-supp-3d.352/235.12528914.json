HELLERSTEIN, U.S.D.J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Petitioner Adou Kouadio (\"Petitioner\"), a citizen of Ivory Coast seeking asylum in the United States, was taken into custody at the U.S. border on February 21, 2016. He has been detained ever since-approximately 34 months at present writing, while his petition for asylum remains pending. He petitions for habeas corpus, claiming that his indefinite detention without an opportunity for bail violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. I grant the petition, holding that Petitioner's continued detention without a bond bearing violates his due process rights as an arriving non-resident alien, limited as those rights are.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Immigration Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the purposes of this opinion, I accept as true the facts alleged in the First Amended Petition. On February 21, 2016, Petitioner was detained at the El Paso, Texas border crossing. First Amended Petition (\"Pet.\"), ECF No. 13, \u00b6 12. He expressed an intent to seek asylum, which entitled him to a credible-fear interview under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B). Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. At the conclusion of that interview, on March 14, 2016, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officer found that Petitioner had demonstrated a credible fear of persecution in Ivory Coast based on his political opinions. Pet. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 17, 2016, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") served Petitioner with a Notice to Appear charging him as a removable \"arriving alien\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7)(A)(i)(I), and commencing removal proceedings against him. Pet. \u00b6 14. ICE interviewed Petitioner and, on April 11, denied his parole request and ordered him detained, stating that he had failed to establish that he was not a flight risk and that he was not a danger to the community or the United States' security. Government's Opposition Memorandum (\"Opp.\"), ECF No. 17, at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioner's removal proceedings in Texas were subject to repeated delays. Petitioner appeared before an immigration judge (\"IJ\") on May 3, 2016, Pet. \u00b6 15, and, again, on May 20 with counsel. Pet. \u00b6 16. The government failed to engage a Twi language interpreter, so his case was adjourned to July 6, 2016. Pet. \u00b6 16. On July 6, Petitioner submitted his application for asylum and a merits hearing was scheduled for August 24. Pet. \u00b6 17. The absence of an interpreter caused Petitioner's merits hearing to be delayed twice more, first on August 24 and again on September 28. Pet. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Petitioner then moved to change venue to New York in order to have better access to an interpreter and to his family. Pet. \u00b6 19. The motion was granted on October 25. Opp. at 4. By that\n   time, Petitioner had been detained for eight months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At Petitioner's first hearing at the Varick Street Immigration Court in New York City, on November 29, 2016, Petitioner's case was adjourned to December 5 to allow Petitioner to secure new counsel in New York. Pet. \u00b6 20. Petitioner's December 5 hearing was adjourned after ICE failed to produce Petitioner. Pet. \u00b6 21. Petitioner appeared with counsel on January 12, 2017, at which time the IJ scheduled Petitioner's merits hearing for April 11, 2017. Pet. \u00b6 22. Petitioner's counsel requested and obtained adjournment of the April 11 hearing date to April 26. Opp. at 4. Petitioner's merits hearing began on April 26 and was continued to May 12 to allow more time for the presentation of additional evidence. Pet. \u00b6 23. On May 19, 2017, an IJ denied Petitioner's application and ordered his removal to Ivory Coast. Pet. \u00b6 25. He then had been detained for 15 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Petitioner timely appealed the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which dismissed his appeal on October 13, 2017. Pet. \u00b6 26. On November 13, 2017, Petitioner filed a petition for review with the Second Circuit. Pet. \u00b6 27. The Second Circuit ordered his removal stayed on September 21, 2018, Pet. \u00b6 28, and his appeal remains pending. On October 13, 2018, Petitioner filed an amended petition for habeas corpus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , asking this court to grant immediate release or, in the alternative, a hearing at which the government must demonstrate why his continued detention is justified (ECF No. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner has a clean record, never having been arrested or convicted. Petitioner's First Reply Memorandum of Law, ECF No. 20, at 19. There is little risk of flight, since he seeks asylum within the United States, and little risk of danger to the community, judging from his lack of a prior criminal history. Yet, Petitioner has suffered 34 months of detention without an opportunity for a bond hearing while waiting for a final decision on his petition for asylum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Treaty Obligations and Implementing Legislation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The United States' processes for handling asylum applications are rooted in its treaty obligations and implementing statutes. In 1968, the United States acceded to the 1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which \"incorporates by reference Articles 2 through 34 of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.\"\n   <em>\n    I.N.S. v.
