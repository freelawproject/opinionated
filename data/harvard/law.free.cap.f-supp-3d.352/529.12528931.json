Also pending are plaintiffs' and cross-claimant Vaughn's motions to strike MorGreen defendants' answer, (DE 54, DE 59). For the following reasons, the court grants cross-claimant Vaughn's motion for entry of default, denies MorGreen defendants' motion to set aside order on motion for entry of default, and grants plaintiffs' and cross-claimant Vaughn's motions to strike MorGreen defendants' answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs filed complaint in this court July 21, 2017, claiming defendants misclassified them as independent contractors, willfully failed to remit compensation for all hours worked, willfully failed to remit required overtime pay, and violated statutory record-keeping requirements.

(DE 17 at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   No answer having been filed by MorGreen defendants, on January 26, 2018, plaintiffs moved for entry of default against MorGreen defendants, which was granted on March 16, 2018 by the clerk of the court. (DE 27, DE 44). On March 15, 2018, cross-claimant Vaughn filed the instant motion for entry of default on its cross-claims against MorGreen defendants. (DE 39).

(DE 52 at 17, 23). MorGreen defendants bring the following counterclaims against the Criscos: tortious interference with a contract, tortious interference with prospective economic relations, conversion, indemnification, and contribution.

The court \"dismisse[d] all claims of Plaintiffs who submitted individually executed settlement agreements in this matter, as they relate to Defendant Vaughn only, based on or arising out of any acts, facts, transactions, occurrences, representations or omissions alleged in the Complaint in this matter on the merits and with prejudice and without costs to any of the parties as against any other settling party, except as provided in the parties' mediation agreement and individually-executed settlement agreements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both plaintiffs and cross-claimant Vaughn filed the instant motions to strike MorGreen defendants' answer on April 16, 2018 and April 20, 2018, respectively.

MorGreen defendants did not file response to the motions to strike, but on April 17, 2018, filed the instant motion to set aside order on motion for entry of default, offering unverified statement that \"[d]efendants had consulted with several law firms, none of which were willing and/or able to take them on as clients.

(Compl. (DE 1) \u00b6 37). Defendant Green founded and holds a majority ownership stake in defendant MorGreen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38). Defendant MorGreen, a subcontractor who performed construction services on cross-claimant Vaughn's behalf, contracted exclusively with cross-claimant Vaughn throughout defendant MorGreen's existence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that defendants \"had a systemic company-wide policy, pattern, or practice of misclassifying their employees as independent contractors, willfully failing to compensate employees for all hours worked, willfully failing to pay employees the statutory minimum wage rate for all hours worked, willfully failing to compensate employees at the appropriate overtime rate for overtime hours worked, and violating statutory record-keeping provisions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Cross-claimant Vaughn alleges that Vaughn and MorGreen defendants entered into a subcontract agreement on November 1, 2016, wherein MorGreen defendants agreed in part\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 \"to provide labor, materials, equipment and services necessary to perform work regarding a solar panel installation project in Wilson, North Carolina\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 \"be solely responsible for and have control over construction means, methods, techniques, sequences and procedures and for coordinating and supervising all portions of the Work under the Subcontract and shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of Subcontractor's employees, subcontractors and their agents and employees and for all applicable employer taxes, benefits and insurance\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \u2022 \"comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of any public authority ... including without limitation ... prevailing wages\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 \"be liable to [Vaughn] for all damages, fines, penalties, costs and expenses incurred by [Vaughn] resulting from [MorGreen defendants] failure to comply with such Laws\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 \"that all monies received [from Vaughn] shall first be used for the payment of all labor and materials used in the Work\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 to indemnify and hold harmless Vaughn \"from and against any and all claims, damages, losses and expenses ... arising out of or resulting from: (i) any breach or default of [Cross-Claim Defendants] in performance of its obligations under the Subcontract.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (DE 17 at 14-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A.

R. Civ. P. 55(c). When deciding whether to set aside default, a district court should consider factors such\n   as whether the moving party has a meritorious defense, whether it acts with reasonable promptness, the personal responsibility of the defaulting party, the prejudice to the adversary party, whether there is a history of dilatory action, and the availability of sanctions less drastic than entry of default.\n   <em>\n    Payne ex rel.

Within these lean filings, MorGreen defendants only argument concerning a meritorious defense is the following statement: \"Defendant has a meritorious defense, as referenced in his Answer to all claims against him.\" (DE 68 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This argument is insufficient. In the limited filings made by MorGreen defendants currently before the court, no argument or evidence is offered as to whether these defendants have a meritorious defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Even if the court were to consider MorGreen's answer and counter claims as sufficient \"presentation or proffer of evidence,\" the court finds no meritorious defense there as well. In MorGreen defendants' answer, beyond general denials and boiler-plate language regarding potentially applicable defenses, MorGreen defendants appear to assert, without explanation, that they were not \"employers\" of plaintiffs and, in their counterclaims, allege that the Criscos \"made an initial investment in Morgreen\" of approximately $30,000.00 and, before the Wilson Project was completed on or about December 2, 2016, and \"without authorization from Morgreen[,] withdrew funds from the business account of Morgreen causing the business to not be able to pay expenses,\" including paying the subcontractors. (DE 52 at 19, 24). Thus, it appears MorGreen defendants do not dispute plaintiffs' primary argument that plaintiffs were not adequately paid, arguing only that plaintiffs were not paid because MorGreen defendants had inadequate money in order to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   These allegations may assert a viable claim against the Criscos regarding an agreement between MorGreen defendants and the Criscos, an agreement that is not currently before the court, or in tort regarding the Criscos alleged behavior. However, even taking these allegations as true, these allegations do not establish a valid counterclaim to plaintiffs' claims in this case, that from November 2016 to January 14, 2017, MorGreen defendants and cross-claimant Vaughn misclassified\n   plaintiffs as independent contractors, willfully failed to remit compensation for all hours worked, willfully failed to remit required overtime pay, and violated statutory record-keeping requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, MorGreen defendants have failed to articulate any meritorious defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Regarding the next\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   factor, MorGreen defendants did not act promptly. Whether a party has acted with reasonable promptness to set aside entry of default must be determined \"in light of the facts and circumstances of each occasion ....\"\n   <em>\n    Moradi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1412747\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/673/725/#p727\">\n    673 F.2d at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this particular case, MorGreen defendants' attorney filed notice of appearance two days before plaintiffs' motion for entry of default was granted and then waited roughly one month to file answer, without leave of the court, and file motion to set aside entry of default. However, even though inexplicable, the delay at issue is roughly one month, and therefore the court finds MorGreen defendants lack of promptness was of minor consequence.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cent.

Mr. Green replied that he was aware of the lawsuit. I asked whether he was represented by an attorney. Mr. Green responded that he was not, but that he was working on getting one. I asked who that attorney was. Mr. Green replied that he could not remember the attorney's name or the name of the firm. I told Mr. Green that it was extremely important for him to get an attorney because this case was moving forward and a judgment for more than $400,000 could be entered against him. Mr. Green said it did not matter as his company was out of business and had no assets. I told him that he was being sued personally and that any judgment could potentially be entered against him personally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (DE 69-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Although defendant Green asserts he \"diligently searched for an attorney,\" from April 2017 to February 2018, (DE 67 at 1-2), this assertion is not plausible. MorGreen defendants argue that \"Defendant was advised to not act by other Firms,\" which \"rises to the level of excusable neglect and good cause for said neglect.\" (DE 68 at 2). It is unlikely that two law firms instructed defendant Green to do nothing in response to federal complaint being filed against\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   him\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   his former company and that none of the allegedly numerous lawyers contacted by defendant Green would have advised him, at the least, to appear pro se, if defendant Green was unable to afford an attorney. However, even assuming the two law firms so instructed, as stated above, cross-claimant Vaughn's counsel informed defendant Green of his potential liability on January 9, 2018. Given the information provided by plaintiff and cross-claimant Vaughn, it appears defendant Green was aware of this lawsuit and his potential liability, inconsistent with his assertions that he was \"under the impression that the matter was not time sensitive.\" (DE 67 at 2). Defendant Green's personal responsibility for entry of default weighs against setting aside that entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Turning to prejudice to the parties, plaintiffs argue that because defendant Morgreen is no longer in operation and defendant Green has made clear there are no available resources, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE 67 \u00b6 1), \"all corporate representatives, resources, and other helpful evidence will be impossible to gather and reconstruct, and this will impede Plaintiff's ability to engage in meaningful discovery or litigation proceedings,\" (DE 70 at 6). Additionally, \"Plaintiff and\n   Defendant Vaughn have worked diligently over the course of several months, to engage in good faith negotiations and ultimately reach a resolution that benefitted Plaintiffs (which may have been impacted if Morgreen Defendants were active in this action).\" (DE 61 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Under the circumstances of this case, both plaintiff and cross-claimant Vaughn would be prejudiced by the court setting aside entry of default after approval of plaintiff and cross-claimant Vaughn's settlement has occurred, where \"the settlements followed extensive investigation and negotiation, and was the result of a formal mediation involving vigorous arm's-length settlement discussions and the assistance of an experienced mediator,\" (DE 56 at 2), and where defendant MorGreen is no longer in operation,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Port Rentals, Inc. v. Ruben\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519998\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/957/126/\">\n    957 F.2d 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 132 (4th Cir. 1992) (finding \"[t]here was also substantial evidence to support the district court's determination that Home Port would be prejudiced if the default judgment were vacated,\" including that \"[b]y the time Ruben's motion to vacate was filed, IYG had ceased operations and at least two of the defendants could not be found.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Next, there is significant history of dilatory action. As already stated, plaintiffs filed complaint in this court July 21, 2017, and service of process was made on MorGreen defendants in August 2017. Notwithstanding, MorGreen defendants did not contact current counsel until February 2, 2018, who did not file an appearance until March 14, 2018, who then waited until April 12, 2018, to file answer to plaintiffs' complaint and cross-claimant Vaughn's cross-claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The court additionally notes in assessing whether good cause exists, that the court directed MorGreen defendant to file sworn affidavit(s) attesting to the occasions where they contacted any lawyer in furtherance of securing representation, including dates of correspondence to and from counsel/firm and any required performance and subsequent compliance to undertake representation, as well as identifying the dates of any communication with counsel for a party to this action. Despite this directive, defendants' supplemental response failed to provide all the information requested. Defendants omitted dates that supposed communications with potential counsel occurred and the details regarding representation, including performance terms, defendants' performance deadline, or whether defendants timely satisfied performance obligations. Additionally, while defendant Green claims to have spoken only with counsel for cross-claimant Vaughn, excluding emailed communications with plaintiffs' counsel, no substance or dates of communications were provided. (DE 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Turning to the final factor, although MorGreen defendants offer no alternatives, the court recognizes that there are less drastic alternatives to entry of default favored in this circuit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lolatchy v. Arthur Murray, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1677985\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/816/951/#p953\">\n    816 F.2d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 953 (4th Cir. 1987) (\"The attorney, for example, could have been charged with all costs and expenses attendant to the delay, including attorneys' fees, or even held in contempt of court.\"). However, even noting the Fourth Circuit's \"policy in favor of merits-based adjudication\" and disfavor of default judgment,\n   <em>\n    Colleton Preparatory Acad.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049574\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/413/#p417\">\n    616 F.3d at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the availability of less drastic alternatives to entry of default is not sufficient to set aside default where no other\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   factor weighs in favor of so doing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Accordingly, the court denies MorGreen defendants' motion to set aside default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   B. Cross-Claimant Vaughn's Motion for Entry of Default\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Cross-claimant Vaughn moves for entry of default as to their cross-claims against MorGreen defendants, which MorGreen defendants oppose for presumably the same reasons asserted in their motion to set aside default entered as to plaintiffs' claims. For the same reasons stated above, the court finds MorGreen defendants' opposition to entry to default as to cross-claimant Vaughn's cross-claims unavailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Accordingly, the court grants cross-claimant Vaughn's motion for entry of default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   C. Plaintiffs' and Cross-Claimant Vaughn's Motions to Strike Answer\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In parallel to seeking entry of default against MorGreen defendants, both plaintiffs and cross-claimant Vaughn have moved to strike MorGreen defendants' answer as untimely. MorGreen defendants were served with summons and complaint in August 2017 and filed answer on April 12, 2018, roughly seven and a half months later. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) permits the court to \"strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.\" Given the untimeliness of MorGreen defendants' answer and the court's holding regarding entry of default against MorGreen defendants, the court grants the motions to strike answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the court GRANTS cross-claimant Vaughn's motion for entry of default (DE 39), GRANTS plaintiffs' motion to strike answer (DE 54), DENIES MorGreen defendants' motion to set aside order on motion for entry of default (DE 57), and GRANTS cross-claimant Vaughn's motion to strike answer (DE 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   SO ORDERED, this the 29th day of November, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Plaintiffs' motion for default judgment is currently ripe and also pending before the court. (DE 46). Where it appears cross-claimant Vaughn will file motion for default judgment, the court will take up and address both plaintiffs' and cross-claimant Vaughn's motions for default judgment together under separate order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Nor do these allegations establish a valid cross-claim as to cross-claimant Vaughn, where cross-claimant Vaughn assert that MorGreen defendants breached the subcontract agreement entered into by those parties, provisions of which provide a basis for claims for indemnification and contribution against MorGreen defendants.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    As stated above, the court recognizes that it does not appear defendant Green is solely responsible. MorGreen defendants's attorney filed notice of appearance two days before plaintiffs' motion for entry of default was granted, although MorGreen defendants did not move to set aside that entry for roughly a month.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Plaintiffs have submitted email documentation that on August 25, 2017, defendant Green emailed plaintiffs' counsel stating only \"In reference to the list of mediators, I would like to choose Steven Dunn in Charlotte, NC,\" to which plaintiffs' counsel responded \"Mr. Green, Are you represented by counsel? If so, please advise immediately.\" (DE 28-4). The court additionally notes that although the court directed defendant Green to discuss this communication, affidavit submitted by defendant Green makes no mention of this interaction. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    DE 67 at 1-2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    MorGreen defendants argue that \"if the Court finds that Defendant has not shown good cause or excusable neglect, default judgment should not be entered and the matter should be heard on its merits,\" citing to\n    <em>\n     Consol. Masonry &amp; Fireproofing, Inc. v. Wagman Const. Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2078582\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/383/249/#p252\">\n     383 F.2d 249\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 252 (4th Cir. 1967), wherein the court found the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing evidentiary hearings although the entry of default was not set aside. (DE 68 at 2). For all the reasons stated above, the court declines to so order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The court's assessment of the\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n    factors with regard to plaintiffs and cross-claimant Vaughn is the same excepting factor two, whether MorGreen defendants acted promptly. Here, entry of default as to cross-claimant Vaughn's cross-claims has not yet been entered. However, because the court found this factor with regard to plaintiffs was of minor consequence, that this factor is of even less consequence with regard to cross-claimant Vaughn does not impact the court's overall assessment. No one\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n    factor is dispositive.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Colleton Prep.
