Cheyer Patents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendants (other than Google) argue that the Cheyer patents are directed to an abstract idea. The Amazon defendants allege that the Cheyer patents are directed to the abstract idea of \"breaking tasks down and delegating them to appropriate actors.\" (D.I. 36 at 17). Defendant Microsoft asserts that the abstract idea is \"retrieving electronic data in response to a request.\" (C.A. 18-01, D.I. 18 at 7). Plaintiff counters that the Cheyer patents \"are directed to specific technologic processes to overcome the shortcomings of prior art systems with improvements to software architecture in distributed computing environments that advance computer-user interfaces over the then-existing state of the art and improve the computer's ability to complete tasks for users.\" (D.I. 37 at 18). For the reasons stated below, I conclude that the Cheyer patents are not directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Improvements to efficiency and scalability in task completion in distributed computing environments \"can be a non-abstract computer-functionality improvement if done by a specific technique that departs from earlier approaches to solve a specific computer problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Ancora Techs., Inc. v.

Cir. 2018) ). The Cheyer patents describe a specific software architecture that employs facilitators for delegation and coordination, construction of arbitrarily complex goals, an expandable inter-agent communication language, service-providing agents and a distributed process where no single agent defines the set of possible inputs. ( '115 patent col. 5:3-9, col. 8:40-55). Moreover, the Cheyer patents \"expressly disclose and claim inventive improvements over then-existing OAA technology.\" (D.I. 37 at 21). For example, the specification of the '115 patent states, \"The agent library preferably minimizes the effort required to construct a new system and maximizes the ease with which legacy systems can be 'wrapped' and made compatible with the agent-based architecture of the present invention.\" ( '115 patent col. 7:48-52). The agent library also enables the incorporation of new agents \"without any need to revise code for the facilitator, the natural language agents, or any other client agents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col. 8:45-49). \"[A] single request can produce cooperation and flexible communication among many agents, written in different programming languages and spread across multiple machines.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   col. 8:52-55). These are problems the Cheyer patents identify with prior art technologies in distributed computing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267136\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/879/1299/#p1304\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   col. 3:24-27 (\"restriction of the [distributed object-oriented programming] approach is that the interactions among objects are fixed through explicitly coded instructions\"); col. 3:53-58 (disadvantages of mobile agent are programmatic specificity of agent interactions, lack of coordination support, and execution environment irregularities); col 4:13-16 (blackboard architecture does not allow programmatic control to refer to a specific process during computation); col. 4:37-55 (previous agent based technologies and architectures are limited in the extent to which agents can specify complex goals, influence strategies used by the facilitator, integrate human agents, deal with compound goals, and in system scalability) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Moreover, the Cheyer patents lay out specific structures by which these improvements in functionality are achieved. Claim 61 of the '115 patent discloses a \"facilitator agent\" which coordinates cooperative task completion by (1) using an agent registry, (2) parsing a service requesting order, (3) interpreting a compound goal according to an Interagent\n   Communication language, and (4) constructing a goal satisfaction plan. Claim 52 of the '560 patent describes the method by which tasks are delegated and Claim 1 of the '128 patent describe the construction of the distributed computing layout as a whole. The specific structures and methods laid out in these claims provide concrete improvements in the underlying computer technology over the prior art. Interactions between objects are not fixed through explicitly coded instructions; coordination support is provided by the facilitating agent; a user may refer to a specific process when making its request; the system does not need to be rewritten when new agents are added; agents can influence strategies used by the facilitator; and the system provides more flexibility in dealing with compound goals. Therefore, these claims are directed to improvements of the underlying computer functionality in a distributed computing environment, not to the abstract idea of \"retrieving electronic data in response to a request\" or \"breaking tasks down and delegating information to appropriate actors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Defendants argue that the Cheyer specifications do not explain or state how a facilitator engine performs certain tasks. However, as Plaintiff correctly states, \"whether a patent specification teaches an ordinarily skilled artisan how to implement the claimed invention presents an enablement issue, not an eligibility issue...\"\n   <em>\n    Visual Mem.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275598\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1253/#p1259\">\n    867 F.3d at 1260-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the patent claims specifically state that the facilitating engine \"construct[s] a goal satisfaction plan by using reasoning that includes one or more of domain-independent coordination strategies, domain-specific reasoning, and application-specific reasoning.\" ( '115 Patent col. 35:23-27). While Defendants argue this language is a black-box, the language does incorporate the improvements on prior art. Specifically, the facilitating engine's claimed use of these different strategies enables (1) the facilitating agent to provide coordination support (by using a domain-independent coordination strategy), (2) a user to refer to a specific process when making its request (by using domain-specific reasoning), and (3) the agents to influence the strategies used by the facilitator agent (by using application-specific reasoning). Thus, the Cheyer patents claim specific improvements over the prior art.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Cheyer patents, therefore, are not directed to an abstract idea and the Court need not address\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   Step Two for the Cheyer patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(D.I. 30 \u00b6\u00b6 97-106, 111-12, 130, 132-34, 136, 153). These allegations add no new factual information for the Court to consider in determining whether the claims contain an inventive concept. Additionally, a significant percentage of Plaintiff's new factual\n   allegations simply recite the prosecution history of the Halverson patents. (D.I. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 115-25, 138-47, 155-65). These paragraphs of the Complaint allege facts such as the number of prior art references the Halverson patents were issued over, the number of times the Halverson patents have been cited as prior art since being issued, and the examiners' recitations of why they found the Halverson patents to be novel. However, these types of facts are not properly considered in determining a motion to dismiss for patent ineligibility under \u00a7 101. Every patent that is issued is generally (and often specifically) issued over prior art references and is found to be novel. Moreover, as Defendants correctly point out, citations are no measure of whether the patent is directed to an abstract idea or an inventive concept. (D.I. 36 at 113 n.3 (\"one of the patents invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   has been cited 325 times\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The remaining factual allegations also do not change the results of the inventive concept determination.

Paragraphs 107 and 108 together assert that the construction of a navigation query results in \"improvements to computer functionality and technological processes including increased efficiency and speed-and they achieve these technological benefits by fundamentally changing the manner in which a user interfaces and interacts with computer technology itself.\" (D.I. 33 \u00b6 108). However, no portion of the claims or specification cited shows how the construction of a navigation query results in increased efficiency or speed in computer functionality.

As I previously held, neither the claims nor the specification teach how to construct a navigation query.\n   <em>\n    IPA Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524920\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/356/#p364\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, the specification clearly states that persons of ordinary skill in the art will be thoroughly familiar with how to do so. ( '021 patent col 9:9-14). Therefore, the construction of the navigation query alone cannot support the allegations of increased efficiency or speed giving rise to an inventive concept. The language of these paragraphs seems to suggest that it is the use of spoken language and the interpretation of the spoken request to construct the navigation query that creates the increased convenience, efficiency, and speed. However, nowhere does the specification or claims explain how the invention renders an interpretation of the spoken request to increase convenience, efficiency, and speed of the computer functionality. Instead, the specification states that speech recognition (i.e., rendering an interpretation of the spoken request) can be achieved by \"[a] variety of commercial quality speech recognition engines, [which] are readily available on the market, as practitioners will know.\" ( '021 patent at 7:19-31). The allegations of improvements to computer functionality in paragraphs 107-08 are therefore contradicted by the claims and the specification and cannot be credited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiff also includes new allegations that the multimodal feedback approach included in the claims improves computer functionality by creating faster searches. (D.I. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 109-10). However, as I previously held,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   At the level the claims are drafted, the multi-modal feedback essentially requires gathering additional data in a non-spoken modality and using the data to modify the initial navigation query, without further limitation as to how this is accomplished in the context of generating a navigation query from a spoken request. Refining search terms in a database\n   query does not qualify as inventive, even if for the purpose of error correction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    IPA Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524920\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/356/#p364\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A mere increase in the speed of a process cannot be an inventive concept where the technology is conventional, and the ordered combination of steps using that conventional technology is not shown to be inventive.\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055438\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1363/#p1367\">\n    792 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1367 ;\n   <em>\n    IPA Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524920\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/356/#p364\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Similarly, paragraphs 113, 135, and 154 of the amended complaint assert that the claimed \"speech-based navigation method\" in the Halverson patents \"provide[s] significant benefits and improvements to the capacity and underlying computer functionality over their prior art navigation methods-namely, increased speed, convenience, and efficiency in creating a proper query to search an electronic data source and providing information requested by a user, as well as a greater degree of freedom for users to use and the navigation system to accept and process an expanded set of intuitive inputs.\" (D.I. 33 \u00b6 113, 135, 154). However, these allegations cannot overcome the specifications' continued references to using conventional technology to implement the claims, nor do the claim elements as an ordered combination impart an inventive concept. The steps of the claimed method are the basic steps used to navigate an electronic method. The ordered combination of the \"speech-based navigation method\" claimed is the only logical sequence of steps that could be followed to achieve the result. As I found previously, \"any changes to their ordering would render the claims useless for accomplishing their goal.\"\n   <em>\n    IPA Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524920\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/356/#p364\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, there is nothing unconventional or inventive about the ordered combination of steps. Moreover, because the ordered combination of the claim elements is not inventive, the alleged improvements of convenience, efficiency, and speed attributed to the method cannot confer an inventive concept upon the combination either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Finally, paragraphs 126, 148, and 166 of the amended complaint allege facts surrounding the priority dates of the Halverson patents. Specifically, these paragraphs allege, \"The technology disclosed and claimed ... was not then well-understood, routine, or conventional,\" because the first device marketed as a smartphone was not announced until 2000, the first mobile camera phone came to the United States in 2002, and the first mobile phone with any text to speech capability was not released until late 2004. (D.I. 33 \u00b6\u00b6 126, 148, 166). However, as previously discussed, the Halverson \"specification is replete with references to implementing the claims using conventional technology.\"\n   <em>\n    IPA Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524920\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/356/#p364\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d at 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These references directly contradict Plaintiff's allegations in the amended complaint. Moreover, the method claimed in the Halverson patents does not confer an inventive concept, even combined with the factual allegations in the amended complaint. A method reciting the high-level, basic steps of electronic database navigation in the only logical sequence to achieve the function and using well-understood, routine, and conventional technology to do so cannot be unconventional or inventive. Therefore, these paragraphs cannot infer an inventive concept when the Halverson patents themselves make clear that the technology is not inventive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Because the claims of the Halverson patents are directed to the abstract idea of \"retrieving electronic data in response to a spoken request and transmitting the retrieved data to a user\" and do not contain an inventive concept, the Court finds that the claims are patent ineligible under \u00a7 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

In these related cases, Defendants Microsoft Corporation and Google LLC have filed Motions to Dismiss and provided additional briefing. (C.A. No. 18-01, D.I. 17, 18, 19, 30; C.A.

My previous order was not a final judgment on the merits, as it was without prejudice and with leave to amend. Moreover, Plaintiff's previous voluntary dismissal in another case does not transform the Court's previous order into a final judgment.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Camesi v.
