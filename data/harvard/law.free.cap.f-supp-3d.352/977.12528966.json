CHEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff is Service Women's Action Network (\"SWAN\") a nonprofit \"to support, connect and advocate for all military women, including current service members, but also veterans and future enlisted women.\" Docket No. 122 \u00b6 13. Defendant is the Secretary of the Department of Defense, James N. Mattis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. SWAN challenges as unconstitutional the \"Leaders First\" policy for the Army and Marines Corps, as well as the segregated training for the Marine Corps.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6, 8. The Secretary moved for a motion to dismiss arguing that SWAN lacked both organizational and associational standing, and that SWAN has not stated a claim upon which relief can be granted. Docket No. 127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court finds that SWAN has organizational standing to challenge both these policies. However, SWAN has failed to plead facts to establish associational standing to bring a claim on behalf of its members to challenge the \"Leaders First\" policy. SWAN has pled facts to establish associational standing to challenge the Marine Corps' segregated basic training. SWAN is granted leave to amend its Third Amended Complaint (\"TAC\") to allege factual allegations that it has a member who would have standing to challenge the \"Leaders First\" policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court also finds that SWAN has stated a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The original complaint in this matter was filed on November 11, 2012. Docket No. 1. The original complaint challenged the Department of Defense's 1994 policy that excluded women from ground combat. Docket No. 1 \u00b6 1. On January 24, 2013, the Secretary of Defense at the time rescinded the 1994 policy, and stated that the integration of women into combat positions and units must be completed by January 1, 2016. Docket No. 66 at 1. However, on April 28, 2016, the parties in this matter filed a joint case management statement indicating that the \"Leaders First\" policy would be implemented; this policy requires establishing women leaders into the previously\n   closed units before junior enlisted women are able to join those units. Docket No. 75 at 9-17. The Leaders First policy, adopted by the Army and Marine Corps, \"preclude the assignment of women soldiers and Marines to a company-level unit until two or more women 'leaders' are assigned to the unit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. The Armed Services assert that the \" 'Leaders First' policy furthers the goal of gender integration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   SWAN pleads that this policy\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) deprives junior enlisted servicewomen access to the full range of positions available to their male colleagues, because they are only able to be assigned to combat units in which women \"leaders\" are installed; (2) deprives women \"leaders\" access to the full range of positions in combat units because they are assigned based on the needs of the \"Leaders First\" policy; (3) communicates to male servicemembers and leaders in combat units that they have little or no responsibility for the development and advancement of servicewomen; (4) places unusual and unnecessary burdens on junior enlisted women, who are often required to ignore chain of command norms in order to seek counsel from their designated female \"leaders\"; (5) places unusual and unnecessary burdens on women \"leaders,\" who are required to divert attention from their own professional development in their new roles in combat units to mentor and supervise junior enlisted women; and (6) causes resentment among male soldiers in combat units.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Similarly, the Marine Corps \"continue to segregate recruits for basic training into same-gender platoons. The Marine Corps is the only service branch that separates training along gender lines.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. SWAN claims that this policy is unconstitutional because it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1) is premised on stereotypes about women's aptitude for military service; (2) deprives women of equal opportunity for training and mentorship, thus impairing their ability to successfully meet gender-neutral physical standards for their contracted MOSs and thereby to continue their training in those specialties; and (3) teaches male recruits and leaders to regard servicewomen as in need of protection, incapable of competing on equal footing with men, and otherwise as second-class members of the Marine Corps.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 18, 2017, SWAN filed a Second Amended Complaint. Docket No. 107. On February 2, 2018, the Secretary filed a motion to dismiss for improper venue, lack of justiciability, and lack of standing. Docket No. 110. The Court granted the motion to dismiss on the grounds that SWAN lacked standing, but rejected the Secretary's arguments as to improper venue and lack of justiciability. Docket No. 118. Following the Court's order granting the Secretary's motion to dismiss, SWAN filed the TAC. Docket No. 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The TAC states that SWAN's goals include the empowerment and promotion of servicewomen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. SWAN describes its main areas of focus as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) unifying servicewomen as a nationwide community, through in-person events and online engagement; (2) connecting servicewomen with the resources they and their families need, primarily through building partnerships with other organizations; and (3) amplifying the voices of servicewomen by advocating for them on a wide range of issues, by participating in coalitions, conducting a national survey on the needs\n   of women in the military, and educating members of Congress as to those needs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In furtherance of its goals, SWAN engages in the following activities: (a) fielding on average ten phone calls, Facebook posts, and emails per month from servicewomen looking for assistance with legal services and other issues; (b) seeking partnerships and coalition building with other organizations that assist women veterans; (c) creating a database of services for women in the military; (d) keeping Congress informed on issues related to women in the military by having educational Hill visits for its members; (e) developing a three-year strategic plan which includes \"establishing a 501(c)(4) arm, increase and diversify funding sources, to create an online Resource Portal, to develop strategic partnerships with other organizations that can provide resources to servicewomen, and to develop a prioritized engagement plan that sets forth how SWAN will educate and mobilize key stakeholders and members to support professional growth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   SWAN asserts that the policies at issue have forced it to \"divert its resources from direct advocacy promoting servicewomen and their needs during and after active service to engagement and advocacy regarding the gender segregation policies and practices that are the subject of this suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. SWAN contends that it has been forced to redirect \"its limited resources and limited staff hours to answering questions from women who seek to enter combat roles, who are entering these roles under the 'Leaders First' policy, or who are experiencing or who have experience the segregated Marine Corps training.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   SWAN pleads that its servicewomen members describe concerns about career advancement and opportunities because of \"Leaders First\" and the Marine Corps segregated training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   SWAN claims that these two policies have led to harassment from male counterparts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The TAC states that to cope with these inquiries and concerns, it must devote many hours of limited staff time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Additionally, \"in direct response to concerns raised through SWAN's Facebook page, SWAN staff held (and sponsored) a one-day 'Trailblazers Workshop' in Fort Hood, Texas in order to support the first class recruits trained for Army infantry roles at Fort Hood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. This workshop was to \"support and connect these infantry women in their day-to-day struggles, and to brainstorm how to deal with the ramifications of the 'Leaders First' policy and the continuing barriers and stigmatizations it creates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. SWAN expressed an intention to hold another workshop in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   SWAN claims that approximately 15% of its staff's work hours have been spent addressing concerns regarding the policies at issue in this matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. SWAN has been forced to divert resources for \"reaching out to Congress and other policymakers to advocate against these policies and practices, or connecting servicewomen to resources or networks that they need as they attempt to navigate military careers under these policies and practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But for the policies at issue here, SWAN believes it would be able to spend its time and resources focusing on its strategic plan rather than wasting valuable time combatting the effects of these policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"SWAN is a membership organization.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. SWAN's membership is comprised of servicewomen that communicate with SWAN through Facebook, phone calls, emails and through its monthly e-newsletter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the TAC, SWAN shared\n   stories of how these policies have impacted its members.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   For example, with respect to \"Leaders First,\" SWAN has a member who is an Infantry Platoon Leader in the Army National Guard. Because of the \"Leaders First\" policy, this member was treated differently from her male counterparts by being denied the ability to take inactive guard status for six months at the beginning of her service while she completed the civilian training required for her job as a Denver Police Officer. This in turn led to her not being able to participate fully in the training of her National Guard cohort, which caused her to be perceived as getting different treatment from her male counterparts and ultimately ranked last as a Platoon Leader in the cohort.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. SWAN also explained that members in the Marine Corps suffer harassment and stigmatization as a result of the segregated training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. The TAC quotes one SWAN member explaining that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The purpose of boot camp is to break down recruits by stripping them of their individuality, to form a team, to listen to superiors and act on their command without questions, and to \"make Marines.\" The male experience is different in that misogyny, sexism, gender bias and the general hate that women have infiltrated their boys' club are taught during segregated boot camp and reinforced in male-only units.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794847\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/624/1083/#p1088\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Similarly, SWAN argues that because of \"Leaders First,\" junior enlisted women are limited to certain units and positions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. The TAC states that with respect to the National Guard only two states (Colorado and New Hampshire) have met the requirements for \"Leaders First.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. SWAN contends that the \"Leaders First\" policy relegates \"women, literally and figuratively, to a 'supporting role' in our Armed Forces based on stereotypes about women and assumptions about battlefield conditions that do not reflect the reality that women are already serving in combat situations, and doing so with distinction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. The segregated training, SWAN believes, fosters an environment that leads to an increased likelihood of sexual harassment and sexual assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The TAC discusses how these policies are based in part on \"animus towards servicewomen on the part of the DoD and the Administration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On August 8, 2018, the Secretary filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the TAC must be dismissed because SWAN lacks standing and failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Docket No. 127. On September 27, 2018, the Court heard arguments from both parties on these two issues. Docket No. 133. The Court found that SWAN has standing to bring this cause of action and has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Secretary challenges SWAN's standing to bring this action. The Court previously addressed the issue of standing and dismissed the Second Amended Complaint because SWAN failed to plead sufficient facts showing organizational standing or associational standing. Docket No. 118 at 18-22. The Court specifically found that SWAN's allegations of standing were too conclusory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22 (\"SWAN does not provide any specificity in describing (1) from what and (2) to what its resources have been reallocated.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   To establish standing, a party must allege factual allegations showing the three requirements for standing are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

Docket No. 122 \u00b6 14. Importantly, SWAN alleges in some detail how it has been forced to divert resources in response to these policies. For example, SWAN has alleged that \"because of the policies and practices that are the subject of this suit, SWAN has had to redirect its limited resources and limited staff hours to answering questions from women who seek to enter combat roles, who are entering these roles under the 'Leaders First' policy, or who are experiencing or who have experienced the segregated Marine Corps training.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. SWAN also alleges that the services it provides to its members is impeded because \"approximately 15% of its staff's work hours have been spent addressing concerns regarding the policies at issue in this matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Not only has SWAN had to divert resources towards fielding questions from members in these programs, but \"in direct response to concerns raised through SWAN's Facebook page, SWAN staff held (and sponsored) a one-day 'Trailblazers Workshop' in Fort Hood, Texas in order to support the first class recruits trained for Army infantry roles at Fort Hood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. This workshop was directly focused on how women can deal with the \"ramifications of the 'Leaders First' policy and the continuing barriers and stigmatizations it creates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Pac. Properties &amp; Dev.

In this case, SWAN has similarly been forced to divert its scarce resources to fielding phone calls and putting on a workshop to combat the negative effects of the policies. But for the two policies at issue here, it would have used its limited budget towards its strategic plan. Docket No. 122 \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As the cases above demonstrate, such a specific allegation of diversion of resources suffices to establish organizational standing. Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has specifically found that diversion of resources for \"outreach campaigns\" and educating the public establishes a diversion of resources sufficient to establish organizational standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cegavske\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340464\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/800/1032/#p1039\">\n    800 F.3d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that \"The [Supreme] Court has also made clear that a diversion-of-resources injury is sufficient to establish organizational standing at the pleading stage, even when it is 'broadly alleged.' \");\n   <em>\n    Pac.

The TAC pleads a plausible claim for relief under the Equal Protection Clause sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Secretary's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court finds that SWAN has alleged sufficient facts to establish organizational standing to challenge both policies and associational standing to challenge the Marine Corps' segregated training policy. SWAN has not sufficiently alleged associational standing to challenge the Leaders First policy but is given thirty (30) days to amend. The Court also finds that SWAN has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted. For these reason, the Secretary's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This order disposes of Docket No. 127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The Secretary presents for the first time in his Reply Brief the argument that\n    <em>\n     Gill v. Whitford\n    </em>\n    prevents the Court from addressing the issues raised in this matter. He argues that because \"the Supreme Court found that a citizen did not have standing to challenge a gerrymandered district in a neighboring district within the citizen's state of residence\" the Court cannot find standing here where \"a Washington, D.C. based advocacy group, seeks to establish its standing without alleging that it has suffered any diversion of resources within the Northern District of California or even within the State of California.\" Docket No. 129 at 5 n.3. This belatedly raised argument is waived. In any event, it is without merit. The Court has already addressed the issue of venue in this case. Docket No. 118.\n    <em>\n     Gill v. Whitford\n    </em>\n    was not an organizational standing case. The question of organizational standing addressed herein is distinct from the question of venue. In\n    <em>\n     Gill\n    </em>\n    , no plaintiff could establish injury - the Court found that \"not a single plaintiff sought to prove that he or she lives in a cracked or packed district\" and therefore plaintiffs were unable to show any injury.\n    <em>\n     Gill v. Whitford\n    </em>\n    , --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1932\">\n     138 S.Ct. 1916\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1932,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/#p1932\">\n     201 L.Ed.2d 313\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2018). Lack of injury, not venue, was the issue. In the same footnote in his reply brief, the Secretary belatedly argues that \"as a practical matter it is also difficult to see how the Court's exercise of jurisdiction over the Marine Corps policies at issue could square with the Ninth Circuit's recent decision in\n    <em>\n     City &amp; Cty. of S.F. v.

The Secretary appears to assert that the Court cannot hear this matter because courts are barred from issuing nationwide injunctive relief; however, that is not the holding of that case. The Ninth Circuit stated \"[w]e are unpersuaded by the Administration's arguments in favor of a blanket restriction on all nationwide injunctions. And we do not wish to interfere with the district court's considerable discretion in ordering an appropriate equitable remedy.\" City &amp; Cty. of San Francisco,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517815\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/897/1225/\">\n     897 F.3d at 1244-45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The Court rejects SWAN's argument that under 12(g) the Secretary cannot raise a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because of a previous motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. The Ninth Circuit has held that \"[d]enying late-filed Rule 12(b)(6) motions and relegating defendants to the three procedural avenues specified in Rule 12(h)(2) can produce unnecessary and costly delays, contrary to the direction of Rule 1.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Apple Iphone Antitrust Litig.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125774\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/313/#p318\">\n     846 F.3d 313\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 318 (9th Cir. 2017),\n    <em>\n     cert. granted sub nom.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Apple Inc. v.

In light of the Ninth Circuit's approach to late filed motions, the Court will consider the Secretary's 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    SWAN seeks to include statements made by the Secretary after the filing of the TAC. Docket No. 132. SWAN requests under Local Rule 7-3(d) leave from the Court to submit an article and transcript of public statements made by the Secretary. Local Rule 7-3(d) states that \"[o]nce a reply is filed, no additional memoranda, papers or letters may be filed without prior Court approval,\" except: \"[i]f new evidence has been submitted in the reply, the opposing party may file and serve an Objection to Reply Evidence\", or a Statement of Recent Decision. L.R. 7-3(d). SWAN does not assert that the transcript is in response to new evidence presented in the Secretary's Reply Brief, nor is this a Statement of Recent Decision. Therefore, the Court denies SWAN's request for leave to file additional statements by the Secretary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The Secretary in its motion to dismiss includes at least fifteen footnotes of various links for the Court to accept as true for the purposes of a motion to dismiss. Docket No. 127. The Secretary does so without properly requesting the Court judicially notice these documents. Additionally, the Ninth Circuit recently found that it was an abuse of discretion to judicially notice content that is subject to different interpretations, as many of the Secretary's cited footnotes require.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518146\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/988/#p1000\">\n     899 F.3d 988\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1000 (9th Cir. 2018). For these reason, the Court grants the one lone request to judicially notice the fact that \"President Trump, Secretary Mattis and Gen. (ret.) Kelly were not members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on January 9, 2013.\" Docket No. 127 at 16 n. 9. The remaining citations that the Secretary cited to without a request for judicial notice shall be ignored by the Court for the purposes of the motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
