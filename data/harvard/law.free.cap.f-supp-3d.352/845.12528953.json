(Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6 1.) Jamestown and Union Bank are a Tennessee corporation and bank, respectively, with the same principal place of business in Jamestown, Tennessee. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 2.) On May 20, 2015, Security National issued Policy No. SDO111557-01 (the \"Security Policy\"), a Directors and Officers liability insurance policy, to Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 7.) The Security Policy ran through May 20, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Insuring Agreement D of the Policy is subject to a $1,000,000 limit of liability and a $25,000 retention. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 8.)

Lending wrongful act includes the servicing of loans for others under a contract or agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Insuring Agreement E is subject to a $2,000,000 limit of liability and a $25,000 retention.

However, the insured person or the company shall be indemnified for defense expenses as to any claim alleging such fraudulent, dishonest or criminal actions, unless a judgment or final adjudication establishes such fraudulent, dishonest or criminal acts or if such acts are otherwise established in fact. In the event that the Insurer has no liability, the insured person or the company agrees to repay to the Insurer, upon demand, all monies advanced by the Insurer in connection with such claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 14.)

For the purposes of this exclusion, \"willful\" means acting with reckless disregard of such laws, orders or regulations. However, the insured person or the company shall be indemnified for defense expenses as to any claim alleging such willful failure unless a judgment or final adjudication establishes such willful failure or if such willful failure is otherwise established in fact. In the event that the Insurer has no liability, the insured person and the company agree to repay to the Insurer, upon demand, all monies advanced by the Insurer in connection with such claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 15.) Finally, Exclusion A.13 excludes coverage for \"the assumption of any liability to defend, indemnify or hold harmless any person or entity, other than an insured person, under any written contract or agreement unless such liability would have been imposed in the absence of such contract or agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Underlying State Tort Lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In November 2017, Lester and Ruth Clark (the \"Clarks\") filed a lawsuit against Union Bank in Overton County Circuit Court (the \"Clark Lawsuit\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 20.) The Clark Lawsuit alleges that Union Bank failed to acquire or maintain insurance on certain real property owned by Danielle Akard (\"Akard\"). More specifically, the Clarks alleged that they (1) sold the property at issue to Akard and retained a first priority lien as security for seller financing they provided to Akard; (2) Union Bank provided a loan to Akard and secured it with a second priority lien on the property; and (3) Union Bank agreed to provide insurance on the property for protection of the Clarks' and its' respective interests; and (4) Union Bank failed to obtain that insurance. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6\u00b6 22-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is not necessary for the Court to delve too deeply into the relationship between the Clarks and Akard here, nor to discuss at too great length the disputed events surrounding the alleged lack of property insurance. In short, at some point, Akard defaulted on her loan to Union Bank, and the bank moved to foreclose. The Clarks then allegedly learned that the bank had failed to maintain property insurance, a matter of apparent great concern given the Clarks' alleged concern about Akard's potential \"vindictive\" behavior. (Doc. No. 1-3 at 2.) Union Bank sought to secure insurance, but allegedly erroneously did not list the Clarks as insureds. After all this, in December 2016, the subject property burned to the ground under allegedly \"mysterious circumstances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The Clarks have been unable to obtain property insurance reimbursement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 1-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Underlying State Tort Lawsuit and Instant Insurance Coverage Dispute\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Clark Lawsuit asserts causes of action for promissory estoppel, breach of contract, misrepresentation, negligence, subrogration/constructive trust, and other violations of Tennessee statutes. (Doc. No. 1-2.) On March 9, 2018, Security National denied coverage to Defendants under the Security Policy for the Clark Lawsuit on the grounds of, among other things, Exclusion C. Security National specifically asserted that: (1) the Clark Lawsuit alleged that Union Bank \"was negligent regarding insurance on the property\"; (2) \"the entirety of the Complaint concern[ed] a loan made by Union Bank, foreclosure proceedings on its collateral, and insurance proceeds it may have received when its collateral was damaged\"; (3) under the Security Policy, a Lending Wrongful Act includes misconduct \"concern[ing]\" a loan made by Union Bank; (4) Lending Wrongful Acts are covered under Insuring Agreement D of the Security Policy; (5) certain Lending Wrongful Acts are excluded under Exclusion C of the Security Policy, including claims arising out of \"failure to effect or maintain any insurance or bond\"; and (6) the Clark Lawsuit unquestionably involves the failure to effect or maintain insurance. (Doc. No. 1-3 at 3-4.) Accordingly, because Security National concluded that the entirety of the Clarks' complaint sought damages related to the alleged failure to maintain insurance, it declined any duty to indemnify Union Bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 4.)

Oct. 30, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has established guidelines for district courts deciding whether to exercise\n   discretionary jurisdiction over a declaratory relief action. \"In determining the propriety of entertaining a declaratory judgment action, competing state and federal interests weigh in the balance, with courts particularly reluctant to entertain federal declaratory judgment actions premised on diversity jurisdiction in the face of a previously-filed state-court action.\"\n   <em>\n    Adrian Energy Assocs. v.

In insurance cases (like this one), the Court of Appeals has sometimes held that \"declaratory judgment actions seeking an advance opinion on indemnity issues are seldom helpful in resolving an ongoing action in another court.\"\n   <em>\n    Manley, Bennett, McDonald &amp; Co. v.

While not required to do so by the Security Policy (Doc. No. 1-1 at 26), Security National offered to defend Defendants in the Clark Lawsuit and file a declaratory judgment action. This is a logical course of action, and one that is contemplated by the Security Policy (Doc. No. 1-1 at 26), because Security National could be involved in the handling of Defendants' tort claims in the Clark Lawsuit to protect Security National's interests in the event it was ultimately found to have coverage obligations. However, Defendants went the route of filing a third-party complaint against Security National. As Judge Trauger observed, however, the Tennessee state court is highly likely to focus on the liability disputes between the parties before turning to the question of insurance coverage.\n   <em>\n    Cincinatti Ins.

With regard to the first factor, in the context of actions seeking a declaration of the scope of insurance coverage, the Sixth Circuit has recognized that such\n   questions can sometimes be resolved as a matter of law and do not require factual findings by a state court.\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n    513 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   560 ;\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10550172\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/825/1061/#p1066\">\n    825 F.2d at 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This action therefore does not implicate the resolution of extensive factual issues because the complaint in the Clark Lawsuit speaks for itself. The interpretation of the Security Policy is not a complicated exercise. Finally, neither party has argued that this coverage dispute involves any novel or unsettled questions of state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this way, this case is distinguishable, for example, from\n   <em>\n    Travelers\n   </em>\n   , relied upon by Defendants.

However, the Court is mindful that the Court of Appeals has quite consistently leaned toward the view that \"interpretation of ... insurance contracts is guided by state public policy,\" and concluded that state courts are in a somewhat better position to resolve insurance disputes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n    513 F.3d at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, given the finding that only one of the three sub-factors counsels in favor of yielding to the state courts, the Court concludes that the fourth\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   factor does not clearly require declining jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Whether There is an Alternative Remedy That is Better or More Effective\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In just a few sentences, Defendants suggest that the Clark Lawsuit is a better remedy because Security National has been made a party to that case. Security National responds that the Clark Lawsuit is no better and potentially a worse because it will require Security National to \"sit by and ... wait.\" (Doc. No. 18 at 12-13.) Indeed, a district court should only \"deny declaratory relief if an alternative remedy is\n   <em>\n    better or more effective\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648811\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/746/323/#p326\">\n    746 F.2d at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). That being said, the Sixth Circuit also avoids a rigid application of this factor. \"[I]nquiry [ ] must be fact specific, involving consideration of the whole package of options available to the federal declaratory plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n    513 F.3d at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court sees no alternative remedy that presents a notably more attractive option. As discussed above, the Tennessee court is no better situated than this court to resolve the questions at issue. Just as important are concerns that Security National \"could be dragged along for a long and expensive ride before the issue of its coverage obligations is determined in the state court litigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cincinatti Ins.

Because Security National has no clearly superior options to this action, the court finds that the fifth\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   factor is at least neutral and at most supports the Court's exercise of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Balancing the Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Sixth Circuit has \"never indicated how the\n   <em>\n    Grand Trunk\n   </em>\n   factors should be balanced.\"\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165684\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/546/\">\n    513 F.3d at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
