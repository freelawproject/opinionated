Canadian Solar, and Trina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prelim I &amp; D\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The latter two submitted affiliate and customer certifications of non-use applicable to the period of review stating that U.S.-based customers had not benefitted from the EBCP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trina Section III Questionnaire Response at 75, P.D. 81-98 (May 3, 2016); Trina Benchmark Submission (BPI Version) at Ex. 10., C.D. 105-107 (Nov. 30, 2016); Canadian Solar Section III Questionnaire Response at Vol. II, Ex. 20, P.D. 116-22, C.D. 31-37 (June 10, 2016). The GOC, however, refused to provide information on potential third-party bank involvement in the EBCP,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that such information was irrelevant to Commerce's determination regarding whether the program had been used by the relevant parties.\n   <em>\n    I &amp; D Memo\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Unlike in the second administrative review,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which Commerce declined to apply an adverse inference with regard to facts otherwise available (\"AFA\") against otherwise cooperating respondents based on the GOC's refusal to provide requested EBCP information, Commerce here concluded that the intervening 2013 revisions\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the EBCP made Respondents' certifications of non-use insufficient to establish non-use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I &amp; D Memo\n   </em>\n   at 13;\n   <em>\n    Prelim. I &amp; D Memo\n   </em>\n   at 30-31. The 2013 change to the program allowed for the involvement\n   of third party banks in the EBCP and Commerce reasoned that, given the GOC's refusal to answer questions regarding whether and how these banks extended credit, it was impossible to verify Respondents' certifications of non-use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I &amp; D Memo\n   </em>\n   at 13. Commerce found that \"[a]bsent the requested information, the GOC's claims that the respondent companies did not use this program [were] not reliable\" and therefore applied AFA to all parties in calculating the amount of subsidization based on the EBCP.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Trina and Canadian Solar argue that Commerce disregarded record evidence showing that they did not receive support from the EBCP. Trina Compl. at \u00b6 10; Trina Br. at 7-9; Canadian Solar Br. at 8-14. Canadian Solar further argued that it was improper to use AFA against a cooperating party and that Commerce's decision is arbitrary as it contradicts Commerce's previous rulings in similar situations. Canadian Solar Br. at 9, 12-13. Trina disputes Commerce's assertion that the non-use of third party banks was unverifiable and contends that Commerce could have requested further documentation on Trina's loans in order to verify non-use.

Canadian Solar argues that the affidavits of non-use were sufficient and no other documentation was necessary. Canadian Solar Br. at 10-12. Defendant claims that Commerce was correct in finding that respondents used the EBCP based on an adverse inference given the GOC's failure to cooperate fully, and that Commerce was under no obligation to attempt to verify Canadian Solar or Trina's submissions.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When an interested party \"withholds information that has been requested\" by Commerce, Commerce may need to \"use the facts otherwise available\" to reach a decision. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(A). Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) an adverse inference as to what such facts show may be used only if a party has failed to cooperate to the best of its ability, meaning that a party has failed to \"put forth its maximum effort to provide Commerce with full and complete answers to all inquiries in an investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Nippon Steel Corp. v.

As the court has previously held in a similar case, if a foreign government fails to cooperate in a countervailing duty case, Commerce may apply AFA even if the collateral effect is to \"adversely impact a cooperating party.\"\n   <em>\n    Archer Daniels Midland Co. v.

In addition to the lack of complete documentation of non-use, in that review Commerce supplied detailed reasoning for why documentation from the GOC was necessary.\n   <em>\n    Changzhou I I &amp; D Memo\n   </em>\n   at 91-94. Here, Commerce provided reasoning as to why the GOC's failure to respond adequately made it impossible for it to understand fully the operation of the EBCP, but it failed to show why a full understanding of the EBCP's operation was necessary to verify non-use certifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Guizhou\n   </em>\n   , as here, Commerce found that the GOC's refusal to explain if and how third-party banks were involved in the EBCP made respondent's claims of non-use unverifiable.\n   <em>\n    Certain New Pneumatic Off-the-Road Tires From the People's Republic of China: Final Results of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review; 2014\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2018%2C285\">\n    82 Fed.

In the Guizhou court's review of that determination, it found that the GOC's lack of response was \"rendered immaterial by responses from [respondents].\" 352 F.Supp.3d at 1269-71,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205307676\">\n    2018 WL 5307676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The court here does not resolve the materiality issue at this juncture, rather it finds that Commerce simply failed to provide reasoning sufficient for this court to find that its determination was supported by substantial evidence. In this case, Commerce claims its ability to verify the certifications was stymied by a lack of understanding of if and how third party banks were involved in the distribution of loans.\n   <em>\n    I &amp; D Memo\n   </em>\n   at 13. Commerce, however, did not explain why the GOC's failure to explain this program was necessary to assess claims of non-use and why other information accessible to respondents was insufficient to fill whatever gap was left by the GOC's refusal to provide internal bank records. Further, Commerce did not explain how an adverse inference regarding the operation of the EBCP logically leads to a finding that respondents used the program. The use of facts available allows Commerce to render determinations when information is missing and it may use an adverse inference if respondents fail to cooperate, but is\n   not permitted to skip either of these steps on the way to use of AFA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) Commerce may use AFA to choose among facts of record, but the choice must fill in the information that is actually missing. Further, although it is true that Commerce need not consider information submitted by respondents that cannot be verified, Commerce must first reasonably show that such information is, in fact, unverifiable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Papierfabrik August Koehler SE v.

Cir. 2016) (holding that if the requirements of \u00a7 1677m(e) are not met, Commerce need not consider information submitted by an interested party). What type of information requested from the GOC would have made these claims verifiable? And what information, such as loan agreements and other relevant documents ostensibly held by Respondents, might have sufficed to provide Commerce the assurance it needed? Commerce does not explain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, the court remands this matter and instructs Commerce to explain what information specifically the GOC failed to provide that led it to resort to facts available and the facts as to which it drew an adverse inference in arriving at the conclusion that Respondents benefited from the EBCP. Commerce should further explain if and how certifications of non-use are unverifiable in the absence of the GOC's cooperation. If Commerce determines that it is able to verify non-use by not unreasonably onerous means, the court instructs it to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Trina further argues that even if Commerce's normal preference for monthly average has merit, there is no way for Commerce to know whether Comtrade's monthly data more accurately reflects price fluctuations over time, because those\n   fluctuations may very well be caused by the irrelevant merchandise within the HTS subheadings.

Commerce employs a three-tiered hierarchy to determine the appropriate remuneration benchmark. In the absence of an undistorted tier one benchmark, e.g., an \"actual transaction [price] in the country in question,\" Commerce turns to a tier two benchmark, e.g., a \"world market price\" for goods in question.

This preference does not allow Commerce to include largely irrelevant data in its average of world market data sets. Put simply, not all flaws in data are equally problematic. Although some degree of nonspecificity is tolerable, when a dataset is vastly overinclusive of products not covered by the relevant CVD order, that flaw is not equivalent to the flaw in otherwise product-specific arising from its annual average. Here, Commerce made little effort to counter claims that Comtrade data was based on too broad a product category to provide an accurate world market price, stating only that Commerce was familiar with the data and that the HTS descriptions were suitable for constructing a world price for aluminum extrusions.\n   <em>\n    I &amp; D Memo\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. Although Commerce often has to use less than ideal data, here it has the option to use only seemingly product-specific data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Thus, the court concludes that Commerce's decision to average the Comtrade\n   and IHS datasets without properly considering whether the Comtrade data was too flawed to be probative of the world market price for the input at issue renders the decision unsupported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the court remands this case to Commerce with instructions either to use solely the IHS dataset in its calculation of the appropriate benchmark or else explain why the inclusion of the Comtrade data does not produce a fatally inaccurate result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Although under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) Commerce may, under certain circumstances, draw an adverse inference as to facts affecting a cooperating party, it should attempt to avoid doing so when adequate information exists elsewhere on the record that would avoid this collateral effect.\n   <em>\n    Archer\n   </em>\n   Daniels,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304516\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/917/1331/#p1342\">\n    917 F.Supp.2d 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 1342 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fine Furniture (Shanghai) Ltd. v.

Nothing in the record before the court indicates that Chinese manipulation of domestic transactions had any effect on arms-length import prices, and without such a determination, it is impossible to assess whether Commerce correctly resorted to a tier-two benchmark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Rather than address Canadian Solar's submissions, which Canadian Solar claims show that all polysilicon purchases involved \"arms-length import transactions with market economy suppliers,\" Commerce dismissed the evidence without consideration, stating simply that Commerce had already found actual transactions in China distorted. Canadian Solar Br. at 42;\n   <em>\n    I &amp; D Memo\n   </em>\n   at 31. This is circular. Commerce's determination that the actual transactions were distorted presupposed the appropriateness of applying a subsidy rate to these cooperating parties derived from application of AFA in finding there was a subsidy program. Simply stating that the market was distorted fails to give cooperating parties a meaningful chance to rebut that they benefitted from any subsidy resulting in market distortion. Commerce should have considered Canadian Solar's proffered evidence and either accepted it as a tier-one metric or explained how these imports may have been distorted by GOC interference in the market. Only if the latter occurred would it be appropriate to resort to a tier-two metric. In sum, Commerce must first explain why Canadian Solar's submission, a potential tier-one benchmark, is not usable. Such an explanation should not be based entirely on the adverse inference used to determine that the GOC's influence in polysilicon distorted the market. Although SolarWorld's claim regarding import price depression in order for importers to compete in the PRC's national market may certainly be the case, without any such determination on the record, or even sufficient information about polysilicon's fungibility or the dynamics of the market, the court cannot accept it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, with respect to Commerce's decision to resort to a tier-two benchmark with regards to polysilicon, the court finds that Commerce's decision was unsupported by substantial evidence and remands this issue. On remand Commerce should either use Canadian Solar's import data as a tier-one benchmark or else explain how the GOC's purported interference with the polysilicon market would distort arms-length import transactions in a way that makes this data unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

All other determinations are sustained. The court remands for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Remand results should be filed by January 29, 2019.
