The first is a motion by Plaintiff/Counterdefendant Outlaw Laboratory, LP (\"Outlaw\") to dismiss the counterclaims of Defendant/Counterclaimant Roma Mikha, Inc., and Third-Party Plaintiffs NMRM, Inc. and Skyline Market, Inc. (collectively, \"Counterclaimants\") (ECF No. 15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motion is fully briefed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 28, 33.) The second is Outlaw's motion to strike Counterclaimants' third cause of action for rescission pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 425.16. This motion has similarly received the benefit of full adversarial briefing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 29, 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7.1(d)(1), the Court finds the matter suitable for adjudication without oral argument. For the reasons explained below, Outlaw's motion to dismiss will\n   <strong>\n    be granted in part and denied in part\n   </strong>\n   ; its motion to strike will be\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Outlaw Laboratories LP\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to its pleadings, Outlaw is a Texas-based manufacturer of male-enhancement products called \"TriSteel\" and \"TriSteel 8 hour.\" Outlaw's products are made in the United States and distributed for sale in all 50 states, and are claimed to be in compliance with the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. According to Counterclaimants, Outlaw was formed in Texas in September 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Outlaw's demand letters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sometime starting in 2017 and continuing through 2018, Outlaw, through its attorneys at Tauler Smith LLP, began mailing demand letters to proprietors of gas stations, liquor stores, and corner stores in California, and beyond. Those recipients allegedly sold male-enhancement pills designated by the word \"Rhino,\" which Outlaw alleges contain undisclosed sildenafil, a prescription pharmaceutical regulated by the FDA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Outlaw's demand letters warned recipients that they were \"selling illegal sexual enhancement drugs,\" which \"subject your company to legal action for racketeering ... under RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations) and the Federal Lanham Act\" and obligate the recipients to pay to Outlaw \"profits from the sale of Illicit Products dating back four years ... Attorney's fees ... Punitive damages ... Triple damages....\" The letter estimates the recipients' liabilities at \"over $100,000\" but states that Outlaw is \"willing to settle all claims in exchange for a one-time settlement agreement [$9,765, in the sample demand letter enclosed at ECF No. 4, Ex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A] and your agreement to stop selling the Illicit Products.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The letters conclude by warning that \"[i]f this matter is not fully resolved before [a date typically within 30 days],\" that a lawsuit will be filed against the recipient. Attached to the letters are three exhibits: (1) \"photographs taken at your place of business capturing your sale of the Illicit Products,\" (2) \"notices from the Food and Drug Administration regarding the illegality of the Illicit Products,\" and (3) a draft complaint with the recipient's name filled in as defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Some recipients, like Third-Party Plaintiff Skyline Market, Inc., acquiesced to the demand letter and settled with Outlaw. Others, like defendants Roma Mikha, Inc., and NMRM, Inc., resisted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Outlaw files suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   True to its word, on July 24, 2018, Outlaw filed a complaint in San Diego Superior Court against a high volume of defendants, all of whom it had previously mailed a demand letter. (ECF No. 1-2, at 13 (Complaint).) Roma Mikha, Inc. was named in the complaint; NMRM, Inc., was not. Outlaw's complaint alleges that the defendants are engaged in a scheme to distribute and sell unlawful Rhino products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further claims that laboratory testing and public announcements by the Federal Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), have revealed that Rhino products contain hidden drug ingredients like sildenafil (a prescription drug found in Viagra ), desmethyl carbodenafil (an analogue of sildenafil ), dapoxetine (an anti-depressant drug), and tadalafil (a prescription drug found in Cialis ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Outlaw claims that, by selling the Rhino products at their stores, defendants disseminate the false statements on Rhino products stating that they are \"all natural,\" contain \"no harmful synthetic chemicals,\" \"no prescription necessary,\" and have limited side effects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57.) Outlaw further asserts that the defendants' scheme has diverted sales away from its legitimate \"TriSteel\" male enhancement products, in violation of California Business and Profession Code \u00a7 17200 (prohibiting unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business acts), \u00a7 17500 (prohibiting false and misleading advertising), and \u00a7 43(a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act (prohibiting false advertising).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Counterclaimants file their counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 12, 2018, Roma Mikha, Inc. removed the action to federal court. Thereafter, on August 24, 2018, Roma Mikha, Inc., NMRM, Inc., and Skyline Market, Inc. filed a Third Party Complaint (the \"Cross-Complaint\") against Outlaw. (ECF No. 4.) Their Cross-Complaint allege a class action against Outlaw for (1) civil RICO violation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), (2) RICO conspiracy,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), and (3) rescission of any settlement agreements like the one entered into by Skyline Market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to the RICO counts, Counterclaimants allege a RICO enterprise between Outlaw, Tauler Smith LLP, and other as-yet-unnamed individuals, aimed at perfecting a legal \"shakedown\" of small-time San Diego convenience stores. (ECF No. 4, at 11.) They claim that the \"TriSteel\" products \"were created as artifices\" to \"found the false advertising claims,\" and that Outlaw itself is no more than a front for the unlawful enterprise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Counterclaimants take especial umbrage with the demand letters sent by Outlaw, claiming that they were aimed at a \"vulnerable community of victims,\" comprised of mostly \"small, immigrant-run businesses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 11.) They urge that Outlaw's demand letters are not only manipulative, but also fraudulent, because Counterclaimants believe that the Rhino \"products are not illegal to sell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).) Sending those fraudulent letters through the U.S. Mails, therefore, constitutes mail fraud under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; committing mail fraud multiple times forms a pattern of racketeering under RICO. Counterclaimants further liken the conduct of Tauler Smith LLP to that of the Prenda Law Inc., and the Trevor Law Group, two law firms that have become the posterchildren for abusive litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ingenuity 13 LLC v.

Counterclaimants' final request, for rescission of Skyline Market's \"Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release\" with Outlaw, and restitution of benefits conferred as a result thereof, is premised on their claim that Skyline Market had signed the agreement under duress, and that the contract was voidable as a result of Outlaw's scheme to defraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) Counterclaimants further contend that Skyline Market's is not the only settlement agreement that must be rescinded; rather, all settlements entered into as a result of Outlaw's fraudulent demand letters must also be invalidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Outlaw files a motion to dismiss and a motion to strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, Outlaw moved to dismiss all claims asserted in the Cross-Complaint. It also has moved to strike the third cause of action for rescission pursuant to California's anti-SLAPP law.

RICO Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Outlaw has moved to dismiss Counterclaimant's RICO-based causes of action on two grounds. First, it argues that that Counterclaimants have failed to identify a specific, materially false representation as would sustain their claim that Outlaw is engaged in the predicate acts of mail fraud. (ECF No. 15, at 10.) Second, it argues that the\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine, which immunizes those who petition the government for redress from statutory liability for petitioning conduct, shields it from RICO liability.

Sufficiency of Pleading Predicate Acts of Mail Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Outlaw argues that Counterclaimants' RICO claims fail as a matter of law\n   because Counterclaimants were required, and have failed, to \"plead and prove that a defendant intended to defraud their victims using representations through the mail or wires that they knew to be materially false.\" (ECF No. 15, at 10.)

Two allegations in Counterclaimants' Cross-Complaint bear on this point. First, Counterclaimants allege that \"any lawyer of ordinary skill knows that there is not even a colorable claim for RICO liability against [the Counterclaimants'] stores.\" (ECF No. 4, at 12). Second, they point out that while Outlaw had threatened a RICO suit in its demand letters, Outlaw elected not to include that cause of action in the complaint eventually filed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They contend that Outlaw's shifting causes of action is proof that \"the attorney members of the Outlaw Enterprise evidently recognized that stating RICO allegations to the Court would violate Rule 11.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Counterclaimants' arguments are both too conclusory and too subjective to carry the day. Their first argument-regarding what an ordinary lawyer might think with respect to a RICO claim against Counterclaimants-is a bare legal conclusion that does not withstand the heightened pleading standard applicable to\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Pennington\n   </em>\n   cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mohla\n   </em>\n   , 944 F.2d at 533.

The inquiry at part one is not whether Outlaw's attorneys subjectively believed that a RICO suit would have been frivolous. Rather, under both\n   <em>\n    PRE II\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kottle\n   </em>\n   , the issue is whether \"an\n   <em>\n    objective litigant\n   </em>\n   could conclude that the suit is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    PRE II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/\">\n    508 U.S. at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Counterclaimants have not adduced any indication that an objective litigant could not so conclude, except for their conclusory allegation that Outlaw's attorneys recognized that their submission of a RICO claim would run afoul of Rule 11. This is an unwinning factual assertion, because \"an objectively reasonable effort to litigate cannot be sham regardless of subjective intent.\"\n   <em>\n    PRE II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/\">\n    508 U.S. at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court recognizes that Counterclaimants have pointed to additional \"indicia of sham litigation\" in their opposition to Outlaw's motion to dismiss (ECF No. 28, at 14). Counterclaimants allege there that Outlaw did not have an internet presence until a few months before it started sending the demand letters, that the Outlaw enterprise \"often serves the demand letter with no intention of following through with the threatened litigation where the victim merely ignores it,\" and that the enterprise\n   \"fails to pursue the litigation once filed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   These allegations, however, do not matter for part one of the\n   <em>\n    PRE II\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kottle\n   </em>\n   analysis. Indeed, it is the second part of the sham litigation analysis which focuses on whether the party invoking\n   <em>\n    Noerr\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -Pennington\n   </em>\n   is impermissibly attempting to interfere with the other party \"through the use of the governmental process-as opposed to the outcome of that process.\"\n   <em>\n    PRE II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/\">\n    508 U.S. at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11789\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/49/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the general contractor refused to pay the full amount, and instead insisted on a settlement agreement with a compromise payment of $50,000. The sub-contractor initially refused to sign, protesting that its new company would \"go broke\" if not paid the full amount, but eventually capitulated \"after telling [the general contractor]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   that the agreement was 'blackmail' and he was signing it only because he had to in order to survive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1157,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2086\">\n    204 Cal.Rptr. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found rescission appropriate because the general contractor had acted in bad faith in refusing to pay the sub-contractor its due, and were aware that the sub-contractor \"was a new company overextended to creditors and subcontractors and faced with imminent bankruptcy if not paid its final billing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1160,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=204%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2086\">\n    204 Cal.Rptr. 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Rich &amp; Whillock\n   </em>\n   , Counterclaimants argue that Skyline Market was similarly coerced.

They contend that they have sufficiently alleged a \"wrongful act which is sufficiently coercive to cause a reasonably prudent [store] to succumb to the perpetrator's pressure.\" (ECF No. 28, at 17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Rich &amp; Whillock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2149886\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/157/1154/#p1158\">\n    157 Cal.

In light of the nature and tone of the demand letters, and Counterclaimants' allegations that they were targeted because Outlaw knew that they were small operations run by immigrants for whom English is not their first language (ECF No. 4, at 2), the Court tends to agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Outlaw argues in reply that Counterclaimants should not be permitted to seek refuge under\n   <em>\n    Rich &amp; Whillock\n   </em>\n   because the situations are factually dissimilar. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33, at 9 (\"The facts of all the cases cited by the Counter-Claimants in support of their rescission cause of action are all equally unhelpful and easily distinguishable from the present circumstances....\") ) However, the fact that Counterclaimants' claim \"does not fall within the four corners of ... prior case law does not justify dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n   <em>\n    McGary v.

Cal. Dec. 22, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Outlaw additionally contends that, rather than settling, Counterclaimants could have availed themselves of the \"reasonable alternative\" of hiring an attorney to litigate the case. (ECF No. 33, at 9.) Their failure to do so, Outlaw argues, precludes their cry of economic duress. The Court finds, however, that Outlaw has sufficiently pleaded that hiring an attorney was not a reasonable alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Several of Counterclaimants' allegations (and the reasonable inferences therefrom) suggest why this was so. First, in the demand letter sent to Skyline Market, Outlaw threatened to sue if its demand was not met within a two-week deadline. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 4, at 26-27) (demand letter dated December 15, 2017 requiring a resolution by December 29, 2017). The quick turn-around might have made it impracticable to hire an attorney to defend. Even assuming an attorney was hired, however, a reasonable person in Skyline Market's position might nonetheless have felt powerless\n   against the threat of $100,000 in liabilities. Indeed, it is not unreasonable to assume that for at least some of recipients of that letter, a legal judgment for $100,000 would have amounted to \"bankruptcy or financial ruin.\"\n   <em>\n    Rich &amp; Whillock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2149886\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/157/1154/#p1158\">\n    157 Cal.

Outlaw, however, jumps the gun in delving straight into the two-step anti-SLAPP analysis. This is because rescission is not a cause of action within the meaning of the anti-SLAPP statute and therefore cannot be subject to a special motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As noted by Counterclaimants, and as evidenced by the plain text of the anti-SLAPP statute, section 425.16 applies only to \"causes of action.\" CAL.
