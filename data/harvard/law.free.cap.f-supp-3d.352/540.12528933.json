Va. June 11, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Panel Systems' Health Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Panel Systems designs, fabricates and erects prefabricated steel buildings, employing\n   fewer than eighty people. (Panel Systems, Inc.'s Countercl. (\"Countercl.\") (ECF No. 14) \u00b6 5.) In June 2014, Panel Systems implemented the Panel Systems Health Care Plan (the \"Plan\") to provide health benefits to its employees. (Countercl. \u00b6 6.) Panel Systems \"self-funded\" the Plan, meaning that the company and its employees contributed to the benefits. (Countercl. \u00b6 6.) Panel Systems also obtained excess loss insurance from Transamerica Premier Life Insurance Company (\"Transamerica\"). (Countercl. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 30, 2015, Panel Systems and SISCO entered into a Plan Service Agreement, effective June 1, 2015. (Ex. 2 to Compl. (\"2015 PSA\") (ECF No. 1-3).) A year later, on June 1, 2016, the parties entered into a second Plan Service Agreement, effective immediately. (Ex. 3 to Compl. (\"2016 PSA\") (ECF No. 1-4) ). Under both Plan Service Agreements (collectively, the \"PSAs\"), SISCO agreed to process \"Plan benefit claims according to the terms and provisions of the [Summary Plan Description], using its established claim adjudication procedures.\" (2015 PSA at 4; 2016 PSA at 4.) By the terms of the PSAs, SISCO would act in a \"ministerial capacity as a third party claims processor.\" (2015 PSA at 3; 2016 PSA at 3.) The PSAs also empowered Panel Systems to, in its full legal discretion, \"construe and interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan\" and to \"[d]elegate to any person or entity such powers, duties and responsibilities it deems appropriate.\" (2015 PSA at 4-5; 2016 PSA at 4-5.) And the Plan itself authorized Panel Systems, as the \"Named Fiduciary and Plan Administrator,\" to delegate its \"authority and discretion to interpret and construe the terms of the Plan and to determine any and all questions in relation to the administration, interpretation or operation of the Plan.\" (Ex. 1 to Compl. (\"Plan Document\") (ECF No. 1-2) at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Using its delegation power, Panel Systems delegated authority to SISCO to act as the independent fiduciary and plan administrator of the Plan. (Countercl. \u00b6 9.) With this authority, SISCO handled all claims made under the Plan, submitted stop-loss claims to Transamerica and processed payments for covered claims. (Countercl. \u00b6 10.) SISCO also opened and maintained a checking account in the Plan's name. (Countercl. \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The PSAs further included two indemnification provisions. The first provision provided that \"SISCO will hold [Panel Systems] harmless from all losses and damages incurred as a result of bad faith or intentional wrongful acts committed by SISCO, or its employees while performing its responsibilities under this agreement.\" (2015 PSA at 6; 2016 PSA at 6.) Under the second provision, Panel Systems agreed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   to defend, indemnify, and save harmless SISCO and its employees from any and all loss, costs, fines, penalties, liability, judgments, claims and expenses, or damages of any kind including attorney's fees arising out of: [1] [Panel Systems'] performance, or lack thereof, of its duties and obligations under the Plan or this Agreement; [2] Stop Loss Carrier or unrelated Business Associate's performance, or lack thereof, of their duties and obligations under the Plan; [3] The good faith performance by SISCO, SISCO's contractors/subcontractors, of their respective duties to [Panel Systems] under this Agreement; [4] Actions taken by SISCO at the direction of [Panel Systems]; [and 6,] Responsibilities performed by SISCO under this agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (2015 PSA at 6; 2016 PSA at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Dispute Over Payment of M.L.'s Medical Benefits\n   </strong>\n   On May 11, 2016, M.L.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a beneficiary of the Plan and dependent of a Panel Systems employee, presented to the Medical College of Virginia Hospital (\"MCV Hospital\") after asphyxiating on a popcorn kernel. (Countercl. \u00b6 12.) On May 17, 2016, MCV Hospital physicians notified M.L.'s parents that M.L. had no brain activity and that they wished to perform an apnea test to confirm their diagnosis. (Countercl. \u00b6 13.) On May 19, 2016, M.L.'s parents sought to enjoin the Virginia Commonwealth University Health Systems Authority (the \"Authority\") from performing the apnea test. (Countercl. \u00b6 14.) The Richmond City Circuit Court denied the parents' request for an injunction on June 10, 2016, and M.L.'s parents immediately filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia. (Countercl. \u00b6 15.) The Virginia Supreme Court entered an order on June 14, 2016, prohibiting the Authority from performing the apnea test until that court resolved the appeal. (Countercl. \u00b6 16.) The Virginia Supreme Court further denied the Authority's request for an expedited hearing. (Countercl. \u00b6 17.) Unable to perform the apnea test, the Authority continued to provide medical care to M.L. until she passed away on November 1, 2016. (Countercl. \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   From her admission to MCV Hospital until her passing, M.L. incurred $1,682,066.77 in treatment costs, which the Authority and MCV Associated Physicians submitted to SISCO for claims processing. (Countercl. \u00b6 18.) SISCO's Claims Settlement Manager, Ann Cook, sent an email on October 10, 2016, advising SISCO's Audit Unit to deny all medical expenses accrued in treating M.L. after May 31, 2016. (Countercl. \u00b6 19; Ex. A to Countercl. (\"Cook Email\") (ECF No. 14).) Ms. Cook reasoned that, because doctors officially diagnosed M.L. as brain dead on May 31, any services after that date were either not medically necessary, experimental or court-ordered, none of which the Plan covered. (Cook Email.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 11, 2016, SISCO requested a refund from MCV Associated Physicians for $30,623.20, which reflected amounts that SISCO had already paid for medical services provided to M.L. after May 31, 2016. (Countercl. \u00b6 20.) MCV Associated Physicians appealed the refund request and SISCO denied the appeal, though SISCO agreed to review the issue if MCV Associated Physicians submitted additional documents supporting its claims. (Countercl. \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   MCV Associated Physicians submitted all of M.L.'s medical records to SISCO on March 10, 2017. (Countercl. \u00b6 21.) The documents confirmed that M.L.'s treating physicians diagnosed her as brain dead on May 31, 2016, rendering any services provided after that date medically unnecessary under the terms of the Plan. (Countercl. \u00b6 21.) Accordingly, on April 21, 2017, Ms. Cook reaffirmed that the Plan did not cover expenses incurred after May 31, 2016. (Countercl. \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, on May 10, 2017, the Authority and MCV Associated Physicians appealed SISCO's second denial of coverage and, on May 15, 2017, SISCO reversed its previous decision, deciding that the Plan in fact covered M.L.'s post-May 31, 2016 expenses. (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 27.) This reversal occurred without the presentation of any new evidence. (Countercl. \u00b6 24.) Instead, Dick Sigwarth, SISCO's Vice President of Operations, simply overruled the earlier denials. (Countercl. \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Around the same time that SISCO reversed course and granted coverage of\n   M.L.'s post-May 31 expenses, in April and May 2017, SISCO and Cigna entered into contract negotiations for SISCO to work on Cigna's Open Access Plus and LocalPlus networks. (Countercl. \u00b6 25.) MCV Associated Physicians and the Authority are both providers within Cigna's network. (Countercl. \u00b6 26.) According to Panel Systems, Cigna had an interest in its providers getting paid, and Cigna delayed approval of the SISCO deal until it received assurances that SISCO would pay the M.L. expenses. (Countercl. \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following approval of the M.L. expenses, SISCO submitted a stop-loss claim with Transamerica on Panel Systems' behalf, requesting $1,360,728.96 for expenses relating to M.L.'s treatment. (Countercl. \u00b6 28.) Transamerica denied this claim on June 29, 2017, finding that the treatment did not meet the Plan's definition of medically necessary care. (Countercl. \u00b6 28.) In response, on July 26, 2017, Mr. Sigwarth arranged for Panel Systems to receive an executive summary of M.L.'s hospital stay, calling Panel Systems' President, Barry Unger, that same day to ask whether Panel Systems intended to approve coverage of the benefits. (Countercl. \u00b6 29.) Panel Systems had not heard from SISCO about the M.L. coverage dispute until that point, and SISCO had never previously asked for Panel Systems to make a coverage determination. (Countercl. \u00b6 29.) In its conversations with Panel Systems, SISCO stated that it had changed its position on M.L.'s coverage after reviewing additional documentation. (Countercl. \u00b6 30.) Over the next few months, SISCO contacted Panel Systems to request approval of the coverage, but Panel Systems never approved the expenses. (Countercl. \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Underlying Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 18, 2018, MCV Associated Physicians and the Authority (collectively, the \"MCV Plaintiffs\") sued Panel Systems and SISCO (the \"MCV Lawsuit\"), alleging that both parties violated their obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). (Ex. 4 to Compl. (\"MCV Compl.\") (ECF No. 1-5).) Specifically, the MCV Plaintiffs alleged, in Count I, that SISCO and Panel Systems had violated the MCV Plaintiffs' right to benefits under the Plan and, in Count II, that SISCO and Panel Systems had violated their fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA. (MCV Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51-74.) In Count III, the MCV Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief as to SISCO's request for a refund. (MCV Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-80.) The MCV Lawsuit ended in August 2018, with all parties stipulating to dismissal. (Civil No. 3:18-cv-43, ECF Nos. 44, 47-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Throughout the MCV Lawsuit, SISCO demanded that Panel Systems defend and indemnify it pursuant to the PSAs. (Compl. (ECF No. 1) \u00b6 39.) After Panel Systems refused to do so, SISCO filed suit in this Court on June 7, 2018. (ECF No. 1.) In its Complaint, SISCO denies any liability to the MCV Plaintiffs, but claims entitlement to any costs that it incurred in defending the MCV Lawsuit. (Compl. \u00b6 38.) SISCO claims that it had performed its contractual duties under the PSAs in good faith, and that Panel Systems therefore has a duty to indemnify it for all costs associated with the MCV Lawsuit. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-48.) SISCO further seeks payment for the costs, including attorney's fees, of bringing the present action against Panel Systems. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Panel Systems filed its Answer (ECF No. 4) to SISCO's Complaint on July 3, 2018. On August 15, 2018, Panel Systems filed its Unopposed Motion for Leave to File a Counterclaim (ECF No. 10), which the Court granted on August 16, 2018\n   (ECF No. 13). On August 17, 2018, Panel Systems filed its Counterclaim (ECF No. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Panel Systems' Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In Count I of its Counterclaim, Panel Systems alleges that, per the terms of the PSAs, SISCO must indemnify it for the MCV Lawsuit attorney's fees incurred because of SISCO's bad faith and intentional wrongful acts. (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.) Panel Systems contends that SISCO's adjudication of the M.L. treatment claims constituted \"an intentional wrongful act done in bad faith,\" because SISCO pushed for coverage of those claims out of self-interest and \"without regard to the best interests of Panel Systems, the Plan, or the Plan participants and beneficiaries.\" (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In Count II, Panel Systems accuses SISCO of knowingly making a false and material misrepresentation when it told Panel Systems that its decision to grant coverage of the post-May 31 M.L. expenses occurred after consideration of additional information and failed to disclose its relationship with Cigna. (Countercl. \u00b6 41.) This misrepresentation, Panel Systems maintains, deprived Panel Systems of sufficient information to determine whether the Plan covered M.L.'s post-May 31 expenses, delaying its decision and resulting in the MCV Lawsuit, from which Panel Systems incurred litigation costs. (Countercl. \u00b6 44.) Alternatively, in Count III, Panel Systems alleges the same misrepresentation as in Count II, but on a negligent misrepresentation theory. (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 45-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In Count IV of its Counterclaim, Panel Systems contends that SISCO acted as a fiduciary under ERISA in administering the Plan and therefore had a duty to communicate complete and accurate information to Panel Systems and the Plan's beneficiaries, which SISCO breached when it failed to disclose its business relationship with Cigna. (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-52.) Because of SISCO's breach, Panel Systems alleges that it sustained attorney's fees in defending the MCV Lawsuit. (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, in Count V, Panel Systems alleges that SISCO had a common law fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of it, the Plan and the Plan's participants and beneficiaries. (Countercl. \u00b6 56.) Panel Systems argues that SISCO breached this duty when it granted coverage of the post-May 31 M.L. expenses out of self-interest and did not disclose that interest. (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.) Panel Systems asserts that this breach caused it to incur attorney's fees in the MCV Lawsuit. (Countercl. \u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    F. SISCO's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 14, 2018, SISCO filed its Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 18), moving the Court to grant judgment in SISCO's favor on Panel Systems' Counterclaim. In support of its Motion, SISCO alleges that none of Panel Systems' theories provide grounds for relief. (Br. Supp. Pl.'s Mot. J. on the Pleadings (\"Pl.'s Br.\") (ECF No. 19) at 1.) As to Count I of Panel Systems' Counterclaim, SISCO argues that the omission of the phrase \"attorney's fees\" from the PSAs' provision relating to SISCO's indemnification of Panel Systems and the subsequent inclusion of \"attorney's fees\" in the provision relating to Panel Systems' indemnification of SISCO demonstrate the parties' intent that SISCO would not be liable for Panel Systems' attorney's fees. (Pl.'s Br. at 12-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Regarding Panel Systems' misrepresentation arguments in Counts II and III, SISCO responds that Virginia law does not recognize purely contractual breaches as\n   grounds for separate tort actions. (Pl.'s Br. at 14-16.) Because Panel Systems' fraud allegations rely on SISCO's contractual duty to adjudicate claims under the Plan, SISCO argues that an independent common law duty does not support Panel Systems' misrepresentation claims. (Pl.'s Br. at 16.) In addition, SISCO contends that Panel Systems has not alleged fraud with sufficient particularity or with the necessary elements to survive its Motion. (Pl.'s Br. at 17-19)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to Panel Systems' allegations that SISCO violated both statutory and common-law fiduciary duties, SISCO maintains that no such duties existed. (Pl.'s Br. at 19-29.) Specifically, SISCO responds to Panel Systems' claim that SISCO owed it a fiduciary duty under ERISA by arguing that: (1)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   does not authorize civil actions for the type of harm that Panel Systems alleges resulted from SISCO's breach of a fiduciary duty; (2) in any case, SISCO did not serve as an ERISA fiduciary, because it performed only non-discretionary, ministerial functions; and, (3) if SISCO did serve as an ERISA fiduciary, it did not owe a duty to Panel Systems. (Pl.'s Br. at 20-26.) Regarding Panel Systems' common-law fiduciary theory, SISCO argues that Virginia common law does not recognize fiduciary duties arising solely from contractual relationships and that Panel Systems has not shown a non-contractual ground for creating a fiduciary relationship. (Pl.'s Br. at 26-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, SISCO challenges Panel Systems' prayer for attorney's fees and costs in the present action. (Pl.'s Br. at 28-29.) Specifically, SISCO argues that Panel Systems has no right to attorney's fees under either ERISA or the Plan, and therefore it must follow the American Rule that all parties to litigation pay their own way. (Pl.'s Br. at 28-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On September 28, 2018, Panel Systems filed its Memorandum in Opposition to SISCO's Motion, (Def.'s Mem. Opp. Pl.'s Mot. J. on the Pleadings (\"Def.'s Mem.\") (ECF No. 25) ), to which SISCO replied on October 4, 2018 (ECF No. 30), rendering the matter ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As mentioned, a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings utilizes the same standard as a 12(b)(6) motion.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201308048\">\n    2010 WL 1308048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Therefore, a motion for judgment on the pleadings tests the sufficiency of a complaint or counterclaim; it does not serve as the means by which a court will resolve contests surrounding the facts, determine the merits of a claim or address potential defenses.\n   <em>\n    Republican Party of N.C. v.

By agreeing that Iowa law would control only contract interpretation and validity, Panel Systems and SISCO established an intent that the law of another forum could govern other issues.

Furthermore, the PSAs themselves fail to indicate a broader intent that Iowa law govern all matters relating to the contracts.

(Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-38.) As the mechanism to obtain the fees its seeks, Panel Systems points to the first indemnification provision in the PSAs, pursuant to which SISCO agreed to \"hold [Panel Systems] harmless from all losses and damages incurred as a result of bad faith or intentional wrongful acts committed by SISCO, or its employees while performing responsibilities under th[ese] agreement[s].\" (Countercl. \u00b6 36; 2015 PSA at 6; 2016 PSA at 6.)

Following Transamerica's denial of SISCO's stop-loss request, Mr. Sigwarth called Panel Systems' President on July 26, 2017, and stated that SISCO had changed its mind on the M.L. expenses after reviewing additional documentation, even though it had not viewed any additional documentation. (Countercl. \u00b6 24, 28-31.) SISCO at no point disclosed to Panel Systems that it had a potential conflict of interest due to its business relationship with Cigna. This alleged misrepresentation resulted from SISCO's performance of its contractual responsibilities to adjudicate claims under the Plan and to refer, with recommendations, unresolved claims disputes to Panel Systems. (2015 PSA at 4; 2016 PSA at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Based on the above, Panel Systems has alleged sufficient facts to make a plausible claim that SISCO acted with wrongful intent and in bad faith in the performance of its contractual duties, which resulted in the MCV Lawsuit giving rise to Panel Systems' attorney's fees.

(Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-48.)

However, when a fiduciary duty arises solely by virtue of a contract, a plaintiff may still bring a breach of fiduciary duty action by showing that the defendant ' \"[took] advantage of the special position occupied by a fiduciary to his benefit and to the detriment of the other party to whom the fiduciary duty is owed by doing something beyond merely failing to perform a duty imposed by the contract.' \"\n   <em>\n    Perry v.

(Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) SISCO further opened and maintained a checking account in the Plan's name. (Countercl. \u00b6 10.) And, although the PSAs defined SISCO's role as merely ministerial, the agreements gave Panel Systems authority to delegate substantial discretion to SISCO, which Panel Systems did.

Panel Systems alleges no special relationship beyond the duties that SISCO agreed to perform under contract. However, Panel Systems has alleged sufficient facts to suggest that SISCO did more than merely fail to perform its contractual duties and in fact took advantage of the special position it occupied. Specifically, Panel Systems' facts contend that SISCO granted coverage of the post-May 31 M.L. expenses out of self-interest and against the terms of the Plan. (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-26.) SISCO then urged Panel Systems to approve its grant of coverage without disclosing it business negotiations with Cigna. (Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 28-31.) Panel Systems alleges, and the Court accepts as true, that SISCO's dishonesty delayed Panel Systems' decision on the M.L. expenses, resulting in the MCV Lawsuit.

(Countercl. at 12.) However, SISCO misconstrues Panel Systems' requests for attorney's fees as separately alleged causes of action, which they are not.

Indeed, Panel Systems' request for attorney's fees under ERISA could not possibly represent a separate cause of action, because ERISA does not authorize a specific action for attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Countercl. at 12, \u00b6 C.);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 1132(g)(1). And Panel Systems likewise did not frame its request for attorney's fees and expenses under the Plan as a separate cause of action, so the Court will wait until it reaches judgment on the remaining counts of Panel Systems' Counterclaim before deciding whether Panel Systems may receive attorney's fees under either the Plan or the PSAs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court GRANTS SISCO's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 18) as to Counts II, III and IV of Panel Systems' Counterclaim (ECF No. 14) and DENIES SISCO's Motion as to Counts I and V and Panel Systems' requests for attorney's fees\n   in this matter. An appropriate Order shall issue.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    In keeping with the prior litigation on this matter and the parties' practice, the Court will refer to M.L. by her initials to respect the privacy of her family.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Neither party contests the enforceability of the PSAs' choice-of-law provisions, so the Court need not consider their validity at this time. Nonetheless, \"unusual circumstances\" would exist where there is \"no reasonable basis\" for the choice-of-law provision, or where the parties agreed to the provision by improper means.\n    <em>\n     Tate\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20S.E.2d%20321\">\n     25 S.E.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    321 ;\n    <em>\n     Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 187 (1971).
