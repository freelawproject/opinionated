ECF No. 3. On December 1, 2017, the Government moved for a psychiatric examination to determine Defendant's competency to stand trial. ECF No. 15. The Court granted this motion on December 15, 2017. ECF No. 17. On January 23, 2018, the Bureau of Prison's (\"BOP\") clinician filed their findings. ECF No. 20. On January 25, 2018, based on the clinician's findings, the Court found Defendant incompetent to stand trial and that he should be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for further evaluation for no more than four months. ECF No. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 31, 2018, Defendant filed an emergency motion to preliminarily enjoin the clinicians at the clinic in Butner, North Carolina from involuntarily medicating Defendant. ECF No. 26. On June 4, 2018, the Court denied this motion for lack of ripeness but also ordered that any forcible medication be stayed until the Court determines its appropriateness. ECF No. 30. On June 12, 2018, Defendant filed a new motion to enjoin forcible medication after the clinic in Butner, North Carolina held a\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   hearing and determined it was necessary to involuntarily medicate Defendant to avoid harm to himself or others. ECF No. 34. On June 22, 2018, after a hearing, the Court denied this motion, finding that the BOP may forcibly medicate Defendant, and lifted the June 4, 2018 stay. ECF No. 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 13, 2018, the BOP's psychiatric report confirmed Defendant's psychiatric incompetency. ECF No. 46. The BOP recommended Defendant be further evaluated for another four months to restore his competency. ECF No. 46 at 11. On September 18, 2018, the Magistrate Judge ordered\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   , June 22, 2018, that Defendant be committed for an additional four months because there was a substantial probability that he would regain competence under \u00a7 4241(d)(2)(A). ECF No. 48. That commitment terminated on October 20, 2018. ECF No. 56 at 3. The BOP filed another psychiatric report dated October 22, 2018 addressed to the Magistrate Judge, which was filed before this Court on November 9, 2018, asking for an additional\n   120 days to restore Defendant's competence since he has been improving with his current medication but has not fully regained competency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 19, 2018, Defendant filed a motion for a status conference to request a hearing to challenge the feasibility of Defendant regaining competence after an additional 120 days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    at 3-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A hearing was held on November 13, 2018. ECF No. 60. The Government filed their Motion to Extend Defendant's Mental Health Treatment on November 6, 2018. ECF No. 58. Defendant's counsel opposed the motion during the November 13, 2018 status conference and has since filed a brief letter in opposition. ECF No. 62. The Government then filed its reply on November 20, 2018. ECF No. 63.

Another hearing is required if the director of the medical facility determines that the defendant is no longer incompetent. \u00a7 4241(e). However, the statute does not mention that a hearing is required for any of the commitment provisions in \u00a7 4241(d). That subsection only references the initial \u00a7 4241(a) hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4241(d). Given the structure of the statute, if Congress intended the Court to hold a hearing each time it had to make a finding of substantial probability that Defendant would attain competency, it would have explicitly stated so. Furthermore, if every determination under \u00a7 4241 requires a hearing then all the mentions of hearings in the statute would be superfluous. Therefore, \u00a7 4241(d) does not require the Court to hold a hearing to determine if \"there is a substantial probability that within such additional period of time [Defendant] will attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go forward.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9034602\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/396/366/#p369\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Moreover, courts in this Circuit have made their findings under \u00a7 4241(d)(2)(A) by relying on the BOP's psychiatric report and not holding a hearing; instead, courts hold a hearing after the psychiatric report has noted no significant progress in defendant's competency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Va. 2009) (citing BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (8th ed. 2004) ). Defendant\n   seems to argue that \"substantial probability\" rises to this level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 62 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Setting \"substantial probability\" below \"preponderance of the evidence\" would contravene the plain meaning of the words. If \"preponderance of the evidence\" means that something is at least probable, then \"substantial probability\" must be higher than that burden. Therefore, the Court cannot agree that \"substantial probability\" should be less than fifty percent. However, the Court does not believe that this standard is equivalent with \"clear and convincing evidence.\" That standard has been well-established, and if Congress intended to use that standard, \u00a7 4241 would have been written differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds that \"substantial probability\" under \u00a7 4241 falls in between these two standards. \"Substantial probability\" means that the chance of competency must be firmly established and be more likely than not. This does not mean that there must be reasonable certainty, but it also does not merely allow for any probability. The Court will instead evaluate the possibility of competency based on whether there is a well-founded basis to support the idea that Defendant is more likely than not to regain competency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendant's Substantial Probability of Competence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court, in its discretion, may rely on the BOP's psychiatric report. Here, the BOP has filed a report that details Defendant's progress since he has been committed in Butner. Before receiving any medical treatment, Defendant exhibited various behaviors of severe mental disease or defect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 59 at 5. After the Court's review of the\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   hearing on June 22, 2018, and he first began receiving antipsychotic medication, Defendant \"was more compliant with staff directives. However, [he] did not evidence significant improvement in his mental status\" until several doses later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. He eventually was able \"to engage in meaningful conversation and began voicing some desire to advance his legal proceedings,\" which led to him participating in a formal interview with his psychiatrist on September 21, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, Defendant has been \"transferred from the most secure locked housing unit ... to a less restrictive, semi-locked housing unit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Most recently, on October 5, 2018, Defendant was allowed more time \"outside of his cell and in common areas of the housing unit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The reports still notes that Defendant still has \"some residual psychotic symptomatology.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. He appears to continue have some auditory hallucinations and paranoia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on these trends, the report states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [Defendant] has evidenced slow yet consistent improvement in his mental status and behavioral functioning. While he remains symptomatic, he has been willing and able to engage in some competency restoration efforts.... Overall, Mr. Brown has evidenced improved mental health functioning but not to such an extent that his competency to stand trail has been restored. Further improvement in [Defendant's] mental status and behavioral functioning is expected with continued treatment with antipsychotic medication.... At this time, it is the opinion of the undersigned evaluator that there is a substantial probability that [Defendant] will demonstrate that he is competent to stand trial [after an additional 120 days].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant argues that the Court should not rely on this report because the June 22 report also stated that the psychiatrists believed Defendant would have a substantial probability to regain competency by\n   the end of four months from then, October 20. ECF No. 62 at 2-3. The Court disagrees. The task of the Court today is to determine if there is a substantial probability that Defendant will regain competency four months from October 21, 2018. While the Court does consider the fact that Defendant is not competent even though the June 22, 2018 report also stated Defendant would be competent by now, the fact that Defendant did not fully regain competence by October 20, 2018 does not sufficiently rebut the progress laid out in the report. Hindsight is 20/20, but that should not unduly skew the Court's review of the October 22 report now before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   According to the report, Defendant's most recent progress occurred on October 5, 2018, with the increase of time in common areas. ECF No. 59 at 7. He was not allowed this amount of freedom of movement when he was first admitted to Butner on December 15, 2017 or even when the Magistrate Judge issued its order under \u00a7 4241(d)(2)(A) on September 18, 2018. Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant has a substantial probability of regaining competency if committed a further 120 days. The progress he has shown according to the report provides a sufficient factual basis for the Court's finding. Therefore, the Court finds that the report provides a well-established basis to support the idea that Defendant is more likely to regain competency than not after an additional 120 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Sell\n    </em>\n    Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, to the extent that Defendant argues that he is entitled to a\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   hearing immediately, that is incorrect. The Court originally ruled Defendant could be forcibly medicated after confirming the BOP's\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   Hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 44-45.\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   itself specifically noted that the Court does not have to delve into the\n   <em>\n    Sell\n   </em>\n   analysis \"if forced medication is warranted for a different purpose, such as the purposes set out in\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   related to the individual's dangerousness.\"\n   <em>\n    Sell v.
