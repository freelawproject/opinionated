Functional Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Neaves contends that the functional limitations in the Noncompete are overbroad. In particular, Neaves argues that while he worked only as a chemist for O'Sullivan, the Noncompete \"prohibits a much broader range of activities: he shall not 'sell, attempt to sell, or assist others in selling or providing products' or 'help, financially or otherwise, any person or entity to compete' with O'Sullivan.\" Def's.

Va. 1995) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Notably, however, Neaves reads out qualifying language in the Noncompete, which language reads in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   I will not (a) sell, attempt to sell, or assist others in selling or providing products or services in competition with the Business of O'Sullivan at the Restricted Contacts; or (b) help, financially or otherwise, any person or entity to compete with the Business of O'Sullivan by using or contacting the Restricted Contacts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Agreement \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The only reasonable way to read part (b) is so that the phrase \"by using or contacting the Restricted Contacts\" modifies \"help, financially or otherwise.\" The phrase \"by using or contacting the Restricted Contacts\" does not make sense if it modifies \"any person or entity to compete with the Business of O'Sullivan.\" Consequently, the only way that Neaves could violate part (b) is by using or contacting the Restricted Contacts to help another entity compete with the Business of O'Sullivan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This interpretation defeats Neaves' appeal to a janitor test. The court finds it difficult to imagine any scenario in which a janitor would be contacting the Restricted Contacts and trying to compete with O'Sullivan unless, as O'Sullivan aptly\n   states, \"such employment were a sham effort to obscure direct competition, which the clause would prevent.\" Pl.'s Mem. Opp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Regarding Enforceability Non-Compete, ECF No. 67, at 10. Instead, the court holds that the Noncompete is narrowly tailored so that Neaves is only precluded from engaging in employment where he (1) works in a field that is directly competitive with O'Sullivan, and (2) furthers that employment by exploiting his relationship with O'Sullivan's clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Similarly, Neaves takes issue with the \"assisting others\" language of part (a). Like with his argument about part (b) of the Noncompete, Neaves claims that part (a) prohibits him from working in the artificial leather capacity even indirectly. Neaves Enforceability Mot. Br. 8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Home Paramount\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=282%20Va.%20412\">\n    282 Va. at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=718%20S.E.2d%20762\">\n    718 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   765 ). But again, Neaves reads out the qualifying language \"with the Business of O'Sullivan at the Restricted Contacts.\" Nothing in part (a) of the Noncompete prevents Neaves from working in the artificial leather industry-even in relation to the automobile industry-as long as his work is not related to the Restricted Contacts, which the evidence shows is limited to a select group of automobile manufacturers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In sum, the court holds that the functional limitations in the Noncompete, tied as they are to the Restricted Contacts, are narrowly tailored to protect the legitimate business interests of O'Sullivan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Geographic Scope\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Neaves also complains about the lack of geographic scope in the Noncompete. Neaves' argument distills down to one sentence: \"The lack of any geographic scope in [the Noncompete], which extends to places around the world where O'Sullivan has no legitimate business purpose in suppressing competition, renders it overbroad and unenforceable.\" Neaves Enforceability Mot. Br. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Of course, the absence of geographic scope in the Noncompete is not dispositive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brainware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174690\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/808/820/#p827\">\n    808 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   827 ;\n   <em>\n    Preferred Sys.

Mahan\n   </em>\n   is instructive. In\n   <em>\n    Brainware\n   </em>\n   , the court found a noncompete that did not contain a geographic limitation was still valid. Brainware was a small company in a niche market with a global reach. The competing business at which the former employee worked was another major player in that small, niche market. The noncompete's functional limitations were narrowly tailored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As discussed in the background section, O'Sullivan is in much the same position as was Brainware. O'Sullivan competes in a highly specialized niche market: artificial leather. Though the market is small, O'Sullivan has a global reach. Uniroyal competes with O'Sullivan to win the same clients for the same projects. And the court has already held that the Noncompete's functional limitations are narrowly drawn to protect O'Sullivan against Neaves directly competing with O'Sullivan at the Restricted Contacts. Like in\n   <em>\n    Brainware\n   </em>\n   , the court holds that the lack of geographic scope is not fatal given the circumscribed scope of the functional limitation and the reasonable one-year duration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The five cases Neaves cites do not dictate a different outcome.

In particular, Neaves points to O'Sullivan's Rule 30(b)(6) deposition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q: As far as loss of business, has O'Sullivan lost any money as a result of Mr. Neaves?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A: As I said previously, I can't tell you that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Q: Has O'Sullivan lost any accounts to Uniroyal as a result of Mr. Neaves?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   O'Sullivan 30(b)(6) Dep. 39:10-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As a result of this testimony, Neaves argues that O'Sullivan's \"damages are speculative and limited to the costs incurred in pursuing the instant action.\" Def.'s Mem.

Instead, it argues that it is entitled to an injunction preventing Neaves from working for Uniroyal for one year because it \"has suffered irreparable harm and has an inadequate remedy at law\"-such as \"when monetary damages are difficult to ascertain or are inadequate to compensate [O'Sullivan] for the injury caused by [Neaves'] breach of a restrictive covenant.\" Pl.'s Mem.

Under Virginia law, it is \"well-settled that parties to a contract may specify the events or pre-conditions that will trigger a party's right to recover for the other party's breach of their agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Ulloa v.

Agreement \u00b6 12 (allowing a breach of contract action to proceed \"without the need to prove actual damages\"). The parties also agree that \"temporary and permanent injunctive relief\" is appropriate for a breach. Under Virginia law, these provisions of the Agreement are enforceable and satisfy elements (1) and (2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ulloa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20Va.%2072\">\n    271 Va. at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634913\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/624/43/#p48\">\n    624 S.E.2d at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Element (3), the balance of equities, weighs in favor of O'Sullivan. As the Eastern District of Virginia has recently noted in the preliminary injunction context, \"[a]lthough it is undoubtedly true that subjecting [a former employee] to the restrictive covenant may impair his ability to earn a living, [the employer] has an interest in protecting its customers from diversion pending resolution of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Update, Inc. v.

Va. 2018). Neaves does not suggest otherwise. Finally, with respect to element (4), public policy weighs in favor of O'Sullivan. Virginia law certainly \"encourage[s] the enforcement of\n   <em>\n    valid\n   </em>\n   non-compete agreements,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525336\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/784/#p796\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525336\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/784/#p796\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the court has already held that the Noncompete is valid and enforceable under Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, the court holds that the Noncompete is enforceable, Neaves has breached the Noncompete, and under the terms of the Noncompete, O'Sullivan is entitled to an injunction preventing Neaves from continued violations of the Noncompete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The court's holdings do not, however, automatically entail enjoining Neaves from working for Uniroyal in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   position.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 48 (\"O'Sullivan seeks injunctive relief preventing Neaves from working for Uniroyal for a one-year period from the date of entry of a final Order in this case.\"). Presumably, there are other positions at Uniroyal that do not compete with the Business of O'Sullivan by using the Restricted Contacts. Accordingly, the court will order the parties to confer and submit a joint proposed permanent injunction no later than fourteen days after entry of the accompanying order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Moreover, Neaves does not contest that O'Sullivan can recover attorneys' fees under Paragraph 12's fee-shifting provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Damages Mot. Br. 4 (\"At most, [O'Sullivan's] damages are speculative and limited\n   to the costs incurred in pursing [sic] the instant action.\"). The court finds that O'Sullivan is entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs in this action. O'Sullivan may submit a motion for attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Because the Noncompete's temporal scope, functional limitations, and geographic scope are narrowly tailored to Neaves' former position at O'Sullivan, the court holds that the Noncompete is valid under Virginia law. Moreover, Neaves does not contest he is violating the Noncompete. Nonetheless, O'Sullivan has failed to prove actual damages, and the injunctive relief sought by O'Sullivan is not narrowly tailored to the terms of the Noncompete. Accordingly, the O'Sullivan Motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   , the Neaves Enforceability Motion will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and the Neaves Damages Motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Neaves does not take issue with the Noncompete's one-year duration, nor does the court perceive any legal issues with the duration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Preferred Sys.
