ERICKSEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs brought a class action to recover the hundreds of millions of dollars lost when Lifetouch's stock value declined. Under Section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), Plaintiffs claim that this loss resulted from breaches of fiduciary duties by Lifetouch, Lifetouch's Board of Directors, and Lifetouch Trustees directly responsible for managing the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\"). All Defendants moved to dismiss the claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Subsequently, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action against Defendant Newport Trust, a Lifetouch Trustee, pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i). Therefore, only the claims against Lifetouch, the Board of Directors (\"Directors\"), and Trustees Ted Koenecke and Glenn Elo remain. As set forth below, the Court grants Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lifetouch is a professional photography company focused primarily on school pictures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Until its recent sale to Shutterfly, Lifetouch was 100% owned by its employees through an ESOP sponsored by Lifetouch (\"the Plan\"). Lifetouch made all contributions to the Plan and the Plan invested primarily in shares of Lifetouch stock. According to the Summary Plan Description, Defendant Lifetouch-the Plan Administrator-was responsible for managing the Plan and communicating with Plan participants. Under the terms of the Trust Agreement, Lifetouch's Directors appointed a Trustee, who had exclusive authority to manage the Plan assets in the trust. Defendants Ted Koenecke and Glenn Elo, Lifetouch senior executives, served as Trustees through May 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lifetouch made cash distributions to ESOP participants upon their retirement. In the event of a distribution, Lifetouch stock was repurchased at the fair market value determined by the Trustees on the June 30th immediately preceding the repurchase date. Because Lifetouch was a private company, its share price could not be determined on publicly traded markets. For that reason, the Plan required the Trustees to value Lifetouch stock annually. The Trustees appointed and relied on the opinion of an independent appraiser to determine the fair market value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Starting in 2015, Lifetouch struggled financially as new technologies transformed the professional photography industry and consumer tastes. In 2015 and 2016, Lifetouch suffered repeated financial setbacks. Lifetouch closed J.C. Penney and Target brick-and-mortar portrait studio locations. In November 2015, Lifetouch closed an entire production facility in North Carolina and laid off 206 employees. Additionally, several Lifetouch senior executives retired, culminating in the retirement of then-CEO Paul Harmel in July 2016. In August of 2016, the\n   <em>\n    StarTribune\n   </em>\n   , a major Minnesota newspaper, published an article about Lifetouch's struggles to stay relevant, adapt to modern technology, and satisfy consumer needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During this time, Lifetouch's stock value decreased. On June 30, 2015, the Trustees valued Lifetouch stock at $93 per share, a 10% decrease from the 2014 valuation. On June 30, 2016 the Trustees valued Lifetouch stock at $88 per share, a 5% decrease from the previous year's valuation. On June 30, 2017, the Trustees valued Lifetouch stock at $56 per share, a 36% decrease from the previous year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Lifetouch's financial troubles continued. On January 30, 2018, CEO Michael Meek explained in a\n   <em>\n    StarTribune\n   </em>\n   article that Lifetouch had put itself up for sale because growth had slowed, and Lifetouch was not generating enough cash flow to invest in new technologies and other areas of business. That same month, Shutterfly announced it was acquiring Lifetouch for $825 million plus unspecified cash and investments. After receiving a fairness opinion from a third-party financial advisor, Trustee Newport Trust reviewed and approved the sale price.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lifetouch's sale terminated the Plan and commenced the distribution of proceeds to participants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, \"a complaint must contain sufficient factual\n   matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

First, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs do not plead with particularly, under Rule 9(b), that the Trustees fraudulently inflated Lifetouch's stock value. Second, Defendants argue that Lifetouch's stock drop in 2017 does not plausibly suggest that Defendants overvalued Lifetouch stock in 2015 and 2016.

However, the cases cited by Plaintiffs are distinguishable. These cases involve claims that fiduciaries failed to disclose information about the truth of the stock's value.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jander v. Int'l Bus.

This alleged conduct-providing inaccurate and misleading information to the independent appraiser-sounds in fraud. Moreover, Plaintiffs do not allege that the Trustees simply had knowledge of and failed to disclose fraud; they allege that they breached their duty by committing fraud.

Consequently, the heightened Rule 9(b) pleading standard applies to Plaintiffs' claim that the Trustees manipulated the stock value.

Further, Plaintiffs assert that no negative events occurred internally at Lifetouch in 2017 that would have materially impacted Lifetouch's value. Yet, Lifetouch's stock value did not drop dramatically until 2017. Therefore, say Plaintiffs, Defendants must have overvalued the 2015 and 2016 stock price and withheld Lifetouch's economic struggles to maintain these artificially inflated values. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 56, 60, 78, 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that they state a plausible claim by inferring overvaluation from a stock drop, especially given that they are not sophisticated parties and have not had the benefit of discovery. However, while\n   courts should consider the Plaintiffs' \"limited access to crucial information,\" it still must be reasonable for the court \"to infer from what is alleged that the process was flawed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495155\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/585/#p595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495155\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/585/#p595\">\n    at 596, 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court in\n   <em>\n    Braden\n   </em>\n   clarified that \"[a]n inference pressed by the plaintiff is not plausible if the facts he points to are precisely the result one would expect from lawful conduct in which the defendant is known to have engaged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495155\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/585/#p595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495155\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/585/#p595\">\n    at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Consequently, the Court finds implausible the proffered inference that Lifetouch's stock price was artificially inflated in 2015 and 2016. Plaintiffs argue that Lifetouch's stock value was not negatively impacted in 2017 while at the same time alleging that Lifetouch stock was a risky investment because Lifetouch failed to adapt to new technology and consumer needs. By late 2017, Lifetouch had put itself up for sale. Given the financial hardship alleged by Plaintiffs, a drop in Lifetouch's stock value in 2017 is a \"result one would expect from lawful conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495155\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/585/#p595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For these reasons, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim that Defendants overvalued Lifetouch stock in 2015 and 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Therefore, Plaintiffs conclude that that they have adequately alleged that Defendants failed to monitor and remove imprudent investments under\n   <em>\n    Tibble\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brannen v.

Ga. Aug. 26, 2016) (holding that plaintiffs stated a claim where defendants \"never conducted an investigation into whether the Plan should continue investing in Company Stock\" after the stock value dropped 50% in six months).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court holds that Plaintiffs do not plausibly plead an imprudent investment claim under\n   <em>\n    Tibble\n   </em>\n   . First, according to Plaintiffs' own allegations, Defendants did regularly monitor the Plan's investment. The Complaint states that the Trustee annually determined the fair market value of Lifetouch stock with the opinion of an independent appraiser. This annual valuation\n   of Lifetouch is inconsistent with Plaintiffs' assertion that Defendants conducted absolutely no monitoring of the Plan's investment in the face of changed financial circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Moreover, Lifetouch's stock was not so risky as to make the company stock an imprudent investment. Employer stock is excessively risky when the company is on the verge of collapse. The cases cited by Plaintiffs support this conclusion. In\n   <em>\n    MoneyGram\n   </em>\n   , the stock had lost 92% of its value and the SEC was investigating the company's accounting practices.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207893\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/607/1033/#p1053\">\n    607 F.Supp.2d at 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

LEXIS 14383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   *5 (D. Minn. July 26, 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The financial hardship described in the Complaint does not amount to the financial collapse described in\n   <em>\n    MoneyGram\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ADC Telcoms\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs allege that the stock value dropped a little over 50% from 2014 to 2017, that Lifetouch closed brick-and-mortar portrait studio locations and a production facility laying off 206 employees, that many Lifetouch senior executives retired, and that Lifetouch failed to adapt to new technology and consumer needs. These facts demonstrate financial hardship, but not a company on the verge of collapse. Although Lifetouch faced these financial setbacks, the company was valued at and sold for over $800 million in 2018. Accordingly, Plaintiffs fail to state an imprudent investment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Duty to Monitor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Directors and Lifetouch breached their duty to monitor the Trustees. Fiduciaries have a duty to monitor their appointees, which includes a duty to act if they discover that the appointed fiduciaries are performing improperly.\n   <em>\n    Crocker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243711\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/782/760/#p784\">\n    782 F.Supp.2d at 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs assert that Directors and Lifetouch should have pressured the Trustees to investigate the true value of Lifetouch stock or removed the Trustees from their positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs' monitoring claim because it is derivative of Plaintiffs' prudence claim. The Court agrees. Plaintiffs' failure to plausibly allege any breach by the Trustees precludes the monitoring claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Target\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12419016\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/1063/#p1087\">\n    275 F.Supp.3d at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases) (\"Plaintiffs cannot maintain a claim for breach of the duty to monitor ... absent an underlying breach of the duties imposed under ERISA.\"). Therefore, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs' failure to monitor claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Duty of Loyalty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Directors and Lifetouch breached their duty of loyalty by artificially inflating Lifetouch stock in 2015 and 2016 so that multiple senior executives were able to retire and cash out in part or in whole at an artificially high stock price. Defendants argue that this claim should be dismissed because it relies on the implausible allegation that senior executives manipulated Lifetouch's stock price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Fiduciaries must discharge their duties \"solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plans.\"\n   <em>\n    Bigger v.

First, Plaintiffs did not plausibly allege that senior executives manipulated the financial data. Second, the Trustees relied on an independent appraiser to evaluate the stock value. Third, it is not surprising nor suggestive of malfeasance that senior executives would depart a company experiencing financial hardship. As discussed above, there is no inference of wrongdoing from actions that \"one would expect.\"\n   <em>\n    Braden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495155\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/585/#p595\">\n    588 F.3d at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs' loyalty claim largely repeats the allegations of their prudence claim. Because the Court found the artificial inflation claim implausible, the Court also concludes that Plaintiffs' derivative loyalty claim fails.\n   <em>\n    Target Corp. Sec.
