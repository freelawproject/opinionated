The Michigan State Senate map was primarily drawn by Terry Marquardt, a senior Republican Senate staffer. (Marquardt Dep., ECF No. 129-46 at 23:1-25:2; 31:2-15.) The task of redistricting the Michigan State House map fell to Daniel McMaster, a senior Republican advisor in the House, who later retained Brian Began to assist him. (McMaster Dep., ECF No. 129-47 at 36:4-5, 49:14, 50:4-51:24.) Republican lawmakers outsourced the drawing of the Congressional Districts to the Michigan Redistricting Resource Institute, which in turn hired Jeff Timmer of Sterling Corporation, a Republican consulting firm. (Labrant Dep., ECF No. 129-44 at 140:23-141:05.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Marquardt, McMaster, Began, and Timmer participated in weekly meetings at the Dickinson Wright law firm where they reported on the maps upon which they were working and strategized about the mapmaking process. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Timmer Dep., ECF No. 129-49 at 56:17-18; Marquardt Dep., ECF No. 129-46 at 82:18-22; McMaster Dep., ECF No. 129-47 at 52:9-54:15; Labrant Dep., ECF No. 129-44 at 235:5-237:19.) Attorneys for Republican legislators also attended the meetings to provide legal counsel to the mapmakers. (Labrant Dep., ECF No. 129-44 at 235:5-2:37:19; McMaster Dep., ECF No. 129-47 at 53:14-54:8; Timmer Dep., ECF No. 129-49 at 256:24-257:2.) Bob Labrant, the founder of the Michigan Redistricting Resource Institute, also participated. (Labrant Dep., ECF No. 129-44 at 236:25-237:11.) These meetings were \"confidential.\" (Timmer Dep., ECF No. 129-49 at 256:18-23.) No Democratic representative or interest group ever attended the meetings. (Timmer Dep., ECF No. 129-49 at 56:19-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The maps were also highly secretive. During meetings where McMaster showed individual Republican legislators copies of their districts' maps, he collected the maps after the meetings \"for security.\" (McMaster Dep., ECF No. 129-47 at 136:25-137:16.) Even the Republican Senate Majority Leader was \"just shown\" the maps at one of the mapmakers' weekly meetings-he was \"not allowed to keep a copy.\" (Marquardt Dep., ECF No. 129-46 at 83:1-9, 127:23-128:2.) And at a Senate Redistricting Committee meeting that took place on June 22, 2011-the day before the Senate passed the Apportionment Plan-the copies of the Apportionment Plan made available to members of the public \"consisted entirely of census data\" and \"did not contain any maps.\" (Smith Decl., ECF No. 129-54 at PageID # 4974.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The mapmakers relied on political data to draw the maps. For the Congressional Districts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Timmer used software called \"Maptitude\" which contained \"population ... and election data.\" (Timmer Dep., ECF No. 129-49 at 29:10-17.) Marquardt, drawer of the Senate Districts, used software called \"AutoBound\" that \"digitize[d] all the political data,\" i.e., \"election results through the years,\" all the way \"down to\n   the block level.\" (Marquardt Dep., ECF No. 129-46 at 40:5-43:8.) Marquardt elected to have AutoBound automatically update the partisan composition of the districts as he drew the maps. (Marquardt Dep., ECF No. 129-46 at 195:16-197:20.) McMaster and Began, who drew the House Districts, also used AutoBound to create their maps. (Began Dep., ECF No. 129-41 at 31:17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The \"underlying factor\" for the mapmakers was that \"if the plans don't pass the legislature ... you've done your work for nothing.\" (Marquardt Dep., ECF No. 129-46 at 56:23-57:4.) The \"major consideration as far as getting the [legislature's] vote\" was the fact that \"sitting ... senators or representatives ... want to be re-elected.\" (Marquardt Dep., ECF No. 129-46 at 69:9-14.) With these considerations in mind, Marquardt prepared reports for every Republican caucus member that showed his or her current district and his or her proposed district. (Marquardt Dep., ECF No. 129-46 at 101:1-104:15.) The reports contained two sets of political data for each current and proposed district: (1) the percentage of voters who voted for the Republican candidate in the previous three governors' races and (2) the percentage of voters who voted in the last three elections for the statewide education boards, a \"guideline\" for the partisan makeup of the districts. (Marquardt Dep., ECF No. 129-46 at 102:3-103:22.) Marquardt provided these political data points to Republican senators \"[b]ecause the senators obviously would be interested in knowing whether their district got better or worse,\" better being more Republican or less Democrat. (Marquardt Dep., ECF No. 129-46 at 104:1-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Emails that the mapmakers exchanged illustrate the profound extent to which partisan political considerations played into their redistricting efforts. For example, a staffer wrote Timmer about \"a glorious way that makes it easier to cram ALL of the Dem garbage in Wayne, Washtenaw, Oakland, and Macomb counties into only four districts.\" (ECF No. 129-18 at PageID # 3557.) Timmer responded, \"[i]nteresting numbers overall. Detroit being 150k less than projected shakes things up.\" (ECF No. 129-18 at PageID # 3557.) In a different email, a staffer approved of one of Timmer's proposed maps, saying it was \"perfect\" because \"it's giving the finger to [S]andy [L]evin,\" a long-time Democratic United States Congressman. (ECF No. 129-30 at PageID # 3606.) In another email, Timmer remarked that a proposed district \"is a bit less GOP, but not so much less so that it is in jeopardy of going south on us.\" (ECF No. 129-31 at PageID # 3611.) In the same email, Timmer explained that, under the new districts, \"the new 3rd would become slightly less Republican\" to allow another seat \"to become slightly more so.\" (ECF No. 129-31 at PageID # 3611.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The mapmakers' efforts proved extremely successful. In each of the three statewide elections held under the Apportionment Plan between 2012 and 2016, the Republicans won 64% of Michigan's Congressional Districts (i.e., 9 of Michigan's 14 seats) despite never winning more than 50.5% of the statewide vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, Republicans won at least 53.6% of the House Districts while never winning more than 50.3% of the total vote share.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in\n   2014, the only year an election was held under the Apportionment Plan's Senate Districts, Republicans won only 50.4% of the vote but collected 71.1% of the seats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats won 50% of the Congressional Districts despite winning approximately 55.8% of the vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, Democrats won only 52 of the 110 House Districts despite securing 52.6% of the vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Elections were not held for Senate Districts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against Johnson on December 22, 2017. (ECF. No. 1.) Johnson filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing on January 23, 2018 (ECF No. 11), which this Court granted in part and denied in part on May 16, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Op. &amp; Order, ECF No. 54.) The Court held that Plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the Apportionment Plan \"on a statewide basis\" and dismissed Plaintiffs' statewide claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 957.) However, the Court concluded that Plaintiffs had adequately pleaded standing on a district-by-district basis because they had alleged they each had been placed in a district drawn to intentionally reduce the power of their votes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 950.) Thus, the Court denied Johnson's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing with regard to Plaintiffs' district-by-district claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This Court's Opinion and Order anticipated the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gill v.

In\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs cannot establish standing on political gerrymandering claims alleging vote dilution in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause by showing a generalized statewide injury because \"the injury is district specific.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n    at 1930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to present the requisite evidence of individual, district-specific harm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For purposes of the pending motions, the Individual Plaintiffs have satisfied the injury in fact requirement from\n   <em>\n    Gill.\n   </em>\n   Individual Plaintiffs have submitted evidence of district-specific injuries to their individual votes through an expert report prepared by Dr. Jowei Chen, Ph.D. (ECF No. 129-51) and a declaration and charts submitted by Dr. Christopher Warshaw that elaborate on Dr. Chen's findings. (ECF No. 129-57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Dr. Chen analyzed whether the Apportionment Plan produced \"an extreme partisan outcome that diverges from possible alternative maps.\" (Chen Rep., ECF No. 129-51 at PageID # 4709.) In his analysis, Dr. Chen used a simulation process that, according to him, \"ignores all partisan and racial considerations when drawing districts\" and instead \"optimize[s] districts with respect to various traditional districting goals, such as equalizing population, maximizing geographic compactness, and preserving county, municipal, and ward boundaries.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Using these non-partisan criteria, Dr. Chen generated 3,000 \"randomly drawn districting plans that closely follow and optimize on these traditional districting criteria\"-1,000 alternative Congressional districting plans, 1,000 alternative State House districting plans, and 1,000 alternative State Senate districting plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Chen then compared these simulated plans to the enacted Apportionment Plan on a district-by-district level by \"align[ing] the districts from each enacted and computer-simulated plan from least to most Republican\" and \"directly\n   compar[ing] ... the partisanship\" of each real-life district under the Apportionment Plan to the 1,000 alternative districts generated for each type of map. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4761.) By comparing individual districts under the Apportionment Plan to the corresponding alternative districts generated using traditional non-partisan criteria, Dr. Chen could opine whether a district under the Apportionment Plan is \"a partisan outlier compared to the simulated districts that cover the same geographic area.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Chen defined a \"partisan outlier\" as a district whose \"partisanship,\" based on all statewide elections held between 2012 and 2016, falls outside \"the middle 95% range of the simulated geographically overlapping districts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4762.) In other words, these districts are more partisan than 95% of simulated districts drawn using traditional non-partisan criteria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Dr. Chen concluded that nine of the Apportionment Plan's Congressional Districts are partisan outliers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4762-63.) Congressional Districts 5, 9, and 12 are partisan outliers because they \"pack[ ] together Democrats to an unusual degree.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4762.) Each of these Congressional Districts packs Democrats together more tightly than\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the 1,000 computer-generated simulation districts drawn using traditional non-partisan criteria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appendix D2,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4781.) Congressional Districts 4, 7, 8, and 10 are partisan outliers because they crack Democratic voters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4762.) In the vast majority of the simulations, each of these Congressional Districts would be \"more partisan competitive or perhaps even a slightly Democratic-leaning district.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Congressional Districts 1 and 11 are also partisan outliers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4763). It appears that Congressional Districts 1 and 11, which are majority Republican districts, would contain even more Republican voters than they currently do in many of the simulations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendix D2,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4871.) Accordingly, these districts \"crack\" Democratic voters; an artificially high number of Democrats are placed there to dilute their voting power compared to other possible districts. Dr. Chan also found that numerous Michigan House and Michigan Senate districts are partisan outliers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Dr. Chen's analysis and opinion provide evidence of district-specific vote dilution. But Dr. Chen does not name any Individual Plaintiff or League member in his expert report. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , Chen Rep., ECF No. 129-51.) Accordingly, Plaintiffs cannot establish injury in fact from Dr. Chen's report by itself-his report does not show \"disadvantage to [Individual Plaintiffs or League members] as individuals\" because it does not provide any evidence that any Individual Plaintiff or League member actually lives in a district where his or her vote has been diluted.\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).

They also present evidence that tends to establish the crucial link between the gerrymandered districts identified by Dr. Chen and the district-specific harm to each Plaintiff. This evidence comes in the form of a declaration and several charts from Dr. Warshaw, one of Plaintiffs' experts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 129-57 (Warshaw Declaration), ECF No. 129-38 (Warshaw Charts).) Dr. Warshaw (1) obtained each Individual Plaintiff and League member's address, (2) determined in which district each Individual Plaintiff and League member lives under the current Apportionment Plan, and (3) using Dr. Chen's data, compared the partisanship of the districts in which each Individual Plaintiff and League member currently lives with the partisanship of all simulated districts that contain the same address. (Warshaw Decl., ECF No. 129-57, at PageID # 4997.) Dr. Warshaw then created charts which he asserts visually depict how partisan a particular Plaintiff's current district is compared to all the simulated districts that contain that Plaintiff's same address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   If after trial this Court accepts the Chen-Warshaw testimony and conclusions, Dr. Chen's report and Dr. Warshaw's charts could show an injury in fact to each Individual Plaintiff. Dr. Chen's report asserts that several Congressional Districts, Senate Districts, and House Districts are gerrymandered \"partisan outliers\" that crack or pack Democratic voters and dilute their votes. Dr. Warshaw connects each Individual Plaintiff to an individual, district-specific harm by (1) determining in which district each Individual Plaintiff currently resides and (2) comparing the level of partisanship in each Individual Plaintiff's actual district to the level of partisanship in each simulated district that would contain each Individual Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Individual Plaintiffs have presented evidence that they actually live in allegedly packed or cracked districts. Accordingly, they have asserted, with sufficient proof under rule 56, district-specific harms, injuries to themselves \"as individuals,\"\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"the effect that [the] gerrymander has on the votes of particular citizens.\"\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence for a fact-finder to conclude that Individual Plaintiffs have suffered an injury in fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1929-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Johnson argues that the Individual Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate injury in fact because they rely on a large number of alternative simulated districts rather than on a single alternative district plan for each district they challenge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Johnson Br., ECF No. 119 at PageID # 2415-22.) But\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   does not require a plaintiff to rely on a single alternative map. In\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that the harm in political gerrymandering cases \"arises from the particular composition of the voter's own district, which causes his vote-having been packed or cracked-to carry less weight than it would carry in\n   <em>\n    another, hypothetical district.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, each Individual Plaintiff has shown that because of packing or cracking, her vote currently-in 2018-carries less weight than it would carry in\n   <em>\n    thousands of hypothetical districts.\n   </em>\n   Evidence of vote dilution based on thousands of alternative districts, rather\n   than on a single alternative map, can be considered at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Johnson next contends that Individual Plaintiffs failed to show injury in fact because Dr. Chen \"performed only\n   <em>\n    statewide\n   </em>\n   analyses\" that may demonstrate \"statewide\" partisan \"intent\" but do not show that a given district is gerrymandered or could be remedied by an alternative map. (Johnson Reply Br., ECF No. 132 at PageID # 5405) (emphasis in original). Dr. Chen did create simulated districts for each challenged district, which in his analysis\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   show that district-specific injuries could be remedied by alternative configurations drawn using non-partisan criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Johnson also contends that Individual Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate injury in fact because, according to Johnson, Dr. Chen testified that he did not have a clear sense of what it means for a district to be \"cracked\" or \"packed.\" (Johnson Reply Br. at PageID # 5045.) However, in the passage cited by Johnson, Dr. Chen explains that existing academic literature does not provide a clear definition for when the partisan makeup of a given district rises to the level of \"packing\" or \"cracking.\" (Chen Dep., ECF No. 119-4 at PageID # 2472.) Importantly, Dr. Chen then explains that, for the purposes of\n   <em>\n    his analysis\n   </em>\n   , he considered a district to be \"packed\" or \"cracked\" if 95% of the alternative simulated districts had a less partisan vote share than the current district. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 2475.) A reasonable fact-finder could conclude that Dr. Chen knew what he meant when he concluded that the districts he identified as \"partisan outliers\" had been \"packed\" or \"cracked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Johnson additionally argues that Plaintiffs lack standing because they only speculate about hypothetical future harms and because none of their experts stated that Plaintiffs' harms would reoccur in the 2020 election cycle. (Johnson Br., ECF No. 119 at 48; Johnson Reply Br., ECF No. 132 at 1.) However, just as an example, Kenneth Mayer, Ph.D., one of Plaintiffs' experts, opined that the gerrymander has persisted \"over a ten year period and 6 electoral cycles.\" (Mayer Rep., ECF No. 129-52 at PageID # 4881.) At this stage, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs and draw all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor.\n   <em>\n    Matsushita\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205783\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/574/#p587\">\n    475 U.S. at 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205783\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/574/#p587\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277684\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/754/#p758\">\n    848 F.3d at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court draws the reasonable inference that Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence that the partisan gerrymander-which has persisted through multiple election cycles over an extended period of time-could harm Plaintiffs again in the 2020 elections.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277684\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/754/#p758\">\n    848 F.3d at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, Defendants repeatedly asserted at oral argument that Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate injury in fact because Democratic candidates won the same number of Congressional seats as Republican candidates in the 2018 midterm election. However, focusing entirely on only one election is inappropriate given that Plaintiffs have presented evidence that the Apportionment Plan is a durable partisan gerrymander that has existed for, and persisted over, several election cycles. Furthermore, the fact that Democrats and Republicans won an equal number of Congressional seats does not foreclose a finding that the Apportionment Plan is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. For instance, it is possible that Democrats would have won an even greater number of seats in the 2018 midterm election but for the unconstitutional gerrymander they allege. Taking Defendants' argument to its logical conclusion illustrates the flaw in Defendants' argument. Under Defendants' theory, a voter whose party received 99%\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   of the vote-but only won half of the seats-could not prevail on her partisan gerrymandering claim, even if she showed individualized, district-specific harm.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Smith's responsibilities \"include making frequent educational presentations about redistricting topics and issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4975.) \"Since June 2011, [Smith has] presented educational redistricting information to the public at many town hall meetings across the state [of Michigan].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Smith has also \"personally trained more than eighty (80) League members across the state in how to use the League's PowerPoint presentation and handouts to educate voters about redistricting in Michigan and how the 2011 maps affected the various communities in the State of Michigan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4976.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   According to Smith, the Apportionment Plan has \"made [the League's] mission of education and engagement much harder in a variety of ways.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Apportionment Plan has made it more difficult for the League to convince Republican candidates to participate in \"candidate forums\" because \"so many Republican candidates are no longer running in competitive races\" and do not feel a need to engage with the electorate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, the Apportionment Plan has caused elected representatives to \"become less responsive\" to the League's legislative proposals because many representatives possess \"safe seats.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, the Apportionment Plan has caused many Michigan voters to experience \"voter apathy and cynicism,\" which \"directly challenges [the League's] mission of empowering voters and defending democracy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 4977.)

Johnson contends that the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs' claims on the pleadings because Plaintiffs' Complaint does not allege district-specific harms, but instead asserts only statewide injuries that, after\n    <em>\n     Gill\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n     138 S.Ct. 1916\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , cannot give rise to an injury in fact. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Johnson Br., ECF No. 119 at 5-9.) Johnson's argument is unpersuasive. Contrary to Johnson's contention, Plaintiffs pleaded district-specific harms. For example, they alleged that \"individual Plaintiffs are being harmed by the Michigan Legislature's gerrymandering of their\n    <em>\n     individual congressional and legislative districts.\n    </em>\n    \" (Compl., ECF No. 1 at 6) (emphasis added). Furthermore, the Complaint alleges that the Apportionment Plan \"singles out the individual Plaintiffs and hundreds of thousands of other similarly-situated Michigan Democrats based on their political affiliation, and\n    <em>\n     intentionally places them in voting districts that reduce or eliminate the power of their votes.\n    </em>\n    \" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 2) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs also alleged a \"challenge [to] the Current Apportionment Plan\n    <em>\n     district by district\n    </em>\n    and in its entirety.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    at 16) (emphasis added). Furthermore, this Court has\n    <em>\n     already held\n    </em>\n    that Plaintiffs' Complaint sufficiently alleged district-specific harms at the motion to dismiss stage. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Op. &amp; Order, ECF No. 54.) Johnson's contention that the Court should revisit its prior determination is without merit. The Court also rejects Johnson's argument that Plaintiffs' challenges to the Senate Districts should be denied as moot now that the 2018 elections have occurred. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Johnson Br., ECF No. 119 at 9.) As the Court previously explained, remedial special elections may be required to remedy the constitutional harms that Plaintiffs allege. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Op. &amp; Ord., ECF No. 88 at 8.) In other words, \"Plaintiffs have requested a possible relief\" with regards to the Senate Districts.

But I disagree with the majority opinion's rationale in the discussion section I.B.2. Specifically, in my view, no Plaintiff-not the League or any individually named Plaintiff-has properly supported standing for a statewide claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   As the majority opinion explains, the individual Plaintiffs have brought forth sufficient evidence to show vote dilution at a district-level basis to support a claim under the Equal Protection Clause under\n   <em>\n    Gill v. Whitford\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1930,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612324\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1916/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Individual Plaintiffs rightly argue that the same evidence that supports their standing for an equal protection claim also supports a vote dilution claim under the First Amendment. Thus, individual Plaintiffs have alleged and supported only district-by-district standing. Accordingly, the League has derivative standing to challenge the reapportionment plan for any district in which its members reside and have put forth the requisite evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   However, a problem arises when the League claims standing independent from its members. To begin, the League conflates two distinct types of \"associational\" standing: (1) First Amendment\n   <em>\n    associational\n   </em>\n   standing, as outlined in Justice Kagan's concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1938 ; and (2) independent standing for an\n   organization or\n   <em>\n    association\n   </em>\n   , as outlined in\n   <em>\n    Havens Realty Corp. v.

For the reasons stated below, I do not believe the League has satisfied the requirements for either type of associational standing to be able to challenge the reapportionment plan on a statewide basis. For First Amendment associational standing, the League is not the right type of plaintiff; for independent standing for an organization or association, the League does not provide the right type of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    First Amendment Associational Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The League cannot take advantage of First Amendment associational standing because it is not a political party or related entity. In her concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Gill\n   </em>\n   , Justice Kagan recognized an \"associational harm of a partisan gerrymander [that] is distinct from vote dilution.\" 138 S.Ct. at 1938 (Kagan, J., concurring).
