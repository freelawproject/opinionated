The court has also considered the probability of Plaintiff's success on the merits and the amount of the settlement in relation to the potential recovery. The proposed settlement appears to be the product of arms-length bargaining between experienced collective counsel and experienced defense counsel, who have independently evaluated the likelihood of prevailing on their claims and defenses.

Here, counsel submitted the hourly breakdown of tasks but provided generic categorical specifications of the task (such as \"case management,\" \"client meetings/call,\" and \"correspondence\") and no date for the tasks. This lack of specification makes it difficult for the court to assess duplication of effort or unproductive time but, because Plaintiff's counsel is seeking less than its lodestar fees and reduced the lodestar fee they are seeking by 41 percent, this significant reduction lessens the court's need to ascertain any duplicative efforts in determining whether the lodestar is reasonable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Phillips\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202636289\">\n     2016 WL 2636289\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at * 8 (finding that even though \"the narrative description of the work of the attorneys suggests that there may have been some duplicative work,\" the number of hours provided by counsel was permissible because, since the recovery was only 30 percent of the settlement amount, it was less than what counsel might be paid by a client paying by the hour even if those hours were discounted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     But\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Stone v.
