Defendant relies on two exceptions to the third-party waiver rule to argue otherwise. First, it asks the court to find that the input offered by Mr. Pollock and Mr. Hanford was necessary for Allergan's attorneys to provide informed legal advice. Second, Allergan argues that Mr. Pollock and Mr. Hanford were functionally equivalent to its own employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On December 19, 2018, I heard extensive oral argument on plaintiffs' motion. For the reasons stated below, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Allergan has submitted declarations from Damon Burrows, its Vice President and Associate General Counsel during the relevant period; Robert Lively, Allergan's Vice President of Global Government Affairs; and Christina Markus, a partner at King &amp; Spalding, a law firm Allergan retained to provide legal advice concerning, among other things, regulatory issues. These declarations describe the roles that Mr. Pollock and Mr. Hanford played in responding to the draft guidance of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which contained recommendations to applicants seeking approval for generic versions of Restasis \u00ae, Allergan's branded version of cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion. Allergan's responses to this draft guidance-which included filing comments and citizen petitions-are central to the plaintiffs' allegations in this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Restasis (Cyclosporine Ophthalmic Emulsion) Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527290\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/333/135/\">\n    333 F.Supp.3d 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Robert Pollock of Lachman Consultant Services, Inc.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Pollock is the former Acting Deputy Director of the FDA's Office of Generic Drugs. In July 2013, Allergan retained Mr. Pollock as a consultant based on the recommendation of Mr. Burrows, who believed Mr. Pollock would help \"ensure that Allergan's in-house and outside attorneys provided informed and effective legal advice regarding the FDA draft guidance and related documents.\" Mr. Burrows and Ms. Markus \"consider[ed] Mr. Pollock to have uniquely specialized knowledge and experience on FDA regulatory issues,\" especially FDA draft guidance. Mr. Burrows believed that Mr. Pollock's knowledge \"was different from what Allergan's employees and attorneys could have themselves provided.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As an example of when Mr. Pollock's \"specialized input\" shaped her legal advice, Ms. Markus cites an email in which she shared with Allergan's legal team and Mr. Pollock a draft of Allergan's comment on the FDA's draft guidance. She sent the email to \"obtain[ ] Mr. Pollock's strategic advice\" about the document so that she \"could provide effective legal advice to Allergan and its in-house counsel.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Mr. Burrows and Ms. Markus, Mr. Pollock worked closely with Allergan's attorneys to determine its strategy regarding the FDA. They treated Mr. Pollock as they did any other Allergan employee; he was \"an integral member\" of their team. Mr. Burrows and Ms. Markus believed that confidential communications shared with Mr. Pollock would remain confidential, and Allergan's consulting agreement with Lachman Consultant Services\n   required that the firm not disclose Allergan's confidential information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Timothy Hanford of ADC Strategies LLC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After Allergan retained Mr. Hanford in August 2015, Mr. Lively recommended that Allergan's legal team work with him to respond to the FDA's draft guidance. Mr. Hanford had previously served as counsel to the U.S. House of Representatives' Ways and Means Committee and, according to Mr. Lively, had \"many years of experience and deep knowledge about members of Congress and congressional and federal agency practices.\" Mr. Lively \"consider[ed] Mr. Hanford to have uniquely specialized knowledge and experiences with government affairs involving health care.\" Although Mr. Hanford is a lawyer, he did not provide Allergan with legal advice. However, Mr. Lively considered Mr. Hanford \"keenly aware of the type of information lawyers need to provide effective legal advice to a corporate client.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Lively, who is not a lawyer, forwarded emails containing privileged information from Allergan's attorneys to Mr. Hanford. Plaintiffs have highlighted two such emails, redacted versions of which were provided to the court. The first contains legal advice from Robert Bailey, Allergan's General Counsel, about an executive order relevant to the company's communications with the FDA regarding cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion. The second contains legal advice from three lawyers, including Mr. Bailey, concerning Allergan's August 2017 citizen petition. According to Mr. Lively, he forwarded these emails to Mr. Hanford so that Mr. Hanford could provide \"strategic advice\" to Mr. Lively and Allergan's counsel. Mr. Lively also sought Mr. Hanford's \"reaction and input\" regarding Mr. Bailey's advice to inform Mr. Lively's discussions with Mr. Bailey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Ms. Markus and Mr. Lively explained that they worked with Mr. Hanford as they did with any other Allergan employee; he was an \"important\" or \"integral\" member of the team tasked with responding to the FDA and to Congress regarding Restasis \u00ae. They considered communications shared with Mr. Hanford confidential. The consulting agreement between Allergan and ADC Strategies required that ADC Strategies keep information it received from Allergan confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Since this approach is inconsistent with my understanding of Second Circuit law, I decline to follow it and will, instead, address the facts here in light of the applicable law in this Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, defendant has not shown that Mr. Pollock and Mr. Hanford played such exceptional roles at Allergan that they should be treated as anything other than typical part-time consultants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed above, Allergan engaged Mr. Pollock and Mr. Hanford through routine consulting agreements to enhance its regulatory strategy regarding Restasis \u00ae. Although the declarations submitted by defendant attempt to portray the consultants' knowledge as unique and specialized, their expertise supplemented the knowledge of others at Allergan. Indeed, Allergan has its own in-house governmental affairs team. That it was too\n   small to handle the complexities of the situation facing Restasis \u00ae, as counsel argued at oral argument, did not transform its consultants into\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant also has not demonstrated that either Mr. Pollock or Mr. Hanford exercised any independent decision-making for Allergan. According to defendant, both consultants \"evaluate[d] legal developments and provide[d] information and advice\" on issues involving the FDA. Thus, while they offered their input to those at Allergan who made decisions, they did not make decisions themselves. Nor did either consultant appear on Allergan's behalf or correspond with third parties as company representatives. The consultants also worked out of their own offices (not Allergan's), communicated via the email addresses provided by their consulting firms (not Allergan), and likely served as consultants for other companies while they were assisting Allergan. Moreover, Allergan has not shown that either Mr. Pollock or Mr. Hanford was so integrated into its corporate structure that he sought and received legal advice from Allergan's counsel, rather than solely providing his input to Allergan's counsel and staff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In conclusion, defendant has not met its burden to demonstrate that Mr. Pollock and Mr. Hanford were functionally equivalent to its own employees. Their roles, while no doubt important, are a far cry from that of the consultants in\n   <em>\n    In re Bieter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531841\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/16/929/#p933\">\n    16 F.3d at 933-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    In re Copper Mkt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1273830\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/200/213/#p219\">\n    200 F.R.D. at 215-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Lively, who is not a lawyer, not only made the referral but also often served as the conduit of information between Mr. Hanford and Allergan's counsel-casting significant doubt on defendant's claim that its counsel required Mr. Hanford's input to impart effective legal advice.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated Mar. 24, 2003\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108096\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/265/321/#p331\">\n     265 F.Supp.2d 321\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 331 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (\"[The client] would not have enjoyed any privilege for her own communications with [the consultants] if she had hired [them] directly, even if her object in doing so had been purely to affect her legal situation.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Courts often evaluate these factors in the context of a test set forth in\n    <em>\n     Exp.-Imp.

While Mr. Hanford's relationship with Allergan spanned several years, it is not clear how much of his work for the company involved Restasis \u00ae as opposed to other drugs. This motion concerns only 92 emails sent over the course of two years, which is hardly indicative of a\n    <em>\n     de facto\n    </em>\n    employee (although Mr. Hanford may have participated in other non-privileged communications). I also note that Mr. Lively declared that he \"often\"-as opposed to always-worked with Mr. Hanford in the same manner in which he worked with other Allergan employees.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
