PAULEY III, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b585-22\">Plaintiffs bring this securities fraud class action pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 against Omnicom, Inc. (\u201cOmni-com\u201d) and various members of its management (collectively, the \u201cDefendants\u201d). Plaintiffs assert that Omnicom (1) failed to write down internet investments it transferred to Seneca Investments LLC (\u201cSene-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ea\u201d), a newly-formed entity (the \u201cSeneca Transaction\u201d); (2) improperly accounted for the transaction; and (3) failed to carry the value of Seneca on its books. Defendants move for summary judgment. For the following reasons, Defendants\u2019 motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The following facts are not in dispute. Omnicom is a global marketing and advertising holding company. On May 7, 2001, <em>Advertising Age </em>reported that \u201cOmnicom Group shifted its minority stakes in Agency.com, Organic and Razorfish into a new E-services holding company to be co-managed with a venture capital unit of Pegasus Capital Advisors\u201d and the \u201cmove was seen by some as a way for Omnicom to get struggling stocks off of its books.\u201d (Declaration of Jeff G. Hammel dated September 7, 2007 (\u201cHammel Deck\u201d) Ex. 04: Debra Aho Williamson, \u201cThe Fairy Tale Ends; Interactive 100 Stumbles After DoWCom Business Blows Away,\u201d <em>Advertising Age, </em>May 7, 2001, at SI.) On June 26, 2001, <em>IntemetNews.com </em>described Seneca as \u201ca complicated effort by ad agency group Omnicom to lessen its losses in the interactive sector.\u201d (Hammel Decl. Ex. P4: Christopher Saunders, \u201cSeneca to Absorb Agency.com,\u201d <em>IntemetNews.com, </em>June 26, 2001.) On September 17, 2001, <em>Fortune </em>reported that \u201c[John Wren, Omnicom\u2019s CEO,] is now getting all the Net assets off Omnicom\u2019s books by shoveling them into a private holding company called Seneca.\u201d (Hammel Deck Ex. U3: Patricia Sellers, \u201cRocking Through The Ad Recession; Omnicom is defying the Madison Avenue slump thanks to its CEO\u2019s aggressive, con-trarian strategy,\u201d <em>Fortune, </em>Sept. 17, 2001.) On March 26, 2002, Omnicom filed a Form 10-K disclosing that it had recorded no gain or loss on the Seneca Transaction. (Hammel Deck Ex. Al: Omnicom Group, Inc.2001 Form 10-K, filed Mar. 26, 2002 at F-13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">There were no statistically significant changes in Omnicom\u2019s stock price after any of these news reports. (Defs. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 203, 205, 207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">On June 5, 2002, Onmicom filed a Form 8-K which stated that \u201c[o]n May 22, 2002, Robert J. Callander, an outside director (age 72; Board member since 1992), resigned from the Board of Directors.\u201d (Hammel Deck Ex. S4: Omnicom Group Inc. Form 8-K, dated June 5, 2002 at 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">On June 6, 2002 rumors of a forthcoming negative <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article circulated, and Omnicom\u2019s stock price declined. (Expert Report of Scott D. Hakala, Ph.D., CFA dated December 18, 2006 (\u201cHakala Report\u201d) \u00b6 70; Corrected Declaration of David R. Hassel dated August 22, 2007 (\u201cHassel Deck\u201d), Ex. 128: \u201cOMC: The Real Story \u2014 Reiterate Buy on OMC,\u201d Sa-lomon Smith Barney, June 6, 2002.) The price continued to decline the following day after further speculation that a negative <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article was imminent. (Hakala Report \u00b6 71; Hassel Deck Exs. 431: Omnicom Group (OMC), UBS Warburg, June 7, 2002 &amp; 125: Omnicom Group, Inc.: A Rare Buying Opportunity, Merrill Lynch, June 7, 2007.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">On June 11, 2002, the Financial Times reported that in 2001 Omnicom had \u201cstruck a \u2018clever ploy\u2019 to avoid taking a hit in last year\u2019s accounts for the \u2018massive\u2019 losses sustained by internet companies in which it had invested .... Omnicom\u2019s investments were hived off into an investment company called Seneca in exchange for a special type of non-convertible preferred stock. The complex arrangement avoided the need for Omnicom to take a write-down .... [Eventually,] Callander came to question whether the board had approved the Seneca vehicle.\u201d (Hammel Deck Ex. Q4: Richard Tomkins &amp; Christopher Grimes, \u201cOmnicom shares wobble amid disclosure fears,\u201d <em>Financial Times, </em>June 11, 2002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>On June 12, 2002, a <em>Wall Street Journal </em>article reported that Callander resigned \u201camid questions about how the company handled a series of soured Internet investments.\u201d (Hassel Decl. Ex. 3: Vanessa O\u2019Connell &amp; Jesse Eisinger, \u201cUnadvertised Deals: At an Ad Giant, Nimble Financing Fuels Rapid Growth,\u201d <em>The Wall Street Journal, </em>June 12, 2002 (the \u201cWSJ Article\u201d), at 1.) The WSJ Article discusses the Seneca Transaction, noting that \u201c[a]mong [its] advantages ... was that it allowed the company to avoid the possibility of writing down the value of its investments in some of the online firms.\u201d (WSJ Article at 1.) It quotes John Wren, Omincom\u2019s chief executive officer, as saying, \u201cSeneca was smart because instead of just walking away from these [investments] and taking a write-off, we said we believe that Pegasus, through Seneca, could restructure the assets and make them valuable again,\u201d and notes that \u201cOmnicom was [also] able to preclude having to record its proportional share of any losses from Agency.com.\u201d (WSJ Article at 4.) The WSJ Article also quotes two accounting professors, who, \u201cbased on the public filings on Seneca with the SEC,\u201d note that the Seneca Transaction \u201craises a red flag: Omnicom reported that it unloaded a batch of troubled Internet investments without recording a loss,\u201d and \u201cwonder where this fair value is coming from in this environment.\u201d (WSJ Article at 4-5.) According to the WSJ Article, after Wren informed the board that he wanted to buy back two of the firms that Seneca had taken private, Callander resigned. (WSJ Article at 1, 5.) Callander reportedly wondered about the purpose of the Seneca Transaction and whether Omnicom executives had engaged in the Seneca Transaction without board approval. (WSJ Article at 1, 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">More than a third of the WSJ Article was devoted to negative commentary on previous disclosures by Omnicom concerning the manner in which it reported \u201corganic growth\u201d and its use of \u201cearn-out\u201d deals. (WSJ Article at 2-4.) For example, the WSJ Article reports at length about other \u201ctactics\u201d that \u201craise[] questions\u201d in the post-Enron environment. It states that \u201cOmnicom makes it difficult to evaluate its growth numbers ...., us[ing] the term [organic growth] more expansively than its rivals ...., [thereby] tending to pump up the organic-growth rate.\u201d (WSJ Article at 2-3.) It notes that \u201cif cash spent on acquisitions is subtracted, the company has a negative cash flow.\u201d (WSJ Artice at 3.) It also comments that Omni-com\u2019s use of earn-out payments \u201cought to be reported as a compensation expense\u201d and not as acquisition expenses, highlighting that \u201cOmnicom\u2019s obligations to make future earn-out payments amount to a substantial potential liability ... [and] that the company currently owes future payments of $250 million to $350 million.\u201d (WSJ Article at 3-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Also on June 12, <em>Reuters </em>quoted a Sun-Trust Robinson Humphrey analyst attributing Omnicom\u2019s historic stock price premium to the credibility of its management and noting that \u201c[u]ntil they can regain that credibility on the issues raised in the Journal, they\u2019ll probably trade in line with the group.\u201d (Hassel Decl. Ex. 125: Adam Pasick, \u201cUpdate 1-Omnicom defends accounting as stock plunges,\u201d <em>Reuters, </em>June 12, 2002 at 1-2.) Omnicom\u2019s closing price declined from $77.56 on June 11, 2002 to $62.28 on June 12, 2002. (Hammel Decl. Ex. B4: Omnicom Group Inc. Stock Price and Volume Data, CRSP, June 5, 2002-Dec. 31, 2002 at 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">On June 13, Omnicom\u2019s closing price fell again to $54.62 (Hammel Decl. Ex. B4 at 1), and Plaintiffs filed this action. On that day, a <em>CBS MarketWatch </em>article stated, \u201c[t]he article seems to suggest that Omni-com was using ... Seneca[ ] to cushion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>itself from losses related to those investments and avoid write-downs that could bring down its overall numbers.\u201d (Hakala Report \u00b6 78.) Also on June 13, the Chicago Tribune reported that Omnicom\u2019s shares fell after news that Callander resigned \u201cquestioning whether certain disclosures were made to the board about the off-loading of certain investments and the buyback of two Internet firms.\u201d (Hassel Deck Ex. 134: Jim Kirk, \u201cOmnicom is counted out on its accounting,\u201d <em>Chicago Tribune, </em>June 13, 2002; Hakala Report \u00b6 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Several research analysts commented that the WSJ Article had not revealed any new information. Merrill Lynch commented that \u201c[t]here was no new information in the article and nothing in the article changes our opinion of the company .... In the current market environment, where investors are inclined to sell on the hint of any impropriety, we are not surprised on the volatility on the shares.\u201d (Hammel Decl. Ex. M4: Lauren R. Fine, \u201cGood News: No New News in WSJ Article.\u201d Merrill Lynch, June 12, 2002.) Bear Stearns noted, \u201c[w]hile there were no new issues raised, the negative tone of the article clearly destroyed a lot of confidence in the stock.\u201d (Hammel Deck Ex. J4: Alexia S. Quadrani, \u201cFollow-Up on WSJ Article,\u201d Bear Stearns, June 13, 2002.) UBS War-burg wrote that \u201c[ojverall we believe that the contents of the [WSJ Article] was not new information.\u201d (Hammel Deck Ex. E3: Catherine Kim, \u201cOmnicom, Still the Leader, Reiterating Buy,\u201d UBS Warburg, June 13, 2002.) Lehman Brothers also commented that \u201c[o]verall, yesterday\u2019s Wall Street Journal article did not bring up any substantial \u2018new1 issues.\u201d (Hassel Deck Ex. 436: Kevin Sullivan, \u201cOmnicom Group, Sifting through the Issues,\u201d Lehman Brothers, June 13, 2002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Smith Barney stated, \u201c[w]e believe the company is an unfortunate victim of an overzealous and highly biased reporter and the context of the accounting environment.\u201d (Hammel Deck Ex. K4: William G. Bird, \u201cOMC: Comments on Management Meeting,\u201d Salomon Smith Barney, June 13, 2002.) <em>The Deal.com </em>characterized the WSJ Article as a \u201chatchet job,\u201d noting \u201c[m]edia arrogance and investor ignorance collided as never before on Madison Avenue last week, causing the stock of Omnicom Group Inc. to crash 30%.\u201d (Hammel Deck Ex. 14: Richard Morgan, \u201cIndustry Insight: Hatchet Job,\u201d <em>The Deal.com, </em>June 14, 2002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">On June 14, PNC Advisors removed Omnicom from its \u201cAdvantage Portfolios\u201d and lowered its price target for Omnicom shares. (Hakala Report \u00b6 81.) A Morgan Stanley report that day noted that \u201c \u2018[reputation risk\u2019 is the latest concern.\u201d (Haka-la Report \u00b6 81.) On June 24, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s placed Omnicom\u2019s debt on a Negative Credit Watch because it was \u201cconcerned about the recently filed shareholder lawsuits and the SEC\u2019s request for information about two independent board members\u2019 departures.\u201d (Hakala Report \u00b6 83.) There were also reports of additional shareholder lawsuits. (Hakala Report \u00b6 83.) The share price further declined that day and the next. (Hakala Report \u00b6 83.) A June 16, 2002 <em>Financial Times </em>article reported that the market, \u201c[fjearful of another Enron or Tyco International ..., hit the panic button, wiping out 36 per cent of [Omnicom\u2019s] share price\u201d even though \u201cno evidence of impropriety has emerged.\u201d (Hammel Deck Ex. H4: Richard Tomkins, \u201cOmnicom in Market for Damage Limitation,\u201d <em>Financial Times, </em>June 16, 2002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">I. <em>Summary Judgment Standard</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Summary judgment is warranted \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The burden of demonstrating the absence of any genuine dispute as to a material fact rests with the moving party. <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 157, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970); <em>Grady v. Affiliated Cent., Inc., </em>130 F.3d 553, 559 (2d Cir.1997). In determining whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact, \u201c[t]he evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\u201d <em>Liberty Lobby, </em>477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505. An issue of fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d if it might \u201caffect the outcome of the suit under the governing law [while] an issue of fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Shade v. Horn. Awth. of New Haven, </em>251 F.3d 307, 314 (2d Cir.2001). Where it is apparent that no rational finder of fact \u201ccould find in favor of the non-moving party because the evidence to support its case is so slight,\u201d summary judgment should be granted. <em>Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd., </em>22 F.3d 1219, 1223 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">II. <em>10b-5 Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Loss causation is a necessary element in a 10b-5 claim. <em>Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 346-47, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005). The \u201clogical link between [an] inflated share purchase price\u201d resulting from an alleged misstatement \u201cand any later economic loss is not invariably strong\u201d because \u201cthat lower price may reflect, not the earlier misrepresentation, but changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions or other events.\u201d <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342-43, 125 S.Ct. 1627. The burden of establishing loss causation rests on the plaintiff. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4). Loss causation can be established either where (1) the market reacted negatively to a corrective disclosure or (2) the materialization of the risks that were concealed by the alleged misrepresentations or omissions proximately caused plaintiffs\u2019 loss. <em>Lentell v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc., </em>396 F.3d 161,175 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">A. <em>Corrective Disclosure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">This is not a case about materialization of an undisclosed risk. Thus, the absence of a corrective disclosure would be \u201cfatal under Second Circuit precedent.\u201d <em>Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 173-75. <em>Dura </em>does not require that a corrective disclosure \u201ctake a particular form or be of a particular quality .... It is the exposure of the falsity of the fraudulent representation that is the critical component of loss causation.\u201d <em>In re Winstar Comm\u2019ns, </em>No. 01 Civ. 3014(GBD), 2006 WL 473885, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 2006); <em>see also Lentell </em>396 F.3d at 177. While a disclosure need not reflect every detail of an alleged fraud, it must reveal some aspect of it. <em>See, e.g., In re ICG Commc\u2019ns, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 00 Civ. 01864, 2006 WL 416622, at *10 (D.Colo. Feb. 7, 2006) (allegations of corrective disclosure as to one of several claims sufficed to survive motion to dismiss all claims); <em>In re Retek Inc. Secs., </em>No. 02 Civ. 4209, 2005 WL 3059566, at *4 (D.Minn. Oct. 21, 2005) (internal citation omitted) (same). Moreover, the disclosed fact must be new to the market. <em>See Joffee v. Lehman Bros., Inc., </em>410 F.Supp.2d 187, 191 (S.D.N.Y.2006) (dismissing action where \u201ceach of the matters that Plaintiffs claim [Defendant] failed to disclose had, in fact, been disclosed to the market\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>A recharacterization of previously disclosed facts cannot qualify as a corrective disclosure. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys. of La. v. Hunter, </em>477 F.3d 162, 187 (4th Cir.2007) (rejecting a corrective disclosure that \u201cmerely attributes an improper purpose to ... previously disclosed facts\u201d); <em>In re Merck &amp; Co. Sec. Litig., </em>432 F.3d 261, 270-71 (3d Cir.2005) <em>(Wall Street Journal </em>\u2019s interpretation of previously disclosed facts is not a corrective disclosure). Indeed, if markets react negatively to a characterization, the \u201closs is caused by the subsequent characterization of the transaction,\u201d not by the transaction itself. <em>In re Cree, Inc. Secs. Litig., </em>No. 03 Civ. 0549, 2005 WL 1847004, at *12 (M.D.N.C. Aug. 2, 2005), <em>ajfd by Hunter, </em>477 F.3d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Plaintiffs assert that information disclosing Defendants\u2019 alleged fraud was released to the market on June 6, 7, 12, 13, 24 and 25, 2002. (Lead Plaintiffs Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment, dated Aug. 20, 2007 at 34.) Disclosures to the market during this time contain the following information: (1) commentary on Omnicom\u2019s accounting with respect to organic growth and earn-outs; (2) the conclusion that the Seneca Transaction allowed Omnicom to avoid taking a write-off for its troubled e-service investments; (3) the opinion of one accounting professor that Omnicom\u2019s failure to record any loss \u201craises a red flag,\u201d and another professor\u2019s skepticism about the value of the e-service investments given \u201cthe current environment;\u201d (4) that Omni-com intended to unwind Seneca by buying back Agency and Organic; and (5) that Callander resigned because he was concerned about the purpose of the Seneca Transaction and that it had not been adequately disclosed to Omnicom\u2019s board.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">First, the parties agree that no new facts were disclosed concerning Omni-com\u2019s reporting of organic growth and earn-outs. Second, the market knew well in advance of June 2002 that Omnicom\u2019s internet assets were ailing and that it transferred them to Seneca without recording a loss. Indeed, contemporaneous news articles reported that the Seneca Transaction was \u201ca way for Omnicom to get struggling stocks off of its books\u201d (Hammel Deck Ex. 04), \u201ca complicated effort by ad agency group Omnicom to lessen its losses in the interactive sector\u201d (Hammel Dec! Ex. P4), and a way of \u201cgetting all the Net assets off Omnicom\u2019s books by shoveling them into a private holding company called Seneca\u201d (Hammel Deck Ex. U3). Moreover, Omnicom\u2019s March 2002 10-K discloses that it recorded no loss on the Seneca Transaction. (Hammel Deck Ex. Al at F-13.) Third, that an accounting professor presented with the fact that Omnicom transferred its internet investments without recording a loss sees a \u201cred flag\u201d or \u201cwonder[s]\u201d about valuation is similarly not a disclosure of any new fact. Rather, it is an observation based on facts already in the market. <em>See In re Merck, </em>432 F.3d at 270 (noting that the efficient market hypothesis suggests that basic calculations are made upon disclosure of underlying facts); <em>In re Wins-tar, </em>2006 WL 473885, at *15 (relevant question is whether a \u201creasonable investor could have drawn those same conclusions based on the total mix of the available information\u201d). Accordingly, the only new facts reported to the market in June 2002 were that Omnicom intended to unwind Seneca by buying back Agency and Organic and Callander\u2019s resignation. The Court addresses each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">First, where a disclosure does not reveal the falsity of the alleged misstatements, it does not qualify as \u201ccorrective.\u201d A decision to reverse course, particularly in a dynamic business environment, does not imply that the earlier business strategy was a subterfuge. <em>See, e.g., Lentell, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>396 F.3d at 177 (downgrading recommendation from \u201cbuy\u201d to \u201cneutral\u201d does not reveal falsity of \u201cbuy\u201d rating and therefore is not \u201ccorrective\u201d). Accordingly, the mere fact that Omnicom later decided to buy back Agency and Organic does not suggest that the original transaction spinning them off was a sham. Therefore, the disclosure of this information \u2014 the announcement of the reacquisition of Agency and Organic \u2014 is not \u201ccorrective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Second, a director\u2019s resignation cannot constitute a corrective disclosure when the resignation is not connected to the alleged fraud. <em>See In re Buca Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 05 Civ. 1762(DWF) (AJB), 2006 WL 3030886, at *9 (D.Minn. Oct. 16, 2006) (press release disclosing director\u2019s resignation \u201cmentioned no investigation or accounting issues and thus disclosed nothing of the alleged fraud\u201d). It follows that a disclosure attributing a director\u2019s resignation to reasons other than the fraud alleged by plaintiffs similarly does not disclose the alleged fraud. Here, coverage of Callander\u2019s resignation attributed his departure to two things: his concern that the board did not approve the Seneca Transaction and questions about the purpose of the Seneca Transaction. As to the first, there is no allegation that the board did not approve the Seneca Transaction. Second, mere attribution of an improper purpose to a previously disclosed transaction cannot constitute a corrective disclosure. <em>Hunter, </em>477 F.3d at 187 (securities fraud action filed by company\u2019s founder not a corrective disclosure where it \u201cdisclose[d] nothing new, but merely attribute[d] an improper purpose to the previously disclosed facts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Accordingly, this Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs have presented facts sufficient to support finding a corrective disclosure. This conclusion is consistent with the analyst coverage by Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, UBS Warburg and Lehman Brothers, all of which noted that the WSJ Article had disclosed nothing new. (Ham-mel Deck Exs. M4, J4, E3; Hassel Decl. Ex. 436.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">B. <em>Market Reaction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Even assuming Plaintiffs could establish that news about Callander\u2019s resignation or Omnicom\u2019s plans to repurchase Agency and Organic were corrective disclosures, Plaintiffs nevertheless cannot demonstrate that the market reacted negatively to the disclosures, rather than to other information simultaneously released to the market. To prove loss causation, plaintiffs must distinguish the alleged fraud from the \u201ctangle of [other] factors\u201d that affect a stock\u2019s price. <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 343, 125 S.Ct. 1627. While plaintiffs need not quantify the fraud-related loss, they must \u201cascribe some rough proportion of the whole loss to [the alleged] misstatements.\u201d <em>Lattanzio v. Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, </em>476 F.3d 147, 158 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cPlaintiffs have not alleged facts to show that [defendant]^ misstatements, among others ... that were much more consequential and numerous, were the proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 loss_\u201d); <em>Gordon Partners v. Blumenthal, </em>No. 02 Civ. 7377(LAK), 2007 WL 1438753, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 16, 2002) (granting summary judgment where plaintiffs presented no evidence to \u201cshow whether any loss (and if so how much) was caused by defendants\u2019 conduct as opposed to other market factors\u201d); <em>see also Lentell, </em>396 F.3d at 177 (where both disclosed and concealed risks materialized to cause a loss, \u201cplaintiffs must allege (i) facts sufficient to support an interference that it was defendants fraud \u2014 rather than other salient factors\u2014 that proximately caused plaintiffs\u2019 loss; or (ii) facts sufficient to apportion the losses between the disclosed and concealed portions of the risk\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>It is clear that a characterization of previously disclosed facts can cause a'loss, just not one attributable to the alleged fraud. <em>In re Merck, </em>432 F.3d at 270; <em>Hunter, </em>477 F.3d at 187. Accordingly, negative characterizations are among the \u201ctangle of factors\u201d that plaintiffs must distinguish to prove that any loss was caused by the alleged fraud. <em>Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 343, 125 S.Ct. 1627. Here, in addition to any shreds of new information, the WSJ Article and ensuing coverage included highly negative commentary about facts already known to the market. Indeed, the <em>Financial Times, the Deal.com, </em>and Salo-mon Smith Barney blamed Omnicom\u2019s stock price decline on the general tone of the WSJ article and post-Enron investor skittishness, and not on the slivers of new Seneca-related information released in 2002 (Hammel Decl. Ex. H4, 14 &amp; K4); and other analysts commented on the article\u2019s impact while noting that it revealed nothing new (Hammel Decl. Exs. M4, J4 &amp; E3; Hassel Decl. Ex. 436).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 economist Scott D. Hakala (\u201cHakala\u201d) undertook an event study to isolate the effect of Plaintiffs\u2019 identified disclosures on Omnicom\u2019s stock price from that of other market forces. Assuming for the purposes of this motion that the event study is adequate in that regard, it nevertheless fails to demonstrate loss causation. First, as discussed above, the event study at best incorrectly identifies several corrective disclosures, and at worst fails to identify any at all. Second, to the extent that any corrective disclosures exist, the event study does not isolate their effect on Omnicom\u2019s stock price from that of the negative reporting, which dwarfed any shreds of new information disclosed in June 2002. Hakala writes, \u201c[wjhile the article also reasserted concerns regarding Omnicom\u2019s organic growth, cash flow, put obligations and earn-outs, those issues had previously been identified and fully <em>[sic </em>] in analyst and news reports ... well before [the WSJ Article].\u201d (Hakala Report \u00b6 76.) Thus, Hakala fails to acknowledge any potential effect from WSJ Article\u2019s highly negative tone. Nor does Hakala analyze the effect of post-Enron \u201cchanged investor expectations\u201d on Omnicom\u2019s stock price. <em>See Dura, </em>544 U.S. at 342-43, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (including \u201cchanged investor expectations\u201d among the \u201ctangle of factors\u201d that might cause a loss). Because the law requires the disaggregation of confounding factors, disaggregating only <em>some </em>of them cannot suffice to establish that the alleged misrepresentations actually caused Plaintiffs\u2019 loss. <em>See Lattanzio, 476 F.3d </em>at 158 (dismissing action where plaintiffs failed to allege that defendant\u2019s misstatements, rather than others that were \u201cmore consequential and numerous,\u201d were the proximate cause of their loss). Thus, there is simply no way for a juror to determine whether the alleged fraud caused any portion of Plaintiffs\u2019 loss. Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs\u2019 10b-5 claims is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">III. <em>Section 20(a) Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act provides for control person liability \u201cto the same extent as\u201d the controlled entity that committed the violation. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). As stated above, Plaintiffs have failed to establish any underlying primary violation of federal securities law. Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is granted on Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 20 claims as well. <em>See Dresner v. Utility.com, Inc., </em>371 F.Supp.2d 476, 501 (S.D.N.Y.2005) (dismissing \u00a7 20(a) claim where plaintiffs failed to establish any underlying liability); <em>In re Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
