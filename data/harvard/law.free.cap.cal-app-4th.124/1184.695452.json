J.</author>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Appellant Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control (BCLC) has challenged development of two retail shopping centers in the southwestern portion of the City of Bakersfield (City), alleging violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The shopping centers are located 3.6 miles apart.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When complete, they will have a combined total of 1.1 million square feet of retail space. Each shopping center will contain a Wal-Mart Supercenter (Supercenter) plus a mix of large anchor stores, smaller retailers, and a gas station. An environmental impact report (EIR) was prepared and certified for each project.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">In these consolidated appeals we are called upon to assess the sufficiency of the EIR\u2019s. In the published portion of this opinion, we first determine that BCLC has standing, that it exhausted its administrative remedies and that the appeals are not moot. We then explain that the EIR\u2019s do not fulfill their informational obligations because they failed to consider the projects\u2019 individual and cumulative potential to indirectly cause urban/suburban decay by precipitating a downward spiral of store closures and long-term vacancies in existing shopping centers. Furthermore, the cumulative impacts analyses are defective because they did not treat the other shopping center as a relevant project or consider the combined environmental impacts of the two shopping centers. Finally, we explain that failure to correlate the acknowledged adverse air quality impacts to resulting adverse effects on human respiratory health was erroneous. These defects are prejudicial and compel decertification of the EIR\u2019s and rescission of project approvals and associated land use entitlements. In the unpublished portion of this decision, we resolve the rest of the CEQA challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">FACTUAL OVERVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Real party in interest Panama 99 Properties LLC (P99) is developing a 370,000-square-foot retail shopping center named Panama 99 (Panama) on 35 acres of vacant land located at the northeast comer of Panama Lane and Highway 99. The project site was zoned for mobilehome use and its general plan designation was low-density residential/open space.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Real party in interest and appellant Castle and Cooke Commercial-CA, Inc. (C &amp; C), is developing a 700,000-square-foot regional retail shopping center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>named Gosford Village (Gosford) on 73 acres of vacant land located on the southwest comer of Pacheco Road and Gosford Road. The project site\u2019s zoning and general plan land use designation was service industrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Panama is located 3.6 miles east of Gosford. The two shopping centers share some arterial roadway links.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Each shopping center will feature a 220,000-square-foot Supercenter as its primary anchor tenant. Supercenters \u201ccombin[e] the traditional Wal-Mart discount store with a full-size grocery store.\u201d Supercenters compete with large discount stores, traditional department stores, supermarkets and other grocery stores, as well as drug stores and apparel stores. The Supercenter at Panama will replace an existing Wal-Mart store that currently is located 1.4 miles north of the Panama site. In addition to the Supercenter, Panama will contain a Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement Warehouse (Lowe\u2019s), a gas station and a satellite pad. Gosford will contain a total of 17 retail stores, plus fast food restaurants and a gas station. In addition to the Supercenter, there will be six other anchor tenants, including Kohl\u2019s Department Stores (Kohl\u2019s) (apparel and home-related items) and Sam\u2019s Club (warehouse club selling groceries and a wide array of consumer products).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">P99 and C &amp; C (collectively, developers) applied in early 2002 for project approvals and associated zoning changes and general plan amendments. A separate EIR was prepared for each shopping center (hereafter the Panama EIR and the Gosford EIR). The Panama EIR concluded that Panama would have significant and unavoidable direct adverse impacts on air quality and noise. The Gosford EIR concluded that Gosford would have a significant and unavoidable adverse impact on air quality, both individually and cumulatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">The Panama EIR identified the Supercenter and Lowe\u2019s as the two anchor tenants. The Gosford EIR did not identify any tenants. In response to comments questioning the environmental effects resulting from locating two Supercenters in a 3.6-mile radius, the Gosford EIR states that no tenants have been identified. However, it is clear from the administrative record that prior to certification of the Gosford EIR, the public and the City knew that one of Gosford\u2019s tenants was going to be a Supercenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">The planning commission and the City Council considered the two projects at the same meetings. On February 12, 2003, the City Council certified the EIR\u2019s and adopted statements of overriding considerations on the nonpublic consent calendar. Then, after public hearing, it approved both projects and granted associated zoning changes and general plan amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>In March 2003, BCLC filed two CEQA actions challenging the sufficiency of the EIR\u2019s and contesting the project approvals and related land use entitlements (the Panama action and the Gosford action).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Soon thereafter, construction-related activities commenced on the project sites. In July 2003, the trial court denied BCLC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order enjoining construction-related activities at the Gosford site.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Trial was held on the Panama action in November 2003 and on the Gosford action in January 2004. In both actions, the court concluded that CEQA required study of the question whether the two shopping centers, individually or cumulatively, could indirectly trigger a series of events that ultimately result in urban decay or deterioration.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">BCLC unsuccessfully sought a temporary restraining order enjoining construction-related activities at the Panama site after the court orally announced its decision in the Panama action.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Argument was held concerning the proper remedy. The trial court concluded that the failure to study urban decay rendered the EIR\u2019s inadequate as informational documents and it ordered them decertified. It left the project approvals and associated land use entitlements intact and it severed the Supercenters from the remainder of the projects. It enjoined further construction of the partially built Supercenter buildings but allowed all other construction activities to continue pending full CEQA compliance. In its written judgments, the court found the EIR\u2019s deficient because they did not consider the direct and cumulative potential of \u201cthe Panama 99 project and the related Gosford Park project\u201d to indirectly cause urban decay. However, the additional environmental review it ordered focused exclusively on the Super-centers, ordering study of the following two points: (1) cumulative impacts \u201con general merchandise businesses\u201d arising from operating both Super-centers; (2) urban decay that could result from closure of the existing Wal-Mart on White Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">BCLC partially appealed both judgments; C &amp; C partially cross-appealed the judgment in the Gosford action. The appeals were consolidated on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">Previously, we have denied petitions for writ of supersedeas that BCLC filed in March and June of 2004. Therein, BCLC sought an injunction prohibiting construction-related activities on the project sites pending resolution of the appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>During the pendency of these actions, the Lowe\u2019s store was constructed and it is operating at Panama. The Kohl\u2019s store was constructed and it is operating at Gosford. Sam\u2019s Business Trust acquired a 12-acre parcel at Gosford and we were notified in June 2004 that this entity would seek issuance of a building permit to construct the Sam\u2019s Club. A group known as Gosford at Pacheco LLC has purchased 25 acres of the Gosford site. Both Supercenters are partially constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">At the outset, it is necessary to explicitly reject certain philosophical and sociological beliefs that some of the parties have vigorously expressed. For the record, we do not endorse BCLC\u2019s elitist premise that so-called big box retailers are undesirable in a community and are inherently inferior to smaller merchants, nor do we affirm its view that Wal-Mart, Inc. (Wal-Mart) is a destructive force that threatens the viability of local communities. Wal-Mart is not a named party in these actions and we rebuff BCLC\u2019s transparent attempt to demonize this corporation. We do not know whether Wal-Mart\u2019s entry into a geographic region or expansion of operations within a region is desirable for local communities. Similarly, we do not know whether Wal-Mart is a \u201cgood\u201d or a \u201cbad\u201d employer. We offer no comment on Wal-Mart\u2019s alleged miserly compensation and benefit package because BCLC did not link the asserted low wages and absence of affordable health insurance coverage to direct or indirect adverse environmental consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Likewise, we will not dignify with extended comment C &amp; C\u2019s complaint that BCLC is just a \u201cfront\u201d for a grocery worker\u2019s union whose disgruntled members feel threatened by nonunionized Wal-Mart\u2019s entry into the grocery business. As will be explained, BCLC has standing to pursue this litigation and it exhausted its administrative remedies. This is sufficient. We do not know whether Wal-Mart adversely affects the strength of organized labor and we have not considered this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">In sum, we have no underlying ideological agenda and have strictly adhered to the accepted principle that the judicial system has a narrow role in land use battles that are fought through CEQA actions. \u201cThe only role for this court in reviewing an EIR is to ensure that the public and responsible officials are adequately informed \u2018 \u201cof the environmental consequences of their decisions <em>before </em>they are made.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Berkeley Keep Jets Over The Bay Com. </em>v. <em>Board of Port Cmrs. </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1356 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 598] <em>(Berkeley).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">CEQA is codified at Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. CEQA is augmented by the state CEQA Guidelines, codified at title 14 of the California Code of Regulations section 15000 et seq.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Guidelines must be interpreted \u201cin such a way as to \u2018afford the fullest possible protection of the environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma County Water Agency </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859, 868 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 322] <em>(Eel River).) </em>No party has challenged the legality of any of the applicable Guidelines and none of them appear to be \u201c \u2018clearly unauthorized or erroneous under CEQA.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123, fn. 4 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 231, 864 P.2d 502] <em>(Laurel Heights II).) </em>Therefore, we will afford them \u201c \u2018great weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">The applicable standard of review is well established. If the substantive and procedural requirements of CEQA are satisfied, a project may be approved even if it would create significant and unmitigable impacts on the environment. <em>(Fairview Neighbors v. County of Ventura </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 238, 242 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 436].)  \u201cIn reviewing an agency\u2019s determination under CEQA, a court must determine whether the agency prejudicially abused its discretion. (\u00a7 21168.5.) Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(Dry Creek Citizens Coalition v. County of Tulare </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 20, 25-26 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 398] <em>(Dry Creek).) </em>Courts are \u201cnot to determine whether the EDR\u2019s ultimate conclusions are correct but only whether they are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the EIR is sufficient as an information document.\u201d <em>(Association of Irritated Residents </em>v. <em>County of Madera </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1391 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 718] <em>(Irritated Residents).) </em>\u201c \u2018The appellate court reviews the administrative record independently; the trial court\u2019s conclusions are not binding on it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1390.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">\u201c \u2018The EIR must contain facts and analysis, not just the bare conclusions of the agency.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018An EIR must include detail sufficient to enable those who did not participate in its preparation to understand and to consider meaningfully the issues raised by the proposed project.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Irritated Residents, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at p. 1390.) \u201cCEQA requires an EIR to reflect a good faith effort at full disclosure; it does not mandate perfection, nor does it require an analysis to be exhaustive.\u201d <em>(Dry Creek, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 26.) Therefore, \u201c[n]oncompliance with CEQA\u2019s information disclosure requirements is not per se reversible; prejudice must be shown.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number><em>(Irritated Residents, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at p. 1391; \u00a7 21005, subd. (b).) Failure to comply with the information disclosure requirements constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion when the omission of relevant information has precluded informed decisionmaking and informed public participation, regardless whether a different outcome would have resulted if the public agency had complied with the disclosure requirements. <em>(Dry Creek, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 26; <em>Irritated Residents, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at p. 1391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The substantial evidence standard is applied to conclusions, findings and determinations. It also applies to challenges to the scope of an EIR\u2019s analysis of a topic, the methodology used for studying an impact and the reliability or accuracy of the data upon which the EIR relied because these types of challenges involve factual questions. <em>(Federation of Hillside &amp; Canyon Associations </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1259 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 301] <em>(Hillside).) </em>\u201cSubstantial evidence is defined as \u2018enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Irritated Residents, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at p. 1391; Guidelines, \u00a7 15384, subd. (a).) Substantial evidence is not \u201c[argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative, evidence which is clearly inaccurate or erroneous, or evidence of social or economic impacts which do not contribute to, or are not caused by, physical impacts on the environment, is not substantial evidence. Substantial evidence shall include facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts, and expert opinion supported by facts.\u201d (\u00a7 21082.2, subd. (c); Guidelines, \u00a7 15384.)</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">II. <em>Procedural Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"AtR\">\n<em>A. Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">C &amp; C asserts that BCLC lacks standing because it is an economic competitor and not a bona fide environmental group. We reject this accusation as unproved speculation. The record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that BCLC has standing to pursue this litigation. \u201cCEQA litigants often may be characterized as having competing economic interests.\u201d <em>(Burrtec Waste Industries, Inc. v. City of Colton </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1133, 1138 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 410].) One of BCLC\u2019s members is a homeowner residing near Gosford and he spoke in opposition to the projects at a public hearing prior to their approval. This is sufficient to satisfy CEQA\u2019s liberal standing requirement. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1138-1139; <em>Bozung </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 272 [118 Cal.Rptr. 249, 529 P.2d 1017] <em>(Bozung).) </em>In any event, unions have standing to litigate environmental claims. (See, e.g., <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 265 [171 Cal.Rptr. 875].) Since C &amp; C <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>did not support with legal argument or authority its perfunctory assertion that the trial court erred by quashing a deposition meant to elicit facts about BCLC\u2019s standing, we deem this point to be without foundation and reject it on this basis. <em>(In re Steiner </em>(1955) 134 Cal.App.2d 391, 399 [285 P.2d 972].)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">B. <em>Exhaustion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">Next, we reject C &amp; C\u2019s complaint about the timing of BCLC\u2019s objections to the shopping centers. C &amp; C decries BCLC\u2019s failure to submit written comments on the draft EIR\u2019s and points out that BCLC\u2019s attorney presented his client\u2019s oral and documentary objections to the projects at the public hearing concerning project approvals that was held by the City Council on February 12, 2003. C &amp; C does not specifically contend with proper legal argument and citation to applicable authority that BCLC failed to exhaust its administrative remedies but this appears to be the implication of its argument. Although we could dismiss as undeveloped whatever legal point C &amp; C might have intended, we have elected to substantively resolve the exhaustion question because the issue is likely to reoccur.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to maintenance of a CEQA action. Only a proper party may petition for a writ of mandate to challenge the sufficiency of an EIR or the validity of an act or omission under CEQA. The petitioner is required to have \u201cobjected to the approval of the project orally or in writing during the public comment period provided by this division or prior to the close of the public hearing on the project before the issuance of the notice of determination.\u201d (\u00a7 21177, subd. (b).) The petitioner may allege as a ground of noncompliance any objection that was presented by any person or entity during the administrative proceedings. <em>(Resource Defense Fund v. Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 886, 894 [236 Cal.Rptr. 794].) Failure to participate in the public comment period for a draft EIR does not cause the petitioner to waive any claims relating to the sufficiency of the environmental documentation. <em>(Galante Vineyards v. Monterey Peninsula Water Management Dist. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1120-1121 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] <em>(Galante).) </em>However, the lead agency is not required to incorporate in the final EIR specific written responses to comments received after close of the public review period. <em>(City of Poway v. City of San Diego </em>(1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 1037, 1043-1044 [202 Cal.Rptr. 366].)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">When discussing exhaustion some opinions have identified certification of the EIR rather than approval of the project as the crucial cutoff point. (See, e.g., <em>Galante, supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at p. 1121.) However, section 21177 specifically refers to close of the public hearing on project approval prior to issuance of the notice of determination, not certification of the EIR. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>(\u00a7 21177, subds. (a) &amp; (b).) The correct formulation is expressed in <em>Hillside, </em>supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at page 1263: \u201c[A] party can litigate issues that were timely raised by others, but only if that party objected to the project approval on any ground during the public comment period or prior to the close of the public hearing on the project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">We believe that the apparent inaccuracy in some case law results from the fact that environmental review is not supposed to be segregated from project approval. \u201c[Pjublic participation is an \u2018essential part of the CEQA process.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Laurel Heights II, supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 1123.) Although public hearings are encouraged, they are not explicitly required by CEQA at any stage of the environmental review process. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15087, subd. (i).) \u201cPublic comments may be restricted to written communications.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15202, subd. (a).) Yet, \u201c[pjublic hearings on draft EIRs are sometimes required by agency statute, regulation, rule, ordinance, or the agency\u2019s written procedures for implementation of CEQA.\u201d (1 Kostka &amp; Zischke, Practice Under the Cal. Environmental Quality Act (Cont.Ed.Bar 2004) \u00a7 9.26, p. 408 (CEQA Practice).) \u201cIf an agency provides a public hearing on its decision to carry out or approve a project, the agency should include environmental review as one of the subjects for the hearing.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15202, subd. (b).) Since project approval and certification of the EIR generally occur during the same hearing, the two events are sometimes treated as interchangeable. (See, e.g., <em>Hillside, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 1257 [final EIR certified at same hearing during which project was approved]; <em>Irritated Residents, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at p. 1389 [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">C &amp; C disparagingly refers to BCLC\u2019s oral presentation and its submission of evidence at the February 12, 2003 City Council hearing as a last minute \u201cdocument dump\u201d and an intentional delaying tactic, pointing out that EIR\u2019s had been certified prior to opening of the public hearing. We reject this complaint because C &amp; C omitted the key fact that the City had improperly segregated environmental review from project approval in contravention of Guidelines section 15202, subdivision (b). The planning commission bifurcated the process by agendizing certification of the EIR\u2019s as nonpublic hearing items and separately agendizing project approval and related land use entitlements as public hearing items. Similarly, the City Council agendized certification of the EIR\u2019s on the closed consent calendar and agendized the \u201cconcurrent general plan amendment/zone change[s]\u201d necessary to implement the projects on the public hearing calendar. Since certification of the EIR\u2019s had been placed on the nonpublic consent calendar that was handled prior to the opening of the public hearing, counsel for BCLC necessarily voiced all of BCLC\u2019s objections, including defects in CEQA compliance, during the hearing on project approvals. He specifically objected to the bifurcated process and asked for certification of the EIR\u2019s to be removed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>consent calendar and heard concurrently with the hearing on the project approvals and land use entitlements. The City Attorney recommended against this, incorrectly stating that this \u201cwould open up the entire EIR process, open up the new comment period, and delay the entire project because it would not be able to certify the EIR tonight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">City appears to have thought that the public\u2019s role in the environmental review process ends when the public comment period expires. Apparently, it did not realize that if a public hearing is conducted on project approval, then new environmental objections could be made until close of this hearing. (\u00a7 21177, subd. (b); Guidelines, \u00a7 15202, subd. (b); <em>Hillside, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 1263.) If the decisionmaking body elects to certify the EIR without considering comments made at this public hearing, it does so at its own risk. If a CEQA action is subsequently brought, the EIR may be found to be deficient on grounds that were raised at any point prior to close of the hearing on project approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">C &amp; C seems to assume that it was somehow entitled to final project approval in February 2003. On the contrary, the City Council was not obligated to certify the EIR\u2019s that evening. \u201c[E]xpediency should play no part in an agency\u2019s efforts to comply with CEQA.\u201d <em>(San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 61, 74 [198 Cal.Rptr. 634] <em>(Reasonable Growth).) </em>As was cogently noted by the trial court, \u201cthe public agency decides when they are going to certify the EIR . . . . [f] . . . [][] . . . They didn\u2019t have to do it that night.\u201d C &amp; C\u2019s complaint that allowing project opponents to raise objections after close of the public comment period for the draft EIR allows them to \u201csandbag\u201d project proponents and delay certification \u201cad infinitum\u201d should be presented to the Legislature, for it is a complaint about the design of the CEQA process.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">We reject C &amp; C\u2019s related contention that BCLC failed to participate in the public review process prior to certification of the EIR\u2019s because it is factually incorrect. BCLC actively participated in the administrative review process prior to certification of the EIR\u2019s. The City Planning Commission accepted public comment concerning the adequacy of the draft EIR\u2019s at a hearing on October 3, 2002. Sheila Stubblefield, who is described in the minutes of this meeting as BCLC\u2019s president and founder, spoke in opposition to both projects at that meeting. After the City Planning Commission voted in December 2002 to recommend certification of the EIR\u2019s and approval of the projects, BCLC notified the City in writing that it was appealing the planning commission\u2019s decision. The issues specifically raised by BCLC in this letter include urban decay and cumulative impacts. If an EIR is certified by an unelected planning commission, then the lead agency must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>allow the public an opportunity to appeal the certification to an elected body. (\u00a721151, subd. (c); Guidelines, \u00a7 15090, subd. (b); <em>Vedanta Society of So. California v. California Quartet, Ltd. </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 517, 525-526 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 889].) BCLC sent a second letter to City before the February 2003 City Council meeting. It outlined several inadequacies in the EIR\u2019s and raised other objections to approvals of the project. Then, BCLC\u2019s legal counsel appeared at the City Council meeting and proffered oral and documentary support for BCLC\u2019s previously expressed position that the EIR\u2019s were legally inadequate. Since the certification of the EIR\u2019s had been placed on the nonpublic consent calendar, he necessarily spoke during the hearing on project approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Finally, we dismiss C &amp; C\u2019s assertion that BCLC only challenged the Supercenter aspect of the shopping centers. The evidence contradicts this position and demonstrates that BCLC\u2019s objections concerning urban decay and cumulative impacts related to the shopping centers as a whole. For example, BCLC\u2019s December 2002 letter appealing the decision of the planning commission specifically referenced the addition of over one million square feet of retail space. Nowhere within this letter did BCLC mention Wal-Mart or the Supercenters. BCLC\u2019s February 2003 letter also references urban decay as a consequence of the shopping centers and it cites relevant authorities. The trial court\u2019s oral decisions and written judgments found the EIR\u2019s deficient because they failed to consider whether the shopping centers could indirectly cause urban decay. It was only the remedy that inexplicably was limited to the Supercenters.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">In essence, C &amp; C has imputed bad faith on BCLC\u2019s part without offering any evidence to justify the accusation. BCLC actively and properly participated in the administrative review process. It did not contravene CEQA by challenging the adequacy of the EIR\u2019s at the February 2003 City Council meeting and submitting evidence supporting their position. There is no indication in the record that if the City had seriously considered the objections asserted by BCLC and others and if it had revised the EIR\u2019s in response to these objections, BCLC subsequently would have asserted new inadequacies solely to delay the projects. It is the City\u2019s bifurcated process, which resulted in segregation of environmental review from project approval, that supports an imputation of bad faith, an inference BCLC civilly does not press.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">C. <em>Mootness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Developers achieved an important practical victory when they convinced the trial court to leave the project approvals in place, sever the Supercenters from the remainder of the projects and allow construction of the rest of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>shopping centers to proceed prior to full CEQA compliance. As a result, retail businesses currently are operating at both project sites and nonparties have acquired portions of the project sites. This has generated substantial economic and psychological pressures in favor of the shopping centers as presently approved and partially constructed. BCLC cannot provide any precedent for closure of an operating retail establishment because the retailer\u2019s landlord failed to adequately comply with CEQA and it has not asked us to order these businesses to cease operations pending full CEQA compliance. Given this state of affairs, questions necessarily arise concerning redressability and consequent mootness. Has the danger of irreversible momentum in favor of the shopping centers, about which we warned in <em>San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713 at page 742 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 704] <em>(Raptor), </em>been realized?</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Undoubtedly some would view further environmental study of the partially completed projects as a futile waste of time and money. Since CEQA\u2019s purpose is not to generate meaningless paperwork <em>(Bozung, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 283), we were tempted to find the alleged defects in CEQA compliance essentially nonredressable and therefore moot. Yet, after reviewing briefing on this question, we decided not to adopt this rather cynical position. For the following reasons, we have concluded that the CEQA issues remain viable and therefore, we decline to dismiss the appeals as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">First, developers expressly recognized that they were proceeding at their own risk when they relied on the contested project approvals during the pendency of this litigation. When an injunction is not granted after commencement of a CEQA action, the agency is to assume that the contested EIR or negative declaration satisfies CEQA\u2019s requirements. However, \u201c[a]n approval granted by a responsible agency in this situation provides only permission to proceed with the project at the applicant\u2019s risk prior to a final decision in the lawsuit.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15233, subd. (b).) Although BCLC\u2019s failure to diligently and expeditiously seek injunctive relief necessitated our denial of its belated pleas for issuance of extraordinary relief pending issuance of this opinion, it did not provide developers with a \u201cpass\u201d on full CEQA compliance or grant them any vested interest in improvements that were completed at their own risk. The sale or lease of land to third parties was beyond BCLC\u2019s control. Such third party transactions do not immunize defective land use approvals. As a matter of public policy and basic equity, developers should not be permitted to effectively defeat a CEQA suit merely by building out a portion of a disputed project during litigation or transferring interests in the underlying real property. Failure to obtain an injunction should not operate as a de facto waiver of the right to pursue a CEQA action.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Second, questions concerning urban decay and cumulative impacts constitute important issues of broad public interest that are likely to reoccur. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number><em>(Lundquist v. Reusser </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1193, 1202, fn. 8 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 875 P.2d 1279]; <em>Cucamongans United for Reasonable Expansion </em>v. <em>City of Rancho Cucamonga </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 473, 479 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 202].)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Finally, even at this late juncture full CEQA compliance would not be a meaningless exercise of form over substance. The City possesses discretion to reject either or both of the shopping centers after further environmental study and weighing of the projects\u2019 benefits versus their environmental, economic and social costs. As conditions of reapproval, the City may compel additional mitigation measures or require the projects to be modified, reconfigured or reduced. The City can require completed portions of the projects to be modified or removed and it can compel restoration of the project sites to their original condition. <em>(Association for a Cleaner Environment v. Yosemite Community College Dist. </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 629, 641 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 560]; <em>Woodward Park Homeowners Assn. v. Garreks, Inc. </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 880, 888-890 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 268].) We presume that the City will fully and sincerely assess the new information contained in the revised EIR\u2019s and that it will fairly and independently decide whether reapproval of the projects is in the best interests of the City\u2019s residents, giving no weight to the fact that the shopping centers are partially constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">m. <em>Urban Decay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Water contamination and air pollution, now recognized as very real environmental problems, initially were scoffed at as the alarmist ravings of environmental doomsayers. Similarly, experts are now warning about land use decisions that cause a chain reaction of store closures and long-term vacancies, ultimately destroying existing neighborhoods and leaving decaying shells in their wake. In this case, the trial court recognized that the shopping centers posed a risk of triggering urban decay or deterioration<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it concluded that CEQA required analysis of this potential impact. C &amp; C has challenged this determination. We find C &amp; C\u2019s arguments unpersuasive and agree that CEQA requires analysis of the shopping centers\u2019 individual and cumulative potential to indirectly cause urban decay.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Guidelines section 15126.2 requires an EIR to identify and focus on the significant environmental impacts of the proposed project. In relevant part, this section provides: \u201cDirect and indirect significant effects of the project on the environment shall be clearly identified and described, giving due consideration to both the short-term and long-term effects.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15126.2, subd. (a).)  Guidelines section 15064, subdivision (d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>mandates that both primary (direct) and \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d secondary (indirect) consequences be considered in determining the significance of a project\u2019s environmental effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">\u201cCEQA is not a fair competition statutory scheme.\u201d <em>(Waste Management of Alameda County, Inc. v. County of Alameda </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1235 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 740].) Therefore, the economic and social effects of proposed projects are outside CEQA\u2019s purview. (Guidelines, \u00a7 15131, subd. (a).) Yet, if the forecasted economic or social effects of a proposed project directly or indirectly will lead to adverse physical changes in the environment, then CEQA requires disclosure and analysis of these resulting physical impacts. <em>(Friends of Davis v. City of Davis </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1019 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 413] <em>(Friends of Davis); Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mt. Shasta </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 433, <em>445-446 </em>[243 Cal.Rptr. 727] <em>(Mt. Shasta).) </em>Subdivision (e) of Guidelines section 15064 provides that when the economic or social effects of a project cause a physical change, this change is to be regarded as a significant effect in the same manner as any other physical change resulting from the project. (See, e.g., <em>El Dorado Union High School Dist. v. City of Placerville </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 123, 131 [192 Cal.Rptr. 480] [potential of increased student enrollment in an already overcrowded school resulting from construction of the proposed apartment complex was an environmental effect that required treatment in an EIR because it could lead to the necessity of constructing at least one new high school].) Conversely, where economic and social effects result from a physical change that was itself caused by a proposed project, then these economic and social effects may be used to determine that the physical change constitutes a significant effect on the environment. (See, e.g., <em>Christward Ministry v. Superior Court </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 180, 197 [228 Cal.Rptr. 868] [when a waste management facility was proposed next to a religious retreat center, CEQA required study whether the physical impacts associated with the new facility would disturb worship in the natural environment of the retreat center].) Guidelines section 15131, subdivision (a) provides, \u201cAn EIR may trace a chain of cause and effect from a proposed decision on a project through anticipated economic or social changes resulting from the project to physical changes in turn caused by the economic or social changes. The intermediate economic or social changes need not be analyzed in any detail greater than necessary to trace the chain of cause and effect. The focus of the analysis shall be on the physical changes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Case law already has established that in appropriate circumstances CEQA requires urban decay or deterioration to be considered as an indirect environmental effect of a proposed project. The relevant line of authority begins with <em>Citizens Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151 [217 Cal.Rptr. 893] <em>(Bishop). </em>There, the appellate court held that adoption of multiple negative declarations for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>different aspects of the same large regional shopping center violated CEQA. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 167.) The court also agreed with appellant that on remand \u201cthe lead agency must consider whether the proposed shopping center will take business away from the downtown shopping area and thereby cause business closures and eventual physical deterioration of downtown Bishop.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 169.) Citing Guidelines section 15064, the court found that the lead agency had an affirmative duty to consider whether the new shopping center would start an economic chain reaction that would lead to physical deterioration of the downtown area. (172 Cal.App.3d at p. 170.) Therefore, \u201c[o]n remand the lead agency should consider physical deterioration of the downtown area to the extent that potential is demonstrated to be an indirect environmental effect of the proposed shopping center.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Next, <em>Mt. Shasta, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d 433, invalidated an EIR for a proposed shopping center for numerous reasons. In relevant part, the court determined that the EIR was defective because it failed to \u201cconsider the potential physical effect of the rezoning on the central business area. The EIR pointed out the proposed project may pose a significant economic problem for existing businesses, but offered little analysis of the issue . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 445.) The court rejected respondent\u2019s justification that \u201cno analysis of economic effects was required in the EIR.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 446.) Citing <em>Bishop, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d 151 and Guidelines section 15064, it explained that \u201c[t]he potential economic problems caused by the proposed project could conceivably result in business closures and physical deterioration of the downtown area. Therefore, on remand, City should consider these problems to the extent that potential is demonstrated to be an indirect environmental effect of the proposed project.\u201d <em>(Mt. Shasta, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 446.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\"><em>City of Pasadena v. State of California </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 766] addressed this issue as part of its determination whether a project to relocate a parole office was exempt from CEQA. In assessing whether the significant effect exception applied, the court discussed <em>Bishop, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d 151. It agreed that social and economic effects must be considered if they will cause physical changes but found <em>Bishop </em>distinguishable because appellant in this case had not made a \u201cshowing or argument that [relocation of the parole office] would cause the physical deterioration of the area.\u201d <em>(City of Pasadena, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at p. 828.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\"><em>Friends of Davis, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th 1004 (distinguished, <em>post) </em>rejected the position that identification of a Borders bookstore as a prospective tenant in a retail development compelled supplemental environmental review. There, the City of Davis (Davis) certified an EIR for a specific plan that reflected designation of the subject property for retail use. The applicant subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>acquired an option to purchase the property and applied for design review of a proposed retail development that conformed to the specific plan and current zoning designation. During the design review process, it was revealed that one of the tenants would be a Borders bookstore. Davis planning staff took the position that the design review process did not differentiate between one type of retail tenant and another. Over objection from citizens who sought to use the design review ordinance to exclude Borders from locating in Davis, the planning commission\u2019s decision to approve the design review application was upheld. The appellate court agreed with Davis, carefully explaining that it was \u201cnot reviewing the record to determine whether it demonstrates a possibility of environmental impact, but are viewing it in a light most favorable to the City\u2019s decision in order to determine whether substantial evidence supports the decision not to require additional review.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1021.) Prior environmental review already encompassed retail use of the property. A subsequent EIR was not required merely because it \u201cappears likely\u201d that Borders would compete with existing bookstores. <em>(?Ibid.) </em>Appellant had not presented any evidence supporting its assumptions \u201cthat existing downtown bookstores will not be able to compete with Borders and will close[,] . . . that the bookstores will not be replaced by new or different businesses . . . [and] that the bookstore closures will cause other downtown businesses to close, thus leading to a general deterioration of the downtown area.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">Most recently, it was held that the project description for a proposed warehouse distribution center did not have to specifically identify the end user because this information did not implicate new or different environmental effects other than those that had been addressed in the EIR. <em>(Maintain Our Desert Environment v. Town of Apple Valley </em>(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 396 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 322] <em>(Apple Valley).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">It is apparent from the case law discussed above that proposed new shopping centers do not trigger a conclusive presumption of urban decay. However, when there is evidence suggesting that the economic and social effects caused by the proposed shopping center ultimately could result in urban decay or deterioration, then the lead agency is obligated to assess this indirect impact. Many factors are relevant, including the size of the project, the type of retailers and their market areas and the proximity of other retail shopping opportunities. The lead agency cannot divest itself of its analytical and informational obligations by summarily dismissing the possibility of urban decay or deterioration as a \u201csocial or economic effect\u201d of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">C &amp; C contends that study is not required because the record does not contain substantial evidence proving that the shopping centers will cause urban decay. This argument founders because it is premised on the wrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>standard of review. Substantial evidence is the standard applied to conclusions reached in an EIR and findings that are based on such conclusions. <em>(Irritated Residents, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1390-1391.) BCLC is not challenging a conclusion in the EIR\u2019s that the shopping centers would not indirectly cause urban decay or a finding adopted by the City. It is not arguing that the City used the wrong methodology in assessing whether urban decay will be an indirect effect of the project or challenging the validity of an expert\u2019s opinion on this topic. Rather, BCLC\u2019s argument is that the EIR\u2019s failed to comply with the information disclosure provisions of CEQA because they omitted any meaningful consideration of the question whether the shopping centers could, individually or cumulatively, trigger a series of events that ultimately cause urban decay. Neither EIR even contains a statement indicating reasons why it had been determined that urban decay was not a significant effect of the proposed projects. (\u00a7 21100, subd. (c).) BCLC is challenging the City\u2019s view that such an analysis was purely economic and therefore was outside the scope of CEQA. The substantial evidence standard of review is not applied to this type of CEQA challenge. The relevant question is whether the lead agency failed to proceed as required by law. (1 Kostka &amp; Zischke, CEQA Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12.5, pp. 464-466.1.)  \u201c[Although the agency\u2019s factual determinations are subject to deferential review, questions of interpretation or application of the requirements of CEQA are matters of law. [Citations.] While we may not substitute our judgment for that of the decision makers, we must ensure strict compliance with the procedures and mandates of the statute.\u201d <em>(Save Our Peninsula Committee v. Monterey County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 118 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 326] <em>(Peninsula).) </em>If C &amp; C is contending that claims concerning omission of information from an EIR essentially should be treated as inquiries whether there is substantial evidence supporting the decision approving the projects, we reiterate our rejection of this position for the reasons previously expressed in <em>Irritated Residents, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at page 1392.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">In any event, C &amp; C\u2019s position has no substantive merit. There is a great deal of evidence in the record supporting the validity of concerns that the shopping centers could cause a ripple of store closures and consequent long-term vacancies that would eventually result in general deterioration and decay within and outside the market area of the two shopping centers. Although much of BCLC\u2019s evidence specifically applied to the Supercenters, the administrative records as a whole contain sufficient indication that addition of 1.1 million square feet of retail space in the shopping centers\u2019 overlapping market areas could start the chain reaction that ultimately results in urban decay to necessitate study of the issue with respect to the entirety of the shopping centers.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>First, BCLC retained a professor of economics at San Francisco State University, C. Daniel Vencill, to study the cumulative economic effects that will be caused by the two new Supercenters (the Vencill report). Together with two colleagues, Vencill reviewed literature and analyzed the five-mile area surrounding the project sites. Photographs were taken of the sites and \u201cexisting blight conditions which have remained unabated for some years in the area surrounding the proposed new sites\u201d were documented. The Vencill report determined that the two shopping centers are in the same shopper catchment area and they will be competing with each other as well as with existing retail establishments. It states that \u201c[tjhere are [four] existing shopping centers and malls that will be adversely affected by [Gosford and Panama]. One regional mall is suspected of being in serious decline.\u201d The two Supercenters represent significant excess capacity as configured and located. \u201cThis will result in oversaturation and fall-out of weaker competitors in the at-risk commercial blight zone the developments will create.\u201d The Vencill report identified 29 businesses, primarily but not exclusively grocery stores, that are at direct risk of closure. Two Albertsons are \u201cfacing extinction\u201d and a small nursery that is located across the street from Gosford \u201cwould certainly become defunct.\u201d Additionally, no \u201calternative plans\u201d were observed for the Wal-Mart building on White Lane that will be vacant when this Wal-Mart store is replaced by the Supercenter at Panama. The Vencill report finds: \u201cIt is reasonably probable [that] competition provided by the two proposed [Supercenters] (i.e., the diversion of existing sales from local merchants), individually and especially cumulatively, will have economic impacts on existing businesses triggering a chain of events that may lead to adverse effects on the physical environment in the southern part of Bakersfield. One of the ways this may occur is that smaller retailers in the area, particularly those located within five miles of the sites, and even more specifically those retailers already struggling or on the verge of having to terminate operations, will be unable to compete and will have to go out of business. In turn, this may cause permanent or long-term vacancies of retail space in the area. The result is typically neglect of maintenance and repair of retail facilities, the deterioration of buildings, improvements, and facilities. This may then culminate in physical effects associated with blight-like conditions, which include visual and aesthetic impacts accompanying the physical deterioration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">BCLC also submitted numerous studies and articles analyzing the adverse effects other communities in California (San Diego, Orange County and Calexico,) and elsewhere (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Bath, Maine; Eastern Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois; Syracuse, New York) have experienced as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>result of saturation of a market area with super-sized retailers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As relevant here, the authors found numerous adverse effects resulting from saturation of a market area with Supercenters and similar retail facilities, such as SuperTargets and SuperKmarts. These effects include, but are not limited to, physical decay and deterioration resulting from store closures in the same market area or in established areas of the community (i.e., the \u201ctraditional downtown area\u201d) due to competitive pressures, followed by an inability to easily re-lease the vacated premises. The authors also found that it had been difficult to find tenants for buildings that formerly housed Wal-Mart stores that were replaced by the new Supercenters. Many of the empty buildings physically deteriorated.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">This evidence cannot be cavalierly dismissed as \u201chit pieces\u201d designed to disparage a specific corporation. Studies discussing the experiences of other communities constitute important anecdotal evidence about the way the proposed shopping centers could serve as a catalyst for urban deterioration and decay in the City. The Vencill report is extremely significant and it strongly supports BCLC\u2019s position that CEQA requires analysis of urban decay.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Moreover, numerous individuals commented about urban decay during the administrative process. For example, at the planning commission\u2019s public hearing on the adequacy of the draft EIR\u2019s, Cindy Fabricius stated, \u201c[T]here are 45 empty Wal-Marts in the state of Texas. There are 34 empty standing Wal-Marts in the state of Georgia. There are 27 in Utah. Find them. Go look at them. They are empty. When Wal-Mart moves on they leave their boxes. Those boxes are not bought up by other [businesses]; who can afford that huge of a store; that huge of a rent?\u201d Herman Lee commented that there are parts of East Bakersfield that need revitalization. Yet, the proposed shopping centers are out in the southwest part of town. He queried, \u201cWhat about the people on the east side of town?\u201d Some comments made at the February 2003 City Council meeting are also relevant. A representative of Save Mart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>Supermarkets spoke in opposition to the project and submitted the data concerning Oklahoma City. He stated that the addition of the two shopping centers will adversely affect existing shopping centers and asserted that the \u201c[t]he potential for urban blight and decay is a matter which must be considered\u201d in the EIR\u2019s. Another commercial property owner wrote that he had been unable to re-lease a building that formerly housed a grocery store and he ended up demolishing the building. When a grocery store closes, the remainder of the stores in the shopping center are likely to close. The center \u201ccould end up with many boarded up storefronts.\u201d Another citizen wrote a letter that included six examples of buildings in the City that formerly housed large retail stores and now are \u201cvacant, rundown box buildings and shopping centers.\u201d He was concerned that the proposed projects would result in more \u201cempty warehouse type, rundown buildings\u201d littering the City. While these individuals are not experts in any sense of the word, their firsthand observations should not casually be dismissed as immaterial because \u201crelevant personal observations are evidence.\u201d <em>(Bishop, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d at p. 173; see also <em>Ocean View Estates Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Montecito Water Dist. </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 396, 402 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 451].)</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">The responses in the EIR\u2019s to these and other comments do not meaningfully address the issue of urban decay. The Gosford EIR states that vacant buildings \u201care part of the evolutional change of the retail environment.\u201d It then asserts that further analysis is outside the scope of CEQA because economic and social effects are not considered environmental effects under CEQA. The response in the Panama EIR is similarly incomplete. Ignoring the question of urban decay or deterioration, it simply replies that \u201cblight\u201d is a legal term that does not apply. It also asserts that vacancy rates and business closures are purely economic impacts and therefore outside of CEQA. Finally, it states that a survey of vacant buildings had been prepared and this survey demonstrated that \u201cretailers entering or leaving the market, relocations, re-leasing to new tenants or conversions to other uses is a normal part of a dynamic market.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">The Retail Impact Analysis (retail analysis) that was appended to the Panama EIR does not constitute an acceptable substitute for proper identification and analysis in an EIR. The retail analysis analyzed \u201cthe potential market support and retail sales impacts\u201d of the Supercenter component of Panama. It found that general merchandise stores have a market area of approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>five miles; grocery stores have a market area of approximately two miles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It concluded that there is sufficient capacity to sustain the Supercenter at Panama without causing closure of existing general merchandise or grocery stores. However, the Supercenter would reduce the business volume of existing stores. The retail analysis stated that the existing Wal-Mart store building could be utilized in another unspecified capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The retail analysis did not reference Gosford or consider whether there is sufficient capacity to sustain both shopping centers. It did not analyze whether the combined influx of both shopping centers would lead to the closure of existing grocery or general merchandise stores, particularly where their market areas overlap. Rather, it focused on the single narrow question whether there is sufficient demand to sustain the Supercenter at Panama. It did not meaningfully consider whether addition of 1.1 million square feet of new retail space, much of it housing Supercenters, Sam\u2019s Club and other large retailers such as Lowe\u2019s and Kohl\u2019s (which dominate individual merchandise areas and are sometimes referred to as \u201ccategory killers\u201d) will displace older, smaller retail stores and shopping centers, leaving long-term vacancies that deteriorate and encourage graffiti and other unsightly conditions. Furthermore, the retail analysis fails to meaningfully address the question whether the building on White Lane that currently houses a Wal-Mart store will experience a long-term vacancy when this store is closed. No facts are offered in support of the retail analysis\u2019s conclusion that the building can be leased to another tenant. \u201cCan\u201d is not equivalent to \u201cwill\u201d and the difference in the two words is crucial when assessing whether the store closure will result in an adverse environmental impact. The retail analysis characterizes vacancies as normal parts of a dynamic and evolving retail environment without considering whether those vacancies are clustered in one area or are likely to be long term.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">We agree with BCLC that <em>Mt. Shasta, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d 433, is analogous. Just as in <em>Mt. Shasta, </em>it is apparent that in this case the shopping centers could, individually and cumulatively, trigger the same downward spiral of business closures, vacancies and deterioration that other communities have experienced when they allowed similar saturation development. Therefore, CEQA requires analysis of this potential environmental impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">C &amp; C argues that the instant case is analogous to <em>Friends of Davis, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th 1004. We disagree. <em>Friends of Davis </em>considered whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>supplemental EIR was required. No zoning change or nonconformity with the existing specific plan existed and retail development on the project site had already been subjected to full environmental review. In contrast here, there has not been any previous study of the environmental effects associated with the requested zoning changes and general plan amendments. No prior EIR\u2019s considered the consequences of building shopping centers on the project sites. Rather, it is the sufficiency of the initial EIR\u2019s that is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">It must be mentioned that although we do not quarrel with the holding in <em>Apple Valley, supra, </em>120 Cal.App.4th 396, it is factually distinguishable from this situation. Here, recognition of the characteristics of the shopping centers\u2019 tenants is a necessary prerequisite to accurate identification and analysis of the environmental consequences that will result from approval of the proposed projects. When the particular type of retail business planned for a proposed project will have unique or additional adverse impacts, then disclosure of the type of business is necessary in order to accurately recognize and analyze the environmental effects that will result from the proposed project. A rendering plant has different environmental impacts than a chandler. In the retail context, Supercenters are similarly unique. Unlike the vast majority of stores, many Supercenters operate 24 hours per day seven days a week. Such extended operational hours raise questions concerning increased or additional adverse impacts relating to lights, noise, traffic and crime. While specific identification of the name of the tenant may be unnecessary, to simply state as did the Gosford EIR that \u201cno stores have been identified\u201d without disclosing the type of retailers envisioned for the proposed project is not only misleading and inaccurate, but it hints at mendacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">Accordingly, we hold that the omission of analysis on the issue of urban/suburban decay and deterioration rendered the EIR\u2019s defective as informational documents. <em>(Mt. Shasta, supra, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at p. 446.) On remand, the EIR\u2019s must analyze whether the shopping centers, individually and/or cumulatively, indirectly could trigger the downward spiral of retail closures and consequent long-term vacancies that ultimately result in decay. <em>(Ibid.; Bishop, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d at p. 171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">IV. <em>Cumulative Impacts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">The Gosford EIR and the Panama EIR considered each shopping center in isolation. The cumulative impacts sections of each EIR do not reference the other shopping center and neither EIR contains any discussion of or reference to retail development in the area surrounding the project site. BCLC argues that the \u201cfailure to treat Panama and Gosford as \u2018relevant projects\u2019 for purposes of evaluating cumulative effects\u201d is \u201c[a]n overarching legal flaw in both EIRs.\u201d We agree. The trial court correctly realized that the cumulative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>effect of the two shopping centers must be analyzed with respect to the topic of urban decay. However, it inexplicably failed to follow the applicable chain of reasoning to its logical conclusion and recognize that the cumulative effects analyses were fimdamentally flawed because they did not recognize that the shopping centers were relevant projects and did not analyze the type and severity of impacts that will result from construction and operation of both projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">\u201cA fundamental purpose of CEQA is to ensure that governmental agencies regulate their activities \u2018so that major consideration is given to preventing environmental damage, while providing a decent home and satisfying living environment for every Californian.\u2019 [Citations.] . . . The heart of CEQA is the EIR. [Citation.] Its purposes are manifold, but chief among them is that of providing public agencies and the general public with detailed information about the effects of a proposed project on the environment. [Citations.] [][] Part of this vital informational function is performed by a cumulative impact analysis.\u201d <em>(Reasonable Growth, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d at pp. 72-73.) \u201cThe term \u2018 \u201c[cumulative impacts\u201d refer[s] to two or more individual effects which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Raptor, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 739.) \u201c[A] cumulative impact consists of an impact which is created as a result of the combination of the project evaluated in the EIR together with other projects causing related impacts.\u201d (Guidelines, \u00a7 15130, subd. (a)(1).) \u201c \u2018The cumulative impact from several projects is the change in the environment which results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other closely related past, present, and reasonably] foreseeable probable future projects. Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time.\u2019 (CEQA Guidelines, \u00a7 15355, subd. (b).) \u2018Cumulative impact analysis \u201cassesses cumulative damage as a whole greater than the sum of its parts.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Irritated Residents, supra, </em>107 Cal.App.4th at p. 1403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">\u201cThe significance of a comprehensive cumulative impacts evaluation is stressed in CEQA.\u201d <em>(Schoen </em>v. <em>Department of Forestry &amp; Fire Prevention </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 556, 572 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 343].) Proper cumulative impact analysis is vital \u201cbecause the full environmental impact of a proposed project cannot be gauged in a vacuum. One of the most important environmental lessons that has been learned is that environmental damage often occurs incrementally from a variety of small sources. These sources appear insignificant when considered individually, but assume threatening dimensions when considered collectively with other sources with which they interact.\u201d <em>(Communities for a Better Environment v. California Resources Agency </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 114 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 441], fns. omitted; see also <em>Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1025 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 367].) \u201c[Consideration of the effects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>of a project or projects as if no others existed would encourage the piecemeal approval of several projects that, taken together, could overwhelm the natural environment and disastrously overburden the man-made infrastructure and vital community services. This would effectively defeat CEQA\u2019s mandate to review the actual effect of the projects upon the environment.\u201d <em>(Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 300, 306 [223 Cal.Rptr. 18].)</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">When faced with a challenge that the cumulative impacts analysis is unduly narrow, the court must determine whether it was reasonable and practical to include the omitted projects and whether their exclusion prevented the severity and significance of the cumulative impacts from being accurately reflected. <em>(Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 723 [270 Cal.Rptr. 650] <em>(Farm Bureau).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">It is beyond dispute that the two shopping centers are both \u201cpresent\u201d projects within the meaning of Guidelines section 15355, subdivision (b). They were proposed within a month of each other and both shopping centers were considered at the same meetings of the City Planning Commission and the City Council. Many citizens, including BCLC, voiced their opinions about both shopping centers at the same time. Thus, the determinative question is whether Gosford and Panama also are \u201cclosely related\u201d within the meaning of Guidelines section 15355, subdivision (b). We answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">First, there is evidence showing that the two shopping centers will compete with each other. Some of the anchor tenants at both shopping centers are regional draws with a market area in excess of five miles. The Vencill report states that the market area for stores like Supercenters is about five miles. It concludes that the two shopping centers are in the same shopper catchment area and the Supercenters will compete with each other. Sifnilarly, the retail analysis states that general merchandise stores have a market area of five miles or more. Grocery stores have a market area of two miles or more. Since Gosford and Panama are 3.6 miles apart, the two market areas necessarily overlap. As previously discussed, the record contains numerous studies analyzing the adverse effects other communities have experienced when a market area was saturated with large-scale retailers such as traditional Wal-Mart stores and their siblings, Supercenters and Sam\u2019s Clubs. Studies discussing the adverse effects that other communities experienced after similar retail development constitutes important anecdotal evidence about the adverse impacts that the City may experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">Second, the Gosford FIR and the Panama FIR show that the two shopping centers share four arterial roadways: Pacheco Road, Panama Lane, Harris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>Road and White Lane. A planning commissioner stated that he was concerned that the two projects could have combined, unrecognized adverse impacts on traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Third, ambient air quality is a serious concern. Each of the EIR\u2019s concluded that the proposed shopping center would have an unavoidable adverse impact on ambient air quality. The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) expressed the opinion that each project \u201cand others similar to it will cumulatively reduce air quality in the San Joaquin Valley.\u201d This will \u201cmake it more difficult to meet mandated emission reductions and air quality standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">When considered in its entirety, this evidence strongly supports BCLC\u2019s position that the two shopping centers are closely related and may have several cumulatively significant adverse impacts. Therefore, CEQA compels assessment and disclosure of these combined environmental effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">There is no merit to the position of City and developers that cumulative impacts analysis does not require consideration of both shopping centers because, in each case, the other shopping center is outside the radius of the \u201cproject area\u201d as defined in EIR\u2019s. An EIR is required to discuss significant impacts that the proposed project will cause in the area that is affected by the project. (CEQA Guidelines, \u00a7 15126.2, subd. (a).) This area cannot be so narrowly defined that it necessarily eliminates a portion of the affected environmental setting. Furthermore, Guidelines section 15130, subdivision (b)(3) directs agencies to \u201cdefine the geographic scope of the area affected by the cumulative effect and provide a reasonable explanation for the geographic limitation used.\u201d Neither the Gosford EIR nor the Panama EIR complied with this requirement. The EIR\u2019s state what has been determined to be the appropriate geographic area for each category of potential impacts, but no explanation was offered as to the criterion upon which this determination was made. Simply put, selection of \u201cappropriate\u201d geographic areas that just happen to narrowly miss the other large proposed shopping center in every category of impacts despite their overlapping market areas and shared roadways does not constitute the good faith disclosure and analysis that is required by CEQA. In <em>Raptor, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th 713, we found the description of the environmental setting in an EIR prepared for a residential project to be deficient because it failed to mention nearby wetlands and a wildlife preserve. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 722-729.) Omission of any reference in the EIR\u2019s to the other proposed shopping center is similarly \u201cinaccurate and misleading.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 724.)</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">We are unpersuaded by C &amp; C\u2019s argument that the cumulative impacts of the two projects were accounted for because the Gosford EIR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>based its discussion of certain environmental effects, such as air quality, on a summary of projections contained in an approved planning document. Use of a planning document does not preclude challenge to the accuracy or sufficiency of the cumulative impacts analysis. As recognized in a respected CEQA treatise, \u201c[t]he summary-of-projections approach may present problems if the projections in the general plan or related planning document are inaccurate or outdated.\u201d (1 Kostka &amp; Zischke, CEQA Practice, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 13.39, p. 537.) Such is the case here. Both of the shopping center projects required amendment of the general plan. The addition of large regional shopping centers such as Gosford and Panama are not accounted for in the projections. We need not comment on the propriety of using the list of projects method for some aspects of cumulative impacts analysis and using the summary of projections for other aspects because, under either method, the cumulative impacts section is underinclusive. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00a7 13.39, pp. 537-538.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Proper cumulative impacts analysis is absolutely critical to meaningful environmental review of the shopping center projects. Four analogous cases support our conclusion that the EIR\u2019s are legally inadequate due to their underinclusive and misleading cumulative impacts analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">In <em>Reasonable Growth, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d 61, the appellate court ordered an EIR prepared for a high-rise project to be decertified because it underestimated the amount of new downtown development and consequently had not evaluated \u201cthe true severity and significance\u201d of the cumulative impacts. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 80.) The court explained that the danger created by providing understated information subverts an agency\u2019s ability to adopt appropriate and effective mitigation measures, skews its perspective concerning the benefits of the particular projects under consideration and precludes it from gaining a true perspective on the consequences of approving the project. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Similarly, in <em>Farm Bureau, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 692, this court determined that limiting the scope of cumulative impacts analysis to the mid-San Joaquin Valley was unduly restrictive and resulted in an inaccurate minimization of the cumulative impacts on air quality resulting from construction of the proposed cogeneration plan together with the many other proposed energy projects. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 721-724.)</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Next, in <em>Raptor, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th 713, we invalidated an EIR prepared for a housing project, in part because it failed to analyze the project in conjunction with other development projects in the surrounding area. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 739-741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>Most recently, in <em>Eel River, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th 859, the court found that an EIR considering a project to divert water was legally inadequate because the cumulative impacts analysis did not take into account other pending proposals that would curtail water diversions. The court concluded that it was \u201creasonable and practical\u201d to include other pending curtailment proposals in the cumulative impacts analysis and that this omission resulted in an EIR that failed to alert decision makers and the public to the possibility that the agency would not be able to supply water to its customers in an environmentally sound way. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 868-872.)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Following and applying these authorities, we likewise conclude that the EIR\u2019s are inadequate because they did not analyze the cumulative environmental impacts of other past, present and reasonably foreseeable retail projects in the market areas served by the proposed shopping centers. Neither EIR meaningfully addressed comments stating that the two shopping centers will have cumulative adverse impacts. As a result, the cumulative impacts analyses in both EIR\u2019s are underinclusive and misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The record raises numerous questions respecting the type and severity of cumulative adverse environmental impacts that likely will result from the two shopping centers. Topics such as traffic, noise, air quality, urban decay and growth inducement immediately surface.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> City and developers cannot fault BCLC because it does not have evidence answering these and other questions related to the cumulative impacts resulting from construction and operation of both Gosford and Panama. \u201cTo conclude otherwise would place the burden of producing relevant environmental data on the public rather than the agency and would allow the agency to avoid an attack on the adequacy of the information contained in the report simply by excluding such information.\u201d <em>(Farm Bureau, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 692, 724.)</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">On remand, each EIR must analyze the cumulative impacts resulting from construction and operation of the proposed shopping center in conjunction with all other past, present or reasonably foreseeable retail projects that are or will be located within the proposed project\u2019s market area. This includes, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>is not limited to, analysis of the combined adverse impacts resulting from construction and operation of Gosford and Panama.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">V. <em>Failure to Correlate Adverse Air Quality Impacts to Resulting Adverse Health Impacts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">The Gosford EIR concluded that Gosford would cause significant unavoidable direct adverse impacts to regional air quality from construction and operation. The direct adverse air quality impacts are derived \u201cprimarily from automobile emissions during operation and from architectural coatings and construction equipment during construction phase. No feasible mitigation measures are available that would reduce impacts to less than significant levels.\u201d Furthermore, Gosford \u201ccould potentially result in cumulatively considerable impacts to regional air quality from construction and operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">Similarly, the Panama EIR concluded that Panama \u201cmay result in an overall increase in the local and regional pollutant load due to direct impacts from vehicle emissions and indirect impacts from electricity and natural gas consumption. This impact is considered significant and unavoidable for ROG and NOx.\u201d The Panama EIR reached a different conclusion than the Gosford EIR with respect to cumulative impacts, determining that a \u201cless than significant\u201d impact would occur in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">BCLC contends that both EIR\u2019s omitted relevant information when they failed to correlate the identified adverse air quality impacts to resultant adverse health effects. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Guidelines section 15126.2, subdivision (a) requires an EIR to discuss, inter alia, \u201chealth and safety problems caused by the physical changes\u201d that the proposed project will precipitate. Both of the EIR\u2019s concluded that the projects would have significant and unavoidable adverse impacts on air quality. It is well known that air pollution adversely affects human respiratory health. (See, e.g., Bustillo, <em>Smog Harms Children\u2019s Lungs for Life, Study Finds, </em>L.A. Times (Sept. 9, 2004).) Emergency rooms crowded with wheezing sufferers are sad but common sights in the San Joaquin Valley and elsewhere. Air quality indexes are published daily in local newspapers, schools monitor air quality and restrict outdoor play when it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>especially poor and the public is warned to limit their activities on days when air quality is particularly bad. Yet, neither EIR acknowledges the health consequences that necessarily result from the identified adverse air quality impacts. Buried in the description of some of the various substances that make up the soup known as \u201cair pollution\u201d are brief references to respiratory illnesses. However, there is no acknowledgement or analysis of the well-known connection between reduction in air quality and increases in specific respiratory conditions and illnesses. After reading the EIR\u2019s, the public would have no idea of the health consequences that result when more pollutants are added to a nonattainment basin. On remand, the health impacts resulting from the adverse air quality impacts must be identified and analyzed in the new EIR\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">VI. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">\u201cWhen the informational requirements of CEQA are not complied with, an agency has failed to proceed in \u2018a manner required by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Peninsula, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 118.) If the deficiencies in an EIR \u201cpreclude[] informed decisionmaking and public participation, the goals of CEQA are thwarted and a prejudicial abuse of discretion has occurred.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">An EIR\u2019s role \u201cas an environmental \u2018alarm bell\u2019 whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return\u201d <em>(County of Inyo </em>v. <em>Yorty </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810 [108 Cal.Rptr. 377]) is equally vital whether one is protecting our coastline and forests or preserving our inland neighborhoods as viable communities. For many of us, adverse environmental impacts such as reduction of endangered species habitat are regrettable but largely abstract harms. In contrast, deterioration of our local communities is a very real problem that directly impacts the quality of our daily life. When our morning commutes are marred by the sight of numerous vacant or half-vacant strip malls adorned with graffiti and weeds, when we hesitate to move into an established neighborhood because of the absence of close and convenient shopping and when it hurts to take a deep breath on hot August afternoons because of the poor air quality, the importance of thorough environmental analysis and complete disclosure before new projects are approved is all too evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">In this case, City\u2019s failure to assess whether the shopping centers, individually and cumulatively, will indirectly cause urban decay, to evaluate the cumulative impacts of both shopping centers and to correlate the adverse air quality impacts to resulting adverse health consequences, cannot be dismissed as harmless or insignificant defects. As a result of these omissions, meaningful assessment of the true scope of numerous potentially serious adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>environmental effects was thwarted. No discrete or severable aspects of the projects are unaffected by the omitted analyses; the defects relate to the shopping centers in their entirety, not just to one specific retailer. These deficiencies precluded informed public participation and decision making. Therefore, certification of the EIR\u2019s was a prejudicial abuse of discretion. <em>(Peninsula, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The Guidelines unequivocally require the lead agency to certify a legally adequate final EIR prior to deciding whether or not to approve or carry out a contested project. (Guidelines, \u00a7\u00a7 15089 to 15092.) \u201c[T]he ultimate decision of whether to approve a project, be that decision right or wrong, is a nullity if based upon an EIR that does not provide the decision-makers, and the public, with the information about the project that is required by CEQA.\u201d <em>(Santiago County Water Dist. v. County of Orange </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 829 [173 Cal.Rptr. 602].) Thus, the project approvals and associated land use entitlements also must be voided. (See, e.g., <em>Eel River, supra, </em>108 Cal.App.4th at p. 882; <em>Raptor, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 742-743.)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">VII.-IX.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">The judgments are reversed and the actions are remanded to the Superior Court of Kern County.

Since the survey did not consider questions concerning the likely effects that the addition of 1.1 million square feet of new retail space would have on the vacancy rate in the City or address the likelihood of re-leasing vacant premises that formerly were occupied by competitors of the proposed shopping centers, we find it unhelpful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b948-8\"> After stating that general merchandise stores have a market area of five miles or more, the retail analysis inexplicably assigns without explanation three miles as the relevant market area with respect to the Supercenter at Panama. Since this conclusion is not supported by any explanation or analysis and it is directly contradicted by other information in the retail analysis, we decline to afford it any weight.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b954-7\"> Specific questions such as the following immediately come to mind: How will traffic patterns be affected on the shared roadways? Will combined traffic cause an increase in mobile emissions that adversely affects sensitive receptors? Will the presence of two shopping centers containing large value-oriented retailers result in an overall increase in shoppers who may come from outlying areas because of the abundance of retail opportunities in a relatively small area? In other words, is there a synergy whereby one and one equals more than two? Alternatively, will Gosford and Panama draw customers from each other, thereby increasing the potential that one of the shopping centers will not be successful and could deteriorate? Does addition of multiple new shopping facilities stimulate growth in the surrounding area and if so, what type?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b955-11\"> This conclusion obviates any need to address BCLC\u2019s other claims concerning the sufficiency of the cumulative impacts analyses. However, we mention that when the City assesses the combined effects that the two shopping centers will have on ambient air quality, it must apply the principles we explained in <em>Farm Bureau, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d 692. The magnitude of the current air quality problems in the San Joaquin Valley cannot be used to trivialize the cumulative contributions of the shopping centers and the scope of the analysis cannot be artificially limited to a restricted portion of the air basin. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 718, 723.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b957-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1184.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
