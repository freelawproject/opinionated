A jury convicted Claude Adams of misdemeanor battery on a police dog (Pen. Code, \u00a7 600, subd. (a), (count 3)) along with possession of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (a) (count 1)), and misdemeanor resisting arrest (Pen. Code, \u00a7 148 (count 2)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-9\">On appeal, Adams challenges only his conviction for battery on a police dog. Adams contends his conviction on this count must be reversed because (1) the court refused defense counsel\u2019s request to instruct the jury on the definition of the term \u201cmaliciously,\u201d (2) the court failed to instruct the jury sua sponte on the definition of the term \u201cwithout legal justification,\u201d and (3) the court failed to provide the jury with a written instruction on the elements of Penal Code section 600, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the jury requested. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-11\">On May 10, 2003, around 11:13 p.m., Bakersfield Police Officer Damon Youngblood was working routine patrol in a marked unit with his K-9. Upon seeing Adams walking with an unidentified Hispanic male in an area known for high narcotics usage, Officer Youngblood decided to contact Adams. Adams appeared nervous; he was sweating and displaying symptoms consistent with being under the influence of a central nervous system stimulant. When Officer Youngblood asked Adams if he minded being searched, Adams told him to go ahead. Officer Youngblood found a large sum of money in Adams\u2019s rear pocket, which he removed and placed on his patrol car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1490\">*1490</page-number>Continuing the search, Officer Youngblood felt something squishy with hard objects inside it in Adams\u2019s left front pocket, which Officer Youngblood thought was possibly rock cocaine. Officer Youngblood pulled the object out and saw a clear plastic baggie containing eight to 10 white rocks he believed were rock cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">Adams became \u201cantsy.\u201d Officer Youngblood pushed the baggie back into Adams\u2019s pocket so he could gain better control of Adams and placed Adams in a reverse wrist lock. He told Adams he was under arrest. Adams took his free hand down from the back of his head and refused Officer Youngblood\u2019s orders to put it back. When Officer Youngblood attempted to push Adams to the ground, Adams managed to break free and run away across a parking lot. Officer Youngblood chased him on foot. Despite Officer Youngblood\u2019s repeated orders to stop, Adams continued to run. Finally, for safety reasons, Officer Youngblood stopped chasing Adams and set up a perimeter. Area officers responded as backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">Bakersfield Police Officer Chris Ward and his K-9, Hunter, responded to the call for backup. Upon arrival at the scene, Officers Ward and Hunter took a perimeter position. About 30 minutes later, Officers Ward and Hunter, along with another officer, began searching house to house. Hunter led the officers into the yard of a residence. The house had a stairway up to a porch and a crawl space under the house. Officer Ward found the access to the crawl space after Hunter pulled him toward a bush. Hunter tried to enter the access, but Officer Ward pulled him back. Officer Ward then called Officer Youngblood to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">Officer Ward looked into the crawl space, but did not see anyone. He then yelled into the crawl space two or three times that he was with the Bakersfield Police Department and anyone there should come out with his hands up or he was going to send in the police dog. Officer Ward had Hunter bark several times between announcements, then listened each time to see if he could hear anything. When there was no response, Officer Ward deployed Hunter to check the crawl space.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-8\">The officers immediately heard barking, followed by yelling and profanities. Within seconds, Officer Ward entered the crawl space with Officer Youngblood following. They could see Adams sitting up and hitting Hunter on the head with a stick that looked like a portion of a table leg, while Hunter held fast to his lower left leg. Officer Ward yelled at Adams to put the stick down, but he continued hitting Hunter. Adams hit Hunter on the head another five to eight times before finally throwing down the stick. At that point, Officer Ward called Hunter back to him and took Hunter out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1491\">*1491</page-number>Officer Youngblood ordered Adams to come out from under the house, which he eventually did. Officer Youngblood handcuffed Adams and placed him under arrest. A subsequent search revealed that the plastic baggie was no longer in Adams\u2019s pocket. Officer Youngblood did find a $10 bill wrapped around a white rock, which appeared to be rock cocaine, in Adams\u2019s left front pocket.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, Adams was missing the T-shirt he had been wearing when Officer Youngblood initially contacted him. Approximately 45 minutes had transpired between Officer Youngblood\u2019s initial contact with Adams and his arrest. Although officers searched for the plastic bag, they were unable to find it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">Adams was transported to Kern Medical Center, where he was treated for his injuries, which included punctures on his left lower leg and foot. Hunter received a laceration on the side of his nose, but Officer Ward did not take him to the veterinarian. According to Officer Ward, Hunter properly performed his duties in accordance with his training.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">Adams testified in his own defense. According to Adams, on the night of May 10, 2003, about 11:15 p.m., he was walking with an acquaintance in the vicinity of Baker Street. Officer Youngblood came around the comer in his patrol car, jumped out, and asked Adams whether he had anything on him. When Adams said no, Officer Youngblood asked if he could search him. Adams asked why. Officer Youngblood then grabbed him by his arm like he was trying to break it. Adams became \u201creal scared,\u201d broke free and ran. While Adams admitted having a single rock of cocaine on him at the time, he denied having a plastic bag containing rocks of cocaine. Adams also admitted he fled across a parking lot and over fences and that he hid under a house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">After he had been under the house for 20 to 30 minutes, Officers Ward and Youngblood arrived with a leashed dog. Adams claimed he never heard the officers telling him to come out or heard the dog bark. Adams testified the officers were \u201csneakin\u2019 up\u201d on him, but after he saw \u201cthe light,\u201d he turned around and saw them. The officers had crawled into the crawl space together with the dog still on the leash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">According to Adams, when the officers saw him, they told him to be still and not move. Adams complied. Officer Youngblood grabbed him by his feet and held him. Adams said Officer Youngblood \u201churr[ied] up [and] took my shoe off and throw it, then he take off my T-shirt I had on.\u201d Adams further explained that initially the dog only had him by the pants \u201ca bit,\u201d and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1492\">*1492</page-number>officer made the dog stop. Then Officer Youngblood grabbed his leg and held him down, took off his shoes, and told the dog, \u201cget \u2019em boy, get \u2019em boy, bite \u2019em, bite \u2019em.\u201d Adams begged the officers to make the dog stop and told them he gave up, but the officers only responded with nasty remarks and thought it was funny. One of the officers said they would only call the dog off if Adams stuck out his hand. When Adams did this, the officers \u201cgot the dog [to] bit[e] my arm.\u201d The officers held him where they wanted the dog to bite him and told the dog to \u201cget \u2019em, get \u2019em boy, that keep \u2019em from running, get \u2019em.\u201d He claimed Officer Youngblood tore his pants leg, and the officers told the dog to bite him on the arm and back. While these events were occurring, Officer Ward was laughing and \u201cgetting his kick[s].\u201d The officers told Adams to crawl on his belly and, if he did not hurry up, they would make the dog bite him some more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">Adams said the officers grabbed his arms and tried to twist him over and drive him out from under the house. They also grabbed his neck and twisted and slammed him \u201creal hard.\u201d Even after he was taken to the hospital, Officer Ward continued to make jokes. Adams claimed he never saw the stick before and never picked it up, that he never hit the dog with a stick and that he never kicked the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-7\">I. <em>\u201cMaliciously\u201d and \u201cLegal Justification\u201d as Used in Section 600</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-8\">The trial court instructed the jury with a specially drafted instruction which stated that in order to convict Adams of a violation of section 600, the jury had to find among other things that he \u201cwillfully and maliciously and with no legal justification\u201d struck, beat, kicked, cut or stabbed a dog under the supervision of a peace officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While the court instructed the jury with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1493\">*1493</page-number>definition of \u201cwillfully\u201d contained in CALJIC No. 1.20,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court refused defense counsel\u2019s request to instruct the jury on the definition of \u201cmaliciously\u201d as set forth in CALJIC No. 1.22.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court also did not give any specific instruction on the definition of \u201cwith no legal justification,\u201d and defense counsel did not request such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">Adams first contends the trial court erred by refusing his trial counsel\u2019s request to define the word \u201cmaliciously\u201d as used in section 600, subdivision (a). He claims the error is analogous to failure to instruct on an element of an offense, which denied him due process of law and a fair trial. (See <em>People v. Cummings </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233, 1313 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1].) We disagree with Adams\u2019s analogy because the term \u201cmaliciously\u201d as used in section 600, subdivision (a), does not have a technical meaning different from its common meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">\u201c \u2018[Tjhe language of a statute defining a crime or defense is generally an appropriate and desirable basis for an instruction, and is ordinarily sufficient when the defendant fails to request amplification. If the jury would have no difficulty in understanding the statute without guidance, the court need do no more than instruct in statutory language.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Estrada </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 568, 574 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 586, 904 P.2d 1197].) However, the trial court has a sua sponte duty to give jurors explanatory instructions when a term in an instruction has \u201ca technical meaning that is peculiar to the law.\u201d <em>(People v. Howard </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 375, 408 [243 Cal.Rptr. 842, 749 P.2d 279].) \u201cThe rule to be applied in determining whether the meaning of a statute is adequately conveyed by its express terms is well established. When a word or phrase \u2018 \u201cis commonly understood by those familiar with the English language and is not used in a technical sense peculiar to the law, the court is not required to give an instruction as to its meaning in the absence of a request.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] A word or phrase having a technical, legal meaning requiring clarification by the court is one that has a definition that <em>differs </em>from its nonlegal meaning. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Estrada, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 574.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">Adams claims the word \u201cmaliciously\u201d has a technical legal meaning because it is specially defined in section 7, paragraph 4, and is the subject of a standard criminal jury instruction (CALJIC No. 1.22). \u201cMaliciously\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>typically defined in legal proceedings to mean \u201ca wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person, or an intent to do a wrongful act.\u201d (\u00a7 7, par. 4.) This definition, however, does not entirely apply to the crime of battery on a police dog under section 600, subdivision (a). Section 600, subdivision (a) makes it an offense to \u201cmaliciously\u201d strike, beat, kick, cut, stab, poison, throw an object at, or place an object likely to produce injury in the path of \u201cany dog under the supervision of, any peace officer in the discharge or attempted discharge of his or her duties.\u201d The acts that constitute the crime are specific acts of cruelty which by their nature necessarily imply the use of malice in the second sense of the code definition, \u201can intent to do a wrongful act.\u201d (\u00a7 7, par. 4, 2d cl.) The statute does not involve the first sense of the code definition which imports \u201ca wish to vex, annoy, or injure another person.\u201d (\u00a7 7, par. 4, 1st cl.) Therefore, the only definition of \u201cmaliciously\u201d from section 7, paragraph 4, applicable to battery on a police dog is the second definition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">\u201cMalice\u201d is defined in non-legal settings as the \u201cdesire to cause pain, injury, or distress to another\u201d or the \u201cintent to commit an unlawful act or cause harm without legal justification or excuse.\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (1999) p. 704.) In the circumstances of this case, the common understanding of maliciously is no different than the applicable definition from the statute and CALJIC No. 1.22. Accordingly, no additional instruction beyond that of the statutory language was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">Adams next contends the court was required to instruct the jury sua sponte with the definition of \u201clegal justification.\u201d While the trial court did not define that term, Adams acknowledges the jury was instructed they should find Adams not guilty of battery on a police dog if (1) they had a reasonable doubt the officer was attempting to make a lawful arrest or using reasonable force in attempting to make the arrest, or (2) they found the officer used unreasonable or excessive force in attempting to make the arrest and Adams used only reasonable force to protect himself.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Adams argues, however, the court was required to \u201cclose the proverbial loop by telling the jury that self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>defense against excessive force is what constituted \u2018legal justification\u2019 in the context of this case in which it was the prosecution\u2019s burden to prove the absence of legal justification as a separate element of the Penal Code section 600 offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">We need not decide whether the court had a sua sponte duty to give such an instruction in this case, however, because any error in failing to so instruct was harmless since the jury necessarily resolved the issue against Adams through other properly given instructions. <em>(People v. Wooten </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1834, 1849 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 765] [\u201c \u2018A failure to instruct where there is a duty to do so can be cured if it is shown that \u201cthe factual question posed by the omitted instruction was necessarily resolved adversely to the defendant under other, properly given instructions\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d].)  The instructions given informed the jury that in a prosecution under section 600, the People had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the performance of their duties, that an officer is not engaged in the performance of his duties if he uses unreasonable or excessive force in attempting to make the arrest, and if the jury had a reasonable doubt the officers were using reasonable force, they should find Adams not guilty of battery on a police dog. They were further instructed they could not convict Adams of a violation of section 600 if they found an officer used unreasonable or excessive force and Adams used only reasonable force to protect himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-7\">Under these instructions, the jury was obligated to acquit Adams of battery on a police dog if it found the officers used excessive force and Adams used only reasonable force to protect himself. Thus, by convicting Adams of battery on a police dog, the jury necessarily resolved the issue of self-defense against excessive force against him. Accordingly, any error in failing to give an instruction on legal justification was necessarily harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-8\">II. <em>Refusal to Provide Written Instruction on Section 600</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">Cornell, Acting P.

Adams was sentenced to a total term in state prison of four years comprised of two years for count 1, and two 1-year enhancements for the prior prison terms.

[f] In any event, he\u2019s charged with a violation of Penal Code Section 600, a misdemeanor. HO That provides that any person who willfully and maliciously, and with no legal justification, strikes, beats, kicks, cuts and/or stabs any dog under the supervision of any peace officer in the discharge or attempted discharge of his duties, is guilty of a violation of Penal Code Section 600, a misdemeanor. [][] In order to prove this crime, each of the following four elements must be proved: [][] One, a person willfully and maliciously and with no legal justification, strikes, beats, kicks, cuts and/or stabs a dog under the supervision of a peace officer. []Q Number two, the person acted in such manner as to be capable of producing injury and likely to produce injury to such dog. [f] Three, the dog was under the supervision of any peace officer engaged in the discharge or attempted discharge of his duties.

In that case, the court concluded that only the \u201cintent to do a wrongful act\u201d portion of section 7, paragraph 4, applied to the term \u201cmaliciously\u201d contained in section 597, which makes it an offense to maliciously maim, wound, or kill the animal of another. <em>(People v.
