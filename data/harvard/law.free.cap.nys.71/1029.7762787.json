The verdict was not only clearly against the weight of evidence, but it seems that the jury were misled, either by the charge of the learned court below, or by the assumption on their part that statements of account rendered to one of the defendants, in his individual name, were sufficient to carry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>evidence of liability against both of them as partners. The court charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1062-5\">\u201cNow, unless they can show that the balance of $168 applies to the two deliveries, for which the plaintiff claims his charge, then you must find as I have stated. If you find that both of these deliveries were not paid for in the payment of $768, then you can find against both of the defendants for those two deliveries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">This was manifestly not only prejudicial to the defendants, but was error in law, because, if sale and delivery were never made to Gunther, nor to the firm of which he was a member at the time, and plaintiff had knowledge of dissolution of defendants\u2019 firm, plaintiff could in no event recover.
