The costs fall with the judgment, and no question is presented on this appeal that we are now required to determine. The appeal should therefore be dismissed. If, however, the question argued was before us, we agree with the court below'. The amount claimed for referee\u2019s fees was $5,180. The clerk, on taxation, allowed $2,590. From the affidavit of the referee, it appears that at the commencement of the reference there w'as a stipulation that \u201cthe referee may fix such fees for himself in this matter as may be reasonable, and in doing so he shall not be limited to the legal statutory fee.\u201d The attorney for the defendants, at the time this stipulation was proposed, called the attention of the referee and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to the fact that such a stipulation would have no effect. The attorney for one of the defendants swears that the referee stated that he was quite content, if he charged any sum that was unreasonable, that his fees should be objected to; that after this statement the stipulation was entered upon the minutes; and that he was never arvare of the amount that the referee intended to charge. It also appears: That the referee charged for 97 days when evidence was taken; 68 days upon which the proceedings were adjourned, at which no testimony was taken; and 94 days for examining the case and the preparation of his report. That the case was submitted November 15, 1900, and the report was filed on the 30th of March, 1901, 185 days, including Sundays and holidays, of which the referee says he spent 94 in determining a case which seems to have been free from difficult legal questions. This would seem to be impossible. The clerk allowed for 259 days at $10 per day, and the complaint is that the referee was entitled to more, not that too much was allowed. There was no valid stipulation between the parties fixing the fees of this referee at $20 a day, the defendants having expressly refused to sign such a stipulation, and the referee was entitled to no more than his legal fees,\u2014$10 a day. This he was allowed by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The appeal is therefore dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">1 PATTERSON, O\u2019BRIEN, and LAUGHLIN, JJ., concur; VAN BRUNT, P. J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
