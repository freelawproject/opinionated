Reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b849-13\">The first paragraph of the complaint was as follows: \u201c(1) That on or about the 18th day of August, 1899, the above-named plaintiff and the defendant herein entered into an agreement, wherein and whereby the said defendant, in consideration of this plaintiff entering into his employ and service, for the term and at the compensation hereinafter stated, agreed to employ and did employ the above-named plaintiff as a foreman in the said defendant\u2019s pants factory at No. 535 Broadway, in the city of New York, borough of Manhattan, for a term of one year, beginning from the above-named date, at a salary of ten hundred and forty ($1,040) dollars a year, payable in equal weekly payments of twenty ($20) dollars per week during said term; and said plaintiff, in consideration thereof, agreed <em>to ' </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>and did enter into the employ of the said defendant for said term at said compensation as hereinbefore stated, and thereupon entered upon his service, and continued in said employment and service until the 8th day of October, 1899.\u201d The second paragraph alleged a wrongful discharge. The first paragraph of the answer was as follows: \u201c(1) Defendant admits that the above-named plaintiff was employed in his factory at No. 535 Broadway, in the city of New York, borough of Manhattan, until the 8th day of October, 1899, but denies each and every allegation or parts of allegations contained in paragraph marked \u20181\u2019 of the first cause of action in plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint contained.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b850-4\">Argued before SCOTT, P.

In the main charge of the learned court no reference is made to this subject, but at plaintiff\u2019s request the court,charged in the following words: \u201cThere has been no denial of the contract on the pleadings.\u201d This was manifestly error, and left to the jury only the question as to whether or not the affirmative defenses pleaded in the answer were established. It amounted to a statement by the court that the contract, as set forth in the complaint, was admitted; and, indeed, in view of some of the rulings upon evidence, there is good ground for the contention that this was the general theory of the case adopted by the learned trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
