The complaint was verified, and the defendant served a verified answer, in which he set up as a first defense a general denial, as a second defense that he was a nonresident of the city of New York, and as a third defense that there had been a former litigation between the parties. The answer was subscribed by his attorneys in the customary form, without reservation, except that at the beginning of the answer it is stated that the defendant answers \u201cwithout conceding the jurisdiction of this court.\u201d It has recently been decided that an action in a municipal court against a nonresident defendant must be commenced by the service of the \u201cshort\u201d summons provided for by section 1369 of the Greater New York charter (Laws 1897, c. 378). But it has also been held tha subdivision 3 of section 1370 of the same charter, which provide that \u201cno person who shall have a place in said city for the regula transaction of business shall be deemed a nonresident, under the provisions of this title,\u201d creates an exception to section 1369, in tint it authorizes the commencement of an action against a nonresident who has a regular place of business within the city of New Yok bv the usual \u201clong\u201d summons such as was issued in the present jetton. Routenberg v. Schweitzer, 164 N. Y. 566, 58 N. E. 1092. Wbn such an action is commenced by a \u201clong\u201d summons formally sered upon the defendant within the said city, the residence of the lefendant, and the consequent jurisdiction of the court, will be resumed, without allegations or proof of residence. Sperry v. Maor, 1 E. D. Smith, 361. So, when a defendant objects that he shuld have been served by a short, instead of a long, summons, he rust show Ihe necessary facts to overcome the presumption that, irhis case, the long summons was the proper process. In other wrds, he must show both that he is a nonresident and that he has no lace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>within the said city for the regular transaction of business; for, if he be either a resident, or have such a place of business, he can be sued by a long summons. The defendant\u2019s plea of nonjurisdiction was defective, in that, while he alleged his nonresidence, he failed to allege that he had no place of business within the said city. Even if the defendant could not lawfully be sued by a \u201cshort\u201d summons, he did not take the objection properly, or in due season. If the service was void by reason of the defendant\u2019s nonresidence, it was as if he had never been served at all. Still, since the action was one which the municipal court had jurisdiction to entertain if properly begun, the defendant could waive any defect in the process, and submit himself to the jurisdiction. If he had not intended to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the court, he should have appeared specially for the purpose of raising the question of jurisdiction by motion, for, where the case is one in which the court can acquire jurisdiction by the proper service of a summons, the fact of nonservice or of defective service cannot be raised by answer. Reed v. Chilson, 142 N. Y. 152, 36 N. E. 884; Goldstein v. Goldsmith, 28 Misc. Rep. 569, 59 N. Y. Supp. 677. So far as concerns the merits, there was a sharp conflict of testimony, upon which the justice decided, as he had a right to do, in favor of the plaintiff. The nonproduction of the note by the plaintiff was sufficiently accounted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
