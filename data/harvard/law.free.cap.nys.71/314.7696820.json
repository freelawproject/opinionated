It was error for the court to charge that it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove Ms freedom from any contributory negligence such as might have brought about the accident. The correct rule of law is that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence must have contributed to the accident, and that negligence must be proximate and not remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-19\">It was further error in this case, in view of the defendant\u2019s story of how the accident happened (i. e., that the plaintiff jumped hack from a carriage against the shaft of the defendant\u2019s cart) fon the court to charge that the plaintiff was bound to show that the negligence was entirely the negligence of the defendant. It may he that the accident occurred by reason of the negligence of the driver in charge of the carriage passing by, and the negligence of the defendant\u2019s servant. All that the plaintiff was called upon to prove was that the accident occurred without negligence on his part contribu\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ing thereto, and because of the negligence on the part of the defendant.
