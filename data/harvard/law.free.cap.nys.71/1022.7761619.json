It appears from the record before us that the plaintiff\u2019s claim and judgment were correctly inserted as to amount and date in the schedules of the defendant in the proceedings in bankruptcy, but that, through a mere clerical error, the name of the plaintiff was given therein as George Liesman instead of George Liesum. It nowhere appears that there was any attempt made to conceal the indebtedness of the defendant on this judgment, and there was nothing in the record in the United States court to which our attention has been called indicating any fraud or concealment, or any design or intent on the part of the debtor to conceal or suppress the judgment in question; and, finding no reason to disturb the order made at special term, it follows that the same should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-17\">O\u2019DWYER, J., concurs with HASCALL, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
