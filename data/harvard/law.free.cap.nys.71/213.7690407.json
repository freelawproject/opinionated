The defendants admit making the agreement, deny the allegations of the complaint wherein it is alleged that the plaintiff has complied therewith, and deny the other material allegations of the complaint. This action being-in equity for an accounting, and the plaintiff\u2019s right to an accounting being denied, the defendants are entitled to have the question of the plaintiff\u2019s right to an accounting determined upon the trial at special term before a reference could be ordered to take the account. The issue in the action is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to an accounting. That issue does not require the examination of a long account, or bring the case within the provisions of the Code which authorize a compulsory reference. The accounting, if ordered, may he before a referee; but, until the right of the plaintiff to an accounting is determined, the examination of an account is not involved. We think, therefore, that the court was not justified in referring the issues in the action to he tried by a referee, and the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
