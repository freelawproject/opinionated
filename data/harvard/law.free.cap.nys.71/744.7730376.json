The order is affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">The second trial was submitted to the learned justice for decision by consent, the jury having failed to agree. He ordered judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $65. This was the reasonable value of the services of the plaintiff\u2019s physician, as testified to on the trial. Having thus succeeded upon the issue of negligence, the plaintiff is without any compensation for his own injuries, being only repaid the reasonable value of his doctor\u2019s services. This is an injustice, and cannot be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
