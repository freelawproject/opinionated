The case of Parmelee v. Surgeons, 9 Misc. Rep. 458, 30 N. Y. Supp. 250, is an authority directly in point. In that case the plaintiff sued upon a contract of employment, which he said he made with 0the treasurer of the defendant corporation, purporting to act for the company; and the court there held that where the contract is made in the name of a corporation, by its president, or by any one possessing apparent general executive power, and the contract is in furtherance of the business of the corporation, there is a presumption of authority, but the treasurer of a corporation is an agent with special powers merely, and cannot bind such corporation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the performance of acts without the scope and ordinary course of the duties of Ms office. The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
