He was doubtless entitled to a preference on either of two grounds, but could not urge a right to a statutory preference.for the reason that he could try his cause within an hour, nor vice versa. He claimed the right to advance a one-hour cause under subdivision 8 of the said section. He should have noticed and moved at trial term for advancement (People v. Kinney, 92 N. Y. 647; President, etc., v. Dunn, 13 Civ. Proc. R. 166), or else made his motion to have the cause placed upon the calendar of part 4 because on contract. Rule 14 of the city court cannot operate, nor was it promulgated, to overstep the practice ordained by the Code, but to provide a needful, additional relief in certain cases not specified in the statute. The amendatory order of May 13th became unavailing, and a second notice of trial did not cure plaintiff\u2019s infirmity of practice. Fox v. Quinn (Com. Pl.) 12 N. Y. Supp. 725. For- these reasons, the order of May 13th and of May 2, 1901, should be reversed, with one bill of costs and disbursements of appeal to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-15\">Order reversed, with one bill of costs of appeal to appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
