Therefore, if the moving cause of the woman\u2019s consent be a promise of marriage conditional upon her pregnancy, the defendant cannot be found guilty. People v. Van Alstyne, 144 N. Y. 361, 39 N. E. 343; People v. Duryea (Sup.) 30 N. Y. Supp. 877, approved in People v. Van Alstyne, supra. If a woman betrothed submit to her lover, the absolute promise implied in betrothment will not warrant his conviction for seduction if she yield in reliance on his special promise that he will marry her in case pregnancy follow the illicit relation. People v. Van Alstyne, supra. Though testimony was given in this case which would have justified the finding that the woman and the man were under engagement of marriage, this did not warrant the refusal of the request if there was testimony which fairly and reasonably would have justified the finding from the whole case that the inducement was the special and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>conditional promise. The prosecutrix testified that she engaged herself to the defendant early in June, 1900; that she had intercourse with him first at the close of that month, which was continued for some months; that she first told him of her condition in September, 1900, when she said that she \u201cwas in trouble.\u201d On cross-examination she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201cQ. Was this talk of getting married repeated on the night that he first had connection with you? A. Yes, sir. Q. What did he say then? A. He said if I got in any trouble, he could go out and work, and take care of me. Q. If he got you in trouble after connection, he would go out to work, and take care of you? A. Yes, sir. Q. And did you rely upon that statement in permitting him to have connection with you, that if you got in trouble he would marry you, and go to work, and take care of you? A. No, sir; we were engaged before that. Q. Did you pay any attention to what he said that night, that he would marry you and take care of you? A. Yes, sir. \u2022Q. Is that the reason why you permitted him to have connection with you,\u2014 his promise that if he got you into trouble he would take care of you? Is that what induced you to let him have connection with you? A. We were engaged first. Q. Is that promise what led him to have connection with you? A. Yes, sir. * * * The subsequent time that he had connection he did not renew that promise, that if I got into trouble he would marry me. Q. He said that only once? A. He said it often, but not after each time. Q. And did you rely upon that promise in permitting him to have connection with you? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">On redirect examination she also testified that she permitted him to have intercourse because of the engagement in June. I think that it cannot be said that there was no testimony which would have justified a finding from the whole case that the reliance of the woman was upon the conditional promise, and therefore I am of opinion that the exception was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Armstrong v. People, 70 N. Y. 38, cited by the learned district attorney, does not touch the question presented by this appeal, as appears both by page 53 of the reported case, and by the comments of Peckham, J., in Van Alstyne\u2019s Case, page 364, 144 N. Y., and page 343, 39 N. E. The judgment of conviction must be reversed for the error, and a new trial granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
