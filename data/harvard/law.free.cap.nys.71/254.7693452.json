Upon the trial the driver of the car was called as a witness for the plaintiff. On cross-examination the witness, after testifying that he had made a statement concerning the accident which the bookkeeper of defendant wrote down, but which the witness did not sign, was shown a statement, which he admitted had been subscribed by him in the presence of one Stansbury, who presented the statement to him at the company\u2019s office. The statement purported to have been subscribed and sworn to before Stansbury as a commissioner of deeds. The witness was then asked, \u201cAnd what did he (meaning Stansbury) say to you before you signed it?\u201d The question was objected to by plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cas calling for incompetent evidence.\u201d The objection was sustained, and defendant duly excepted. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel thereupon said, \u201cIf the evidence is offered to show that he (meaning Stansbury) swore him, I consent to the question, but not to any general conversation,\u201d The official stenographer\u2019s original notes and his transcript therefrom show that the qualification of the objection of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to this question was made after the ruling of the court, and after defendant had taken an exception. There is no dispute that plaintiffs, counsel modified his objection to the question as herein stated, and that such modification was not made until after the ruling and exception on the original unqualified objection to the evidence as incompetent. In defendant\u2019s proposed case and exceptions the ruling of the court and defendant's exception were inserted after both the objection to the question and the qualification or modification of such objection. Plaintiff, by an appropriate amendment to the proposed case, sought to have the qualification or modification of the objection inserted after the ruling and exception in accordance with the fact as to the time it was made. The trial judge, instead of allowing this amendment, on his own motion struck out altogether the said statement of plaintiff\u2019s counsel made after the ruling and exception. Plaintiff thereupon moved for a resettlement of the case in accordance with his proposed amendment. The motion was denied, and plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The cross-examination of the witness printed in the record before us indicated that he testified that the car brake was out of repair, and that its defective condition had been reported to the company prior to the accident. It is manifest, therefore, that it is important to the plaintiff to have the records show that he withdrew his objection to the question to the extent of allowing it to be shown that the witness was duly sworn. The record should show the various steps and proceedings in their order upon the trial, and plaintiff was, therefore, also entitled to have the statement inserted at its proper place in accordance with Ms proposed amendment. Cooley v. Trustees, 36 App. Div. 520, 55 N. Y. Supp. 832. The Code now expressly provides that such an order is appealable. Code Civ. Proc. S 13-1T, as amended by chapter 916, Laws' 1895. The statement excluded may have a material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>bearing on the question as to whether the ruling and exception, with reference to which it was made constitute reversible error, and, there being no dispute about the facts, and nothing in the order to show that the recollection of the trial judge in any manner differs from the official stenographer\u2019s record, the motion for a resettlement should have been granted. Zimmer v. Railroad Co., 28 App. Div. 504, 51 N. Y. Supp. 247; Gleason v. Smith, 34 Hun, 547; Rubber Co. v. Rothery, 112 N. Y. 592, 20 N. E. 546; Id., 119 N. Y. 633, 23 N. E. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The order appealed from should he reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion to resettle the case in accordance with plaintiff\u2019s twenty-eighth proposed amendment granted, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
