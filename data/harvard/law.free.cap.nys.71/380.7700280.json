Upon the day fixed for the examination, a statement in writing, sworn to by an officer of the Mutual Beserve Association, was presented, showing the property which it had received, and purporting to state the rights which that association had therein; and annexed was a copy of the agreement under which the association obtained the property formerly belonging to the judgment debtor, of the value of $294,-168.77, the title to which it claims by virtue of the provisions of said agreement. The affidavit thus concludes: \u201cThat it [the Mutual Beserve Association] has received from said Northwestern Life Assurance Company no other property; that it has in its possession or under its control no property belonging to the said * * * company, and it is not indebted to said * * * company in any sum of money whatever.\u201d This was met by the affidavit of one of the attorneys for the judgment creditor, who stated that the summary of the property received, together with the other averments of the affidavit \u201care false and evasive, and that they do not fully and truly set forth the character and bona fides of the transfer * * * of the judgment debtor\u2019s property, or of the assets thereby received\u201d; and the opposing affidavit contains additional statements of what the judgment creditor desires to obtain from the examination. Upon this showing the special term ordered \u201cthat further examination of the said Mutual Beserve Fund Life Association as such third party be, and the same hereby is, denied.\u201d From such order the judgment creditor appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b412-17\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

Cases can be found, based on the language of the old Code, which sanction such a practice, some of which are referred to in the memorandum of the learned judge at special term; but, in view of the provisions of the present Code of Civil Procedure, we do not think that the practice can be supported. The language employed in section 2441 of the Code is that \u201cthe judgment creditor is entitled to an order requiring that person or corporation to attend and be examined concerning the debt or other property.\u201d This language, it will be noticed, is similar to that used in section 2435 of the Code of Civil Procedure,\u2014which relates to the order for the examination of the judgment debtor,\u2014that the judgment creditor \u201cis entitled to an order requiring the debtor under the judgment or order to attend and be examined concerning his property.\u201d And in section 2444 of the Code it is provided: \u201cUpon an examination under this article * * * either party may be examined as a witness in his own behalf, and may produce and examine other witnesses, as upon the trial of an action.\u201d Evidently this last section embraces the examination both of the judgment debtor and a third party, because both are \u201cunder this article\u201d; and thus the distinction which existed by reason of the language employed under the former Code between the examination of a judgment debtor and a third party has been eliminated. To emphasize this view, we have in the present Code an entirely new provision in section 2460, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\u201cA party or witness examined in a special proceeding authorized by this article is not excused from answering a question on the ground * * * that he or another person claims to be entitled as against the judgment creditor, or a receiver appointed or to be appointed in a special proceeding, to hold property, derived from or through the judgment creditor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The examination, therefore, which is now allowed of a third party to whom property of the debtor has been transferred, is as full and extensive as of the judgment debtor himself, and the right which the creditor has to such an examination cannot be taken away by the presentation of a statement by the third person as to his relations concerning the property, even though such statement be sworn to, for the reason that it is not, in our opinion, the equivalent of the examination allowed by the Code. The right which, in express language, is given, is to examine the third party; and, although it was within the power of the court to prevent such right of examination being abused, and which power should be exercised, it was not within its power to take away or to limit that right in the way here sought to be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The order appealed from should accordingly be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the order for the examination of the third party should be reinstated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
