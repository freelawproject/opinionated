The defendant-defaulted, and the case was tried on September 21, 1900, the justice rendering a simple money judgment. On May 29, 1901, the-justice and the attorneys for the plaintiff signed a stipulation that' the return should be amended so as to read that plaintiff complainedi of defendant in \u201cconversion,\u201d and that the words \u201cgoods sold and; delivered\u201d in said return be stricken out. This was long subsequent: to the appeal, which was taken on October 1, 1900. The appeal by the plaintiff is taken in order to procure an amendment of the judgment so that it shall state that the defendant is subject to arrest and imprisonment. The appeal cannot prevail. The plaintiff might, doubtless have originally sued in conversion, but he elected to suey as he had a right to do, for goods sold and delivered, and the judgement rendered followed precisely the complaint. It is too late after-a cause has gone to judgment, without notice to the defendant, by a consent signed merely by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and the justice^, to amend the complaint, and upon such an amendment base an appeal for the amendment of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">The judgment must be affirmed-, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
