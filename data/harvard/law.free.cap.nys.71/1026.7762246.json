It was the direct issue involved, under the defendant\u2019s pleading. Mrs. Beilly is not an interested party, to be precluded from testifying, under section 829 of the Code of Civil Procedure,\u2014is not a party at all, nor \u201ca person from, through or under whom such a party * * derives his interest.\u201d The bank, it appears, in no way succeeded to her title, and she is not \u201cinterested in the event,\u201d within the meaning of the statute, and could not be bound by the judgment, whichever way it should go. For these reasons, her testimony was competent. Hobart v. Hobart, 62 N. Y. 80; Nearpass v. Gilman, 104 N. Y. 507, 10 N. E. 894; Wallace v. Straus, 113 N. Y. 242, 21 N. E. 66. Judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-15\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-16\">O\u2019DWYEB, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
