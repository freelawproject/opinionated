A motion was made to change the place of trial to the county .of Steuben because of the convenience of witnesses. That motion was granted upon condition that, \u201cif the plaintiff so elects, a referee is to be appointed to hear, try, and determine the issues herein, with power to take testimony in the county of Steuben and in the county of Onondaga.\u201d From the portion .of the order imposing this condition the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">There is no doubt that the order is appealable. Nor is there any question that the defendant, not having accepted the order, is at liberty to appeal from any part or all of it, if he sees fit. In re New York Cent. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 60 N. Y. 112. A motion to change the place of trial of an action for the convenience of witnesses rests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>largely in the discretion of the court at special term. Lane v. Town of Hancock (Sup.) 9 N. Y. Supp. 97. In such a case there is no doubt of the power of the court to impose certain conditions upon granting the order. In re Waverly Waterworks Co., 85 N. Y. 478. So long as those conditions involve only the conduct of the action and matters of procedure which the court would have the power to regulate,\u2014such as the taking of testimony de bene esse, requiring a stipulation to be made as to certain facts, or the imposition of motion costs,\u2014there is no doubt that, they rest largely in the discretion of the court, and the imposition of them will not usually be reviewed. But where the court undertakes, as a condition of granting the order, to require a party to stipulate away an absolute right, which is substantial in its nature, it goes outside of its power. The right of trial by jury in an action of this kind is absolute, and it is one of which a party cannot be deprived in the discretion of a judge (Kain v. Delano, 11 Abb. Prac. (N. S.) 29), and actions cannot be sent to a referee for trial without the consent of the parties, except in cases where the statute expressly authorizes it. The court has no power to impose, as a condition of granting a favor, that the party should waive this constitutional right. So much of the order, therefore, as has been appealed from, should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
