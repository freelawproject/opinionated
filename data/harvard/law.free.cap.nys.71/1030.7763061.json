To maintain this action against the defendant, a corporation organized under the laws of the state <em>o\u00ed </em>Mew Jersey, after the debt for which the notes were given was incurred, it is claimed that at the time of the giving of the notes in suit the president and the secretary and treasurer of the defendant corporation stated <em>to </em>the plaintiffs that the notes in suit were the notes of the defendant, and that the form in which they were signed was the form used by the defendant for signing its notes, and that the Union Cloak Company and the Union Cloak &amp; Suit Company, this defendant, were the same; that by reason of these statements the notes are the notes of the defendant, and it is liable thereon. The debt for which the notes were given was contracted prior to the time that the defendant corporation had a legal existence, and the record fails to disclose any evidence showing that this defendant received any benefit from the goods purchased by the Union Cloak Company, and it appears that no other or further consideration is claimed as having been given for the notes in suit. It follows that the defendant is not liable upon these notes, and the judgment and order herein appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
