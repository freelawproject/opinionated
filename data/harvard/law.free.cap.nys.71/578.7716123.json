J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkV\">It appears, though somewhat obscurely, that the relator held the position of street commissioner of the village of Dobbs Ferry for the year ending March 25, 1901. In his petition he alleges that on that day he applied to the' respondents, composing the village board, \"for its appointment of him as street commissioner for said defendant village, in whom .the appointment to such office of street commissioner is vested by said village law.\u201d The board re-fused to appoint him, and appointed Michael J. Francis to the office, and he applied for a peremptory writ of mandamus, requiring the village board of trustees to appoint him to such position. He alleges that-his application for appointment stated that he was an honorably discharged soldier of the late Civil War, and that the board refused to give him the preference provided by the constitution and by section 20 of the White law (chapter 370, Laws 1899), and appointed Francis, who was not an honorably discharged soldier, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>sailor, or marine. The answer of Gfilespie, president of the village board, alleges that Francis, in his application for appointment, set forth that he was a veteran volunteer fireman, and entitled to preference in appointment. The court denied the motion for the writ, and the relator appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Francis was not made a party to the proceeding, and this was held to be a fatal defect by the old general term of this department in People v. Wendell (Sup.) 10 N. Y. Supp. 587. Section 43 of the village law (chapter 414, Laws 1897) provides that the term of office of the street commissioner shall be one official year. The relator\u2019s term of office expired on March 25th. Consequently, it cannot be held that the action of the board was a removal from office. The board was called upon to newly fill an office, and between two persons entitled to preference in appointment,\u2014the one a veteran soldier, and the other a veteran fireman,\u2014it selected the latter. The White law does not compel the board in such a case to give the veteran soldier the preference, and the board had the power to exercise the right of selection. With that choice we cannot interfere. The order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
