The action was for false imprisonment. From the papers used on the motion, there is no doubt that the plaintiff was arrested in Saratoga county by the defendant, who was deputy sheriff of Warren county, and was by him carried therefrom to and imprisoned in the jail of Warren county. As part of the cause of action, therefore, arose in Saratoga county, the action was properly brought there (section 983, Code Civ. Proc.), and the defendant was not entitled to a change of venue on the ground on which motion was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-16\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
