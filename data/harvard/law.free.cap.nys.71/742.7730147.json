The contract, which was dated November 26, 1899, authorizes the .plaintiff to insert the defendants\u2019 advertising card in certain street surface cars \u201cfor a term of twelve months, commencing December <em>1st, </em>1899.\u201d The contract contained the following danse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>\u201cPosner Bros, reserve the right to discontinue this contract at the end of three months, by giving the Railway Advertising Company 30 days\u2019 previous written notice, and paying $25 per month additional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The contract thus, by its terms, began to run on December 1, 1899, and was to continue tor one year, unless terminated in the manner therein prescribed. It could be discontinued only at the end of three months from the commencement of the term, or on March 1, 3.909, and then only by giving the plaintiff 30 days\u2019 previous written notice. Thirty days prior to March 1, 1900, would have been January 30th. No such notice was given. On January 31st the defendants wrote to the plaintiff, requesting it to take their cards from the cars, and to keep them out for one month. On February 1, 1900, defendants wrote to the plaintiff, \u201cWe again notify you to discontinue our contract for advertisement in cars ending March 5th.\u201d Neither of these notices was effectual to end the contract, because neither was given thirty days before the expiration of three months after the commencement of the term. The letter of January 31st did not purport to be a cancellation of the contract, but merely a notice to keep the cards out for one month. The letter of February 1st, in addition to being too late, did not undertake to terminate the contract on March 1st, three months after the expiration of the term, but on a later date. The justice, under exception by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, submitted to the jury the question whether, by consent or acquiescence of the parties, the time for the commencement of the contract had been extended to December 5, 1899. There was no competent evidence to justify such a contention on the part of the defendants, and the submission of the question was error. The contract itself provided as follows: \u201cCards to be furnished by advertiser, and, in case of delay of copy or cards, it shall be at .the advertiser\u2019s loss.\u201d The cards were not furnished until December 5th, but there was no evidence that the plaintiff would not have been able to place them in the cars if they had been received by December 1st. The defendant testified that when he made the contract he said to \u25a0one of the plaintiff\u2019s officers, \u201cHow about printing?\u201d to which the officer replied, \u201cI will send you a printer.\u201d It appeared that the officer in question telephoned a printer to call on Mr. Posner, and that he did so at once, and received an order to print the cards. It was owing to delay in the printing of the cards that they were not ready to be inserted in the cars until December 6th. There is certainly nothing in this testimony to charge the plaintiff with the printer\u2019s fault, if he was in fault, in not having the cards printed in time. The plaintiff did not stipulate that it should select the printer, or \u25a0even advise the defendants to employ any particular printer, but, more as a friendly act, at defendants\u2019 suggestion, sent a printer with whom the defendants might or might not make a contract. There was nothing to justify leaving the question of the extension of the contract to the jury, and, for the error in so doing, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
