In defendant\u2019s opposing affidavit, which it was claimed was not contradicted, it was contended that plaintiff was in possession of documentary evidence essential to the defense, and purposely kept his name out of the commission, to put obstacles in the way of defendant\u2019s examining him or obtaining the use of such evidence.
