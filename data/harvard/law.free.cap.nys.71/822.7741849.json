For this plaintiff was given and received $10 term costs. The court at trial term did not judicially examine the issues on the facts, and those arising on the pleadings were sent to special term to be changed or corrected, if proper, \u2022on motion therefor. At least, that is what we gather from the meager record submitted; and hence this was not a trial within the meaning of the authorities defining just what shall be considered such. Just how \u201cthe .judge sitting at special term promptly set aside the verdict,\u201d neither the papers submitted nor counsel have explained. The taxation of but two trial fees was very evidently quite correct, and the order appealed from should \u25a0be affirmed, with costs and disbursements.

Upon the first trial a verdict in favor of the plaintiff was rendered, and, upon his motion, was set aside on the ground of insufficient damages. Upon the second trial a juror was withdrawn at defendants\u2019 request, to enable them to apply at special term for leave to amend the answer. The third trial resulted in a verdict for plaintiff for the full amount. The clerk taxed only two trial fees, issues of fact. A motion for a retaxation was denied, and upon appeal to the general term of the city court from the order entered upon this decision the \u25a0said order was affirmed. This was error. It has been frequently held that the withdrawal of a juror in the progress of a trial did not affect the right of the successful party to the taxation of costs. Gilroy v. Badger, 28 Misc. Rep. 144, 58 N. Y. Supp. 1106; Hudson v. Railroad Co., 57 App. Div. 99, 68 N. Y. Supp. 28. The order appealed from reversed, with costs and disbursements, and retaxation ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-17\">Order reversed, with costs, and retaxation ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
