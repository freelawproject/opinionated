Appeal by defendant from an order granting plaintiff\u2019s motion to open his default before a referee appointed to determine questions arising on a motion made by plaintiff to substitute the Metropolitan Street-Railway Company for the Metropolitan Traction Company as defendant herein, upon the ground (hat service was intended to be made upon the former company, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>also from an order entered at the same time and place denying defendant\u2019s motion (1.) to confirm the report of the referee on said reference, and (2) for the denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend his complaint, and to have defendant\u2019s said motion referred to the justice presiding when the order of reference was granted, the motion having been adjourned pending the reference. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-5\">The action is brought to recover \u00a725,000 damages sustained by plaintiff, and. alleged to have been caused by the neglect in the operation by defendant of a street car on Sixth avenue, between Ninth and Tenth streets, on the 4'th day of March, 1896. According to an affidavit presented by defendant, the action was commenced on the 23d day of June, 1896, by the service of a summons, and the complaint was not served until nearly four months thereafter; but an affidavit presented by the plaintiff shows that the action was not commenced until the 10th day of October, 1896, and that the summons and complaint were served together. The summons was served upon Daniel B. Hasbrouck at the office of the Metropolitan Street-Railway Company, he then being its vice president. Issue was joined on the 9th or 19th day of November, 1896, according to whether the affidavit presented by the defendant or that presented by the plaintiff is correct. There have been three substitutions of attorneys for the plaintiff. At the time this action was commenced, each of these companies owned and operated a line of street railway in the city of New York. Henry A. Robinson, who appeared for the Metropolitan Traction Company herein, was attorney for both. The order of reference was granted on the 16th day of September, and entered on the 18th day of September, 1899, and motion was adjourned pending the reference. The first hearing was had on February 15th thereafter. On May 31st, after several hearings and 19 adjournments, plaintiff defaulted, his attorney having previously withdrawn from the case. At this time an adjournment - was had, at the request of an attorney who contemplated being substituted for plaintiff, until the 7th day of June, at which time, on defendant\u2019s motion, the reference was declared closed. On the 31st day of December, 1900, plaintiff\u2019s counsel made a motion before the referee to open the default. This motion was granted on the 6th day of February, 1901, upon condition that plaintiff pay to defendant\u2019s attorney the sum of \u00a725 on or before the 12th of that month; and the reference was adjourned until the 14th day of February, at which time, the costs not having been paid, plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved for an adjournment to February 21st to give plaintiff an opportunity to comply with the terms of the order, and stated that he had been informed by his client that the latter would have the money on the 15th. The motion was denied, and on defendant\u2019s motion the reference was declared closed. The referee made and signed his report on the 18th of February, wherein he found that plaintiff had failed to establish the facts set forth in his moving papers. The report was filed on the 19th day of March, and the notice of motion to confirm the same was served on the 23d day of March, 1901, returnable on the 28th of the same month. The motion was adjourned at the instance of plaintiff until the 8th of April, 1901, at which time an order to show cause why the default should not be opened, obtained by plaintiff on .the 6th of April, was made returnable. It appeared that defendant, after plaintiff\u2019s last default, paid the fees of the referee, amounting to the sum of \u00a7200, and took up the report. An affidavit presented by defendant shows that proceedings for the voluntary dissolution of the Metropolitan Traction Company were taken on the 16th day of September, 1897, but it does not appear whether a final order has been entered thereon.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b322-6\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

This inexcusable delay of the trial of the issues, and unjustifiable expense to the litigants, warrant the court in again expressing its disapproval of references to determine controverted questions of fact arising upon motion, except very exceptional cases, where the facts are complicated, and it is manifest that the truth cannot be ascertained with reasonable certainty without an examination of the witnesses. We think the case could and should have been disposed of without a reference. If the plaintiff\u2019s' affidavit did not sufficiently present the facts, his motion might have been denied without prejudice to a renewal thereof; and, if those presented by defendant were insufficient, the motion might have been continued, and an opportunity afforded to supplement them.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">As the statute of limitations would be a bar to an action now commenced against the railway company, we think justice to the plaintiff, notwithstanding the gross laches of his former attorneys, requires that he be permitted to proceed to a hearing upon the merits of his motion to amend. The plaintiff, however, should have made his motion before defendant, acting upon the default, paid the referee\u2019s fees.' The order, therefore, should be modified by requiring that defendant be reimbursed the amount of the referee\u2019s fees and $10 costs of the motion, in addition to the $25 allowed by the special term, and by further providing that $10, costs of this appeal, and the disbursements thereon, be awarded to defendant, to abide the final award of costs in the action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
