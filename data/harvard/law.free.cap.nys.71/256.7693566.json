The order required the plaintiff to give a bill of particulars specifying the number o\u00ed the defendant\u2019s car and the direction in which it was and had been moving, and the name and numbers of the conductor and gripman in charge thereof. We do not think the court below was justified in compelling the plaintiff to give the particulars above specified, as the plaintiff never got upon the car. It cannot be assumed that she knew the number of the car or the names or numbers of the conductor and gripman, and she expressly denies such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>knowledge. She was also required to specify in what respect she was seriously injured. We do not think the plaintiff should be compelled to specify by a bill of particulars the injury complained of, its nature, location, and extent. We think the court below correctly ordered an itemized statement of the expense that the plaintiff was put to for medical and surgical appliances; but we think the particulars should be confined to such a statement, and that the plaintiff should not be compelled to furnish the defendant with the names and addresses of the physicians, the number of visits, and the other particulars specified in the fourth subdivision of the defendant\u2019s demand. As to the fifth subdivision, we think the court correctly required the plaintiff to state the number of weeks that she was confined to her bed as alleged in the fourth paragraph of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The order should be modified by requiring plaintiff to give the particulars of the expense to which she was put for medical and surgical attendance, appliances, and medicines, and the number of weeks during which she was confined to her bed as alleged in the fourth subdivision of the complaint, and as modified affirmed, without costs. All concur..</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
