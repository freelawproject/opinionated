The warranty was, \u201cWarranted kind and sound in all harness, and good wind.\u201d On the evening of the sale, plaintiff, who is a liveryman, hitched the horse to a hansom cab, and, after driving him a little, turned him over to one of his drivers. This was about half past 6. The driver made three calls with the horse, and about 1 o\u2019clock in the morning he and the plaintiff, who was driving another cab, went to supper together. After supper they started for the plaintiff\u2019s stable on West Thirty-Ninth street, New York City. The plaintiff, on his cab, was behind the cab to which was hitched the warranted horse. When they were between Eighth and Ninth avenues, the warranted horse began to run. The plaintiff whipped up his horse, and managed to pass and get in front of the runaway, so as to stop it. The cab was somewhat injured. The plaintiff returned the horse to the auctioneer, and was tendered back the sum he had paid, but refused to accept it, saying that he proposed to collect further damages. There is nothing in the evidence to show what caused the runaway. It appears that there was a passenger in the cab at the time, but neither he nor the driver were called as witnesses, nor was any attempt made to explain or account for their absence. Former owners of the horse were called, who testified that the horse was kind and had never been known to run away. It was further testified to by persons expert in such matters that the horse was unusually tall and long in the body, and that a horse of such conformation was not well adapted for use in the ordinary hansom cab, unless exceptionally long shafts were used. The warranty in the present case was not a specific warranty that the horse was suitable to be driven before a hansom cab, but merely that he was kind and sound in all harness. We do not think that the evidence justified a finding that the warranty had been broken. All that appeared was that, after the horse had been safely driven for several hours, he ran away. Absolutely no evidence is offered to show how he came to run, and neither the driver, nor the passenger, who may be supposed to know something of the circumstances, have been called upon to state them. It is a fair inference from the failure to call or account for the absence of the driver that his testimony, if produced, would not have added anything to the strength of the plaintiff\u2019s case. Milliman v. Railway Co., 3 App. Div. 109, 39 N. Y. Supp. 274; Cushman v. De Mallie, 46 App. Div. 379, 61 N. Y. Supp. 878. We have, therefore, as the sole evidence of a breach of warranty, the unexplained fact that the horse ran away. This, in our opinion, was not sufficient, in the face of the positive evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>deuce of the horse\u2019s previous gentleness, and of the necessity, owing to his visible conformation, to especial care in hitching him to the particular vehicle in which it was attempted to use him. The horse having been redelivered to and accepted by the seller, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the purchase price. The judgment will be affirmed, without costs, if the plaintiff stipulates to reduce it to the sum of $33.37, and that $10 of the costs already paid to plaintiff shall be applied to the payment of said judgment; otherwise, the judgment will be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Judgment affirmed, without costs, if plaintiff stipulate to reduce it to the sum of $33.37; otherwise, judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
