The answer contains a general denial, a plea of misjoinder of parties defendant, and a counterclaim in favor of the defendant Mary Blair for $100 for services rendered. On the trial it was stipulated that the matters litigated are between the plaintiff and the defendant; Mary Blair individually, and by consent of the parties the action was dismissed as to the defendant David Blair, and continued between the plaintiff and the defendant Mary Blair. On June 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>1900, the justice rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant Mary Blair against the plaintiff for $15.31 damages and $4.75 costs; total, $20.06. On June 30th a notice of appeal in an action entitled, \u201cJustice Court. Herbert B. Jerry, Plaintiff, against Mary Blair and David Blair, Defendants,\u201d was served by the defendants, stating that the defendants, Mary Blair and David Blair, appeal to the county court of Clinton county \u201cfrom the judgment rendered in the above-entitled action in favor of the defendants against the plaintiff, June 13, 1900, for 20 and o/ioo dollars damages and costs, and demands a new trial in the appellate court.\u201d On December 1st the attorney for the defendants served a notice of trial for December 18th, and thereafter the attorneys for the plaintiff, specially appearing for the motion, served notice of motion for that day to dismiss the pretended appeal.

There was no such judgment as the one from which the appeal purports to be taken. Concededly, the action brought in the justice\u2019s court against the respondents jointly was, -by consent of parties, dismissed and discontinued as to the defendant David Blair, and continued as against the defendant Mary Blair, in whose favor alone judgment was rendered by the justice. The defendant\u2019s counsel contends that the service of the notice of appeal was the commencement of a new action in the county court; that the action which in the justice\u2019s court was discontinued as against David Blair was revived by the appeal as against him. This is unsound. The Code of Civil Procedure does not provide for the commencement of an action in the county court by an appeal, but rather for the transfer to that court of an action in which a judgment has been rendered in a justice\u2019s court. The new trial in the county court is on the issues formed by the pleadings in the justice\u2019s court, and the parties are the same as they were when the judgment was rendered. David Blair had no right of appeal. He had ceased to be a party to the action, and was not \u201caggrieved by the judgment.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3045. The disposition of the motion by the county court is an injustice to the plaintiff, who, by an offer to compromise, under section 3070 of the Code, could have protected himself against the costs of a trial in the county court if the defendant Mary Blair had appealed from the judgment rendered; whereas, under the decision made, the new trial would inevitably result in costs against him, as he has no claim against the defendants jointly. If the counsel for the defendants, on the motion to dismiss his appeal, had asked for relief by reason of any mistake or inadvertence of his, that court- would undoubtedly have permitted an amendment of the notice of appeal. But no such relief was asked for. He there insisted, as he does here, that his practice was regular, and he must accept the consequences. The order appealed from should be reversed, and the motion to dismiss the appeal should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
