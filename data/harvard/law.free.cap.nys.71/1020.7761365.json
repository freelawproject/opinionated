From the evidence it appears that the plaintiff\u2019s wife attempted to cross Second avenue, in the borough of Manhattan, from west to east, on the north side of Thirty-First street; that she stopped at the curbstone on the northwest corner, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>looked <em>to </em>see if the way was clear, and could not see any car. She says on her direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-5\">\u201cI was coining out from the butcher shop, and I stopped at the curbstone of the sidewalk, and I looked up. I saw no car coming, and I went over easy to the avenue. There behind the elevator, I could see no car, and the car was not ringing, and was coming too fast without ringing a bell; and X made a step, and the car catched my clothes, broke my leg, dragged me down. The car just came and hit me. He was too quick, and came like the wind, and tore my clothes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">After all the plaintiff\u2019s evidence was in, the plaintiff\u2019s wife was recalled, and, in answer to questions by the court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-7\">\u201cI was first on the sidewalk. I went down on the sidewalk from the curbstone, down with the avenue, and there I was looking up, and I saw no car. Then I walked very slowly to the avenue, and I come right between the two elevated posts, and I was looking up, and I could see no car. Something must be before me. Q. How far were you from the track when you last looked? A. Oh, well, I was always three or four feet away. Q. Three or four 'feet away from the track? A. Yes, sir. Q. Then what did you do? A. I don\u2019t see the car, and I made an easy step, and I wanted to go ahead, and the fender catched my clothes, dragged me down; my leg broke,\u2014my ankle. Q. The last time you looked you said was when you were three or four feet away from the track? A. Yes, sir. Q. Then you made an easy step? A. Yes, sir. Q. And got onto the track? A. No, sir. Q. How far from the track? A. Well, I was always\u2014 I can\u2019t say; about so far. (Witness indicated with her cane.) <em>Q. </em>You were that far from the track,\u2014about two feet? A. Yes, sir. Q. And then that car came right on you? A. The car was so quick, without ringing a bell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">This evidence undoubtedly made a case for the submission to the jury of the questions of defendant\u2019s negligence and the wife\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence. The fact that the wife was injured when two feet away from the track of the defendant, which position she had to reach after arriving at the elevated post, before being able to see whether a car was approaching or not, clearly made a case, within the authorities, for the jury to pass upon. The cases of Schwarzbaum v. Railroad Co., 54 App. Div. 166, 66 N. Y. Supp. 367, and Mitchell v. Same, 62 App. Div. 371, 70 N. Y. Supp. 1118, sustain these views. Judgment and order appealed from reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
