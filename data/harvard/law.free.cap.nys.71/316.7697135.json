Being in default, it was. well within the discretion of the special term to impose, as a condition for compelling the acceptance of the defendant\u2019s answer, the payment of costs and the giving of security. Furthermore, it appears that the defendant has complied with the terms of the order, by paying the costs as taxed in the judgment roll and serving his answer. By submitting to the terms of the order, the defendant waived his right to appeal therefrom. Order appealed from affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-18\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
