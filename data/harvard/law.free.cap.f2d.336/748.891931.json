On January 25, 1962 an informer telephoned police that Perry, his wife, and a cousin were selling narcotics near 14th and U Streets. The police went there and saw, across a crowded street, that in walking some twelve blocks the trio stopped several <em>times to </em>talk to people and that these included known addicts. Twice an officer saw an \u201cexchange of something\u201d with a known addict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>The police arrested appellant and his companions. On the way to the police station an officer saw Perry drop a glas-sine bag on the floor of the wagon. It proved to contain heroin. At the station the arresting officer filled out an \u201caddict form\u201d which Perry signed. It contained admissions that he dropped the narcotics and that he had a 12 capsule a day habit. The form was introduced in evidence at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">At appellant\u2019s trial, his counsel asked the police how the informer was paid, how he usually gave his tips, whether he was an addict, and what his relationship to the arresting officer was. The court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objections. The defense was allowed to bring out, without further detail, that the police had received \u201cabout three\u201d other tips in three months from this informer. On re-direct an officer testified that these previous tips had \u201cproven reliable\u201d. But the defense was not allowed to inquire about the nature and circumstances of these previous tips, what the informer\u2019s compensation was, or whether he was an addict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Seeing Perry \u201cexchange * * * something\u201d with a known addict, though not \u201ctotally innocuous\u201d, <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was not probable cause for Perry\u2019s arrest. We must therefore consider the informer\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 115-116, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 1514, 12 L.Ed.2d 723, 729 (1964), held that an affidavit on which a magistrate issued a search warrant \u201cdid not provide a sufficient basis for a finding of probable cause and that the evidence obtained as a result of the search warrant was inadmissible in petitioner\u2019s trial.\u201d The Court said that when an affidavit is \u201cbased on hearsay information * * * the magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were, <em>and </em>some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant, * * * was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable.\u2019 \u201d 378 U.S. at 114, 84 S.Ct. at 1514, 12 L.Ed.2d at 729. (Emphasis added.) Though those words are not directly applicable to this case, since this case turns on a police officer\u2019s determination of probable cause and not a magistrate\u2019s determination, the Court\u2019s words suggest that in such a case as this the trial court should permit inquiry into the two named sorts of \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d. The Court said: \u201cwhen a search is based upon a magistrate\u2019s, rather than a police officer\u2019s determination of probable cause, the reviewing courts will accept evidence of a less \u2018judicially competent or persuasive character than would have justified an officer in acting on his own without a warrant\u2019 \u201d ; citing Jones v. United States, <em>supra, </em>362 U.S. 257, 271, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>At appellant\u2019s trial no questions were asked about the \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d from which the informant concluded that the Perrys were selling narcotics.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the record contained only the policemen\u2019s testimony to their own observations and their statements that the informer was reliable, a finding of probable cause might perhaps be sustained, but the record shows that the court prevented the defense from inquiring into the \u201cunderlying circumstances from which the officers concluded that the informant * * * was \u2018credible\u2019.\u201d The questions the defense sought to ask might have elicited information that would have affected the trial court\u2019s decision on the question of probable cause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And if the questions had been permitted, the defense might well have gone on to the other line of inquiry suggested in <em>Aguilar, </em>namely, the basis for the informer\u2019s belief. Where, as here, the informer\u2019s reliability is relevant to the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion, we think the court should permit inquiry into both kinds of \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d to which <em>Aguilar </em>refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">When Perry was arrested he was taken directly to the narcotics squad office at police headquarters. The arresting officer testified that Perry asked to see a lawyer but that the line-up sheet, booking, and \u201caddict form\u201d had to be completed first. In addition to routine questions such as name, aliases, and parents, the addict form asks questions about addiction, such as how many capsules are taken and how they are taken. Under a heading \u201cRemarks (including a brief summary of the circumstances of the arrest)\u201d, this was written on appellant\u2019s form: \u201cOn the way to police headquarters on Wagon No. 2 he took from his right overcoat pocket a cellophane bag and dropped it on the floor of the wagon. 'This bag was recovered immediately by Detective Joseph W. Somerville and was found to contain 9 gelatine capsules containing a white powder. Subject admitted they were his and stated they were for his own use.\u201d Perry signed the form under the words \u201cI have read both sides of this sheet and find the statements herein to be true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Although the statement written on the addict form seems to imply that Perry admitted ownership while he was in the wagon on the way to headquarters, this implication cannot be intended, because the officer testified that Perry then denied he dropped the bag. His admission of ownership came later, in response to questioning at headquarters while the form was being filled out, and therefore was not a \u201cthreshold confession\u201d. The form was completed about an hour and a half after Perry was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">Though a policeman testified that use of the addict form is common and may help other agencies that deal with addicts, and the police keep a list of addicts, a form filled out as appellant\u2019s was is a confession. The \u201cordinary administrative steps required to bring a suspect before the nearest available magistrate\u201d do not include the obtaining and record<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number><em>ing </em>of confessions. Since the confession was obtained during unnecessary delay in presenting appellant before a magistrate, it should have been excluded under the <em>Mallory </em>rule, Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 453, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957). The police may not take a suspect to a station \u201cin order to carry out a process of inquiry that lends itself * * * to eliciting damaging statements to support the arrest and ultimately his guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 77 S.Ct. at 1359.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The government does not deny that the <em>Mallory </em>rule was violated,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but says the point was not raised at trial and cites White v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 238, 314 F.2d 243 (1962), and Williams v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 7, 303 F.2d 772, cert. denied, 369 U.S. 875, 82 S.Ct. 1145, 8 L.Ed.2d 277 (1962). These cases do not dispose of the matter. In each of them this court weighed the circumstances in deciding whether to invoke the plain error rule, 52(b), F.R.Crim.P., when the <em>Mallory </em>point had not been raised at trial. And in Lawson v. United States, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 332, 248 F.2d 654 (1957), we referred to \u201cour discretion\u201d in such a case. In the present case we think the <em>Mallory </em>point was effectively if indirectly called to the court\u2019s attention. Cf. Kramer v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 50, 317 F.2d 114 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">When the addict form was offered in evidence, defense counsel objected \u201cto any introduction of any document * * until it is shown that the Defendant was advised of his constitutional rights, was notified that he did not have to make a statement, that he was advised of his right to counsel, of his right to be brought speedily before a committing magistrate\u201d. Shortly after this the following colloquy occurred: \u201cThe Court: What about the question of whether or not there had been any lapse of time between the time of his arrest\u2014 Mr. Smithson [the prosecutor] : At the time of his arrest, he was taken into custody, and this statement was made up at the Narcotics Squad to which he was immediately taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">The following colloquy occurred at a hearing in the absence of the jury on the circumstances in which the form was executed: \u201cMr. Brown [defense counsel] : I will object, of course, to the introduction of this statement in evidence on the ground that the Defendant was not advised of his legal rights before he made the statement, he was not given an opportunity to have counsel for his guidance and assistance. The Court: What do you say, Mr. Smithson ? [The prosecutor] : I think, Your Honor, this even beats the test in Naples<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> * * * This was an arrest on probable cause, a statement made in the course of normal procedure. Your Honor will recall the language of the Mallory Rule, where in the course of preparing, in their administrative short processes, they secure such statements, that they would be admissible. This is the same type of situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-14\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-15\">. When pressed, the officer said first that one exchange \u201clooked like money\u201d and then that it was money. He did not re-rnember whether appellant took part in this exchange.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\">. \u201c[V]ery little attention has been paid to the veracity of drug addicts who are frequently used as stool pigeons in narcotics cases.

United States, 358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959), a previously reliable informer\u2019s tip bad been corroborated in detail by \u201cmatters in themselves totally innocuous\u201d. (Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 269-270, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (I960)). Probable cause was found. But the information on which the informer based his tip, the details of his previous tips, the basis of police belief in his reliability, and even his identity, were shown at Draper\u2019s trial. See Draper v. United States, 248 F.2d 295, 297 (10th Cir. 1957); 146 F.Supp. 689 (D.Colo.1956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\">.

[Policeman]: This is correct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b800-9\">. In <em>Jones </em>the Court sustained a warrant based on an officer\u2019s affidavit that an informant had previously proved reliable and that Ms information was corroborated by \u201cother sources\u201d; yet even in that case the Court said the \u201c[e]ommissioner * * * might have found the affidavit insufficient and withheld his warrant.\u201d 362 U.S. at 271, 80 S.Ct. at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"ahk-dedup-0\">In Walker v. United States, U.S.App.D.C., 327 F.2d 597 (1963), rehearing <em>in danc </em>denied January 28, 1964, probable cause to issue a search warrant was found in an affidavit that two previously reliable informers had given the pertinent information and a showing that their statements were \u201creasonably corroborated by other matters within the officer\u2019s knowledge.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b801-8\">. It might well have been found that appellant\u2019s statements were not voluntary.

If an addict confesses because it appears to be the only way to get treatment for withdrawal pains, the confession is not voluntary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b801-16\">.
