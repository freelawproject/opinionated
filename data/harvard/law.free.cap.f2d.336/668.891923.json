The DC-6 aircraft used to carry out this service order flew from the Travis, California, base, landed and refueled at Anchorage, Alaska, and was in the process of landing for the purpose of refueling again at Shemya, Alaska, in the Aleutian Islands, when it crashed, taking the lives of all six crewmen aboard, July 21,1961. Beneficiaries of five of the deceased crewmen filed claims with J. J. O\u2019Leary, Deputy Commissioner for the Fourteenth Compensation District, Bureau of Employees Compensation, United States Department of Labor, for death benefits pursuant to the Defense Base Act, 55 Stat. 622 (1941), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 (Supp. Y, 1963), which is set out in part in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The deputy commissioner awarded death benefits, finding as facts that the contract was one for public work and that it was to be performed outside the United States by means of transoceanic flights. Appellee petitioned the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to set aside the awards of the deputy commissioner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and on April 25, 1963, the court entered an order granting appellee\u2019s motion and dismissing that of the deputy commissioner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The deputy commissioner appealed, invoking the jurisdiction of this court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">After completion of oral argument in this court, it came to the attention of this court that the claimants had brought actions against a third party, the operator of the airfield at Shemya, for wrongful death of the crewmen. It is our understanding that these tort actions have been compromised, and that this was done without the consent of appellee herein. We accordingly requested the views of the parties herein as to the eifeet these compromise settlements have on this appeal. Both appellant and appellee agree that the issues on this appeal have now become moot by virtue of section 33 of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 44 Stat. 1440 (1927), as amended, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933 (Supp. V, 1963), which is set forth in part in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the judgment of the district court is vacated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>and \u00bfhe action is remanded with directions to set aside the awards of the deputy commissioner on the ground that the issue of the claims to compensation have become moot.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">. \u201c(a) Except as herein modified, the provisions of the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as amended, shall apply in respect to the injury or death of any employee engaged in any employment\u2014 * * * (4) under a contract entered into with the United States or any executive department, independent establishment, or agency thereof (including any corporate instrumentality of the United States), or any subcontract, or subordinate contract with respect to such contract, where such contract is to be performed outside the continental United States and at places not within the areas prescribed in subparagraphs (l)-(3) of this subdivision, for the purpose of engaging in public work, * * * irrespective of the place where the injury or death occurs * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b719-12\">.
