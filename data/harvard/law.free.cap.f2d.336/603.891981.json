See F.R.Civ.P. 4(d) (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-24\">Colorado law on the subject is admittedly controlling, and the trial judge, a former Justice of the Supreme Court of Colorado, has analyzed the decisions, based upon the universally accepted general rule. The trial court concluded that the appellant was doing business in the State of Colorado and amenable to service of process. The Court also construed the applicable Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure (4(e) (5)) to authorize service on the appellant\u2019s resident stockholder. See Focht v. Southwestern Skyways, D.C., 220 F.Supp. 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-25\">We accept the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Colorado law, and the judgment is affirmed for the reasons stated in its reported decision. Cf. Massey-Ferguson Ltd. v. Intermountain Ford Tractor Sales Co., et al., 10 Cir., 325 F.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-26\">SETH, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
