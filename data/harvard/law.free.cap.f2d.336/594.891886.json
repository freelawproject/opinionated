Brooks in a well-reasoned memorandum opinion, 233 F.Supp. 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The recently adopted Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure provide petitioner with an adequate post-conviction review to seek a determination of the question presented under K.R.S. 203.340. R.Cr. 11.42 provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">\u201cA prisoner in custody under sentence who claims a right to be released on the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or statutes of the Commonwealth or of the United States, or that the court imposing the sentence was without jurisdiction to do so, or that the sentence was in excess of that authorized by law or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may file a motion at any time in the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agqt\">This rule affords a post-conviction review comparable to the remedy provided federal prisoners by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Ayers v. Davis, 377 S.W.2d 154 (Ky.1964). See also Moore v. Commonwealth, 380 S.W.2d 76 (Ky.1964); Etherton v. Commonwealth, 379 S.W.2d 730 (Ky.1964); Nolan v. Thomas, Warden, 230 F.Supp. 114 (W.D.Ky.1964). Cf. McIntosh v. Commonwealth, 368 S.W.2d 331 (Ky. 1963) in which Rule 60.02 of the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure was used to raise a similar issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The record is clear that petitioner has not filed or attempted to file a motion pursuant to this rule in the court where he was convicted. Since petitioner has available to him a remedy in the state courts, the District Court properly denied the writ. Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 438, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837; Hampton v. Buchkoe, Warden, 334 F.2d 6 (C.A.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">The Court expresses appreciation to Mr. Kenneth L. Bailey of the Cincinnati Bar, who presented an excellent brief and oral argument as court-appointed counsel for petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-13\">. \u201c203.340 [263b-17] Mental examination of habitual criminals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-14\">\u201c(1) Wben a person who has been twice previously convicted of a felony, is indicted by a grand jury as an habitual criminal, the circuit clerk of the court in which he is indicted shall 'give notice of the indictment to the Commissioner of Mental Health within seven days after the indictment is returned by the grand jury.\". The commissioner shall cause such person. to be \u2018\u25a0examined by a . psychiatrist already in the employ of the department, to determine. Ms mental condition and the existence of any mental disease or defect which would affect his \u25a0 criminal responsibility. This examination . shall be made without expense other than , the. amount to cover necessary travel, as . provided by law for any other employe of the state traveling on official business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-25\">\u201c(2) The psychiatrist making the examination shall submit a written report of his findings to the judge of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>having jurisdiction, who shall make the report available to the prosecuting attorney and the attorney for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">\u201c(3) The commissioner may decline to cause such examination to be made if the number of psychiatrists on duty in the department is insufficient to spare one from his regular official duties, in which event the commissioner shall notify the clerk of the circuit court to that effect within three days.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
