United States, 320 F.2d 187 (C.A.7, 1963), petitioner filed a motion <em>pro se </em>to vacate sentence under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 alleging sixteen grounds for such relief. The District Judge in a carefully drawn opinion and order summarized the points raised (which pertain principally to issues which are subject to decision on appeal) and held that all were without merit in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-16\">Petitioner-appellant thereupon filed notice of appeal and this court appointed counsel for him. Before this court counsel urged that one paragraph of petitioner\u2019s motion be construed as an attack upon the constitutionality of one count of the indictment because of its failure to name the purchaser of the narcotics. See Lauer v. United States, supra. Appointed counsel also contended that the possession counts were void because they failed to set out the presumption contained in Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4744(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-17\">We have inspected and considered petitioner\u2019s original motion filed <em>pro se, </em>his brief filed in this court, and the District Judge\u2019s opinion and order. We believe that the latter constituted adequate legal response to petitioner\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-18\">In another appeal we have dealt extensively with the Lauer opinion of the Seventh Circuit and declined to follow it. United States v. Dickerson, 337 F.2d 343 (C.A.6, 1964). No contention was made before the District Judge or before us that petitioner was refused information as to the identity of the alleged purchaser at or prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-19\">As to the last of appointed counsel\u2019s contentions \u2014 the counts of the indictment made specific reference to the applicable statutory provisions by citing them. The presumption referred to is one created by statute not by the language of the indictment. Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 7(c) specifically authorizes use of \u201cthe official or customary citation of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
