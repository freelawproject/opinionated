This is true because the final conclusion by the trial court that the company would have concluded the transaction had it been in full possession of all the facts, can not be held by us to be clearly erroneous on this record. The trial court\u2019s judgment was based upon clear expressions by the directors of the corporation which constrained it to hold that the fact that Connett profited from the transaction would not have caused them to have acted differently with respect to the making of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-14\">The judgment must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
