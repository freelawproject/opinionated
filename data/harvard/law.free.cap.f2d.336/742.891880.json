Read in connection with \u00a7 4-521(1), D.C.Code (1961) \u00a7 4-526 provides that when a member of the Police or Fire Department \u201ccompletes five years of police or fire service and is * * * disabled due to injury received or disease contracted other than in the performance of duty\u201d, he shall be retired on an annuity of at least 40 per cent of his salary. Appellee contends that former military service should be counted and that he therefore has five years of \u201cpolice or fire service.\u201d This contention contradicts the plain meaning of the quoted words. Moreover, \u00a7 4-521(10) of the Code defines \u201cpolice or fire service\u201d as \u201chonorable service in the Metropolitan Police Department, White House Police force, Fire Department of the District of Columbia, the United States Park Police force, and the United States Secret Service * * * \u201d The District Court erred in entering summary judgment for appellee. Summary judgment should be entered for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
