S.C. (I.R.C.1954) \u00a7 4161. Taxpayer\u2019s right to recover was dependent upon the correctness of its claim that a removable spool, upon which a fishing line was wound, was not an integral part of, nor an accessory to, a fishing reel manufactured and sold by taxpayer; and, that taxpayer had not collected the subject taxes from the purchasers of the reels. 26 U.S.C. (I.R.C.1954) \u00a7 6416. The trial court found against taxpayer on both issues and denied recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">We affirm the judgment for the reasons stated in the trial court\u2019s opinion. 218 F.Supp. 441. Both issues are essentially questions of fact and the trial court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous and support its judgment. The statement of the trial court that the fishing line is an accessory to the reel is erroneous but does not affect the validity of the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
