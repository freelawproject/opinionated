After an extended colloquy with appellant in the course of the hearing, the District Court permitted withdrawal of the guilty plea as to Count 3 but declined it as to Count 4 because no valid reason or basis for withdrawal had been claimed or shown. On the remaining guilty plea to Count 4 he sentenced appellant to nine years imprisonment under the Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(c) (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-15\">The six-count indictment charged three offenses arising out of unrelated robberies and one attempted robbery on a fourth occasion, spanning a period from April 1962 to January 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-16\">At arraignment under Fed.R.Crim. P. 10 on February 25, 1963, appellant entered a plea of not guilty as to all six counts and was released on bail. Two months later, with retained counsel, he withdrew the pleas of not guilty to Count 3 (robbery) and Count 4 (assault with intent to commit robbery) and entered pleas of guilty as to both of these counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before accepting these guilty pleas, the District Judge, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Resolution of the Judges of the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia promulgated June 24, 1959 thereunder,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>ducted an extensive interrogation of appellant as to the facts of the alleged crimes and his reasons for pleading guilty thereto. Appellant freely admitted the charges: as to Count 3 he said, \u201cI went in and robbed the place * * * by myself * * * [and took] about $200.00, sir\u201d; as to Count 4 he said, \u201cWell I entered the liquor store and I demanded money, sir; and well I just remember being shot; that\u2019s about all.\u201d \u2022He stated further that he had brandished \u2022a gun both times but did not shoot it; that on the latter occasion one of the liquor store employees had shot him; and that he had been apprehended the following day when he had gone to the hospital for treatment of the gunshot wound. The District Judge interrogated appellant carefully as to his awareness of the possible sentence; appellant reiterated his guilt<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and said he was pleading guilty because he was guilty and not because the Government had moved to dismiss four other counts should he plead guilty to Counts 3 and 4.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">Three weeks later, appellant, with his retained counsel, filed a motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to withdraw his guilty pleas to Counts 3 and 4. On June 27, 1963, the District Court conducted a hearing on the motion and at this time appellant said he was innocent of the Count 3 robbery charge and had pleaded guilty to that count only because he \u201cwas so confused and worried * * * [and] wanted to try to get this over as soon as possible.\u201d As to Count 4, however, he stated to the Court: \u201cWell, Your Honor, I am guilty of that charge. I did attempt to rob this place. That\u2019s all.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The District Judge granted the motion to withdraw the plea as to Count 3 but denied the motion as to Count 4 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on which guilt was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">Appellant is now represented by court-appointed counsel who urges that the District Court committed reversible error in refusing to permit withdrawal of the guilty plea to Count 4 in the circumstances shown here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-16\">We disagree emphatically. We have held that withdrawal of a guilty plea, made by a defendant unrepresented by counsel, \u201cshould be freely allowed\u201d when he seeks withdrawal <em>before </em>sentencing. Poole v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 71, 75, 250 F.2d 396, 400 (1957).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>recently, in Gearhart v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 273, 272 F.2d 499, 502 (1959), Judge Washington, speaking for a unanimous court, noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-4\">\u201c[T]he Supreme Court in broad dictum already had said that \u2018The court in exercise of its discretion will permit one accused to substitute a plea of not guilty and have a trial if for <em>my reason </em>the granting of the privilege seems <em>fair and fust.\u2019 </em>* * -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-6\">\u201cThis is not to say that the District Court lacks all discretion in dealing with a motion of the present sort. But discretion must be exercised on the basis of sound information, soundly viewed. Where the accused seeks to withdraw his plea of guilty before sentencing, on the ground that he has a defense to the charge, the District Court should not attempt to decide the merits of the proffered defense, thus determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. In certain situations, where the issue raised by the motion to withdraw is one of tangential, nature, resolvable apart from the-merits of the case, the District Court, may appropriately hold a factual, hearing to determine whether the-accused has a \u2018fair and just\u2019 reason for asking to withdraw his plea of' guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-15\">Far from showing a \u201c \u2018fair- and just\u2019 reason\u201d for a change of plea to Count 4, appellant demonstrated by his repeated statements that he had no reason other than wanting a trial on a charge of which he admitted his guilt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Unlike Gearhart, appellant offered no defense to the charge,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> nor did he allege. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>involuntariness or any other factor which would militate against the correctness and truth of his guilty plea to Count 4 which was entered when he was represented by retained counsel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> His contention is virtually a claim of an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea prior to imposition of sentence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No court has ever so held; our use of the language \u201cfreely allowed\u201d plainly implies the existence of some circumstances in which a defendant is <em>not </em>entitled to withdraw a plea of guilty before sentencing, and negates any absolute right to do so.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Overwhelming authority holds, as has this court, that withdrawal of a guilty plea before sentencing is not an absolute right<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but a decision within the sound discretion of the trial court which will be reversed by an appellate court only for an abuse of that discretion<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number> A defendant who stands before a court freely admitting his attempted robbery does not remotely meet the standard of offering a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawing his plea of guilty prior to sentence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> He must give some reason other than a desire to have a trial the basic purpose of which is to determine the very facts the defendant has just volunteered to the court on the record and while attended by his own counsel.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The record reveals a guilty plea, intelligently and voluntarily made with assistance of retained counsel and candid admission of all essential elements of the crime in open court; this is hardly a predicate for an appellate holding that the District Judge abused his discretion in refusing to permit a withdrawal. We are not disposed to encourage accused persons to \u201cplay games\u201d with the courts at the expense of already overburdened calendars and the rights of other accused' persons awaiting trial, whose cases may lose both their position on the calendar and the Court\u2019s time and facilities which are thus diverted for no useful purpose.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>'</p>\n<p id=\"apb-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">. On the basis of these two guilty pleas, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office moved the dismissal of the remaining four counts. Ruling on this motion has been held in abeyance by the District Judge pending disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">. Fed.R.Ckim.P. 11 provides in part: \u201cThe court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept the plea without first determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge. * * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">. Resolved, that it is the consensus of opinion of the Judges of this Court that in all cases in which defendant enters a plea of guilty the defendant should be interrogated by or under direction of the Court to establish the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-13\">1. That defendant has been advised and understands that he has a right to a speedy trial by jury with the aid of counsel, but will have no such right if his plea of guilty is accepted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-17\">2.

In his statement to the Court at the time of sentencing appellant said: \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t anything to say about my sentence, but I have something to say about why I did this crime. * * * Well, the only reason why I did this crime, Your Honor, was because of my pregnant wife and unborn child. And she needed medical care, and I just didn\u2019t have any means to try to get her in the hospital.\u201d The Judge noted that he had information that indicated that appellant had been unemployed and his wife pregnant at the time of the offense; further colloquy revealed that appellant\u2019s wife had gone to Jamaica to live with her father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1031-21\">.

Indeed, although appellant at the April 25th hearing asserted his innocence of the charge contained in Count 3, he not only never claimed to be innocent of the charge in Count 4, but readily admitted it. Failure to make such an assertion of innocence, although not in itself dispositive, certainly militates against withdrawal. See United States v.

Indeed the record discloses that the effort to withdraw the plea and stand trial on all six counts was against the advice of appellant\u2019s retained counsel in the District Court.

The dissent seems to assume that when the defendant at the time of sentencing explained his reasons for the crime, see note 8 <em>supra, </em>the District Court was required sua sponte to vacate its earlier denial of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. No authority supports such a view. These reasons do not, as the dissent intimates, go to the existence of <em>mens rea </em>in the appellant: there is no criminal-responsibility issue here; rather, Everett\u2019s reasons only explain his motives for doing a voluntary act. As such, they are irrelevant in our system of criminal justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">. This court has considered numerous appeals in which challenged trial delay was-caused in part by unavailability of a. judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1034-11\">WRIGHT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AcS\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"AJA2\">Admitting the acts charged against, him, the defendant nevertheless moved, unsuccessfully, to withdraw his plea of guilty<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and go to trial. On allocution, he stated that he stole because he was poor, in order to provide necessary medical care for his pregnant wife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant is not articulate, but his claim seems to make him out as a modern Jean Val-jean, who was convicted of burglary for' stealing bread for his starving children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-12\">At the time of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the defendant here had' not been sentenced.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>\"that, had the motion been granted, the Government would have suffered no prejudice. Thus I would have thought that, under the circumstances, the defendant should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea as a matter of course.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">But Judge Burger\u2019s scholarly opinion has demonstrated that the cases have established a different standard. And the Supreme Court has recently spoken in .a case where, as here, the defendant admitted the acts charged;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it applied the rule that while he may properly withdraw a guilty plea prior to sentencing, there must be some good^reason for allowing him to do so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ^Ehus the issue framed for us is whether sufficient reason exists to withdraw the plea when the defendant claims mitigating circumstances and apparently seeks to have the .jury pass, not on the issue of the historical facts charged, but on the issue of Culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">Our jun^ prdperly pass on the culpability of the accused. An element of the crime charged is <em>mens rea, </em>and if \u201cthe jury cannot find that that state of mind existed in the accused, it must acquit. Thus, in the extreme instance, a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is tantamount to a finding of \u201cproved\u201d on the Government\u2019s charge concerning certain events, but a finding of \u201cnot culpable\u201d on the defendant\u2019s claim concerning his state of mind. A verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d may have a similar meaning; when the defenses of self-defense, privilege or excuse are raised, for example, a jury may find that the deed was done, but that the man is no criminal. Indeed, it has been recognized as an \u201celementary principle of justice\u201d that \u201cwhen a man\u2019s life or liberty is at stake he should be adjudged according to his personal culpability as well as by the objective seriousness of the crime.\u201d Fisher v. United States, 328 U.S. 463, 492, 66 S.Ct. 1318, 90 L.Ed. 1382 (1946) (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Murphy).</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-15\">This power of the jury to pass upon culpability is reflected in the institution of the general verdict. Juries decide \u201cguilty\u201d or \u201cnot guilty,\u201d criminal or not criminal, rather than bring in a special verdict as to commission of the act charged to the accused. Reflected in the jury\u2019s decision is a judgment of whether, under all the circumstances of the event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>and in the light of all known about the defendant, the prohibited act, if committed, deserves condemnation by the law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">In one period in England, the Star Chamber punished juries who acquitted men who had obviously done the acts charged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But, with the development of the common law, attaints, fines and imprisonments of juries were abolished, leaving juries free to find as the evidence and their oaths led them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Colonial case wherein John Peter Zenger<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was prosecuted for seditious libel stands as a landmark instance where the defendant went to the jury on his admission of the facts charged and his claim, nevertheless, of no culpability. By acquitting Zenger, the jury fulfilled its role as protector against unjust laws or their unfair application. In the century following the <em>Zenger </em>case, it was generally recognized in American jurisprudence that the jury, agent of the sovereign people, had a right to acquit those whom it felt it unjust to\" call criminal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In a leading case<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> at the end of the nineteenth century, the Supreme Court affirmed that the jury had this power, while a strong opinion for the minority<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> went further and reaffirmed the American common law tradition that this was no mere power of the jury, but their proper right.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Modern discussions in both criminal and civil law have re-emphasized this \u201cdispensing-function\u201d of the jury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>The mitigating circumstances the defendant here claims may not be enough ~to convince the jury that his crime is \u25a0excusable, but to my mind his desire to raise the issue of culpability for jury decision may be sufficient cause to allow him to withdraw his plea of guilty and go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">The recent ruling<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of the Supreme Court, handed down subsequent to the decision of the District Court here, indicates that the withdrawal of the guilfy plea before sentence by one who admits his guilt may be proper. The case before us is a stronger one than the case before the Supreme Court, for here the defendant wishes to raise an issue as to his culpability. Perhaps the district judge here, like the district judge in that ease, was unaware that under the law a defendant may change his plea before sentencing, even where he does not challenge the commission of the act charged against him. I would therefore vacate the decision below and remand for consideration in the light of the recent Supreme Court opinion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1034-15\">.

Juries sometimes take the law into their own hands and decide a case-according to popular prejudice which often embodies popular notions of what the law ought to be. It has also been recognized that this fact is not always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>a weakness but sometimes a great strength of the jury system. Lord Coke is reported to have said \u2018the jurors are Chancellors.\u2019 [Quoted from Pound, An Introduction to the Philosophy op Law 133 (1922).] Holmes said \u2018one reason why I believe in our practice of leaving questions of negligence to them is precisely one of their gravest defects from the point of view of their theoretical function: that they will introduce into their verdict a certain amount \u2014 a very large amount, so far as I have observed \u2014 of popular prejudice, and thus keep the administration of the law in accord with the wishes and feelings of the community.\u2019 [Holmes, Collected Legal Papers 237-238 (1921).] Pound concluded that \u2018Jury lawlessness is the great corrective of law in its actual administration.\u2019 [Pound, <em>Lato in Books and Law in Action, </em>44 Am.L.Rev.\" 12, 18 (1910).] One of our ablest trial judges \u25a0of today has noted that \u2018traditionally juries are the device by which the rigor of the law is modified pending the enactment of new statutes.\u2019 [Wyzanski, <em>A Trial Judge\u2019s Freedom, and Responsibility, </em>65 Harv.L.Rev. 1281, 1286 (1952).] Justice Traynor of the California Supreme Court believes that \u2018we would lose more than we would gain by a reform of fact-finding that would \u25a0only compel righteous adherence [by juries] to wrong rules. * * * \u2019 Until the rules themselves are changed we are better off \u2018with that quiet distortion that presently adapts them to the needs of rough justice.\u2019 [Traynor, <em>Faet \u00a1Skepticism and the Judicial Process, </em>106 U.Pa.L.Rev. 635, 639, 640 (1958).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-11\">\u201cIt is not, I submit, an improper abdication of responsibility to the jury to call on its dispensing power \u2014 its equitable function \u2014 when the occasion is appropriate. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">James, <em>Tort Law in Midstream: Its Challenge to the Judicial Process, </em>8 Buffalo L.Rev. 315, 342-343 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-13\">And Professors Paulsen and Kadish have noted: \u201cIt has often been suggested that juries are agencies of mitigation in that they may serve to bring the law up to date by applying it in a way consistent with present-day community values.\u201d Paulsen &amp; Kadish, Criminal Law and Its Processes 1107 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">It has also been said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-15\">\u201c * * * Many an acquittal, many a judgment for the defendant, is * * * an admonition to go and sin no more.
