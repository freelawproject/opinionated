The United States District Judge who heard the case in the United States Dis-strict Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Western Division, rendered judgment for the government as to the issues herein discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-21\">This appeal requires us to consider the purpose and the operation of one of the most debated provisions of federal income tax legislation. We are told that the question posed is a matter of first impression and our own research does not serve to dispute the assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-22\">The section in question, enacted into its present form in 1954, is Section 355 (Title 26, U.S.C. \u00a7 355) entitled \u201cDistribution of stock and securities of a controlled corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-23\">Concerning it and its allied problems, a tax law expert said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-24\">\u201cLike many other areas new to, or substantially changed in, the 1954 Internal Revenue Code, Section 355 is a breeding ground for substantial differences between taxpayers and their government. Advance rulings can avoid many potential disputes. But incautious taxpayers almost certainly will find many of their disputes the subject of litigation for years to come.\u201d Dean, Spin-offs, N.Y.U. 15th Inst, on Fed. Tax, 571, 590 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-26\">This appeal is brought by a husband and wife as joint taxpayers. The husband owned 4,100 shares of stock in an old and successful corporation called American Crayon Company, which operated mainly in the school and educational supply fields. In 1957 this company, as a result of negotiation between its executives and principal stockholders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>and their opposite numbers in another company, merged with the Joseph Dixon Crucible Company. The Dixon Company was a larger organization with a better profit record in recent years, doing business in the same general fields as American Crayon.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In broadest outline the basic transaction represented a transfer to Dixon of the assets of American Crayon (and the extinguishment of its corporate existence) in exchange for transfer of Dixon stock and debt certificates (deemed equivalent in market value to the book value of the American Crayon assets transferred). The Dixon stock was assigned in proportionate shares to the former American Crayon stockholders. This basic transaction then was primarily an example of a Section 354 merger of a smaller corporation into a larger, with an exchange of assets and corporate existence for stock in the larger corporation. Section 354 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">\n<em>\u201cExchanges of stock and securities in certain reorganizations</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ4N\">\u201c(a) General rule. \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">\u201c(1) In general. \u2014 No gain or loss shall be recognized if stock or securities in a corporation a party to a reorganization are, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, exchanged <em>solely </em>for stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 354.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The controlling word in this quotation is the word \u201csolely.\u201d As a part of the instant transaction, however, the American Crayon stockholders received not only Dixon stock, but also two other evidences of property \u2014 the certificates of indebtedness from the Dixon Company previously referred to, and stock in a newly formed company, Kroma, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Kroma, Inc., was organized to operate a warehouse building owned by American Crayon which Dixon did not w\u00e1nt as a part of the merger. At the time of the merger the warehouse was transferred to Kroma, and Kroma stock was distributed to the American Crayon stockholders on the basis of one share for each share of American Crayon stock. It was stipulated that each share of Kroma stock was worth $2.00 at time of distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">This stock the Commissioner of Internal Revenue has claimed to be a distribution to former American Crayon stockholders, and hence taxable under Title 26, U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 316. The taxpayer-appellants did not declare the value of the Kroma stock in their 1957 income tax return and claim before us that its value should not be regarded as subject to taxation under another section, \u00a7 355, because it represented a \u201cspin-off\u201d corporate reorganization of a separate business for legitimate business reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">The taxpayers in filing their 1957 tax returns also claimed that the certificates of indebtedness from Dixon were not recognizable for tax purposes. However, at trial of this matter the taxpayers abandoned this position and apparently conceded that this aspect of the total transaction did represent a distribution of assets. They did, however, contest the basis for computation of the taxable amount before the District Court; and they do so before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">Details of both disputed transactions are set forth in the stipulated facts upon which this matter was heard before the District Judge. Relevant paragraphs of the stipulation follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-13\">\u201c1. The American Crayon Company, hereinafter called American, was an Ohio corporation incorporated July 21,1890, and had its principal office in Sandusky, Ohio. The Joseph Dixon Crucible Company, hereinafter called Dixon, was and is a New Jersey corporation incorporated March 11, 1868, with its principal office in Jersey City, New Jersey. Prior to the merger hereinafter referred to American and Dixon were both engaged in serving the educational, school and stationery fields throughout the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-14\">\u201c2. American\u2019s manufacturing plant was located on Hay\u00e9s Street in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Sandusky, Ohio. American also owned the Kroma building on Water Street in Sandusky which it rented. In order to simplify the issues, and for the purpose of this case only, the parties agree that American\u2019s manufacturing operation and its rental operation of - the Kroma building each constituted the conduct of a separate and active business within the meaning of, and meeting the requirements of, Section 355(a) (1) (C) and (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">\u201c3. The first in the series of events that eventually led to a merger of American into Dixon occurred about April 11, 1955, upon the receipt by American of a letter of that date from a broker inquiring whether the owners of American would be interested in a sale or merger of its business. After learning that Dixon was the company interested in American and after investigation of Dixon, American\u2019s chief executives were interested in pursuing the prospects of a possible sale of American\u2019s assets to Dixon or of a merger of American into Dixon. On July 6, 1955, the broker advised American that Dixon was interested in a combination of the two companies and asked American to formulate an asking price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\u201c4. During the period of negotiation, the negotiators found themselves consistently in accord on the proposition that a combination of the two companies would enhance the prospects of a profitable business future for both companies. American had been losing part of its market. American\u2019s negotiators believed the merger would benefit it by making available for its operation new capital and able young executives. Dixon had a much greater net worth and a larger volume of sales and earnings than American, and maintained substantial cash reserves. American was in need of funds for plant modernization, research, and diversification, and its negotiators hoped to obtain such funds as a result of the merger. American\u2019s chief executives were advancing in age without sufficient younger executives available for replacement and its sales organization was not as aggressive as Dixon\u2019s. Its negotiators hoped new personnel would become available as a result of the merger. Dixon\u2019s sales and profit position was strong and stable whereas American\u2019s was declining. The Government will not dispute that American had bona fide business reasons for a merger with Dixon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">\u201c5. The matter that caused the most difficulty throughout the negotiations was the question of American\u2019s Kroma warehouse. American\u2019s negotiators valued the Kroma warehouse at in excess of $300,000, whereas Dixon did not want the warehouse and initially offered merely to take an option to purchase it for $30,000. The parties never came closer to an agreement with respect to the Kroma warehouse than American\u2019s offer to include it in the merger at a value of $192,000, and Dixon\u2019s offer to merely take an option for its purchase at a price of $75,000. Because American\u2019s negotiators, chief executives and board of directors believed that the proposed combination of American and Dixon was important to a sound and profitable business future for American, they, at the insistence of Dixon\u2019s negotiators, deleted the Kroma warehouse from the assets of American that Dixon would acquire if a combination of the two companies could otherwise be agreed upon. It was thereafter understood between the parties to the negotiations that if the combination of the two companies were agreed upon, American would have to make some other disposition of the ownership of the Kroma warehouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">\u201c6. Another problem arose during the negotiations because Dixon\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>negotiators indicated that they believed that sound business procedure required them to obtain protection for Dixon against possible unrecorded, undisclosed or undetermined liabilities of American. This was for the reason that Dixon\u2019s negotiators understood that following the proposed merger, Dixon, as the surviving corporation, would be responsible for all obligations and liabilities that would have been the obligations and liabilities of American but for the merger, whether or not such obligations and liabilities, at the time of the merger negotiations, were recorded, disclosed, or determined. The possible American liabilities that Dixon\u2019s negotiators were concerned about were tax liabilities, copyright infringements, contract violations, breaches of warranty with respect to manufactured products, claims arising out of American\u2019s rental of warehousing facilities and claims of unfair competition which had been made by the Federal Trade Commission in a lengthy action then still pending. In order to obtain the protection for Dixon desired by its negotiators, a part ($113,454) of the purchase price for American\u2019s assets was withheld for a period of time, as provided by Articles IV and VI of the merger agreement. Each American shareholder, on the completion of the merger, received a pro-rata share of Dixon\u2019s contingent 6% notes x*ep-resenting this sum of money. The parties hex*eto have stipulated, paragraph 17 infra, that the contingencies mentioned in the merger agreement were sufficiently remote so as not to reduce the fair market value of the notes, as of the date of the mergex', below face value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Exhibit A-l in this case was a September 30, 1956, balance sheet of the American Crayon Company which showed an \u201cearned surplus\u201d of $832,291.10 \u2014 an amount considerably in excess of the combined value of the. assets transferred to Kroma, Inc., plus the Dixon debt certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The principal question which was before the trial coux't was whether or not under the total facts in this record the \u201cspin-off\u201d of the Kroma company was entitled to nonx-ecognition of gain or loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as contended by the taxpayers, or on the contrary, was properly to be considered a taxable dividend as detex'mined by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The District Judge answered this question thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">\u201cIt is the Government\u2019s position that, where several transactions were in fact merely steps in carrying out one definite preconceived purpose, the object sought and obtained must govern, and that the integxated steps used in effecting the desired result may not be treated separately for tax purposes, citing Koppers Coal Co. v. Commissioner, 6 T.C. 1209; Mellon v. Commissioner, 12 T.C. 90, affirmed on other grounds, 184 F.2d 157 (C.A.3). The Government contends that the transactions herein involved were steps in carrying out a definite px*econceived purpose and that, therefore, the several steps cannot be treated separately; that the two concerns here had in mind the merger of American and Dixon, and that the transactions involving Kroma were merely steps to the final result and, thex'efore, the Kroma transaction cannot be viewed for tax purposes separately and independently from the merger. The Government contends that Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 requires that the distributing corporation, in this case American, must itself engage in the active conduct of a trade or business after the spin-off, and that this requirement was not satisfied in this particular case. With this position of the Defendant we agree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-10\">The District Judge was right as a matter of law in concluding that non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>recognition of gain or loss was barred to the taxpayers involved in the \u201cspin-off\u201d by the fact that the parent company went out of existence by virtue of the coincidental merger and was not \u201cengaged immediately after the distribution in the active conduct of a trade or business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We note appellant\u2019s argument to the effect that the American Crayon business was actively continued under Dixon ownership with employment of the American Crayon assets and that this fulfilled the limitation of Section 355(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">If we had no means of ascertaining congressional intent in this regard, the appellant\u2019s suggested interpretation would still seem farfetched. Since we do have a means of determining intent, the interpretation sought by appellants appears to us to be prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">It must, of course, be recognized that Section 355 is an exception to a general taxation rule set forth in Section 301 and Section 316. The applicable language in these sections follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\n<em>\u201cDistribution of property</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\">\u201c(a) In general. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a distribution of property (as defined in section 317(a)) made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock shall be treated in the manner provided in subsection (c).\u201d Title 26, U.S.C. \u00a7 301.

Corporate reorganizations (spin-offs).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-15\">\u201cSection 317 of your committee\u2019s bill adds a new section 112(b) (11) of the code to provide for the nonrecognition of gain from the receipt of stock in corporate exchanges carrying out transactions known as spin-offs. A spin-off occurs when a part of the assets of a corporation is transferred to a new corporation and the stock in the latter is distributed to the shareholders of the original corporation without a- surrender by the shareholders of stock in the distributing corporations. It is intended that section 317 shall be applicable even though the portion of the business which is spun off is already organized as a separate corporation, with the result that it is the stock of that corporation, rather than the underlying assets, which is ' transferred to the new corporation whose stock is distributed. For example, if among the assets of corporation A is the stock of a subsidiary corporation B, whether or not wholly or even majoiity owned, and business reasons exist, unrelated to any desire to make a distribution of earnings and profits to its shareholders, for the separation of the assets consisting of such stock, such separation may be effected without recognition of gain to corporation A or its stockholders by transferring the stock of B to a newly organized corporation C in exchange for its stock, followed by the distribution of C\u2019s stock to the stockholders of A without the surrender of their stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-16\">\u201cThis section has been included in the bill because your committee believes that it is economically unsound to impede spin-offs which break-up businesses into a gxnater number of enterpxfises, when undertaken for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>legitimate business purposes, similar provision was contained in the revenue revision bill of 1948 which passed the House but was not acted upon by the Senate, and a similar provision was included in the Senate version of the bill which became the Revenue Act of 1950.

Nonrecognition of gain has been denied also in cases where the reorganization was principally a device for the distribution of the earnings and profits of the corporations which are parties to the reorganization. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-4\">\"Section 317 of the bill also adds a new section 113(a) (23) to the code providing that, in the case of stock distributed in a spin-off, the basis of the new stock, and the old stock, respectively, in the shareholder\u2019s hands, is to be determined by allocating between the old stock and the new stock the adjusted basis of the old stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">\u201cThese provisions of your committee\u2019s bill are to be effective with respect to taxable years ending after the date of the enactment of this bill, but are to apply only to distributions of stock made after that date.\u201d Sen. Rep.No. 781, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. (1951), U.S.Code Congressional and Administrative News, p. 1969.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">It thus appears to us that Congress plainly intended to require that the <em>parent </em>company must continue in active existence after a \u201cspin-off\u201d reorganization'in order for the resulting stock distribution to qualify for nonrecognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">The reasons for this limitation (apparently arbitrary on its face) become clear when we read the history of tax exemptions for spin-off corporate reorganizations. The first such exemption was. adopted in 1924<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was intended (as shown by legislative debate <footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) to be narrowly limited in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">The statutory language used, however, proved ineffective in limiting the efforts of taxpayers to employ corporate spinoffs for the purpose of tax free distribution of corporate assets. The net result was repeal of the exemption in its entirety in 1934.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case for nonrecognition of gain in spin-off reorganizations where distribution of assets was neither the purpose nor the result was argued before Congress with vigor in 1951, and Section 355 was adopted. Read in this context the strict limitations of the present Section 355 which we construe became more understandable.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\"> We find no warrant for accepting the interpretation of Section 355(b) sought by taxpayer-appellants. Exemptions from general taxation statutes are to be strictly construed. Corn Products Refining Co. v. Commissioner, 350 U.S. 46, 52, 76 S.Ct. 20, 100 L.Ed. 29 (1955); Helvering v. Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, Inc., 311 U.S. 46, 49, 61 S.Ct. 109, 85 L.Ed. 29 (1940). Nielsen v. United States, 333 F.2d 615 (C.A.6, 1964). Further, the taxpayers\u2019 interpretation would, if given effect by us, represent judicial repeal of a condition deliberately considered and duly adopted by Congress. This court, of course, possesses no such power.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">The federal District Judge was correct in refusing the refund sought as a result of taxation on the Kroma stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\">The second question posed by this case requires rather less discussion because there appears to be good precedent in relation to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>The taxpayers acquired their total American Crayon stock in eight different blocks, acquired on eight different dates, at different prices. As to four of these blocks, it is conceded that the merger resulted in net losses, while as to four there was net gain. The Commissioner\u2019s determination taxed the net gain without allowing for the losses on the other blocks. The applicable statute provides for nonrecognition of losses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-4\">\u201c(c) Loss. \u2014 If\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">\u201c(1) section 354 would apply to an exchange, or Section 355 would apply to an exchange or distribution, but for the fact that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">\u201c(2) the property received in the exchange or distribution consists not only of property permitted by section 354 or 355 to be received without the recognition of gain or loss, but also of other property or money,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">\u201cthen no loss from the exchange or distribution shall be recognized.\u201d Title 26, U.S.C. \u00a7 356(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Appellants argue, however, that they should be allowed to average in (or merge) their losses in relation to determination of net gain from their acquisition of the Dixon debt certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">The merger question posed here was considered in Lakeside Irr. Co. v. Commissioner, 128 F.2d 418 (C.A.5 1942), cert. denied, 317 U.S. 666, 63 S.Ct. 71, 87 L.Ed. 535 (1942), wherein the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">\u201cOn the question whether for tax purposes what happened is one single and inseparable sale or exchange, or may and must be considered as four, no direct authority is cited. We are of opinion that in ascertaining gain and loss by sales or exchanges of property previously purchased, in general each purchase is a separate unit as to which cost and sale price are to be compared. If less than all of a purchase is sold, either a credit on the cost of all is to be entered, or a proportion of the cost is to be attributed to what is sold, as Regulations may have prescribed. If several things separately bought are welded into some physical or business unit, as where bricks, lumber and hardware are made into a house, or machines and buildings are made into a plant, and then sold together, the cost is the aggregate costs of the ingredients, and the sale price is that of the whole, for separation would be impracticable and unreasonable. But where, as here, four unrelated lots of stock were separately acquired and might readily have been separately sold, the fact that after ascertaining the value of each lot all _ were transferred together for a lump price will not require or authorize a merger of costs. The United States may enquire as to which stocks were disposed of at a profit and tax the profit, and may ignore losses altogether on the disposal of other stocks, though realized at the same time and in the same transaction. Section 24(a) is emphatic in declaring that in the transactions it names, including loss from sales or exchanges between persons related as they are here, \u2018no deduction shall in any case be allowed\u2019. It seems hard that this is so in this case, because it would have been otherwise had the stocks been sold and the money paid to the creditor stockholder, who might with the money have bought these or like stocks; but thus the statute is written.\u201d Lakeside Irr.
