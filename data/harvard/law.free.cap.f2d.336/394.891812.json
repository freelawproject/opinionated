Edward R. Kenneally, trustee and appel-lee herein, filed objections to both the validity and secured ranking of appellant\u2019s claims and that of the First National Bank of Minneapolis for its prior chattel mortgage held on the same property of the bankrupt. The trustee, in turn, brought a counterclaim against appellant seeking a money recovery and an accounting for its alleged mismanagement of the bankrupt\u2019s affairs causing insolvency during the period appellant controlled bankrupt\u2019s board of directors pursuant to a merger agreement which was never consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-22\">The referee sustained in part the objections of the trustee, disallowing Standard\u2019s claims as to one of the chattel mortgages and the pledge agreement, while refraining from passing upon the factor\u2019s lien as unnecessary to his deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>sion since it was given as additional security for the remaining chattel mortgage held valid. In his memorandum opinion and order, the referee awarded Standard an enforceable lien on this chattel mortgage of January 1962 to secure payment of indebtedness in the amount of $25,000.00 out of the $53,741.-09 in funds obtained by the trustee from proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property in excess of the bank\u2019s allowed superior claim, securing indebtedness of $21,817.67. He rejected the trustee\u2019s counterclaim for insufficient evidence and reserved jurisdiction to determine, <em>inter alia,, </em>the precise amount each claimant is entitled to of the funds on hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">The trustee appealed to the District Court in accordance with 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 67, sub. c of the Bankruptcy Act; the court, on the basis of the pleadings, a partial transcript, and documentary exhibits, modified the referee\u2019s order and remanded the case because the referee failed to number his findings of fact and conclusions of law in his memorandum opinion and order and neglected therein to properly consider the trustee\u2019s claimed set off or counterclaim. From this decision of the District Court, only Standard has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">A recitation of the facts upon which the referee based his findings is unnecessary to our disposition of this appeal on procedural grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Standard urges reversal of the order of the District Court remanding the case to the referee for further instructed actions and reinstatement of the referee\u2019s decision for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">1. The trustee failed to comply with Minnesota Federal District Court Bankruptcy Rule 19(b) which requires a petitioner for review to the District Court to furnish a transcript of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">2. The District Court erred in failing to abide by the referee\u2019s findings of fact which are not to be set aside unless \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d under Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">3. The District Court erred in requiring the referee to make separate, numbered findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">The trustee, on the other hand, has at the outset moved to dismiss the appeal for our lack of jurisdiction on grounds the appeal is from an interlocutory order-in a controversy arising in proceedings in bankruptcy which is therefore non-ap-pealable at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Section 24, sub. a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 47, sub. a, confers on this court appellate jurisdiction \u201cin proceedings in bankruptcy, either interlocutory or final, and in controversies arising in proceedings in bankruptcy * * pftg jurisprudence construing this provision of the 1938 Act has maintained the long-standing distinction between the appealability of interlocutory orders \u201cin proceedings in bankruptcy\u201d and the non-appealability of such orders in \u201ccontroversies arising in proceedings in bankruptcy\u201d. Kelso v. Maclaren, 122 F.2d 867 (8th Cir. 1941) ; Lesser v. Mig-den, 328 F.2d 47 (2nd Cir. 1964); Dutch American Merc. Corp. v. Eighteenth Ave. Land Co., 302 F.2d 636 (2nd Cir. 1962); Hillcrest Lumber Co. v. Terminal Factors, Inc., 281 F.2d 323 (2nd Cir. 1960) ; 2 Collier, Bankruptcy, UTT 24.04, 24.11 and 24.27 (14th Ed. 1956). Categorization of the nature of the instant-bankruptcy litigation and the type of order issued by the District Court will answer the question of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">Proceedings in bankruptcy have been defined as \u201cthose matters of an administrative character, including questions between the bankrupt and his creditors, which are presented in the ordinary course of the administration\u201d; while controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings \u201cinclude those matters arising in the course of a bankruptcy proceeding, which are not mere steps in the ordinary administration of the bankrupt estate, but present, by intervention or otherwise, distinct and separable issues between the trustee and adverse claimants concerning the right and title to the bankrupt\u2019s estate\u201d. Taylor v. Voss, 271 U.S. 176, 180-181, 46 S.Ct. 461, 463, 70 L.Ed. 889 (1926). The trustee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>contested both the existence and amount of claimant\u2019s lien based on the first chattel mortgage principally on grounds of fraud, invalid corporate authorization by bankrupt\u2019s board of directors, and the inapplicability of this security to future advances in excess of the amount borrowed from claimant at the time of the instrument\u2019s execution. These adverse claims of ownership rights between the trustee and the appealing creditor to property within the bankrupt\u2019s estate subject to the summary jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court are properly characterized under prevailing law as a controversy arising in a proceeding in bankruptcy. Hillcrest Lumber Co. v. Terminal Factors, Inc., supra and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The order of the District Court remanding the case to the referee for numerical designation of his findings of fact and conclusions of law and for consideration of the trustee\u2019s counterclaim did not adjudicate with any finality any substantive right in dispute between the parties with respect to the adverse claims of entitlement to property in the estate of bankrupt. Clearly, the effect of the order is to retain the matter within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court for further action before any affirmative decree settling the claimant\u2019s rights to the disputed property is issued. It is therefore interlocutory within the intendment of Section 24, sub. a of the Act, supra, and the appeal therefrom premature. Triangle Electric Co. v. Foutch, 40 F.2d 353 (8th Cir. <em>1930); 2 </em>Collier, op. eit. supra, jf 24.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">While we can find no authoritative source for the District Court\u2019s requirement that the referee separate and number his findings of fact and conclusions of law, except the general directive that such findings be made and set forth in his report (Order 47, General Orders in Bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C.A. foil. \u00a7 53), our lack of appellate jurisdiction in this instance preempts review of the interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">We agree with Standard\u2019s contention that the referee\u2019s findings of fact should not be set aside unless clearly erroneous pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable in bankruptcy cases by virtue of Orders 37 and 47, General Orders in Bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C.A. foil. \u00a7 53. However, in all the cases cited by Standard as authority for reversal of the District Judge\u2019s order, which apparently overlooked the factual determination of the referee that there was no evidence to substantiate the trustee\u2019s counterclaim, the district court decisions involved were appealable as <em>final orders </em>in controversies arising in bankruptcy proceedings. See e. g. O\u2019Rieley v. Endicott-Johnson Corp., 297 F.2d 1 (8th Cir. 1961) (final order reversing referee\u2019s dismissal of reclamation petition) ; Becker v. Shields, 237 F.2d 622 (8th Cir. 1956) (final order vacating referee\u2019s discharge of bankrupt); Rasmussen v. Gresly, 77 F.2d 252 (8th Cir. 1935) (final order vacating referee\u2019s order disallowing claim). Absence of a final order in the instant bankruptcy controversy again precludes our jurisdiction to consider the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">And finally, we wish to comment on the inadequate state of the record so the deficiency will be corrected in the event of a subsequent appeal. Standard and the District Court have pointed out that the trustee who petitioned for a review of the referee\u2019s order failed to comply with Bankruptcy Rule 19(b) of the District Court of Minnesota by furnishing neither a transcript of the evidence nor a summary of the evidence stipulated to by the parties. In U. S. Machinery Movers v. Beller, 280 F.2d 91, 94 (8th Cir. 1960), cert. denied 364 U.S. 903, 81 S.Ct. 236, 5 L.Ed.2d 195 (1960), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">\u201cOur understanding is that a district judge, called upon to review a referee\u2019s order, is entitled to have from the referee an adequate and accurate statement of the facts and the law upon which he relied in making his order. * * * It is also our understanding that, when an appeal is taken from an order such as that <em>here involved, this Court </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>must have a record which discloses the exact factual and legal basis for the order under review.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Since there is involved here a \u201ccontroversy arising in proceedings in bankruptcy\u201d and the District Court\u2019s order remanding the ease to the referee did not finally determine the rights of the parties or purport to end the litigation, the order is, therefore, interlocutory in character and not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
