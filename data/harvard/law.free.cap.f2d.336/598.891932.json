It was the District Court\u2019s view that \u201cthe single issue before us is whether or not this trust comes under \u00a7 2036 or \u00a7 2038.\u201d 221 F.Supp. 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">The indenture by which the decedent Herbert T. Ballard created the <em>inter vivos </em>trust<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in 1929 (he died December 15, 1956) contained the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-15\">\u201cBallard has irrevocably parted with the title to the securities and property constituting the subject matter of this trust estate, but reserves to himself the right at any time to make any change in the limitations herein contained with respect to the distribution of principal and income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>of this trust fund, provided that no such appointment shall be in favor of himself or his estate. Ballard further reserves the right at any time, upon thirty days written notice to the Trustee, to cause the resignation of the Trustee, which shall then state a final account of its management of the trust estate and shall deliver all the assets composing the trust estate to such other Trustee as Ballard may designate, and shall thereupon be released and discharged from all liability as trustee hereunder. In all other respects this Deed of Trust is irrevocable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The Internal Revenue Service determined that the value of the corpus of the trust was includible in the decedent\u2019s gross estate under \u00a7 2038 on the theory that under the quoted clause the decedent had retained power to alter, amend or revoke the trust except that he could not make an appointment to himself, and assessed a deficiency in tax. The estate paid the tax and later filed the instant action for refund on its theory that the trust was a transfer distinctly described in \u00a7 2036 and since it was created prior to March 4, 1931 it was expressly excluded from taxation by subsection (b). The District Court held that Commissioner v. Ridgway\u2019s Estate, 291 F.2d 257 (3 Cir.1961) and Commissioner v. Canfield\u2019s Estate, 306 F.2d 1 (2 Cir. 1962) \u201care authority for the general proposition that \u00a7 2036, * * * avoids taxation of the trust fund as a part of the gross estate when the \u2018transfer\u2019 of legal title took place prior to 1931\u201d, and entered summary judgment in favor of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The District Court erred in construing Ridgway and Canfield to be dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Neither case presented the issue as to whether \u201cthe applicability of \u00a7 2036 precluded taxation under \u00a7 2038\u201d; otherwise stated, that the provisions of the two sections make them mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">In Ridgway, the Commissioner sought-to include the trust corpus in the decedent\u2019s gross estate under a predecessor-section of \u00a7 2036, and in Canfield under \u00a7 2036, since in each instance he could not have invoked \u00a7 2038 inasmuch as-, the creator of the trust had long prior to death relinquished power reserved in the trust indenture to change its provisions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u00a7 2038 is only applicable-where the power is extant at the date of death. In both cases the critical issue was solely as to whether the act. of relinquishment, occurring after Mai'ch-4, 1931, was the \u201ctransfer\u201d, or whether the \u201ctransfer\u201d occurred when the trust, was created prior to the 1931 date. In-the instant case the decedent did not. prior to his death relinquish the reserved power to alter or amend the trust with respect to making a change regarding the income or principal, so that Ridgway and Canfield are inapposite on their facts; and for the further reason that they did not even touch upon the issue presented here as to whether the March 4, 1931 limitation provision of \u00a7 2036 \u201cprecludes taxation under \u00a7 2038\u201d, since the Commissioner there had invoked only \u00a7 2036.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">Section 2038 does not contain a provision excluding from its coverage <em>inter vivos </em>trusts created prior to March 3,. 1931 as does \u00a7 2036 (and its predecessor-sections).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">Ridgway and Canfield decided only that, a \u201ctransfer\u201d occurs at the time a trust is created and not at the time a retained power to alter or amend the trust is relinquished.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">In Ridgway we made it clear that the trust would have been includible in the decedent\u2019s estate under the predecessor section of \u00a7 2036 had it not been \u201crelieved of taxation under the exception [limitation]\u201d of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>What has been said is dispositive of the estate\u2019s first contention that the District Court did not err in its reliance on Ridgway and Canfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The estate\u2019s second contention is that \u25a0\u201cother than the powers expressly excluded from taxation by \u00a7 2036, the decedent retained no other powers to alter or amend which would subject it to taxation under \u00a7 2038.\u201d In support of this contention it asserts that \u201calter\u201d or \u201camend\u201d as used in \u00a7 2038, \u201care general in meaning and import\u201d, and apply only where the settlor retained \u201ca power to change (i. e. revoke) his act\u201d, and not merely, as here, retained power \u201cto make any change * * * with respect to the distribution of principal and income of this trust fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Section 2036(a) (2) includes in the estate of the decedent all transfers made by him during his lifetime in which he retained \u201cthe right * * * to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom.\u201d Section 2038 affects transfers \u201cwhere the enjoyment thereof was subject at the date of [the decedent\u2019s] death to any change through the exercise of a power * * * to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate.\u201d If one has the power to \u201calter\u201d or \u201camend\u201d the enjoyment of property he has essentially the same power as one who may \u201cdesignate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">We said in Mellon v. Driscoll, 3 Cir., 117 F.2d 477, 478, 479 (1941), cert. den. 313 U.S. 579, 61 S.Ct. 1100, 85 L.Ed. 1536:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-10\">\u201cThe theory of the tax is both old and familiar. The settlor\u2019s death * * * ends his power and so passes a valuable assurance of title. The statute [the 1926 Code predecessor of \u00a7 2038] has been given a liberal interpretation and taxability thereunder found in many different sets of circumstances. A shifting of economic benefits has been stressed. <em>The grantor need not be able to exercise the power for Ms own benefit and in fact may expressly exclude any alteration in favor of himself. A change in beneficiaries or a change in the amounts they are to take is sufficient. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">To the same effect see Commissioner v. Bridgeport City Trust Co., 124 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1941), cert. den. 316 U.S. 672, 62 S.Ct. 1042, 86 L.Ed. 1747 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">In the instant case the decedent reserved to himself \u201cthe right at any time to make any change in the limitations herein contained with respect to the distribution of principal and income of this trust fund, provided that no such appointment shall be in favor of himself or his estate.\u201d This reservation of \u201cthe right at any time\u201d to shift the \u201ceconomic benefits\u201d of the trust, existing at the date of the decedent\u2019s death, brought the trust within the provisions of \u00a7 2038. Mellon v. Driscoll, supra.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">There remains this to be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-18\">The text writers, and the Treasury Regulations, are in agreement that sections 2036 and 2038 \u201coverlap\u201d; that accordingly, the value of a trust may be includible in a decedent\u2019s gross estate under either or both sections, and that they are not mutually exclusive.
