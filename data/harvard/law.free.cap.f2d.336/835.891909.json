A certificate of probable cause has been granted. Appellant was convicted after a jury trial in the District Court of Hill County, Texas, for the offense of uttering and passing a forged instrument in writing relating to and affecting title to land. On appeal to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the conviction was affirmed, rehearings were twice denied, and the Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari. </em>Sheffield v. State, 371 S.W.2d 49 (Tex.Crim.App. 1962), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 833, 84 S.Ct. 45, 11 L.Ed.2d 63 (1963). On a previous appeal, appellant\u2019s conviction had been reversed. Sheffield v. State, 165 Tex.Cr.R. 354, 307 S.W.2d 100 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-29\">Appellant had been indicted on two counts under Chapter 2 of Title 14 of the Texas Penal Code. The first count charg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>ed appellant with forgery in that he aided and abetted and procured the forgery of an acknowledgment of an instrument relating to land by a notary public, Doris Sayles, in violation of Article 1007, Texas Penal Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This charge was not submitted to the jury. Count two, on which the conviction was obtained, charged that appellant, with intent to defraud, knowingly uttered and passed this forged acknowledgment to the Texas Veterans\u2019 Land Board, in violation of Article 1008, Texas Penal Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his petition for habeas corpus, appellant claimed a denial of due process, (1) in that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction for uttering and passing by finding him guilty of forging the instrument allegedly uttered and passed, an offense for which he had not been convicted; (2) that the holding of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals finding him guilty of forging the acknowledgment exposed him to double jeopardy since the forgery count of the indictment had been withdrawn from the jury and, (3) that the Texas trial court refused to hear evidence on his application for adult probation after conviction. We find no merit in these points and, therefore, affirm the denial of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">At the heart of the first two points is appellant\u2019s insistence that the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction not for uttering and passing but for forgery, a crime of which he had been twice acquitted. Appellant\u2019s principal contention on appeal to the Texas court was that the evidence was insufficient to show that the acknowledgment had been \u201cfalsely made\u201d or that it had been made with fraudulent intent by Miss Sayles, the notary. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the acknowledgment had been falsely made, but held that Article 1007 \u201cdoes not require any intent to defraud upon the part of the notary making a false certificate to an acknowledgment. We think the wilful making of a false acknowledgment is a forgery under the terms of the article.\u201d 371 S.W.2d at 52. On appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing, it was again argued that the evidence was insufficient to show that the notary had any fraudulent intent. However, the court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-11\">\u201cIn addition to the disposition made of this contention in the original opinion, it is further concluded that without regard to whether Doris Sayles innocently, or while acting as a principal, certified that M\u00edreles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>appeared before her as a notary, the evidence is sufficient to warrant the finding that the appellant had the intent to defraud and was a principal in the commission of the offense charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">While the last quoted language is not altogether free of difficulty, we do not agree that it warrants the conclusion that the court was affirming on a finding that appellant was guilty of forgery. In its opinion on rehearing, the Texas Court did not alter the explicit holding of the original decision that Article 1007 does not require an intent to defraud and that Doris Sayles was guilty of wilfully and falsely forging the acknowledgment in question. Since we hold that appellant\u2019s conviction for passing and uttering was properly affirmed, we need not reach his claim of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">After the jury imposed sentence upon appellant, he filed an application with the trial court for probation and suspension of sentence pursuant to Article 781d of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. The Trial Judge \u201cconsidered said application and the argument of counsel.\u201d The lengthy application reviewed in detail the pre-trial negotiations between the State\u2019s Attorney and defense attorney wherein appellant had sought unsuccessfully to enter a plea of nolo contendere in exchange for the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s recommendation of probation and a fine. The application also averred, among other things, that appellant was in poor health, enjoyed a splendid reputation as a law-abiding citizen, had never been convicted of a felony before, was a self-employed family man and that he would not be a burden upon the public if he were granted probation. The trial judge, however, refused to hear evidence in support of the allegations in this application, reasoning \u201cthat it was not an abuse of judicial discretion to refuse to consider probation or any other additional evidence or testimony thereon, having heard all the testimony [adduced at trial] * * As appellant recognizes, the granting or denial of probation in Texas is entirely discretionary. See, e. g., Roy v. State, 167 Tex.Cr.R. 307, 319 S.W.2d 705 (1958). His argument on this point does not raise a substantial federal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Affirmed.
