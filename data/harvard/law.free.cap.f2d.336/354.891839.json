JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b405-31\">This is an appeal from an order \u00f3f the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Thomas F. Murphy, District Judge, granting appellee\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and denying appellant\u2019s cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>motions to vacate service and dismiss the petition. We think the district court\u2019s disposition of the motions correct and affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The appellant, a branch of the Spanish Ministry of Commerce, voyage-chartered the S.S. Hudson from its owner, the appellee, to transport a cargo of surplus wheat, purchased pursuant to the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691 et seq.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from Mobile, Alabama to one or two safe Spanish ports. The charter agreement contained the New York Produce Arbitration Clause, providing for the arbitration of disputes before three commercial men in New York.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ship was delayed and sustained hull damage in discharging its cargo in Spanish ports that were allegedly unsafe for a ship of the Hudson\u2019s size. When the appellant failed to pay for the damages or submit the dispute to arbitration, the appellee instituted this proceeding under Section 4 of the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to compel arbitration. On March 22, 1963, appellee secured an ex parte order from the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>permitting service of its petition by registered mail at appellant\u2019s Madrid office. Service pursuant to this order was effected on April 1, 1963.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">On October 15, 1963 the appellant moved to vacate the extraterritorial service as unauthorized by statute. Appearing specially and supported by an affidavit of the Spanish Consul, who stated that the appellant was a branch of the Spanish Government and immune from suit, counsel for the appellant also moved to dismiss the petition to compel arbitration because of a lack of jurisdiction and sovereign immunity. Rejecting these cross-motions, Judge Murphy held that the court had <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction and granted the appellee\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Sovereign Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"Ace6\">Appellant\u2019s primary contention is that as an arm of the soverign Government of Spain, it cannot be sued in the courts of the United States without its consent, which it declines to accord in this case. Tfiere is certainly a great deal of impressive precedent to support this contention, for the doctrine of the immunity of foreign sovereigns from the jurisdiction of our courts was early entrenched in our law by Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s historic decision in The Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 3 L.Ed. 287 (U.S. 1812). The doctrine originated in an era of personal sovereignty, when kings could theoretically do no wrong and when the exercise of authority by one sovereign over another indicated hostility or superiority. With the passing of that era, sovereign immunity has been retained by the courts chiefly to avoid possible embarrassment to those responsible for the conduct of the nation\u2019s foreign relations. See Comment, The Jurisdictional Immunity of Foreign Sovereigns, 63 Yale L.J. 1148 (1954). However, because of the dramatic changes in the nature and functioning of sovereigns, particularly in the last half century, the wisdom of retaining the doctrine has been cogently questioned. See, <em>e. g., </em>Lauterpacht, The Problem of Jurisdictional Immunities of Foreign States, 28 Brit. Y. B. Int\u2019l L. 220 (1951). Growing concern for individual rights and public morality, coupled/ with the increasing entry of governments! into what had previously been regarded! as private pursuits, has led a substantial number of nations to abandon the absolute theory of sovereign immunity in fa- j vor of a restrictive theory. See Dralle v. Rep. of Czechoslovakia, 17 Int.L.Rep. 155 (Sup. Ct. of Austria 1950); Sucharitkul, State Immunities and Trading Activities in International Law (1959); Lauterpacht, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Meeting in Brussels in 1926, representatives of twenty nations, including all the major powers except the United States and Russia, signed a convention limiting sovereign immunity in the area of maritime commerce to ships and cargoes employed exclusively for public and non-commercial purposes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After World <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>War II the United States began to restrict immunity by negotiating treaties obligating each contracting party to waive its sovereign immunity for state-controlled enterprises engaged in business activities within the territory of the other party. Fourteen such treaties were negotiated by our State Department in the decade 1948 to 1958. Setser, The Immunity Waiver for State-Controlled Business Enterprises in United States Commercial Treaties, Proceedings of Am.Soc.Int\u2019l L. 89 (1961). And in 1952 our State Department, in a widely publicized letter from Acting Legal Adviser Jack B. Tate to the Acting Attorney General Philip B. Perlman, announced that the Department would generally adhere to the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, recognizing immunity for a foreign state\u2019s public or sovereign acts <em>{jure </em>imperii) but denying immunity to a foreign state\u2019s private or commercial acts <em>{jure gestionis). </em>26 Dept. State Bull. 984 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In delineating the scope of a doctrine designed to avert possible embarrassment to the conduct of our foreign relations, the courts have quite naturally deferred to the policy pronouncements of the State Department. National City Bank of New York v. Republic of China, 348 U.S. 356, 360-361, 75 S.Ct. 423, 99 L.Ed. 389 (1955). See generally, Cardozo, Judicial Deference to State Department Suggestions: Recognition of Prerogative or Abdication to Usurper, 48 Corn.L.Q. 461 (1963). The Supreme Court\u2019s dictum in Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U.S. 30, 35, 65 S.Ct. 530, 533, 89 L.Ed. 729 (1945) \u2014 \u201cIt is therefore not for the courts to deny an immunity which our government has seen fit to allow, or to allow an immunity on new grounds which the government has not seen fit to recognize\u201d- \u2014 has been variously construed,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but we think it means \u00a1 at least that the courts should deny im- \u00a1 munity where the State Department has i indicated, either directly or indirectly, \u00a1 that immunity need not be accorded. It makes no sense for the courts to deny a litigant his day in court and to permit the disregard of legal obligations to avoid embarrassing the State Department if that agency indicates it will not be embarrassed. Cf. National City Bank v. Republic of China, <em>supra, </em>348 U.S. at 360-361, 75 S.Ct. 423 (1955). Moreover, \u201crecognition by the courts of an immunity upon principles which the po- . litical department of government has not sanctioned may be equally embarrassing to it in securing the protection of our national interests and their recognition by other nations.\u201d Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, <em>supra, </em>324 U.S. at 36, 65 S.Ct. at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">This is not to say that the courts will never grant immunity unless the State Department specifically requests it. A claim of sovereign immunity may be presented to the court by either of two procedures. The foreign sovereign may request its claim of immunity be recognized by the State Department, which will normally present its suggestion to the court through the Attorney General or some law officer acting under his direction. Alternatively, the accredited and recognized representative of the foreign sovereign may present the claim of sovereign immunity directly to the court. Ex parte Muir, 254 U.S. 522, 41 S.Ct. 185, 65 L.Ed. 383 (1921). In some situations the State Department may find it expedient to make no response to a request for immunity. Where, 7 as here,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court has received no com- j munication from the State Department ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>concerning the immunity of the Comis-aria General, the court must decide for itself whether it is the established policy of the State Department to recognize claims of immunity of this type. Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, <em>supra, </em>324 U.S. at 36, 65 S.Ct. 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Through the \u201cTate letter\u201d the State Department has made it clear that its policy is to decline immunity to friendly foreign sovereigns in suits arising from private or commercial activity. But the \u201cTate letter\u201d offers no guide-lines or criteria for differentiating between a sovereign\u2019s private and public acts. Nor have the courts or commentators suggested any satisfactory test. Some have looked to the nature of the transaction, categorizing as sovereign acts only activity which could not be performed by individuals.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While this criterion is relatively easy to apply, it ofttimes produces rather astonishing results, such as the holdings of some European courts that purchases of bullets or shoes for the army, the erection of fortifications for defense, or the rental of a house for an embassy, are private acts. See Allen, The Position of Foreign States Before National Courts 31 (1933) and cases cited therein. Furthermore, this test merely postpones the difficulty, for particular contracts in some instances may be made only by states.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Others have looked to the purpose of the transaction, categorizing as <em>jure imperii </em>all activities in which the object of performance is public in character.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But this test is even more unsatisfactory, for conceptually the modern sovereign always acts for a public purpose. Lauterpacht, <em>supra, </em>28 Brit. Y. B. Int\u2019l L. at 224. Functionally the criterion is purely arbitrary and necessarily involves the court in projecting \u25a0 personal notions about the proper realm of state functioning. See Lalive, <em>supra, </em>fn. 9, 3 Recueil des Cores at 260 (1953). See also, Friedmann, The Growth of State Control Over the Individual and Its Effect Upon the Rules of International State Responsibility, 19 Brit. Y. B. Int\u2019l L. 118, 128 (1938); Setser, The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Immunities of the State and Government Activities, 24 Law &amp; Cont. Probs. 291, 309 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"> The conceptual difficulties involved in formulating a satisfactory method of differentiating between acts <em>jure imperii </em>and acts <em>jure gestionis </em>have led many commentators to declare that the distinction is unworkable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> How-I ever, the Supreme Court has made it \u00a1plain that when the State Department \u00a1has been silent on the question of imI munity in a particular case, it is the 1 court\u2019s duty to determine for itself whether the foreign sovereign is entitled to immunity \u201cin conformity to the principles accepted by the department of the government charged with the conduct of foreign relations.\u201d Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman, <em>supra, </em>324 U.S. at 35, 65 S.Ct. at 532. And since the State Department has publicly pronounced its adherence to the distinction, we must apply it to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"> The purpose of the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity is to try to accommodate the interest of individuals doing business with foreign governments in having their legal rights determined by the courts, with the interest of foreign governments in being free to perform certain political acts without undergoing the embarrassment or hindrance of defending the propriety of such acts before foreign courts. Sovereign immunity is a derogation from the normal exercise of jurisdiction by the courts and should be accorded only in clear cases. Since the State Department\u2019s failure or refusal to suggest immunity is significant,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> we are disposed to deny a claim of sovereign immunity that has not been \u201crecognized and allowed\u201d by the State Department unless it is plain that the activity in question falls within one of the categories of strictly political or public acts about which sovereigns have traditionally been quite sensitive.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such acts are generally limited to the following categories;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">(1) internal administrative acts, such as expulsion of an alien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">(2) legislative acts, such as nationalization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-14\">(3) acts concerning the armed forces.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-15\">(4) acts concerning diplomatic activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-16\">(5) public loans.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-17\">We do not think that the restrictive theory adopted by the State Department requires sacrificing the interests of private litigants to international comity in other than these limited categories. Should diplomacy require enlargement of these categories, the State Department can file a suggestion of immunity with the court. Should diplomacy require contraction of these categories, the State Department can issue a new or clarifying policy pronouncement.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">The Comisar\u00eda General\u2019s chartering of the appellee\u2019s ship to transport a purchase of wheat is not a strictly public or political act. Indeed, it partakes far more of the character of a private commercial act than a public or political act.</p>\n<p id=\"aeu-dedup-0\">\u25a0 The charter party has all the earmarks of a typical commercial transaction. It was executed for the Comisar\u00eda General by \u201cEl Jefe del Servicio Commercial,\u201d the head of its commercial division. The wheat was consigned to and shipped by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>private commercial concern. And one of the most significant indicators of the private commercial nature of this charter is the inclusion of the arbitration clause. The French Court of Appeal, in dismissing a claim of sovereign immunity where the governmental charterer had agreed to arbitration, pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\"><em>\u201cA </em>contract relating to maritime transport is a private contract where the owner merely puts his ship and the ship\u2019s crew at the disposal of the State and does not take a direct part in the performance of the public service undertaken by the State in the latter\u2019s capacity as a charterer. The charter party does not contain any clause peculiar to public law or unusual in private law. It provides for a time charter of the vessel which is put at the disposal of the State chartering it. The insertion of the arbitration clause underlines the intention of the parties to make their agreement subject to private law.\u201d Myrtoon Steamship Company v. Agent Judicaire Du Tresor, 24 Int.L.Rep. 205, 206 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Maritime transport has been included among the commercial or business activities specifically mentioned in recent United States treaties restricting sovereign immunity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> And the 1926 Brussels Convention, the first major international attempt to restrict sovereign immunity, which Spain signed but never ratified, denied immunity to all maritime governmental activities except vessels operated exclusively on non-commercial service, such as warships, patrol vessels, or hospital ships.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Even if we take a broader view of the transaction to encompass the purchase of wheat pursuant to the Surplus Agricultural Commodities Agreement to help feed the people of Spain, the activity of the Comisar\u00eda General remains more in the commercial than political realm. Appellant does not claim that the wheat will be used for the public services of Spain; presumptively the wheat will be resold to Spanish nationals. Whether the Comis-ar\u00eda General loses <em>money </em>or makes a profit on the sale, this purchasing activity has been conducted through private channels of trade. Except for United States financing, permitting payment in pesetas, the Comisar\u00eda General acted much like any private purchaser of wheat.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Our conclusion that the Comisar\u00eda General\u2019s activity is more properly labelled an act <em>jure gestionis </em>than <em>jure imperii </em>is supported by the practice of those countries which have adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity. Thus the Commercial Tribunal of Alexandria declined to grant immunity to this same Spanish instrumentality in a more difficult case \u2014 a suit arising from the Com-isaria\u2019s purchase of rice to help feed the people of neutral Spain during wartime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\">\u201cIt is not contended in the present case that the rice in question was bought by the <em>Comisar\u00eda General </em>for the needs of the Spanish public services. On the contrary, it seems \u25a0 clearly established that the.rice was bought for the feeding of the Spanish population during a difficult period. In negotiating this purchase herself, instead of leaving the matter to private enterprise, Spain proceeded in much the same manner as any other Spanish trader would have done who wanted to buy rice in Egypt; that is to say, she got it out of Egypt with the necessary permits and carried it to Spain in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Spanish ship in order to re-sell it on the usual commercial lines. This being so, the <em>Comisar\u00eda General </em>cannot claim immunity from jurisdiction, and the judgment entered against it must be confirmed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Though there are a few inconsistencies,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the courts in those countries which have adopted the restrictive theory have generally considered purchasing activity by a state instrumentality, particularly for resale to nationals, as commercial or private activity.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Finally, our conclusion that the Com-isar\u00eda General\u2019s claim of sovereign immunity should be denied finds support in the State Department\u2019s communication to the court in New York and Cuba Mail S. S. Co. v. Republic of Korea, 132 F.Supp. 684, 685 (S.D.N.Y.1955). There the Republic of Korea was allegedly responsible for damaging a ship while assisting in the unloading of a cargo of rice for distribution without charge to its civilian and military personnel during the Korean War. Though suggesting that Korea\u2019s property was immune from attachment, the State Department refused to suggest immunity \u201cinasmuch as the particular acts out of which the cause of action arose are not shown to be of a purely governmental character.\u201d If the wartime transportation of rice to civilian and military personnel is not an act <em>jure </em>imperii, <em>a fortiori </em>the peacetime transportation of wheat for presumptive resale is not an act <em>jure </em>imperii.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">The Act of State Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\"> The appellant also seeks to enter the sanctuary of sovereign immunity through the side door by urging that since the acts complained of occurred in Spanish ports, which were designated as safe by a branch of the Spanish Government, the act of state doctrine prohibits holding the Spanish Government to account for the propriety of those acts. As most recently formulated by the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Court, the act of state doctrine \u201cpre-' eludes the courts of this country from inquiring into the validity of the public acts a recognized foreign sovereign power committed within its own territory.\u201d Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 401, 84 S.Ct. 923, 926, 11 L.Ed.2d 804 (1964). The difficulty with appellant\u2019s argument is threefold. First of all, the act of state doctrine applies only to the \u201cpublic acts\u201d of a foreign sovereign, Restatement Foreign Relations Law of U. S., \u00a7 41c (Proposed Official Draft 1962), and we cannot see that designating ports as safe for the S.S. Hudson was a public act of the Spanish Government. The designation of safe ports for the discharge of cargo is an act frequently performed by merchants voyage-chartering a cargo ship. See Gilmore and Black, The Law of Admiralty 179-181 (1957). It can hardly\" be termed an act of state simply because a state instrumentality happened to be the voyage-charterer. Moreover, \u2018designation of the ports as safe was not an\u00bb* act performed within the territory of Spain, nor was it performed by the Government of Spain. Here the designation of the actual discharge ports was done on the bill of lading by the appellant\u2019s shipper at Mobile, Alabama. Appellant's act of state argument is therefore considerably wide of the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Though in most eases jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign is obtained in an <em>in rem </em>proceeding, there is no bar to the assertion of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. See Kunglig Jarnvagsstyrelsen v. Dexter &amp; Carpenter, 300 F. 891 (S.D.N.Y. 1924) (L. Hand, J.), aff\u2019d 32 F.2d 195 (2 Cir. 1929). Relying on the panel decision in Petrol Shipping Corporation v. Kingdom of Greece, 326 F.2d 117 (2 Cir. 1964), appellant contends that there is here no basis for the district court\u2019s assumption of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. In Petrol Shipping Corp. v. Kingdom of Greece, a case factually similar <em>to </em>this one, the majority of the panel held only-that Greece could raise the defense of sovereign immunity by a letter from its ambassador sent directly to the court. The full court, sitting <em>in banc, </em>altered the panel decision, vacated the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the petition to compel arbitration, and remanded for fiu\u2019ther proceedings. 332 F.2d 370 (2 Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">We hold that the district court had <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction to enter the order compelling arbitration. By agreeing to arbitrate in New York, where the United States Arbitration Act makes such agreements specifically enforceable, the Comisar\u00eda General must be deemed to have consented to the jurisdiction of the court that could compel the arbitration proceeding in New York. To hold otherwise would be to render the arbitration clause a nullity. In Farr &amp; Co. v. Cia. Intercontinental De Navegacion, 243 F.2d 342 (2 Cir. 1957) and Orion Shipping &amp; Trading Co. v. Eastern States Petro. Corp. of Panama, 284 F.2d 419 (2 Cir. 1960), this court held that \u00a7 4 of the United States Arbitration Act provides sufficient jurisdictional basis for the district court' to order a foreign corporation which had agreed to arbitration in New York to submit to arbitration. Unless the arbitration clause in this charter differs significantly from the arbitration clauses specifically enforced in the Farr and Orion cases, it is clear that the court has <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction, for we see no reason to treat a commercial branch of a foreign sovereign differently from a foreign corporation. The arbitration clause construed in Farr provided: \u201cThis submission may be made a rule of court by either party.\u201d The corresponding language in the arbitration clause in the instant' case provides: \u201c[F]or the purpose of enforcing any award, this agreement may be made a rule of the Court.\u201d Appellant argues that this slight difference in wording requires a different result, for the appellee is seeking appointment of an arbitrator, not enforcement of an award. We cannot agree. This fine distinction did not trouble this court in Orion, where the corresponding language of the arbitration clause provided: \u201cFor the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>of enforcing awards this agreement shall be made a Rule of the Court.\u201d Implicit in the agreement to arbitrate is consent to enforcement of that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The suggestion by the appellant that the subject matter of the controversy is without the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States courts is utterly devoid of merit. It has long been settled that a charter-party is a maritime contract and that disputes arising therefrom are within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States courts. Morewood v. Enequist, 23 How. 491, 64 U.S. 491, 16 L.Ed. 516 (1860).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Service of Process</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The appellant has also challenged the propriety of the extraterritorial service employed here. But since the appellant as consented beforehand to thq jurisdiction .of the district court, the sole function of process in this case was, as Judge Murphy correctly noted below, to notify the appellant that proceeding^ had commenced. This function was certainly performed. Moreover, similar service of process on nongovernmental foreign corporations was held sufficient in the Farr and Orion cases, supra. No rule of international law requires special treatment for serving branches of foreign sovereigns. See Sucharitkul, <em>supra, </em>at 350, 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Section 4 of the Arbitration Act provides that service of the petition to compel arbitration shall be made in the manner provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The language of Rule 4(d) (3), incorporated by reference into Rule 4(d) (7), which permits service in the manner employed in the state courts, provides for service on \u201ca domestic or foreign corporation or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name\u201d and would seem broad enough to cover the Comisar\u00eda General. Moreover, Rule 4(e) provided, as of March 22,1963, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">'\u201cWhenever a statute of the United States or an order of court provides for service of a summons, or of a notice, or of an order in lieu of a summons upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state, service shall be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by the statute, rule, or order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Since the appellant had consented to the jurisdiction of the court, Judge Dawson\u2019s order authorizing service by registered mail did not violate due process. And since service was effected pursuant to Judge Dawson\u2019s order, such service complied with the terms of Rule 4(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\">.

Service thereof shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is brought. The court shall hear the parties, and upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The hearing and proceedings, under such agreement, shall be within the district in which the petition for an order directing such arbitration is filed. If the making of tire arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or refusal to perform the same be in issue, the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof. If no jury trial be demanded by the party alleged to be in default, or if the matter in dispute is within admiralty jurisdiction, the court shall hear and determine such issue. Where such an issue is raised, the party alleged to be in default may, except in cases of admiralty, on or before the return day of the notice of application, demand a jury trial of such issue, and upon such demand the court shall make an order referring the issue or issues to a jury in the manner provided by law for referring to a jury issues in an equity action, or may specially call a jury for that purpose. If the jury find that no agreement in writing for arbitration was made or that there is no default in proceeding thereunder, the proceeding shall be dismissed. If the jury find that an agreement for arbitration was made in writing and that there is a default in proceeding thereunder, the court shall make an order summarily directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in accordance with the terms thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\">.

The plea of sovereign immunity for the Comisar\u00eda General in the district eourt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>was supported only by a conelusionary affidavit of tbe Spanish Consul in New York. A consul is supposedly clothed with authority to act for his government only in commercial matters. Since nothing in the record indicates that the Spanish Consul was specially authorized to interpose a claim of sovereign immunity, the affidavit was plainly insufficient. The Sao Vicente, 260 U.S. 151, 43 S.Ct. 15, 67 L.Ed. 179 (1922); The Anne, 16 U.S. 435, 3 Wheat. 435, 4 L.Ed. 428 (1818); The Secundus, 13 F.2d 469 (E.D.N.Y. 1926); Harris &amp; Co. Adv. Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 127 So.2d 687 (D.C.App.Fla. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">On appeal the Spanish Ambassador to the United States has written a letter directly to this court claiming immunity for the Comisar\u00eda General and has moved for permission to appear specially in the proceeding. We find it unnecessary to decide whether this procedure is sufficient to raise the claim of sovereign immunity or whether the defense has been waived through a failure to present it properly. Under the view we take of sovereign immunity, permitting the Spanish Ambassador to intervene at this stage in the proceedings will not materially prejudice the appellee, who does not dispute appellant\u2019s sovereign status. We therefore grant the motion of the Spanish Ambassador and treat the claim of sovereign immunity as properly presented to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b409-11\">.
