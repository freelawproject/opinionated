We need add nothing to what Judge Michie said in his opinion, except to advert briefly to one contention the Secretary advances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">It is clear that oysters, large shrimp and crabmeat cannot be refrozen and retain their quality. They must be breaded and processed when fresh, so that the defendant\u2019s operations must be geared to the seasons when they run and are available. This is substantially true also of scallops. It is not true, however, of small shrimp or of fish for processing into fish sticks, and the defendant buys substantial quantities of prefrozen fish and small shrimp.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The Secretary suggests that while the defendant\u2019s processing of oysters, crab-meat, scallops and large shrimp may fall within the Congressional intention to partially exempt those processes which are dependent upon the vicissitudes of the catch, its processing of prefrozen small shrimp and fish is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">General consideration of the necessity of prompt processing of fresh seafoods well may underlie the Congressional purpose, but the exemption the Congress provided is not so narrow. This is manifest in the exemption of those engaged in storing, packing for shipment and distributing frozen seafoods, operations which may have no, or only a remote, relation to harvesting seasons. We find in the statutory exemption no basis for a distinction between those employees who-process and handle previously frozen fish and small shrimp and those other employees of the same employer who handle and process exclusively the much larger volume of previously unfrozen products-of the sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\">.

These account for a relatively small proportion of the defendant\u2019s business, however. Its leading product is breaded oysters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
