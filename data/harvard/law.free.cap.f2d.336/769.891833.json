To aid in the exercise of its broad statutory jurisdiction, the Board has adopted self-limiting jurisdictional standards whereby jurisdiction would be asserted \u201cover all retail enterprises which fall within its statutory jurisdiction and which do a gross volume of business of at least $500,000 per annum.\u201d Carolina Supplies &amp; Cement Co., etc., 122 N.L.R.B. 88, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">As a general proposition, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, objections not urged before the Board cannot be raised in the reviewing court. National Labor Relations Act, \u00a7 10(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); N. L. R. B. v. Cheney Cal. Lumber Co., 327 U.S. 385, 66 S.Ct. 553, 90 L.Ed. 739; Marshall Field &amp; Co. v. N. L. R. B., 318 U.S. 253, 63 S.Ct. 585, 87 L.Ed. 744, rehearing denied 318 U.S. 802, 63 S.Ct. 849, 87 L.Ed. 1165. While the Board\u2019s statutory jurisdiction may be raised at any time, the facts upon which the Board determines it has jurisdiction may be challenged only up <em>on </em>timely exception, in the absence of which the Board\u2019s findings are not open to attack in the proceeding for enforcement. N. L. R. B. v. New Madrid Mfg. Co., 8 Cir., 215 F.2d 908; N. L. R. B. v. Pappas &amp; Co., 9 Cir., 203 F.2d 569; N. L. R. B. v. Townsend, 9 Cir., 185 F.2d 378, cert. denied 341 U.S. 909, 71 S.Ct. 621, 95 L.Ed. 1346. See United States v. Wilson, 10 Cir., 78 F.2d 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The Board\u2019s complaint recited that \u201cThe Respondent\u2019s annual gross volume of business exceeds $250,000, of which goods, materials, and products valued in excess of $25,000 are received directly from sources outside of Kansas.\u201d During the course of a hearing before a trial examiner, the parties entered into a stipulation which stated in part that \u201c * * * the Respondent purchased from suppliers outside the State of Kansas and received in the State of Kansas from points outside the state goods valued in excess of $50,000, that the Respondent raises no question about the jurisdiction of the Board. * * * \u201d After the examiner\u2019s decision, the case was transferred to the Board, and respondent was notified that exceptions were due within 20 days. After one extension of time had been granted to file exceptions, respondent notified the Board that it elected not to file exceptions. No exceptions were ever filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">Following adoption of the trial examiner\u2019s decision by the Board, respondent learned of the Board\u2019s self-limiting $500,000 jurisdictional factor and moved to set aside the decision and order on the ground the examiner erred in finding jurisdiction because the record did not show respondent\u2019s business to have been in excess of $500,000. The motion was denied as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\"> Respondent\u2019s reliance upon the lack of the $500,000 volume of business as constituting a jurisdictional bar is misplaced. The Board\u2019s statutory jurisdiction does not require any particular volume of business except as it may be limited by the maxim de minimis. N. L. R. B. v. Reliance Fuel Oil Corp., 371 U.S. 224, 83 S.Ct. 312, 9 L.Ed.2d 279; N. L. R. B. v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council, 341 U.S. 675, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1284; N. L. R. B. v. Fainblatt, 306 U.S. 601, 307 U.S. 609, 59 S.Ct. 668, 83 L.Ed. 1014; Kingsbury Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 8 Cir., 319 F.2d 387; N. L. R. B. v. Dallas City Packing Co., 5 Cir., 230 F.2d 708; N. L. R. B. v. New Madrid Mfg. Co., supra. No exceptions having been taken, and no extraordinary circumstances appearing which would excuse their absence, the facts upon which jurisdiction was found are not now subject to question.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">The order will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-26\">. The respondent was found to have violated Section 8(a) (3) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (3) and (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
