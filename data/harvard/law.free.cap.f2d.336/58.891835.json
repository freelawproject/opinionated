The keys are sold by manufacturers as blanks, sometimes directly to users but for the most part in quantity to busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ness concerns for them to use as gifts to customers for advertising or promotional purposes. The blank keys are cut by the purchasers on key filing machines, sometimes supplied by the manufacturer, to \u25a0fit the car of the person to whom a key is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The \u201cgolden car key\u201d, hereinafter \u25a0sometimes referred to as a key, was \u25a0originally developed in 1952 or 1953 by an Ohio corporation in the advertising \u00a1specialty business which later merged with another Ohio corporation, the plaintiff, Cole National Corporation, and thereafter operated as Cole National\u2019s Elnar Division. In January or February 1959 a principal officer of Elnar, one Kap-stein, entered into an agreement with the \u25a0defendants, Cohen and Sulkin, citizens of Massachusetts, who a short time before had organized a partnership called Allied Associates. For convenience we shall hereinafter refer to the parties as Elnar and Allied. Under the terms of this agreement Allied was to be the sole representative for the sale of Elnar\u2019s keys in New England with the exception of two existing distributors. Allied was free to sell keys outside New England but, in order to avoid conflicts with other distributors, only after clearing such sales with Elnar. Elnar sold keys to Allied for less than it sold its keys to others and allowed Allied to sell keys under its own name and to fix its own resale price. The evidence is conflicting as to whether Allied was to have the status of a \u201cdistributor\u201d of Elnar\u2019s keys and also as to whether it was to buy all its keys from Elnar. Allied forwarded its orders to Elnar and Elnar filled them by sending keys to Allied\u2019s customers in envelopes marked with Allied\u2019s name and mark. Beginning in March, 1959, Allied with Elnar\u2019s advice and assistance devoted substantial efforts to selling keys to financial institutions at which it was gratifyingly successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">On November 15, 1959, Elnar notified Allied by letter that effective a month later its price on orders of less than 2500 keys would be increased and that a separate charge would be made for \u201cart work.\u201d Allied objected and a conference was held at which it was agreed that the charge for \u201cart work\u201d would be cancelled but the price increase would go into effect. In spite of the price increase Allied was still paying less for keys than Elnar\u2019s distributors. Early in 1960 Allied ordered dies for cutting key blanks from Hazelton Chain Co. of Roxbury, Massachusetts, and on June 7, 1960, ordered 45,000 key blanks from Hazelton which were shipped beginning in July of that year. These keys bore the same identifying letters, A, B, C, and D, in the same style of type that Elnar was using and were shipped to customers in the same kind of envelopes that Elnar used. There is a dispute as to whether in some instances Hazelton keys were cut by customers on key filing machines owned and supplied by Elnar.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">In July or August, 1960, Kapstein noticed a sharp decline in Allied\u2019s orders and at a conference arranged to discuss that matter was told by partner Sulkin that business was bad in the summer but that he expected improvement in the fall. Sulkin admitted that he did not at that time tell Kapstein of Allied\u2019s order of keys from Hazelton, and apparently Kap-stein\u2019s suspicions were not aroused. In November, when Allied\u2019s orders had practically ceased, at another conference partner Cohen admitted to Kapstein that Allied had another source of supply, and friendly relations between Elnar and Allied came to an abrupt end. Elnar joined its distributors in battle with Allied, by that time incorporated in Massachusetts as Emblematics, Inc., for the golden car key business, and on December 21, 1960, brought suit against Cohen, Sulkin and Emblematics, whom for convenience we shall continue to refer to as Allied, for breach of contract, alleging that Allied had agreed to purchase keys exclusively from Elnar and charged Allied with unfair competition. Allied answered with a general denial and later filed an amended counterclaim in two counts. In the first count Allied sought triple damages under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 for violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act as amended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, and in the second count sought damages for unfair competition. Trial by jury resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff on its complaint and also a verdict for the plaintiff on the defendants\u2019 counterclaim. The court entered judgment in accordance with the verdicts and the defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The gist of the plaintiff\u2019s action was that it had entered into a manufacturer-distributor relationship with the defendants whereunder it sold keys to the defendants according to an agreement that the latter would purchase and sell the plaintiff\u2019s keys exclusively. It sought and recovered damages on the basis that the defendants had broken their agreement by purchasing keys from another source. The defendants rested their defense on the proposition that the relationship created was not that of manufacturer-distributor but instead that of seller-customer and that, in any event, they had not agreed to buy keys exclusively from the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\"> The verdicts of the jury settled the issues presented by the complaint and answer, for on this appeal the defendants do not challenge the verdict for the plaintiff on its complaint. The defendants\u2019 appeal is limited to their counterclaim. It is based exclusively on asserted errors of the trial court in excluding certain evidence offered by them in support of their counterclaim and on asserted errors of the court in its instructions to the jury on the law applicable to their counterclaim. The plaintiff as appellee asserts that the court\u2019s rulings on evidence and its instructions to the jury were correct. But it says that we need not concern ourselves with those matters because the trial court ought to have granted its motion for a directed verdict on the counterclaim on the ground that the evidence offered by the defendants was insufficient to warrant a finding for the defendants on either count. We agree with the appellee\u2019s second proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We are very doubtful indeed whether \u201cgolden car keys\u201d constitute a \u201crelevant market.\u201d But however that may be, a careful analysis of the record fails to-show any contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy by Elnar in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states. Nor does the record show any monopoly or attempt to monopolize, or combination or conspiracy by Elnar with any other person to monopolize, any part of the trade- or commerce among the several states, if, indeed, golden car keys could possibly be monopolized. Witness Allied\u2019s purchase of keys from Hazelton. The most that we can find in the record appendices-is evidence of vigorous, at times sharp,, competition between Elnar\u2019s distributors-backed by Elnar and Allied. At times-the participants fought over the same customer, and on one occasion Kapstein-. wrote to one of Elnar\u2019s distributors saying that the news of Sam Cohen in the-hospital \u201cis not my desire as I just want, to put him out of business.\u201d But evidence that Kapstein acting for Elnar put his wish into effect by unfair competitive means is lacking. It is true that, after the break in relations between El-nar and Allied in November, 1960, Elnar made available to its distributors a list of prospective customers submitted by Allied for clearance by Elnar to avoid conflicts with other distributors. But the evidence shows nothing more than the normal reaction of a former supplier forced to become a competitor by the wrongful breach of its distributor. The attempts by Elnar to compete for the customers who had previously purchased its keys through Allied, and whose business was by the jury\u2019s verdict as much its property as that of Allied, do not strike us as improper. The most we can find is evidence of tough but not unfair competition. The motion to dismiss Allied\u2019s counterclaim should have been granted. If there were errors in the exclusion of evidence or in the charge with respect to the counterclaim they are of no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ALDRICH, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ASV\">(dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">I agree with respect to Count 1, but not as to Count 2. Whatever the relationship between the parties I find it hard to see how the initially confidential list of Allied\u2019s \u201cprospects\u201d on which it had done \u201cmissionary work\u201d became Elnar\u2019s simply because, as the jury found, Allied broke its admittedly terminable-at-will agreement to buy only Elnar keys. But quite apart from this I cannot consider it proper competition to tell Allied\u2019s prospects, or any other person\u2019s, that Elnar was the sole producer of golden keys, or that Allied was no longer in a position to supply them. Indeed, it was only because Allied was completely free and able to engage in the key business that it failed on Count 1. The district court did not dismiss Count 2, nor should it have. Since I am in the minority on this, however, I will not deal with the errors which, in my opinion, it did commit under this count, but merely note my dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
