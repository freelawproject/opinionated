The principal issue presented here concerns his right to cross-examine a police officer about the reliability of the informant on whose report he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-30\">The Government\u2019s evidence was that two police officers were approached on the street by one Ethel Gaskins who told them that a man of a certain description was then sitting in the Franklin Delicatessen with narcotics on his person. The officers entered the deli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>catessen and asked two men, one the appellant herein, to step outside so they could talk to them. Outside the store, while the police were asking questions, appellant started to run. An officer tackled him across the street from the delicatessen and recovered narcotics from his coat pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Information received through an informant may be relied on if \u201cthe information given is sufficiently accurate to lead the officers directly to the suspect,\u201d Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 480, 83 S.Ct. 407, 413, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), \u201cso long as a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay is presented,\u201d Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 269, 80 S.Ct. 725, 735, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). Such a substantial basis exists where \u201c[t]he informant had previously given accurate information. His story was corroborated by other sources of information. And petitioner was known by the police * * <em>Id. </em>at 271, 80 S.Ct. at 736. Thus there are \u201crequirements of reliability and particularity,\u201d Wong Sun v. United States, <em>supra, </em>371 U.S. at 479, 83 S.Ct. 407; the information must not be \u201ctoo vague\u201d or \u201cfrom too untested a source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482, 83 S.Ct. 407. Here our major concern is with the reliability of the informant as demonstrated by information she had previously given.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The police officer testified that his informant, Miss Gaskins, was reliable, but his judgment is not the final one. \u201c[T]he deliberate, impartial judgment of a judicial officer\u201d is required \u201cto assess the weight and credibility of the information which the complaining officer adduces as probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481-482, 83 S.Ct. at 414. When a motion to suppress challenges the \u201cprobable cause for believing the existence of the grounds on which the warrant was issued,\u201d Rule 41(e), F.R.Cr.P., \u201c[t]he judge shall receive evidence on any issue of fact necessary to the decision of the motion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus the court, in determining probable cause, like the magistrate issuing a warrant, must be informed of the underlying circumstances from which the officers concluded that the informant was credible or his information reliable. See Aguilar v. State of Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964). And the evidentiary requirements are greater when, as here, a warrant is absent. <em>Id., </em>378 U.S. at 111, 84 S.Ct. 1509.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">Here the police arrested appellant solely on the information obtained from this informant. As in Kelley v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 396, 298 F.2d 310 (1961), we can say that if appellant was not arrested when he was asked to step outside, he was certainly under arrest by the time he was escorted outside and questioned by the police. Under the circumstances, the issue of probable cause to arrest depends on the reliability of Miss Gaskins as an informant. But when the appellant, acting <em>pro se, </em>attempted to cross-examine the police officer about the reliability of Miss Gas-kins\u2019 information on prior occasions, the trial court interjected: \u201cNo, we won\u2019t go into that. We are not going into that.\u201d For the reasons stated, it was error to rule out questioning as to the basis for the police officer's conclusion that the informant was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">Without knowing what testimony the officer would have given, however, we do not know how prejudicial that error was. Therefore, without reversing the conviction, we remand the case to the District Court with directions to hold a hearing on the issue of Miss Gaskins\u2019 reliability. A new trial will be ordered if the hearing shows that the lower court\u2019s exclusion of this issue from trial was prejudicial. In the absence of a finding of prejudice, the conviction will stand. Any determination of the trial judge will, of course, be appealable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>this court. See Greenwell v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 44, 47, 317 F.2d 108, 111 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In view of this disposition, we do not reach the other issues on this appeal, including the one considered in Judge Bazelon\u2019s separate opinion. Since that issue has not been heretofore raised, it too may be the subject of a motion for new trial or other relief on remand. Remanded with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-7\">. Though <em>Aguilar </em>involved a search warrant, the Court noted that the Fourth Amendment \u201cof course applies to arrest as well as to search warrants,\u201d 378 U.S. at 112, 84 S.Ct. 1513 n. 3, and thus drew upon <em>both </em>search and arrest cases in determining the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b631-7\">BAZELON, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AnR\">(concurring in part and dissenting in part) :</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">I agree with the court\u2019s opinion on the only issue it reaches. But I think the record discloses circumstances which, though not raised, amount to denial of a fair trial and plain error requiring reversal under Rule 52(b), F.R.Cr.P. These circumstances relate to the presentation of appellant\u2019s insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Henry Jackson, age 25, has been a drug addict since he was 12. On November 15, 1962, a prostitute he lived with told the police he had heroin. He was arrested and narcotics were found in his possession. He was sentenced to seven years in prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Authoritative declarations from institutions in all three branches of Government recognize a relation between drug addiction and mental illness. The President\u2019s Advisory Commission on Narcotics and Drug Abuse: \u201cMost drug addicts suffer from personality disturbances which * * * cover a wide range of psychiatric disorders.\u201d Final Report, at 54. Congress: \u201cDrug addiction is not a disease but is a symptom of a mental or psychiatric disorder.\u201d H.R.Rep.No. 2388, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. 54 (1956), U.S.Code Cong, and Adm.News 1956, p. 3293. The Supreme Court: \u201c[I]t is generally conceded that a narcotics addict, particularly one addicted to the use of heroin, is in a state of mental and physical illness.\u201d Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 667, see n. 8, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 1420, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962). Our court has recognized that \u201cThe defense of insanity based on drug addiction generally presents a jury issue as to criminal responsibility.\u201d Brown v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. -, 331 F.2d 822 (1964). In United States v. Prince, D.D.C. Crim. No. 349-63 (1963), a successful insanity defense was grounded in drug addiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-22\">Before trial, the defendant had been committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital under D.C.Code, \u00a7 24-301 for a 90-day mental examination. He was returned as competent to stand trial. The Hospital\u2019s report added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-23\">\u201c [H]e was actively addicted to drugs on or about November 15, 1962, and the criminal acts with which he is charged, if committed by him, were most probably related to that addiction. However, it is further our opinion that while Mr. Jackson shows some evidence of deviation from normal, it is not in sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>degree to warrant a diagnosis of mental disease or defect at this time, nor is it probable that he was suffering from mental disease or defect on or about November 15, 1962, that resulted in the syndrome of drug addiction present at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">\u201cSigned/ Dale C. Cameron, M.D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\u201cSuperintendent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cSt. Elizabeths Hospital\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Trial was set for 10 o\u2019clock on September 16, 1963. At 9:30 court-appointed defense counsel moved for a mental examination, alleging <em>inter alia: </em>(1) Defendant refuses to assist in the preparation of his defense; and (2) defendant\u2019s past medical record indicated the presence of a mental disease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This hearing followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">\u201c [Defense counsel]: If it please Your Honor, I have filed a motion for a mental examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">\u201cThe Court: When did you file it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">\u201c[Defense counsel] : Today. Mr. Lowther [the prosecutor] showed me that an examination had been made some time ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-14\">\u201cThe Court: You know under the rule that we have here you cannot, on the day the case is called for trial, file a motion for a mental examination. That is interrupting the ball game in the middle of the game. That is a stall, to use a vulgarism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-16\">\u201cThat will be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-17\">\u201cAre you ready for trial ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-18\">\u201c[Defense counsel]: I have been ready for trial \u2014 \u2022\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-19\">It would appear that counsel did not learn until the day of the trial that there had been a mental examination. He had been in the case one month. Other counsel had made the motion for mental examination and argued a preliminary motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-21\">Before his trial began, Jackson announced in open court that he wanted to raise the insanity defense, citing his long addiction to drugs. But the court said: \u201cThe report from St. Elizabeths says you are not a mental case. Well, I will read specifically the report [reading] * * * How would that help you?\u201d Later, however, when the defendant again asked to raise the defense, the court agreed to issue forthwith subpoenas for the doctors from St. Elizabeths who had examined the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-22\">Before the doctors appeared, the court asked defense counsel if he would be ready to question them. He replied: \u201cYes, I will be ready to proceed.\u201d Yet a few minutes before, when the defendant asked in open court for a new lawyer because \u201cthis attorney won\u2019t [\u2018subpoena doctors in my case\u2019]\u201d, defense counsel had said: \u201cThis is the first time I ever heard him ask to subpoena a doctor. * * * \u201d And this colloquy followed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-24\">\u201cDefendant: I told him to subpoena all the doctors in the case. I had a mental examination while I was at St. Elizabeths there. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-26\">\u201cDefense counsel: I have just heard of these doctors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-28\">The St. Elizabeths psychiatrists were testifying in other cases, but when they had finished, they came directly to Jackson\u2019s trial. Defense counsel then said in a conference with the judge and prosecutor at the bench that, the records he had obtained from the prosecutor and the short conversation he had just had with the doctors indicated that their testimony would not be helpful to the defendant, but that the defendant insisted on calling them. The doctors then took the stand, and defense counsel questioned them briefly. He did not ask about the extent of the doctors\u2019 contacts with the defendant. When one doctor mentioned that' he had \u201creviewed\u201d \u201cinformation regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ing his past episodes of confinement,\u201d counsel did not ask what and when these were. He did not ask about the nature of Jackson\u2019s \u201cdeviation from the normal.\u201d He did not ask whether this deviation \u201csubstantially affects mental or emotional processes and substantially impairs behavior controls.\u201d McDonald v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 120, 312 F.2d 847 (1962). He did not ask about the relationship between drug addiction and mental disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Called suddenly from other courtrooms and testifying largely from memory, without ward or personal notes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the psychiatrists said flatly that Jackson had no mental disease. But their testimony gives no assurance that they could have answered questions about his background, his deviation from the normal, and the effect of drug addiction on his mental processes. We have said that \u201c[t]he chief value of an expert\u2019s testimony in this field, as in all other fields, rests upon the material from which his opinion is fashioned and the reasoning by which he progresses from his material to his conclusion.\u201d Carter v. United States, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 227, 236, 252 F.2d 608, 617 (1957). It is for the trier of fact to decide the issue of responsibility. The psychiatrists here provided no data for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">It is conceivable that they did not even have the data.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Time and resources 3inay not permit taking the psychosocial history of each person committed for a 90-day examination, or engaging in extensive personal interviews, or making a collateral investigation. Moreover, the sources of drug addiction and its relation to crime are problems on which psychiatrists disagree. Such factors no doubt make it difficult for psychiatrists from public institutions to testify, and we can only sympathize with them. But they should advise the court when they have been unable to make the kind of examination required by proper clinical standards because of lack of time, facilities or knowledge. Dr. Owens, a St. Elizabeths psychiatrist, recently testified : \u201c [I] f you haven\u2019t done an adequate examination or complete examination, then you should not render an opinion as to the presence or absence of mental illness.\u201d Morgan v. United States, hearing on a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, presently pending on appeal in this court. No. 18,178 (Transcript, p. 244).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-17\">Late in the trial, long after the psychiatrists had testified, the prosecutor \u201cout of an abundance of caution * * * put in the record some of the medical stuff on this defendant over at St. Eliza-beths, as counsel has seen it.\u201d He then read of prescriptions for Librium, Thorazine and Tofranil given the defendant, for short periods, in considerable quantities. The drugs were prescribed by Dr. Dabney, a staff psychiatrist, who was not present at the staff conference on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>defendant and was not subpoenaed to testify at the trial. After reading from the ward records, the prosecutor testified: \u201cI may say that Dr. Dabney told me out in the hall this morning that on certain occasions people who are psychotic, if they are given large doses of Thorazine and so on, may appear to be all right. I thought the defendant should know that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Defense counsel then said he was \u201csatisfied with the recitals made by\u201d the prosecutor and expressly declined to pursue the matter raised by the medical records. Yet the prosecutor\u2019s statement had shown there was a doctor who knew something bearing on the defendant\u2019s sanity and whose evidence was essential to a fair presentation of the defense. I think it appeared at this point, if not before, that more time was necessary for the preparation of the insanity defense. Though counsel did not request it, the court <em>sua sponte </em>might well have granted a continuance. Even one day would have allowed defense counsel to investigate the nature and extent of the mental examination from which the psychiatrists concluded that Jackson had no mental disease. Since Jackson had no real opportunity to present a plainly non-frivolous defense, he did not have a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Ten years after Durham v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 228, 214 F.2d 862, 45 A.L.R.2d 1430 (1954), this record would indicate that meaningful exploration of the issue of criminal responsibility is lacking in this jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That issue is ordinarily for the jury. But the necessary corollary of the rule allowing laymen to decide responsibility is that they must be given the fullest information possible. The <em>Durham </em>rule is designed to provide such information by allowing a wide range to expert testimony. But the vitality of legal rules depends on the adversary system, in which \u201cspecially motivated persons, and parties and their counsel, * * * makes the best possible case for their side. The parties present \u2018their\u2019 witnesses, \u2018their\u2019 versions of events, \u2018their\u2019 theories of law. Such a model requires that the parties engage in a constant process of \u2018correction\u2019 of the adversary\u2019s material. Witnesses must be penetratingly cross-examined, opposing versions of events comprehensively presented, and conflicting * * * theories crisply propounded.\u201d Goldstein &amp; Fine, <em>The Indigent Accused, the Psychiatrist, and the Insanity Defense, </em>110 U. OF Pa.L.Rev. 1061 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Here the adversary system collapsed. Defense counsel and prosecutor had not studied the available information in order to present it effectively. They joined with the court in agreeing that there was no valid insanity defense. The psychiatrists did not appear as expert witnesses to present and explain their viewpoints, but as triers of fact to announce their verdict of \u201cno mental illness.\u201d The only person who took any steps to get before the court the information on which the defense depended was the prosecutor. The only adversary was Jackson himself, who insisted on his defense but lacked the financial and intellectual capacity to present it without help.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">A meaningful insanity defense requires adequate resources for examination, exploration and preparation. Medical and legal resources are scarce and Jackson is not even among the \u201cdeserving poor.\u201d He is indigent, uneducated, unemployed, and he has engaged in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>duct offensive to society. A drug addict most of his life, he is doubtless part of the shadowy sub-culture of those who live <em>for </em>their craving and <em>by </em>robbery, shoplifting, prostitution, or peddling. At the hospital, the hours necessary to discover the roots of his \u201ctragic dependency on drugs\u201d would deprive of care someone else whose need might be greater and who might respond more readily to treatment than a drug addict. Time which the St. Elizabeths psychiatrists spend in court testifying is time taken from their work at the hospital. Court-appointed counsel who give valuable days without compensation are often assigned to disturbed defendants like Jackson shown by the record to be suspicious and demanding. Moreover, there are a great number of indigent defendants and relatively few lawyers familiar with criminal trial practice. Hence, it is very often necessary to appoint lawyers who understandably know little about such practice, and even less about the special difficulties of presenting the insanity defense. The Bar has responded beyond the call of duty and good will. But how much preparation in depth can we expect under such circumstances?</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Yet we need to know the personal or social causes of the behavior we condemn not only to assess culpability but to rehabilitate the individual and to remove those causes if possible so others will not fall into the same pit. The need for prevention is plain since prison sentences too often result only in the return to the streets of more dangerous criminals. We have devised rules, institutions and procedures for determining responsibility and for discovering and preventing causes of crime, but we have not been willing to allocate sufficient resources to the task.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Economy of resources and of human feeling may be among the reasons no one wanted to discover why Jackson acted as he did. Unless society is to abandon inquiry into the culpability of people like Jackson, or dispense with culpability as a basis for condemnation, we cannot countenance such reduced justice. Even an inadequate system must provide more than Jackson had. There should be a new trial with a fair opportunity to present his defense.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-12\">. He was indicted in two counts. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4704(a) he was sentenced to 8 months to 2 years. Under 21 U.S.O. \u00a7 174, he was sentenced to 7 years, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"A46\">As in Hawkins v. United States, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 338, 340-341, 288 F.2d 122, 124-125 (1960) (concurring opinion) : \u201c * * * from all that appears in this record, appellant is nothing more than an unfortunate addict, with a \u2018tragic dependency on drugs\u2019 and no prior record of convictions \u2014 narcotics or otherwise.

Unfortunately, these statutes, which impose severe mandatory penalties that can neither be suspended nor diminished by probation or parole, are not calculated to provide \u2018the medical and rehabilitative treatment* which Congress recognized as essential \u2018to relieve [addicts] of their tragic dependency on drugs and to restore them to a constructive status in society.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-25\">.
