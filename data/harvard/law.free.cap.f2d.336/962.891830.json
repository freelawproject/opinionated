This case has been here before,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we have also previously considered the conviction of the co-defendant with whom he was tried.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before us now are appellant\u2019s contentions that illegally obtained oral and written confessions, as well as certain illegally obtained physical evidence, were used against him at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">According to police testimony, appellant was arrested at about 9:00 P.M. on a weekday evening, September 26, 1961, inside a motion picture theater in Fort Worth, where he was sitting with his wife and infant child. The arresting officers \u2014 two F.B.I. agents assisted by two local policemen \u2014 informed him of the outstanding federal arrest warrant under which they were acting, and he readily admitted he was the man sought.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Immediately after the arrest, the agents put appellant and his wife and child in a police vehicle and drove to the home of her mother where the wife and child were left. Continuing on in the car, the officers drove a few blocks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>and then parked on the street under a street lamp. The officers gave appellant their own substitute for a magistrate\u2019s advice as to his rights, and proceeded to interview him concerning the crime for which the warrant had issued. Within a few minutes, according to police testimony given at trial, appellant confessed to the crime in general terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">During this interview, according to the arresting officers, appellant voluntarily stated to them that there was a sum of money at his parents\u2019 home, the proceeds of the robbery. Immediately thereafter the four officers took appellant to that house where the group entered two bedrooms. While the police held him by the belt, according to their own testimony, appellant uncovered from their hidden caches a number of items, including $2,083.00 in currency and a toy pistol. The seized items were taken by the officers and used against appellant at trial; a number of bills were found to have serial numbers identical with money stolen from the bank, and the toy gun was also connected to the holdup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">After the recovery of the evidence in appellant\u2019s parents\u2019 home, the F.B.I. agents brought him to local police headquarters. There, according to the agents, he voluntarily signed an extensive written confession covering the crime in some detail. Appellant was not brought before a magistrate until the next afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">As noted in our prior opinion: \u201cThe Government\u2019s and appellant\u2019s versions of the relevant facts \u2014 as developed in the pre-trial documents and trial testimony \u2014were diametrically opposed. * * * Appellant * * * testified that he was \u2018grabbed ... in the back of [his] pants,\u2019 threatened with physical violence, slapped in the face when he refused to confess orally, and tricked or beaten into signing the written confession ; moreover, he denied consenting to the \u2018search\u2019 of his mother\u2019s home.\u201d 115 U.S.App.D.C. at 45, 317 F.2d at 109.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">The law requires an arresting officer to bring an accused before a magistrate \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 454, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957); Naples v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 281, 284, 307 F.2d 618, 621 (1962) <em>(en banc).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We must decide whether appellant was \u201cpromptly taken before a judicial officer as the law required,\u201d or was \u201cquestioned while held in \u2018plain disregard of the duty enjoined by Congress upon Federal law officers\u2019 promptly to take [his] before a judicial officer.\u201d Upshaw v. United States, <em>supra </em>Note 5, 335 U.S. at 413, 69 S.Ct. at 171, explaining McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>A basic purpose of Rule 5(a), F.R.Cr.P., is to make certain that a person arrested is advised <em>by a judicial officer </em>of his constitutional right to counsel and of his privilege against self-incrimination \u201cwithout unnecessary delay.\u201d If the police detain an accused \u201cuntil he ha[s] confessed,\u201d and only then, \u201cwhen any judicial caution ha[s] lost its purpose, * * * arraign him,\u201d Mallory v. United States, <em>supra, </em>354 U.S. at 455, 77 S.Ct. at 1360, the confession is inadmissible no matter how much, or how little, time was required to obtain it. The duration of the delay is not determinative, for \u201c[t]he problem is not to be solved by watching the clock * * Muschette v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 239, 241, 322 F.2d 989, 991 (1963), rev\u2019d <em>mem. on other grounds, </em>378 U.S. 569, 84 S.Ct. 1927, 12 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1964). Once the police delay presentment for the production of evidence, the detention becomes illegal and the time for admissible threshold confessions has passed. See Spriggs v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. -, 335 F.2d 283 (1964); Perry v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. -, 336 F.2d 748 (No. 17,846 decided July 31, 1964). Compare United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65, 64 S.Ct. 896, 88 L.Ed. 1140 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\"> Applying this standard, appellant\u2019s first confession must be excluded. Appellant\u2019s statements were not spontaneous admissions made immediately on arrival at a police station, while awaiting booking. Compare Naples v. United States, <em>supra, </em>113 U.S.App.D.C. at 283, 307 F.2d at 620. The parking of the police vehicle en route from the place of arrest was admittedly a detour from the path toward prompt presentment, taken for the purpose of securing statements from the accused as to the crime. <em>Cf. </em>Akowskey v. United States, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 353, 158 F.2d 649 (1946). Interviews by Government agents with accused persons in the absence of counsel may be employed to develop investigative leads as to others, but not to produce evidence for the trial of the accused. <em>Cf. </em>Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964) (and see New York cases cited <em>id., </em>377 U.S. at 205, n. 5, 84 S.Ct. at 1202 n. 5); Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-17\">Ordinarily, arrest is the culmination, ,iiot the beginning, of police investigation. Under our adversary system confessions, including those obtained after the accused has been advised of his rights by the police, are not the normal proofs upon which convictions are obtained.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Secret extra-judicial examination to produce damning evidence cannot be allowed to render useless or unavailing the right to; \u201ca trial \u2018in an orderly courtroom, presided over by a judge, open to the public, and protected by all the procedural safeguards of the law.\u2019 \u201d Massiah v. United States, <em>supra, </em>377 U.S. at 204, 84 S.Ct. at 1202. To admit such evidence \u201cwould make the trial no more than an appeal from the interrogation; and the \u2018right to use counsel at the formal trial [would be] a very hollow thing [if], for all practical purposes, the conviction <em>is </em>already assured by pretrial examination.\u2019 \u201d Es-cobedo v. Illinois, <em>supra, </em>378 U.S. at 487, 84 S.Ct. at 1763.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-18\">The physical evidence recovered from the home of appellant\u2019s parents must also be excluded. After arrest, an accused is not to be taken by the police to some location where he can be used to develop Government evidence of guilt. This court has so decided with respect to using an accused to re-enact the crime. Naples v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Watson v. United States, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 350, 249 F.2d 106 (1957); Jones v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 256, 307 F.2d 397 (1962). The same principle applies to using the accused, before presentment, to recover the proceeds or the means of the crime, as evidence. In Watson v. United States, <em>supra, </em>101 U.S.App.D.C. at 353, 249 F.2d at 109, where we considered the defendant\u2019s \u201cadmissions, his reenactment of the crime, his consent to the visit to his apartment and his turning over the clothing,\u201d we held: \u201cAll must fall together, as Mallory v. United States requires, for he was not arraigned until \u2018judicial caution had lost its purpose.\u2019 \u201d And in <em>Naples </em>the re-enactment itself, as it reached the jury through \u201cpolice description of the actions of * * * the unwarned and uncounselled prisoner,\u201d was held excludable. 113 U.S.App.D.C. at 284-285, 307 F.2d at 621-622. Similarly here, the recovery, as it reached the court through police description of the actions of the unwarned and uncounselled prisoner, as well as through the physical objects recovered, should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">The Government suggests that prompt recovery of the money was necessary to prevent its being removed by appellant\u2019s wife, who knew of his arrest. This argument goes to the reasonableness of an immediate search of the parents\u2019 home, without a warrant, by one or more of the four arresting officers, or other available police. But it could not authorize delaying appellant\u2019s presentment to take him to that home, and to use him to recover the items from their hidden storage places in the bedrooms. The currency and toy pistol were thus things \u201cof evidentiary value which the public authorities have caused [the accused] to yield to them during illegal detention.\u201d Bynum v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 370, 262 F.2d 465, 467 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">The physical objects are excludable for another reason. The police were able to find the objects only because the appellant, during a period of illegal delay, told them of the location of the evidence. Like the narcotics in Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), this evidence was \u201ccome at by exploitation of that illegality,\u201d and thus is excludable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">The written confession must also be excluded. Bringing appellant to a detective office at the local police headquarters for him to give a statement of the crime, instead of bringing him to a magistrate for presentment, is exactly what <em>Mallory </em>condemned. 354 U.S. at 454, 77 S.Ct. 1356. See Spriggs v. United States, <em>supra; </em>Perry v. United States, <em>supra. </em>Even were this statement not the tainted consequence of prior illegality, Killough v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 315 F.2d 241 (1962) (en <em>banc), </em>it would have to be excluded as a separate confession, going far beyond any other admissions made by the accused, taken during a period of unlawful delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">The Government suggests that appellant consented to the police delay and to the securing of the evidence from his parents\u2019 home. But, as this court said in Judd v. United States, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 64, 66, 190 F.2d 649, 651 (1951), cited with approval in Gatlin v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 123, 326 F.2d 666, 673 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1017-12\">\u201c * * * [S]ueh a waiver or consent must be proved by clear and positive testimony, and it must be established that there was no duress or coercion, actual or implied. Amos v. United States, 255 U.S. 313, 41 S.Ct. 266, 65 L.Ed. 654; United States v. Kelih, D.C.S.D.Ill.1921, 272 F. 484. The Government must show a consent that is \u2018unequivocal and specific\u2019 (Karwicki v. United States, 4 Cir., 55 F.2d 225, 226), \u2018freely and intelligently given.\u2019 Kovach v. United States, 6 Cir., 53 F.2d 639. Thus \u2018invitations\u2019 to enter one\u2019s house, extended to armed officers of the law who demand entrance, are usually to be considered as invitations secured by force. United States v. Marquette, D.C.N.D.Cal. 1920, 271 F. 120. A like view has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>been taken where an officer displays his badge and declares that he has come to make a search (United States v. Slusser, D.C.S.D.Ohio 1921, 270 F. 818), even where the householder replies \u2018AH right.\u2019 United States v. Marra, D.C.W.D.N.Y.1930, 40 F.2d 271. A finding of consent in such circumstances has been held to be \u2018unfounded in reason\u2019. Herter v. United States, 9 Cir., 27 F.2d 521. Intimidation and duress are almost necessarily implicit in such situations ; if the Government alleges their absence, it has the burden of convincing the court that they are in fact absent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-5\">\u201cThis burden on the Government is particularly heavy in cases where the individual is under arrest. Nonresistance to the orders or suggestions of the police is not infrequent in such a situation; true consent, free of fear or pressure, is not so readily to be found. United States v. Novero, D.C., 58 F.Supp. 275; United States v. McCunn, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1930, 40 F.2d 295. In fact, the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s plight may be such as to make any claim of actual consent \u2018not in accordance with human experience\u2019, and explainable only on the basis of \u2018physical or moral compulsion\u2019. Ray v. United States, 5 Cir., 84 F.2d 654, 656.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">Moreover, when dealing with an arrested person \u201cduring a period of unnecessary delay within the meaning of Rule 5,\u201d courts look with great suspicion on \u201cevidence that a so-called \u2018willing\u2019 but unwarned and uncounselled accused\u201d consented voluntarily to cooperate with the police. Naples v. United States, <em>supra, </em>113 U.S.App.D.C. at 284, 307 F.2d at 621. There is a presumption of involuntariness which the Government must rebut, if it can, with \u201cclear and positive\u201d evidence. See Judd v. United States, <em>supra, </em>89 U.S.App.D.C. at 66, 190 F.2d at 651, and cases cited therein. Were the police version as to the accused\u2019s cooperation always to be accepted, the law\u2019s restriction on police activity would have little effect. One purpose of the <em>Mallory </em>doctrine was to eliminate swearing contests between police and defendant as to what each said and did, by commanding that the defendant be promptly presented. The hearing before the \u201cneutral and detached magistrate,\u201d <em>cf. </em>Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948), would be an appropriate place for any waivers, consents, or confessions which the accused chose to make, voluntarily and intelligently, after judicial caution and advice of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">Here the evidence of consent is both weak and contradicted. Whether, absent the opportunity for independent legal advice, there can ever be said to be a truly voluntary and intelligent waiver of the right to prompt presentment after arrest \u2014 a right basic to our system of criminal justice \u2014 the evidence before us falls far short of establishing that any such waiver occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">There is a separate and independent ground which requires reversal here. During appellant Greenwell\u2019s trial with his co-defendant Seals, Seals\u2019 confession was admitted in evidence. On Seals\u2019 separate appeal this court held that \u201cit was error to allow [Seals\u2019] confession, obtained as a result of the unnecessary delay in arraigning him, to be put before the jury.\u201d Seals v. United States, <em>supra </em>Note 2, 117 U.S.App.D.C. at 80, 325 F.2d at 1009. Since Seals\u2019 confession may not be used even against him, it should not be used against Greenwell.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And as to Greenwell, Seals\u2019 confession is inadmis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>sible hearsay, and thus also excludable under elementary principles of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">It is true that, at trial, Green-well\u2019s name was deleted from his co-defendant\u2019s confession, and \u201cnamed person\u201d or the like substituted, as the strict rule of our cases requires wherever deletion is possible. Kramer v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 50, 317 F.2d 114 (1963); Oliver v. United States, 118 U.S.App.D.C. -, 335 F.2d 724 (1964). But with Greenwell and Seals on trial before the same jury at the same time charged with the same crime, and with other evidence in the case' connecting the co-defendants in the commission of the crime, it is difficult to believe that the jury was unable to divine who the \u201canonymous nobody\u201d referred to in the confession was. Stein v. New York, 346 U.S. 156, 194, 73 S.Ct. 1077, 97 L.Ed. 1522 (1953). Even had not a witness inadvertently mentioned Greenwell\u2019s name once in reciting Seals\u2019 confession, as did occur, the jury could well have understood that the person incriminated in Seals\u2019 admissions was the other defendant sitting next to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\"> We conclude that the admission of Seals\u2019 confession, since it was improper as to Seals, justifies the retrial of his co-defendant, Greenwell, in a proceeding in which this confession does not reach the jury,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Jones, Short and Jones v. United States, <em>supra </em>Note 5, slip opinion pp. 7-10. See Anderson v. United States, 318 U.S. 350, 355-357, 63 S.Ct. 599, 87 L.Ed. 829 (1943); McDonald v.

Previously, on direct appeal, we decided that the District Court erred in denying at least some of appellant\u2019s requests to subpoena witnesses from Fort Worth, Texas. We held that an indigent defendant\u2019s requests for subpoenas under Rule 17 (b), F.R.Cr.

We remanded for the purpose of determining whether the error was sufficiently prejudicial to require a new trial, and reserved the question \u201cwhether the facts, as developed in the present record, require exclusion of the confessions or fruits of the search under the Mallory rule.\u201d 115 U.S.App.D.C. at 47 n. 7, 317 F.2d at 111 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">The District Court, on remand, has decided that the error in denying the subpoenas was harmless.

United States, \u2014 U.S.App.D.C. -, -F.2d \u2014, p.- (Nos. 17,688-17,692, decided July 16, 1964) slip opinion pp. 3-6 <em>(en bane). </em>Indeed, we note in passing, in reference to arrest in this District without warrants, Congress has similarly provided that the arresting \u201cmember of the police force shall <em>immediately, and without delay, </em>upon such arrest, convey in person such offender before the proper court, that he may be dealt with according to law.\u201d 4 D.C.Codo \u00a7 140 (1961). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">. \u201cThe Constitution does not contemplate that prisoners shall be dependent upon government agents for legal counsel and aid, however conscientious and able those agents may be.\u201d Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 725, 68 S.Ct. 316, 324, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">. The Government cites Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957) (Justices Frankfurter, Black, Douglas and Brennan dissented), where it was not feasible to delete references to a co-defendant contained in. a confession; there the Court sustained refusal to sever the trials. But that case is not relevant here, for here, unlike <em>Delli Paoli, </em>the confession was in- . admissible even against the confessor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">. The Government claims that the effect of Seals\u2019 confession on Greenwell was harmless, since even without it there was ample evidence against him. But \u201c[w]e are not concerned here with whether there was sufficient evidence on which the [appellant] could have been convicted without the evidence complained of. The question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u201d Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 231, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963). We believe that Seals\u2019 confession may well have contributed to Greenwell\u2019s conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
