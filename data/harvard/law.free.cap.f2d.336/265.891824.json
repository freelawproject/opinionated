Inc.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b315-29\">Before MADDEN, Judge, Court of Claims, and MERRILL and DUNIWAY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b315-30\">DUNIWAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b315-31\">Richardson appeals, by a single notice of appeal, from an order dismissing his complaint as to the defendant United States of America, and from a separate, and later, order dismissing his complaint as to the defendant Don\u2019s Chemical Company, Inc. (Don\u2019s). We have reluctantly concluded that the appeal must be dismissed, as to both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-32\">The complaint is in two counts. The first is against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671 and 2674). It alleges that the plaintiff, a citizen and resident of Alaska, was employed by the United States at Anchorage as a cartographer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>draftsman in the Bureau of Land Management. It further alleges that the United States negligently failed to maintain a safe place for Richardson to work by permitting carbon tetrachloride and other dangerous and toxic substances to be released in the air around the drafting tables where he worked, causing him injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The second count is against Don\u2019s. It repeats the allegations of the first count, alleges that Don\u2019s is an Alaska corporation, that the amount in controversy is more than $10,000, and that the claim against Don\u2019s arises \u201cby virtue of the tort claim involving the United States.\u201d It alleges that Don\u2019s negligently furnished to the Bureau of Land Management carbon tetrachloride and chloro-thene in containers that were \u201cimproperly marked, as required [sic] by the regulations of the Federal Food and Drug Administration.\u201d It also alleges that the containers did not indicate the dangerous nature of the substances that they contained and did not warn users of the necessity of avoiding contact with these substances either through breathing or through the skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Don\u2019s answered, admitting the allegations that plaintiff was a citizen and resident of Alaska and that Don\u2019s is an Alaska corporation, but denying all other allegations. The United States filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that no claim was stated against it under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The order of dismissal granted in response to the motion of the United States reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">\u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint be dismissed as to the defendant, United States of America.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ala\">On its face, this is not an appealable order. It dismisses the complaint, not the action. Under rule 15(a), F.R.Civ.P., no \u201cresponsive pleading\u201d having been filed, Richardson would have a right to amend. A motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is not a \u201cresponsive pleading.\u201d (Breier v. Northern California Bowling Proprietors\u2019 Association, 9 Cir., 1963, 316 F.2d 787.) Ordinarily, an order granting such a motion to dis-\u2019 miss the complaint is not appealable. (Turnbull v. Cyr, 9 Cir., 1950, 184 F.2d 117; Williams v. Peters, 9 Cir., 1956, 233 F.2d 618; Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. v. City of Seattle, 9 Cir., 1960, 281 F.2d 896; Javor v. Brown, 9 Cir., 1961, 295 F.2d 60; Marshall v. Sawyer, 9 Cir., 1962, 301 F.2d 639.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\"> Moreover, the order does not dispose of the action. The second count, against Don\u2019s, was not affected. It remained pending and at issue. In such a case, unless the court makes the determination provided for in rule 54(b), F.R. Civ.P., its order dismissing, as to only one party, even though it dismisses the action (as distinguished from the complaint), is not appealable as a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. (Russell v. Cunningham, 9 Cir., 1960, 279 F.2d 797, 805; Russell v. Hackworth, 9 Cir., 1956, 233 F.2d 503). Thus, even though we might find that \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d such as are mentioned in Marshall v. Sawyer, supra, exist, we would still be required to dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">The second order that the court made, relating to the second count, which is against Don\u2019s alone, does not cure the difficulty. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">\u201cComplaint ordered dismissed with leave granted plaintiff to amend within twenty days to state a claim under the Pure Food and Drug Act, especially Sec. 1337 of Title 28.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>This is not a final disposition of the matter. Richardson filed his notice of appeal before the expiration of the twenty days in which he could amend. No judgment of dismissal was entered. In these circumstances the appeal is premature. See Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. v. City of Seattle, supra, 281 F.2d at 899-900.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-8\">. We come to this conclusion reluctantly, because Richardson has no possible claim against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. He is precluded by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 757(b). (Thol v. United States, 9 Cir., 1954, 218 F.2d 12) That section makes his remedy under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cexclusive, and in place, of all other liability of the United States * * * in any direct judicial proceedings in a civil action * * * under any Federal tort liability statute.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
