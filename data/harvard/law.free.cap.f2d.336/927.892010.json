But these issues are not really open to us in the state of existing authority. Zerbst v. Kidwell, 304 U.S. 359, 58 S.Ct. 872, 82 L.Ed. 1399 (1938) ; Jones v. Clemmer, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 288, 163 F.2d 852 (1947). See Order entered by this court on May 8, 1964, in Bartlett v. United States Board of Parole, No. 18,301.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-17\">The other contentions made by appellant, namely, that good time earned by him while imprisoned under the first conviction may not be affected by parole violation at all, or at least not as to that earned in respect of -the completed portions of consecutive sentences, are lacking in substance and have been rejected heretofore by the courts. See, for example, Jones v. Clemmer, supra; Frierson v. Rogers, 289 F.2d 234 (5th Cir. 1961); Grant v. Hunter, 166 F.2d 673 (10th Cir. 1948); cf. Bates v. Rivers, 116 U.S.App.D.C. 306, 323 F.2d 311 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-18\">The order appealed from is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"A3G\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b978-13\">. <em>Generally the commission </em>of a criminal offense while on parole or on a conditional release is a ground for the revocation of the release. If the parole board decides to institute revocation proceedings, it issues a parole violator warrant. However, customarily, these are not served upon the releasee immediately, but are instead held as a detainer against the prisoner while he is serving the sentence on the new conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
