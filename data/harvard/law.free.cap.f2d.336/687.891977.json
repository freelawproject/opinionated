BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b738-23\">The question here is whether the District Court sitting in Texas erred in enjoining proceedings taking. - place in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Washington, D. C. pursuant to a remand order of the Federal Trade Commission. This presents questions of jurisdiction and, assuming jurisdiction, whether an injunction was proper in light of the facts of this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Sometime in 1955, the Commission began an investigation relating, among other things, to a ...possible-violation by Weingarten of \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The investigation culminated in the filing oil January 5, 1960, of a complaint alleging that Weingarten had violated \u00a7.J5 by the inducement or receipt of promotional allowances from suppliers which it knew were granted in violation of \u00a7 2(d) of the Clayton Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because the allowances had not been made available on proportionally equal terms to competitors of Weingarten selling the suppliers\u2019 products.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the same day, the Commission instituted proceedings against eight suppliers who were alleged to have given the unlawful allowances to Weingarten.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After what all concede were the usual afi\u00f1mmst'r\u00e1tTve prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>naries, hearings on the Weingarten complaint began on June 30, 1960.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After full hearings ^terminating in the spring of 1961, the parties filed briefs, proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and presented oral| argument to the Hearing Examiner. On <em>May 1, </em>1962, Jhe Examiner issued his initial decision finding that the charge against Weingarten here involved had been established.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Weingarten gave notice on May 22 of its intention to appeal the initial decision to the Commission,., and- after extensions of time for filing briefs had been granted to both Weingarten and Complaint Counsel, the matter, was submitted on oral argument on .October 23, 1962. Five months later.' on JMareh-25. 1962, the Commission entered the order enjoined by the District Court which remanded the case for further, but limited, hearing before the Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The gist of the Commission\u2019s opinion and order of March 25 was that the initial decision could not stand because of certain defects in proof and certain procedural defects in the fact findings of the Examiner\u2019s initial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">The District Judge held that by virtue of the remand, the Commission had violated the command s of \u00a7 6(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to \u201cproceed with reasonable dispatch to conclude any matter presented, to it.\u201d Consequently he enjoined the Commission and the Hearing Examiner from proceeding with the remand. He did not tell the Commission what disposition to make of the Weingarten complaint, but he did order that the Commission dispose of it on its own with no remand to an Examiner, and that it be finally disposed of within 30 days. Its motion for stay pending appeal ,\u25a0 having been denied, the Commission dis-/ missed the complaint without prejudice to its being reopened in the event the litigation in this Court was concluded in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">The Commission contends at the outset that the District Court was, without jurisdiction to interfere with the orderly course of the administrative proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Urging'that the statutory appeal to the Court of Appeals provided in \u00a7 5 (c) <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the Federal Trade Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Act is exclusive,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Commission asserts that it constitutes a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law which bars) an injunction suit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Weingarten, on the! other hand, contends that the remedy 1 provided by \u00a7 5(e) is inadequate to pro- j tect its right to a disposition with reason- I able dispatch and that jurisdiction wasv/ properly invoked pursuant to decisions like Leedom v. Kyne, 1958, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210; McCulloch v. Sociedad Nacional, 1963, 372 U.S. 10, 83 S.Ct. 671, 9 L.Ed.2d 547; Amos Treat &amp; Co. v. SEC, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 489, 1962, 306 F.2d 260; and Deering Milliken, Inc. v. Johnston, 4 Cir., 1961, 295 F.2d 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Although we recognize that the grant of jurisdiction in Leedom-type cases is a narrow one, Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 1964, 376 U.S. 473, 84 S.Ct. 894, 11 L.Ed.2d 849, 854, we think we should not express any opinion in this area of jurisdiction when it is not necessary to a disposition of the case. Assuming, without deciding, that the District Court had jurisdiction to enjoin the remand proceedings, we conclude that the order did not violate the command of \u00a7 6'(a) to 'proceed liyith reasonable dispatch, nor were the proceedings otherwise defective as claimed. Consequently, the District Court erroneously enjoined the Commission and its staff from proceeding under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Weingarten builds its argument that \u00a7 6(a) has beSn violated by charging (1) that the Commission is guilty of unexcused delay in th\u00e9 disposition of the administrative proceedings and (2) that the remand was an attempt by a biased Commission to implement an arbitrary prejudgment that Weingarten had violated the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">With respect to delay, Weingarten\u2019s claim rests on the simple contention that as a matter of law the Commission is not proceeding with dispatch when a complaint pends for some 2 and % years before a Hearing Examiner and 11 months thereafter before the whole Commission. Absent proof of the normal time necessary to dispose of a similar proceeding or of facts tending to show a dilatory attitude on the part of the Commission or its staff \u2014 matters totally undeveloped on this record \u2014 we are unable to say that a Judge can so hold. So far j as this record shows, this case not only \u00cd proceeded at a rate comparable to that! normally experienced in cases of its kind, f it also proceeded at a rate satisfactory tot Weingarten. This record is barren of] any suggestion that Weingarten at any time between January 5, 1960, the dat$ the complaint was filed, and March 25), 1963, the date the Commission entered its order of remand, ever complained about the pace of the proceedings. The^ record does reveal that extensions of timet for filing briefs before the full Commissi sion were granted to both Weingarten! and Complaint Counsel, and doubtless other extensions at other stages were granted to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-14\">Of course the Supreme Court and all Courts in a supervisory role are concerned with delay. It has recently had occasion to deplore the \u201cnigh interminable\u201d delay in connection with some j administrative agency proceedings. FPC v. Hunt, 1964, 376 U.S. 515, 84 S.Ct. 861, 11 L.Ed.2d 878, 886. And we are the ! first to emphasize that agencies must; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>exert the greatest resourceful, imaginaf five ingenuity in devising procedures f which in a day of ever-expanding dockets | will permit the regulatory process to \u00cd function properly with reasonable dis-<em>j </em>patch. Hill v. FPC, 5 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 355 [1964]. But we think it would \u00cd be the extremely rare case where a Court i would be justified in holding \u2014 as Weingarten urges us to do here \u2014 that the passage of time and nothing more presents an occasion for the peremptory intervention of an outside<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Court in the 1 conduct of an agency\u2019s adjudicative pro- ^ ceedings. This is certainly not such a case, and the decision of the District Judge, insofar as it rests on this foundation, is clearly wrong and cannot stand.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"> The other contention with respect to the asserted denial of. the \u00a7 6(a) right to a disposition with reasonable dispatch must be considered in light of tlje Commission\u2019s established power of rpmand for further hearing before an examiner. Weingarten concedes, as it must, that the Commission has the power to remand a case for the taking of additional evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But, says Weingarten, the Commission violates the command of |\u00a7 6(a) because its purpose in the sub-1 sequent proceedings is to implement the | Commission\u2019s arbitrary prejudgment of i Weingarten\u2019s guilt even though the proceeding to adjudge that, legally and factually, has not yet been concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">The basis of the charge is this. The Commission, with candor, held in its March 25, 1963, order that it could not enter a cease and desist order against Weingarten on the administrative record as then developed. The reasons were two-fold. First, the Commission agreed with Weingarten that the record did not then contain evidence qualitatively sufficient to establish that at the time of the solicitation and receipt by Weingarten of promotional allowances from the suppliers, other customers of such supplier were competing with Weingarten in the distribution of goods of like grade and quality sold by such supplier. Second, the Commission found that the initial decision of the Hearing Examiner did not conform to the requirement of both the Administrative Procedure Act and the Commission\u2019s Rules that the reasons or basis for findings and conclusions upon all material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record be stated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Noting that Weingarten did not question that element [1] of the violation<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was made out, the Commission made this observation about element [2];</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u201cProof sufficient to establish the second criteria should not be difficult to adduce, since it involves merely a showing of the exact identity of the \u25a0products purchased by the respondent from a supplier who granted it .an allegedly discriminatory promotional allowance and the same showing for any of respondent\u2019s compet\u00ed- , tors who did not receive the allowance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-14\">The Commission then remarked that the 10 witnesses relied upon by Complaint Counsel to prove this element of the case<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cwere probably in command of the facts needed to satisfy this criteria but the examination by counsel failed to elicit them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-15\">At this point, the Commission presented detailed examples by way of illustration of \u201cthe defects in the evidence.\u201d Organizing the examples into distinct categories of retailer<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and wholesaler<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> testimony, the Commission found a number of things which made the testimony of these witnesses inadequate on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>to then base a conclusion. After reviewing this evidence, the Commission concluded that although <em>\u201ca </em>good deal of reliable and important information was secured from the ten \u2018competitor\u2019 witnesses,\u201d the evidence was not then sufficient on which to base a conclusion as to element [2], Observing that a \u201cdefinitive finding\u201d on elements [3] and [4] <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> could not be made until element [2] was resolved, the Commission deferred consideration of these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Expressly recognizing that a \u201cremand of a case to a hearing examiner for further proceedings is never lightly ordered,\u201d the Commission proceeded to state its justification for the action being f taken.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u201cThis matter has now been in litigation for slightly more than three i years and both the public and re<em>s</em>pondent have incurred substantial expense in its trial. As we stated earlier; this case is attended with a <em>I </em>great deal of public interest<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and to now order dismissal for failure of proof without finally deciding the legality or illegality of the respondent\u2019s acts would waste all of the 1 money and effort heretofore expended. This would be a disservice both to the respondent and to the public and cannot be seriously contemplated. There is no question but that the public interest cannot be permitted to suffer because of the mistakes of Commission personnel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The Commission concludes that the remand \u201cdoes not envision a complete retrial of all of the issues involved in [the]i proceeding.\u201d It confined the hearing on remand to receipt of evidence \u201cpertaining to questions which [the] opinion, points out cannot be decided on the present record,\u201d and suggests that not \u201cmore than five full hearing days for each side-will be needed to adequately shore up-[the] record.\u201d It then suggested that-the hearing \u201cbe concluded with dispatch- and * * * [ordered] that the hearing examiner and the parties make every effort to complete the reception of evidence within 90 days.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">To this Weingarten responds that the language of the opinion, the uncertainty of Complaint Counsel and the Hearing Examiner as to how to proceed on remand, and the alleged inability of Complaint Counsel to adduce the evidence required by the Commission\u2019s opinion demonstrate that the remand is purely and simply the attempt of a biased Commission to effectuate the prejudgment of. Weingarten\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Weingarten attempts to demonstrate-prejudgment by quoting excerpts such as; \u201cproof to establish the second criteria should not be difficult to adduce,\u201d \u201cthese-witnesses [10 \u2018competitor\u2019 witnesses] were probably in command of the facts-, needed to satisfy this criteria but the examination of counsel failed to elicit them,\u201d the \u201cpublic interest should not be permitted to suffer because of mistakes of Commission personnel,\u201d not \u201cmore than five full hearing days for each side will be needed to adequately shore up this record,\u201d and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Weingarten then tries to build a structure of prejudgment out of the colloquy between the Examiner and Counsel on the initial exploratory conference after the remand order.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Finally, Weingarten suggests that if the evidence was not uncovered by the five years of investigation and three years of trial by experienced counsel, it does not exist. Support for this proposition is generated, says Weingarten, by the fact that the Commission did not take the evidence itself, rather than remanding to the Hearing Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">In our view, none of these factors, whether considered singly or in the aggregate, demonstrate the alleged prejudgment. The Commission opinion, taken as a whole represented a proper \u2022\u2022adjustment of the rights of the public and Weingarten. It was not prejudgment at that stage for the Commission to indicate some likely, even though tentative, views. For example, there was no real question about the solicitation and receipt of allowances by Weingarten. 'This, of course, is not unlawful. But the record also revealed that business organizations which operated or supplied two or more retail outlets had purchased goods from the same suppliers without \u2022receiving allowances. With the record in \u25a0 this stage of development, the Commis:sion\u2019s action shows no prejudgment. On the contrary, it shows the Commission\u2019s \u25a0careful regard for the protection of the rights of both Weingarten and the public in its insistence on evidence which not \u25a0only pointed the finger accusingly at the respondent, but qualitatively afforded a reliable basis for a final adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahf-dedup-0\">\u201cAntitrust cases and, in particular, Robinson-Patman cases require a meticulous attention to minute details. When dealing with prices, allowances and goods of like grade and quality, the Commission may not indulge in assumptions or presumptions, for these matters are susceptible of exact proof and this is the type of showing which must be made. The evidence adduced in this record in support of the element under consideration is, of course, not totally lacking in probative value, for a good deal of reliable and important information was secured from the ten 'competitor\u2019 witnesses. But the evidence does not quite reach the level of reliability and sub-stantiality necessary for a concrete finding on this particular point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The Commission\u2019s analysis of the deficiencies of this testimony, notes 18 and 19, supra, reflects that there was good basis for the conclusion that, the evidentiary details thought desirable to give comprete Trustworthiness to the testimony would be readily forthcoming, probably from these very witnesses themselves. If not, it seems plain to us that apart from mechanical difficulties, there could hardly be any real problem in getting data as to exact sales and purchases, item by item, made by these suppliers and competitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Under such circumstances, what is a Commission charged by statute with the serious responsibility of effectuating statutory policy to do? Must it, on the1, one hand, in the face of a record indicating substantial basis for a likely finding of statutory transgressions, simply acquiesce in a default, largely for technical, not substantive, deficiencies? Or must it, out of some supposed attitude of# administrative advocacy, press on, leaving the respondent to its appeal to the Court of Appeals whose dockets are already overcrowded without adding ajs grist to the judicial mill deficiencies which the administrative body is perfectly willing procedurally to correct? Cf. McDowell v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir., 1962, 310 F.2d 43, 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">If \u2014 and fortunately the if does not exist \u2014 due process is measured by mere externals, there might be some concern that a tribunal had \u201cprejudged\u201d by making a tentative, though uncertain, judgment. But in the light of actions by Courts, it would be a strange thing for Courts to censure administrative agencies for doing what Courts often do. Thus, for example, under Bryan v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>United States, 1950, 338 U.S. 552, 70 S.Ct. 317, 94 L.Ed. 335, and cases such as our own Gulf Oil Corp. v. Wright, 5 Cir., 1956, 236 F.2d 46, we frequently remand both criminal and civil cases for a full or partial retrial. Such situations are, in effect, a holding that while the evidence was legally deficient, nevertheless the record indicates that more or better evidence \"is available on a new or further trial and a system of justice dedicated to the objective of finding the truth ought not to balk at affording an opportunity of \u201cshoring up\u201d the case. That the Examiner expressed some quandary is of no moment. Doubtless many times both the District Judge and the lawyers are uncertain whether in remands we meant what we said or said what we meant.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But n\u00f3 one has yet argued that merely because the exact nature of the proceeding on remand is left to the rather loosely confined discretion of the District Judge in light of what in some cases may arguably be unhelpful direction from an appellate court, the remand is itself somehow defective. That is in essence what Weingarten urges here, and it is plain that we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Actually the District Judge, by permitting the Commission itself to take action within 30 days, recognized that it was proper for the Commission to obtain additional or clarifying evidence. But this prohibition on the use-of an Examiner is an unwarranted intrusion into the administrative process by a. Judge. Unlike traditional court proceedings which have a constitutional genesis, and function so that judging must ordinarily be done by Judges, not Masters, LaBuy v. Howes Leather Co., 1957, 352 U.S. 249, 77 S.Ct. 309, 1 L.Ed.2d 290, Congress recognizes that in administrative adjudication much must be left to-hearing officers. Indeed, it is the fact, finding function through the inescapable-, use of hearing officers, their sense of independence, and the review of their findings which has been at the core of the-concern for improving the quality of such actions. With the wide range of its statutory responsibilities, the number and. complexities of the kind of matters it. must handle,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> there is simply no basis-for the District Judge taking it on himself to tell the Commission how it should: husband and deploy its resources and. manpower.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">In light of what we have said in Part II concerning the alleged prejudgment of Weingarten\u2019s case, the argument that the proceedings before the Commission must be stopped because bias and. prejudice has reared \u201cits ugly head,\u201d' NLRB v. Phelps, 5 Cir., 1943, 136 F.2d 562, 564, is equally lacking in merit.. This is not a case like Accardi<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> where-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>\u201cthe authority having the ultimate decision dictated the result to the body charged with the initial decision. Neither is it a ease like Amos Treat<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> where \u2022one who actively engaged in the prosecution of a case at its initial stages became .a judge of guilt or innocence at a later stage. There is here no direction to convict \u2014 no intimation as to how the initial decision should be made. Indeed, in light \u25a0of the strict standard of proof announced by the Commission and the rigid directions in regard to the making of findings of fact by the Hearing Examiner, the initial decision may well be in favor of Weingarten.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">In light of the foregoing, it is apparent that the injunction must be dissolved.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> That means, of course, that the Commission is free to reinstate the case on its \u25a0docket and proceed pursuant to the remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Nothing we-have said is to be interpreted as a gratuitous effort to influence .any Court of Appeals to which the final \u25a0order, if issued, may be appealed. Ours is quite a different function in reviewing the intrusion ofjm \u201coutside\u201d Court into the incompleted-administrative proceedings. Approached from this vantage point, the reasonableness of agency action of the sort here involved must be tested in light of our recent observation that \u201cCourts are finding day by day that there is both a need to meet extraordinary problems and ample procedural resources to do the job.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We cannot say here that the Commission\u2019s adoption of a procedure somewhat akin to the two-bite process approved in Hill for some Federal Power cases is an unreasonable accommodation of procedural resources to the job at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Reversed with directions to dissolve the injunction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\">. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45.

The complaint also charged a further violation of receiving the promotional allowances and converting them to its own use rather than expending them in advertising and promotion of the suppliers\u2019 goods.

The Third Circuit only recently approved a <em>sua sponte </em>remand by the Commission for the taking of additional evidence. Scott Paper Co. v. FTC, 3 Cir., 1962, 301 F.2d 579, 584, approving Procter &amp; Gamble Co., 1961, 3 CCH Trade Reg.Rep. (1961 Trade Cases) par. 15,-425. The power of remand was recognized in Texaco, Inc. v. FTC, D.D.C., 1962, 1962 Trade Cases par. 70,382, stay pending appeal denied, D.C.Cir., 1962, 1962 Trade Cases par. 70,383. The remand power is conferred by \u00a7 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1007, Attorney General\u2019s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 84-85, and is expressly recognized in the Commission\u2019s Rules of Practice 4.19(d) (1), (2); 4.22(a), 16 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 4.19(d) (1),(2); 4.22(a). Certainly the Commission\u2019s obligation to protect the public interest, P. Lorillard Co. v. FTC, 4 Cir., 1950, 186 F.2d 52, 55, forms a basis for the exercise of the remand power, and Courts remand matters to the Commission under similar circumstances as a matter of course. E.g., Scott Paper Co. v. FTC, 3 Cir., 1962, 301 F.2d 579. In one of the related supplier cases, see note 4, supra, the Court remanded to allow the respondent to develop evidence of a defense. Shulton, Inc. v. FTC, 7 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 36. Finally, the discretion of the Commission to regulate its affairs is doubtless no less than that affirmatively held to have been conferred on the NLRB in Deering Milliken, Inc. v.

The gist of the violation here charged is that Weingarten violated \u00a7 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by the knowing receipt or inducement of a promotional allowance violative of \u00a7 2(d) of the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson Patman Act. The Courts have uniformly endorsed this formulation by the Commission of the controlling legal principle. Grand Union Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 92; American News Co. v. FTC, 2 Cir., 1962, 300 F.2d 104; Giant Food, Inc. v. FTC, D.C. Cir., 1962, 307 F.2d 184. In the Commission's words, the basic factual elements \u2022of the offense are (we have enclosed the numbers in [ ] for ease of reference) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u201c[1]. The solicitation and receipt by respondent in commerce of payments for \u25a0promotional services in connection with the resale of a supplier\u2019s product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u201c[2]. That at approximately the time \u25a0of the solicitation and receipt, other customers of the supplier were <em>competing </em>with the recipient in the distribution of the grantor-supplier\u2019s goods of like grade and quality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">\u201c[3]. The payments received by respondent were not affirmatively offered by the suppliers to such competing customers on proportionally equal terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">\u201c[4]. That respondent possessed information sufficient to put upon it the duty of making inquiry to ascertain whether the granting suppliers were making such payments available to its competitors on proportionally equal terms.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b743-11\">. The 10 witnesses were employees or officers of retailers or wholesalers distributing goods in one or more trade areas served by Weingarten.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b743-12\">. As respects retailer witnesses, the Commission observed failure to develop the form of business organization utilized by certain retail units, the exact capacity or position occupied by the witness with the organization, the specific products of suppliers granting allowances to Wein-garten purchased and resold by allegedly competitive retail units during the relevant 1958 and 1959 periods, the volume of such products purchased and resold, whether such products were stocked in all stores of the retail unit, and if not, the identity of the stores stocking such products.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b743-17\">. With respect to the wholesaler testimony, these witnesses were apparently all officials of food wholesaling concerns which conducted a substantial part of their business with voluntary groups of cooperating retailers who trade under the same name and purchase the bulk of their supplies from the particular wholesalers. Complaint Counse contended that these groups should be considered as a competitive unit as to Weingarten in the distribution of goods. As to this testimony, the Commission noted that it did not reveal the portion of the wholesalers\u2019 purchases from allegedly discriminating suppliers which were resold to retailers which did not belong to the cooperative group, did not show whether suppliers considered the retailer-wholesale cooperatives as a unit and normally paid promotional allowances to them as a unit, failed to show in sufficient detail the operation of the groups particularly with respect to their dependence on the participating wholesalers, and did not identify the particular member stores in competition with Weingarten or in instances where stores were shown to compete failed to show that these stores handled and sold items similar in grade and quality to those purchased by Wein-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>garten from suppliers who granted it an allegedly discriminatory promotional allowance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b744-11\">. The elements are detailed note 16, supra. \u201e</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b744-13\">. The public interest referred to here by the Oommission is developed at an earlier point in its opinion. Basically, the Commission position is that it has two methods of attacking what it apprehends is a knowing inducement of promotional allowances violative of \u00a7 2(d) of the Clayton Act. It may proceed against the alleged inducing customer as it did here or it may bring complaints against each supplier thought to be granting a discriminatory promotional allowance. The latter approach would, in the Commission\u2019s words, ordinarily \u201cresult in a myriad number of suits with attendant expense.\u201d Whereas a \u201csuccessful prosecution [of the customer] may effect the cessation of a whole series of law violations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b744-15\">. The balance of the Commission\u2019s opinion is devoted to demonstrating the formal deficiencies in the initial decision. No complaint is here made by either party of the Commission\u2019s action in this respect, and in such ominous silence we express no opinion as to its correctness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b746-5\">.

A brief look at the Federal Trade Commission Annual Rep. 1963 gives a clear indication of the variety and immensity of the task, which aided by its 1,178 staff members, it must perform. For example, the Commission processed outside 4,562 applications for complaint of deceptive practices and reviewed 516,352 radio and TV scripts of commercials and 302,572 pages of print material. It received 1,-309 applications for complaint of restraints of trade and issued 230 complaints and 261 orders. It made a total of 14,682 inspections in the process of' enforcement of the wool, fur and textile-acts. The 19 attorneys assigned to do-appellate work for the General Counsel\u2019s Office handled 127 cases, an increase-of 41 over the previous year. In addition to issuing a total of 431 complaints- and 454 cease and desist orders, the-Commission conducted numerous economic studies and under its industry guidance program handled by letter and. telephone more than 1,500 requests from.businessmen on how to resolve their difficulties in conforming their practices: with the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b746-11\">.
