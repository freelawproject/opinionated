The merits of the plaintiff\u2019s ease have not been determined. The appealability of the order denying the petitions of intervention, cannot be separated from the substantive questions presented. The order is appealable if the applicants can intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a), F.R.Civ.P.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> **or if the trial court abused its discretion in denying a permissive intervention under Rule 24(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">Rule 24(a) (2) permits intervention of right upon a timely application \u201cwhen the representation of the applicant\u2019s interest by existing parties is or may be inadequate and the applicant is or may be bound by a judgment in the action.\u201d We pass without comment the question, of whether the petitions of intervention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>were timely and the question of adequacy of representation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"> Applicants argue that the \u201cis or may be bound\u201d language of Rule 24 (a) (2) is only a practical test which is satisfied if an adverse judgment would seriously prejudice those who seek to intervene.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This circuit, however, is committed to the view that the test is whether the applicants will be bound under the doctrine of res judicata.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The applicants do not come within this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Applicants Degges allege in their motion to intervene that they own, subject to an agreement to sell, the corporate stock of the company which owns the ditch; that they are water users under the ditch; that the ditch system should be kept intact during the period of the agreement; and that the City has injured their property interests. Applicants Mannings and Goyers own property which was served by the ditch before its destruction. They seek damages for the water which they have lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">No joint ownership is asserted and no privity is claimed. The applicants are not indispensable parties to the litigation. A decision in this case will not bind them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> Permissive intervention under Rule 24(b) is discretionary with the trial court which, in exercising that discretion \u201cshall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\u201d The record shows that the trial court considered these factors and determined that such delay and prejudice would result. We find no abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-21\">. Sutphen Estates, Inc., v.
