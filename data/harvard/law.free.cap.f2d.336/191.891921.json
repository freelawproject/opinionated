The investigation was conducted by a representative of the Secretary of Labor under the authority of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(a) which empowers the Secretary \u201cwhen he believes it necessary in order to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate. any provision of this chapter * * * to make an investigation and in connection therewith * * * [to] question such persons as he may deem necessary to enable him to determine the facts relative thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-24\">The appellant\u2019s principal submission is that the Secretary had no power effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>tively to grant immunity. This contention, which purports to be based on the statutory language and the legislative history is wholly without foundation. The language of Section 521(b) clearly incorporates by reference Sections 49 and 50 of Title 15. Section 49 of Title 15 provides for immunity for witnesses who are required to testify after a claim of privilege. Nothing in the legislative history of Section 521 casts any doubt on the conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Appellant\u2019s other contentions are equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Orders affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
