Federal Communications Commission, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 346, 349, 258 F.2d 440, 443 (1958). There we held that in considering an existing licensee\u2019s protest against the grant of another license, \"\u201cthe Commission had the power to determine whether the economic effect of -a second license in this area would be -to damage or destroy service to an extent inconsistent with the public in-terest.\u201d We held that \u201cwhen an existing licensee offers to prove that the -economic effect of another station would ibe detrimental to the public interest, the Commission should afford an opportunity for presentation of such proof * * We had no occasion to, and did not, undertake to say how detailed the protesting licensee\u2019s offer of proof must be in order to entitle him to a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">In its petition to the Commission for reconsideration in the present ease, appellant KGMO alleged</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">(1) That the area served suffers from substantial unemployment; quoting official figures, county by county, and concluding that the area \u201ccannot provide support for a new advertising medium\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">(2) That there are already ample \u201ccompetitive media\u201d, namely six radio stations, one television station, three daily newspapers and ten weekly newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">(3) That during KGMO\u2019s fiscal year ending August 31, 1962, its net loss from operations was $8,200.08. \u201cUnder new ownership the station is being slowly brought back to more favorable financial operating posture. For example, for the six months period ended February 28, 1963, the station showed a net profit from operations of $2,445.08, although for the month of February 1963 there was an operating loss of $293.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-17\">(4) That the applicant, now the in-tervenor, \u201cestimated that the revenues of the [new] station for its first year of operation would be $46,000.00 * *. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Assuming only 15% of such revenues came out of revenues now being earned by KGMO \u2014 this would result in operating losses to KGMO unless annual operating expenses were reduced. This would require that petitioner curtail or discontinue the services it has been providing at no cost to public service organizations\u201d some of which are named, and also \u201cdiscontinue various regularly scheduled programs * *</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">The petition also said: \u201cPetitioner offers to prove that operation of the new station * * * would have an adverse economic effect on petitioner\u2019s station such as to cause losses of valuable services to the public and * * * would produce the result that neither licensee would be able to provide the services needed by the public in the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">In denying appellant\u2019s petition for reconsideration, the Commission did not attempt an \u201call inclusive\u201d statement but gave illustrations of \u201cthe type of information\u201d it thought \u201cnecessary to support a <em>Carroll </em>issue\u201d, including the amount and trend of retail sales in the area, advertising revenue earned and advertising revenue available, whether some businesses could but do not advertise on radio, the cost of petitioner\u2019s public service programming, and the savings that might be made by dropping or moving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">We think it is within the Commission\u2019s authority to require more information than appellant gave. But since appellant had no notice, in the Commission\u2019s past decisions or otherwise, that more would be required, the petition should not be denied on the ground that more was not furnished. We therefore remand the case to the Commission. Unless it decides the case on other grounds, it should permit appellant to amend and amplify the petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission may in its discretion consider and act upon any of its Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-15\">.

The intervenors\u2019 application for a construction permit had then been pending some nineteen months. Other1 facts follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Before the Commission in 1961 was-an application filed in behalf of the appellant by the former owner of KGMO1 to change the frequency of its standard broadcast station from 1220 KC to 1550' KC. On August 21,1961, the intervenorsfiled an application to construct a new standard broadcast station to utilize the 1220 KC frequency, but only in the event that the KGMO application for change in frequency should be granted. The intervenors gave prompt public notice of their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">While the intervenors\u2019 application was-thus pending, the former owner of KGMO1 sold his interest in the corporation to its present principals. The latter then,, on February 13, 1962, filed an application for consent to such transfer which was approved by the Commission on April 6, 1962. At that time there was-not only another standard broadcast station, KFVS, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, a city of some 25,000 population, but the area was being served by some five other radio stations as well, as KGMO well knew.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">On May 11, 1962, the Commission granted the KGMO application for a change of frequency to 1550 KC, thus leaving available to the intervenors the former KGMO frequency of 1220 KC.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-15\">Some seven months thereafter, on November 2, 1962, the Commission gave public notice that the intervenors\u2019 application was to be ready for processing as of December 11, 1962. The Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>=sion\u2019s notice fixed December 10, 1962 -as the \u201ccut-off\u201d date, and called attention of any party in interest who might de\u25a0sire to file section 309(d) (1) pleadings to section 1.359(i) of the Commission\u2019s 'rul\u00e9s relating to the time for filing and other requirements as to such pleadings. KGMO filed no petition to deny. No \u2022objections were voiced by KFVS or any \u25a0other station.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">After our decision in Carroll Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Commun. Com\u2019n,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Congress caused hearings to be held in April, 1960, and thereafter adopted Public Law 86-752,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cAn Act to promote the public interest by amending the ,Communieations Act of 1934, to provide a \u25a0pre-grant procedure in case of certain \u25a0applications * * * and for other purposes.\u201d It is clear from House Report No. 1800<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that Congress expected the Commission to use any procedural \u25a0devices available to it to expedite its business and deemed its new \u201cpre-grant\u201d procedure adequate for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">The amendatory Act was designed to give interested parties an opportunity to learn of a pending application and to file a petition to deny as set forth in the new section 309(d) (1). A petition to deny any application, the new statute read, (apart from Commission regulations) might have been filed \u201cat any time prior to the day of Commission grant thereof without hearing.\u201d Congress\u2014 not the Commission \u2014 provided next, that a petition to deny a pending application \u201cshall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show that the petitioner is a party in interest and that a grant of the application would be prima facie inconsistent with\u201d the public interest standards of section 309(a). \u201cSuch allegations of fact shall, except for those of which official notice may be taken, be supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof.\u201d Only if \u201ca substantial and material question of fact is presented or if the Commission for any reason is unable to find that a grant of the application would be consistent\u201d with the public interest standards was the Commission to be required to proceed to hearings under section 309(e). So read the new Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">This appellant had done nothing whatever about the application of the inter-venors, although it had been pending some fourteen months from the date it was originally filed and some seven months after the Commission had licensed the appellant KGMO to operate on the 1550 KC frequency.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">Accordingly, with no objections before it, and as the statute required, the Commission on March 13, 1963, without a hearing, granted the intervenors\u2019 application since it was \u201cfully in the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">On April 12, 1963, the new owners of KGMO for the first time appeared in opposition, then filing a Petition for Reconsideration and Request for a Stay of the Commission's March 13, 1963 award. The KGMO petition alleged that the Cape Girardeau area could not support a third standard \u2019 broadcast station. Yet the record showed that the new owners within a few months had already converted the fiscal operations of KGMO from a loss status of $8,200 for the previous fiscal year, largely under the operation of the former owner, to a net profit situation of $2,445 for the 6-month period ending February 28, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">When the Commission denied the petition for reconsideration, it announced in its Memorandum Opinion and Order that the petition had failed to comply adequately with the amended statute\u2019s requirement of specificity in allegations. The facts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-18\">\u201care too generally stated and are not sufficiently related to the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>elusions drawn by the petitioner [KGMO] to show <em>prima facie </em>that a grant of the application would be inconsistent with a finding by the Commission that it would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, or to raise any substantial or material questions of fact concerning the effect of a third AM station entering the Cape Girardeau market.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The Commission further noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abn\">\u201cThe petitioner has only assumed that the proposed new operation might draw a portion of its revenues from the KGMO current revenues, thereby reducing KGMO\u2019s total income, but has not alleged facts tending to show the extent to which that might occur. * * ***<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The petitioner has not set forth the number of businesses or indicated the total advertising revenue available. * * * No information was submitted as to whether there are businesses that could but that do not now advertise on radio. * * * Nor has it alleged that no other revenue is available to replace any business which may be lost by KGMO due to this grant although, generally speaking, a new broadcast station generates some new business. In fact, KGMO has alleged no facts to support its assumption that it would suffer a decline in revenues due specifically to this grant. These failures to allege specific material and relevant facts take on added significance when viewed in the light of successful operation in the area, of other broadcast stations, both standard and television.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">Where Congress had given opportunity to KGMO to avail itself of the pre-grant, remedies so obviously available, KGMO' did nothing. Certainly when reconsideration was thereafter sought under the-provisions of section 405 of the Act, KGMO at the very least, should have set forth allegations as specific as Congress said were requisite to pre-grant, consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-16\">This is not a <em>Carroll Broadcasting Co.. </em>situation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In that case there already had been an adjudicatory hearing. An; economic injury issue had been raised and a record had been made on that.. very point. We held that the Commission could not be sustained since it had\u2019 declined to consider the economic injury-in weighing the possible requirements-of the public interest. We pointed out. that the Commission had even said as a matter of policy <em>\u201cthe possible effects of competition will be disregarded </em>in passing upon applications for new broadcast, stations.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) There-were two competing interests from towns, with respective populations of only 8,600 and 2,300. Thus, possible economic injury became a critical factor in weighing-the public interest, measured in terms of an issue which the Commission had' <em>refused </em>to consider. Therein lay the-vice which we were bound to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-17\">In the instant ease there was no trap for the unwary. The new owners of KGMO obviously entered the competitive-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>field with their eyes wide open. They are not entitled to freedom from competition. Their own inaction raised no barrier to the Commission\u2019s taking precisely the steps it was bound to take under the amended sections 309 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 405. The administrative process, difficult at best, should not further be shackled where KGMO for months had ignored the opportunity to protest and thereafter failed to meet the requirements of the statute. The Commission\u2019s rulings should be upheld.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-8\">. 103 U.S.App.D.C. 346, 258 F.2d 440 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b973-10\">. 74 Stat. 889 amending as here applicable 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309 and 74 Stat. 892 amending 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 405 (Supp. II, 1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Ac5\">. 2 U.S.Code Corra. &amp; Ad.News, p. 3516 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b975-12\">.
