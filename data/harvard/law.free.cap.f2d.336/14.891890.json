Humes, a jockey, while \u201cponying\u201d a race horse on appellant\u2019s suburban farm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The opinion of the District Court adjudicating that matter is recorded in D.C. 224 F.Supp. at page 584. Since there is no dispute as to the relevant facts existing in the case at bar, and it appears from the record before us that the primary issue here is to be related to the singular proposition, namely, whether appellee, by conduct constituting waiver and estoppel, is precluded under Missouri law from asserting \u201cnon-coverage or non-liability\u201d under the policy of insurance in question, we only relate those facts that will bring that issue into proper focus and enlightenment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-16\">Appellee\u2019s insurance policy as issued and in force at all times hereinafter mentioned, granted comprehensive personal liability coverage to appellant at his farm residence described as 900 Char-bonier Road, St. Louis County, Missouri. The policy specifically excluded coverage for occurrences arising from \u201cbusiness pursuits conducted\u201d on the premises. On March 23,1959, within the effective term of such policy, Wallace W. Humes, a professional jockey, was injured while on the insured premises. Humes was employed by appellant on a part-time basis to \u201cpony\u201d three race horses on the one-sixth mile track maintained on the insured premises. While engaged in \u201cponying\u201d one such horse (a stallion) Humes was bitten on the leg by that race horse, resulting in serious personal injuries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>That matter was immediately reported to appellee. Thereafter, one of appellee\u2019s adjusters made investigation of that occurrence. On April 1, 1959, after interviewing appellant at his office, the adjuster (who was a lawyer) went to the insured premises, made observation thereof and later took a statement from appellant\u2019s wife and appellant\u2019s farm manager, and made a written report to appellee. It was then revealed to appel-lee that Humes was engaged in training a i*ace horse owned by appellant at the time he was injured; that Humes was a professional jockey who had \u201cpreviously ridden (appellant\u2019s) horses\u201d at Caho-lda and Fairmount Race Tracks, but on the day of the accident was the first time Humes had worked at (appellant\u2019s) farm. At that time, appellee\u2019s adjuster raised a question of coverage under appellee\u2019s policy as being applicable to Humes\u2019 injury. It appeared to him the status of Humes was that of an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d and not an \u201cemployee\u201d of appellant, and he so stated in his report. \u201cThe idea of Dr. Salerno operating a business never entered (his) mind\u201d although it here appears that it was at all times evident that the Charbonier Road premises were the hub of appellant\u2019s race horse operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">' On June 22, 1959, Humes instituted suit against appellant, seeking damages for the injuries he sustained. Appellant promptly forwarded those suit papers to appellee, who received the same on June 25, 1959. The petition portion thereof recited, among other things, that Humes, \u201cin keeping with his employment, did, as a <em>business invitee, </em>appear at the stables of (Salerno) located at 900 Charbonier Road * * * to exercise and train\u201d the race horses here considered; and Salerno negligently and carelessly turned over to Humes \u201ca high-strung, excitable and dangerous\u201d race horse without warning Humes \u201cof the viciousness and dangerous propensities\u201d thereof, and as a consequence Humes was injured at a time when he was hired to prepare that race horse \u201cfor a forthcoming racing season.\u201d (Supra, at 1. c. 585.) Appellee accepted coverage for that occurrence as being within the terms of its policy and retained counsel to defend that action on behalf of appellant, its named insured. It clearly appears from specific findings made, that appellee took complete control of the defense of the Humes suit, retained counsel to protect the rights of appellant Salerno, and this counsel continued to do all things necessary in defense of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">On April 1, 1960, ten months after ap-pellee accepted coverage and had assumed defense of the Humes suit in accordance with the terms of its policy, it had one of its adjusters make a further investigation at a race track In East St. Louis, Illinois. It was then, as appellee states, it first discovered that Salerno\u2019s \u201cracing activities were extensive in nature.\u201d As a consequence, appellee, on April 6, 1960, filed a declaratory judgment action in a State court of Missouri, for the purpose of ascertaining whether appellant \u201cSalerno was covered under the policy issued to him (and) in regard to the lawsuit filed by . . . Humes against Salerno.\u201d Appellee alleged in the complaint so filed, \u201cthat it had ascertained that the insured, defendant Salerno, was operating a racing horse farm and that he was engaged in the business of buying, selling, raising and racing horses for profit and that under the provisions of (its) policy of insurance, such business pursuits of Salerno were specifically excluded.\u201d (224 F.Supp. at 1. c. 586.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">On April 7, 1960, subsequent to the filing of the declaratory judgment action, appellee wrote a letter to appellant in which it stated that a serious question had arisen as to coverage existing under its policy; and that it would only continue with defense of the Humes case \u201cunder an express reservation of rights\u201d as therein set forth. Appellant, through his personal attorney, rejected any such reservation of rights by appellee. Following that rejection, counsel retained by appellee to defend the Humes action attempted to withdraw therefrom, but \u201cthe Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri, refused to allow such with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>drawal.\u201d Thereafter, retained counsel participated in the trial of the Humes suit which resulted in a verdict and judgment against appellant for $32,000.00. Thereafter, they perfected an appeal to the Supreme Court of Missouri, where the judgment was, on December 28, 19.61, affirmed on condition of a remittitur. As a consequence, the final judgment as entered in the case of Humes v. Salerno was in the amount of $23,500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">It was thereafter, on April 17, 1962, that the original declaratory judgment action commenced by appellee in the State court, <em>ante, </em>was dismissed, without prejudice. Prior thereto, a similar declaratory judgment action had been-commenced by appellee in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, on November 29, 1961, and that case was dismissed on April 20, 1962. The instant declaratory judgment action was filed in the court below on April 23, 1962. After trial on its merits, District Judge Meredith incorpoi*ated'-his findings of fact and conclusions of law in his opinion, supra. Two aspects of that opinion should here be noted: (1) District Judge Meredith found: \u201cIt is evident (in this case) that the Charbonier Road premises were the hub of (appellant\u2019s) racing operations and that the race horse operation was a business pursuit\u201d; and, (2) that it is solely on the premise of such findings that it was ruled in the case at bar that \u201c * * * Salerno was engaged in a business at his residence * * *\u201d and as a consequence liability for the Humes incident was ruled as being \u201cexcluded by the terms of the policy\u201d in suit. No contention is made that there was not ample, evidence adduced to support the factual matter found to exist in the above-stated propositions. It was appellant\u2019s contention in the court below, as it is here, that regardless of the finding as to \u201cbusiness activities\u201d made in this case, appellee, under the undisputed facts, waived any right it might have had to claim \u201cnon-coverage\u201d and is now estopped to claim \u201cnon-liability\u201d under the policy of insurance here in suit, by applicable Missouri law. Such is the \u201cmajor legal question\u201d presented in this appeal and aptly recognized by District Judge Meredith as being a \u201cclose one\u201d under Missouri law.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\"> In the course of his opinion supra, Judge Meredith stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">\u201cFrom our case study of Missouri law, we have concluded that plaintiff\u2019s (appellee\u2019s) categorical proposition that waiver or estoppel can never be extended to broaden coverage (of an insurance policy) cannot be sustained. While plaintiff (appel-lee) has cited a number of cases from other jurisdictions, we are here concerned with the law of Missouri to which our discussion accordingly will be confined.\u201d (Supra, 1. c. 588. Pars, added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">After reviewing applicable Missouri case law as to waiver and estoppel, it was his conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">\u201cFrom these cases we have determined that under Missouri law when all the elements of estoppel are present, it may be used to extend or broaden the coverage afforded to the named insured.\u201d (Supra, 1. c. 590.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">We deem the above general statements to be proper concepts of applicable Missouri law to the facts here; for it has long been the case law of that State that where an insurer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-14\">\u201c -x- * * instead of relying upon (its) right (to reject for non-coverage) when (a) claim (is) first brought to (its) attention, (it), without due investigation, assumes (itself) to be liable, (therefor and) sets the assured aside and claims the right of control of the defense, (it) cannot afterwards ignore the right the' assured has acquired by reason of such action merely because (it) has mad\u00e9 a belated discovery of fact, or law, which (it) thinks puts the case outside the terms of (its) pol-licy.\u201d (Pars, added.) Fairbanks Canning Co. v. London Guaranty &amp; Accident Co., 154 Mo.App. 327, 133 S.W. 664, at 1. c. 666 (1911).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>See also, cases cited in District Court\u2019s opinion, supra, at 1. c. 589-590; and Schmidt v. National Auto &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 207 F.2d 301 (8 Cir. 1953); Cannon v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 314 F.2d 657 (8 Cir. 1963); Western Casualty and Surety Co. v. Herman, 318 F.2d 50 (8 Cir. 1963). Though appellee contended otherwise in the court below, i. e. that coverage under Missouri law could not be established by estoppel it has now changed its position before us, because it merely asserts that the judgment in the case at bar should be affirmed because appellant failed to carry the burden of proof imposed upon him as required by Missouri law, \u201cto prove each and every element of \u2018estoppel\u2019 \u201d as established in Taylor v. Farmers Bank of Chariton County, 135 S.W.2d 1108 (Mo.App.1940); and United Finance Plan v. Parkview Drugs, Inc., 250 S.W.2d 181 (Mo.App. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">In the light of the foregoing, we accept the undisputed, positive statements of applicable Missouri ease law relating to the issue of \u201ccoverage\u201d as found and declared by District Judge Meredith, <em>ante. </em>Hence, all we need be concerned with in this appeal is whether the undisputed facts as found in the case at bar have been properly applied to the issue of estoppel, considered from the standpoint of whether the proof as here made reveals that appellee, with knowledge of all relevant facts, accepted defense of the Humes action, without reservation of rights, at a time when it knew or should have known facts which would have permitted it to deny coverage, but failed to do so and went ahead and investigated such claim and undertook the defense thereof. That such matter presents a question of applicable State law arising in this diversity action in relation to uncontroverted facts, as to which we have the duty to determine a proper application thereof the same as does the District Court, is readily apparent and need not be fortified by cited authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">From the foregoing, we think the first matter to be considered in this appeal is that Judge Meredith, in the course of his opinion, at 1. c. 591 of 224 F.Supp., found the facts to be and reasoned therefrom as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">\u201c * * * (Appellee) within days after the report of the accident knew or should have known the horse involved was a race horse. Certainly such was known from the first petition. In September of 1959, five months after the accident, (appellee) knew or should have known that (appellant) Salerno maintained from twelve to twenty-two race horses on his premises and that race horses were raised and bred there. Further, at approximately this same time (ap-pellee) knew or should have known that the horses were raced for purses at Fairmount and Cahokia. These facts were not concealed by (appellant) Salerno. While we cannot condone <em>(appellee\u2019s) long delay </em>in attempting to reserve its rights and withdraw from the case, and while it was under a duty to make a reasonable determination of its position based on the facts that it knew or should have known, still the (ap-pellee) had a right to rely on (appellant) Salerno\u2019s declaration in the policy that no business pursuits were conducted on his premises and in view of that declaration, (appel-lee) might reasonably assume from the fact within its knowledge that the horse racing operation was a <em>hobby </em>rather than a business pursuit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">\u201cThere was at least <em>one key fact, </em>unknown to (appellee), known to the (appellant) Salerno and not disclosed by him. In his income tax report (appellant) Salerno treated the farm and racing stables as a business operation. We, therefore, have concluded that (appellant) Salerno has failed to prove the essential elements of estoppel (in the case at bar).\u201d (Emp. &amp; pars, added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">However, Judge Meredith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">\u201c * * * concluded that the facts known or that should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>known by the (appellee) regarding the horse racing operation <em>between the time of the assumption of the defense and its attempted reservation of rights and attempted withdrawal </em>from the state court action were better and more accurately known by (appellant) Salerno (than by appel-lee).\u201d (Emp. &amp; pars, added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"> In the light of the foregoing, it clearly appears that the issue of \u201cestoppel\u201d as ruled in the case at bar has. been measured by appellee and the court below from a standpoint of timing of knowledgeable facts. This is to say, that after appellee determined that \u201cSalerno was a (bigger) operator\u201d in the horse racing business than it <em>first </em>determined, it' had been permitted to deny coverage under the policy in suit, after it first accepted and acknowledged coverage under its policy. We do not believe the issue of \u201cestoppel\u201d here presented can be adjudicated from that vista under Missouri case law; because a \u201cwaiver of non-coverage, once effected, is irrevocable\u201d under the law of that State. Cf. Consolidated Elec. Corp. v. Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co. (D.C.Mo.1952) 106 F.Supp. 322. Particularly is that so where it is conceded that no facts in relation to conditions existing on the insured premises were at any time \u201cconcealed\u201d from knowledge by the appellant. Schmidt v. National Auto &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., supra. That appellee did voluntarily assume full control of the defense of the Humes action with actual knowledge of \u201cracing activities\u201d as they existed on the insured premises, is not here left in doubt. Having accepted liability therefor as being within the coverage afforded by its policy, appellee was quite correct in viewing that situation as giving it no choice but to proceed with the trial of the Humes ease in the State court, as it did. It is accepting the defense of an action with knowledge of facts which should make an insurer aware that non-coverage exists, \u201cwithout a non-waiver or reservation of rights agreements that precludes (it) from subsequently setting up (that) fact (as a) defense\u201d under the facts here considered. Missouri Managerial Corp. v. Pasqualino, Mo.App., 323 S.W.2d, 1. c. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In the case at bar, under facts as found by the trial court, we think the only conclusion to be reached is that appellee, within five days after the Humes occurrence, had equal knowledge and means of knowing the full extent of the \u201chorse racing activities\u201d as conducted on the insured premises as did appellant, and under such circumstances accepted coverage under the policy of insurance in suit. That being so, appellee had no right to know whether appellant was a bigger operator than it first thought, or whether he was making a profit or loss from the business venture of which it admittedly had knowledge. \u201cBusiness pursuits\u201d as used in the policy here considered is a very comprehensive term. It can only be construed as embracing everything about which a person may be engaged where profit is a motive. That racing and breeding horses is generally recognized to be an enterprise conducted for profit, has long been recognized. Cf. Wilson v. Eisner, 282 F. 38 (2 Cir. 1922). The number of horses revealed in the income tax returns of appellant, the places where they were raced, and that jockeys were used in the business venture conducted by appellant on his farm, were facts made known to appellant\u2019s adjuster when he first visited appellant\u2019s farm, took statements from appellant, his wife, and from the groom in charge of appellant\u2019s horses; and the over-all situation then existing on the appellant\u2019s farm. Under applicable Missouri law, once such facts were revealed, and recognized by appellee as existing on the insured premises and it accepted coverage therefor under its policy of insurance as issued, it is inconsistent conduct for it to thereafter claim non-coverage and non-liability therefor; and the District Court erred in ruling otherwise. Wolters v. Prudential Insurance Company of America, 296 F.2d 140, 1. c. 143 (8 Cir. 1961), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The District Court\u2019s ruling in the case at bar that appellee was not estopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>to disclaim liability under the circumstances as it did, because appellant failed to make proof and establish elements (2) and (3) relating to estoppel as defined in the case law of Missouri in Taylor v. Farmers Bank of Chariton County, supra,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****8 is, as we view the record before us, an inadvertent misconception of applicable law to the facts here established. As to element (2), <em>infra, </em>the Court found that sufficient facts were known by appellee, (at least from the time of accepting coverage as to the facts revealed by the complaint filed in the Humes action) to p\u00edace it on notice that the activities carried on at appellant\u2019s premises were more than a \u201chobby\u201d as appellee first thought. There is no evidence in the record before us that appellant ever contended that his \u201cracing activities\u201d so conducted were a hobby. Seemingly, it was because the District Court considered the \u201cfact of profit\u201d was better known to appellant than to appellee, that the latter might have been led to consider appellant\u2019s \u201cracing activities\u201d were a hobby and therefore was entitled to rely on appellant\u2019s declaration contained in its policy that no business activities were conducted on the premises. It must be remembered, no question of misrepresentation is asserted in this case. Also, that the fact of \u201cprofit\u201d relied on by appellee as to its claim of \u201cnon-coverage\u201d only came into this case sometime <em>after </em>appellee admittedly was apprised of all the \u201cracing activities\u201d and other conditions existing at the \u201cinsured premises.\u201d Thus the conduct and knowledge of appellee in assuming defense of the Humes claim cannot be measured solely in the light of declarations contained in policy of insurance as was done here. The original acceptance of coverage must be viewed in the light of knowledge appellee had of the true situation giving rise to Humes\u2019 claim, as to which appellee was admittedly fully informed, when it accepted coverage and not \u201cbecause (it) has made a belated discovery of fact, or law, which (it) thinks puts the case outside the terms of (its) policy.\u201d Fairbanks Canning Co. v. London Guaranty &amp; Accident Co., supra, 1. c. 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">As to the third element in footnote 2, <em>infra, </em>namely, the truth of the facts must be unknown to appellee, was not treated separately -by Judge Meredith. Seemingly, he based his conclusion as to that element on reasoning that \u201cracing activities\u201d carried on at the insured premises were fully known to appellee, but not the \u201cextent\u201d as to the fact of \u201cprofit or loss\u201d accruing therefrom. The \u201cfacts\u201d giving rise to the estoppel here considered consisted of conduct on the part of appellee in assuming control of the defense of the Humes suit, with presumptive knowledge of grounds for declaring non-coverage and maintaining such control for several months thereafter, without declaring any reservation of rights. Appellant had nothing on which to rely other than such conduct on the part of appellee, and cannot be held to have known that appellee had any intention to carry on the defense of the Humes suit with any reservation of rights. Hence the estoppel here arises from the conduct of the appellee, and not from the prior conduct of appellant in carrying on a \u201cracing enterprise\u201d (a business type of operation) on the insured premises. \u201cThe loss of a right to con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>-fcrol and manage one\u2019s own case is itself a (the) prejudice\u201d which must be considered under the facts here. (Fairbanks Canning Co. v. London Guaranty &amp; Accident Co., supra.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Appellant seeks upon remand of this case that we direct the District Court to make an allowance for the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred by him, as considered in Security Insurance Company of New Haven v. White, 236 F.2d 215 (10 Cir. 1956). In the answer and cross-petition filed by appellant, he prayed, among other things, that a declaration be made that under the policy of insurance here considered, \u201cthere was coverage provided * * \"\" for the claims and judgment rendered in the suit of Humes v. Salerno\u201d; that the Court declare appellee \u201cbear full responsibility for the payment of the judgment\u201d rendered in that action ; and that appellant recover his costs, \u201ctogether with reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d as provided by \u00a7 375.420 V.A. M.S. Since the District Court determined the issue of liability against appellant\u2019s contention, it did not reach, or malee, any adjudication in respect to the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u201cThe Federal Declaratory Judgment Act contemplates that all necessary and proper relief based upon a declaratory judgment should be granted.\u201d \u2022 National Fire Insurance Co. v. Board of Public Instruction, 239 F.2d 370 (5 Cir. 1956). We have heretofore ruled that upon proper finding of fact being made, in an action such as the case at bar, the penalty imposed, by Missouri statute, for \u2022vexatious refusal to pay an insured loss might be assessed. (Cf. Firemen's Insurance Company of Newark, N. J. v. Smith, et al., 83 F.Supp. 668 (D.C.Mo. 1949), aff\u2019d 180 F.2d 371 (8 Cir. 1950); cert. den. 339 U.S. 980, 70 S.Ct. 1028, 94 L.Ed. 1384. However, this Court cannot make any determination in respect to that issue in the first instance. Upon remand of this case, that issue is left open for consideration and determination by the District Court, in accordance with applicable Missouri law.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-13\">. \u201cPonying\u201d is a type of training whereby a jockey, mounted on one horse, leads a race horse around a track at various gaits.

Humes, the jockey, was joined as a party defendant in this action and filed answer to the petition for declaratory judgment.
