On arraignment he pleaded not guilty and went to trial by jury at which as at his arraignment he was represented by counsel of his own choice. He was found not guilty as to the first two counts but guilty as to the third and sentenced on that count on June 26, 1964. Twelve days later on July 8, 1964, his counsel filed notice of appeal to the \u201cUnited States Circuit of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\u201d The file, however, was properly forwarded by the clerk of the court below to the clerk of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Now the United States Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as both untimely and frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The motion must be granted, if for no other reason, because the notice of appeal was filed out of time under Criminal Rule 37(a) (2) wherefore this court has no jurisdiction over it.
