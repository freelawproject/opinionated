The revocation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>sustained by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals by a divided court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we granted leave to appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The Director grounded his action on several convictions of appellant of violations of \u00a1aw, including housebreaking, larceny and destroying m\u00f3vable property, for all of which offenses he had suffered the penalties imposed for the violations. The Director thought this criminal record enabled him to revoke the license under the authority of Section 5 (a) of Part V of the Traffic and Motor Vehicle Regulations of the District of Columbia, granting the Director discretion .to revoke the permit of any individual who in his opinion \u201cis not * * * morally qualified to operate a motor vehicle in such manner as not to jeopardize the safety of persons or property * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"acy-dedup-1\">In the absence of clearer language we think the Regulation relied upon does not vest the Director with the revocation power for misconduct unrelated fo the ability of an individual to operate a motor vehicle so as \u201cnot to jeopardize-the-safety of persons or propefty ) These modifying words indicate that the moral disqualification must be related to the ability or judgment needed safely to operate a motor vehicle. To place in the Director the discretion here claimed for him would be to permit him to add a penalty over and above that authorized by the statutes prescribing the punishment for the crimes of which appellant had been convicted. As Judge Myers, dissenting in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, stated, \u201cto justify revocation of a driver\u2019s license\u201d under Section 5(a) \u201c \u2018moral unfitness\u2019 must have some direct relationship to the qualifications of an individual to drive a car so as not to endanger the safety of persons or property.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Otherwise the Regulation confers a discretion so broad, and of such possibly unequal application in practice, as should not be upheld in the absence of a clearer delegation of authority than we can gather from the language of the Regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-9\">. Reported at 193 A.2d 209 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b796-10\">. The Director argues that such a relationship does exist here since a person \u201cwhose criminal record discloses a glaring potentiality to continuously and deliberately disregard the criminal law may * * * be determined morally unqualified to properly perform\u201d the many duties \u201cdirectly related to \u2018operation\u2019 of a motor vehicle * * * such as * * * the duty of driving within speed limits, the duty of stopping at red lights and stop signs,\u201d etc. The answer to this, however, is that the regulations specifically provide sanctions for failure to perform the above duties.
