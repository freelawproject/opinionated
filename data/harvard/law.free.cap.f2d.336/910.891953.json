When he left they followed him, seized him, and took a roll of bills from his pocket. A police officer happened to witness the later stages of the affair and arrested them on the spot. They were indicted for robbery and convicted of assault with intent to commit robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-21\">In defense appellants say they had given the complainant a dollar with which to buy whiskey and were seeking to recover their money. They submitted that version to the jury, but as the verdict indicates, that body declined to accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-22\">Appellants also present a point under the so-called <em>Jeneks </em>statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Inquiry was made into the matter at the trial. It was established that the officer had made an original pencil' draft of a report, that the draft had been given to a stenographer at police headquarters who made a typewritten version of it, and that the officer signed it. The typed report was produced at the trial and used to impeach the officer\u2019s testimony as to the events he witnessed. As to the pencil draft the officer said: \u201c * * * it went in the trash after it was \u2014 * * * It. probably went in the trash after the clerk typed it.\u201d All who heard this testimony appear to have taken it at face value as establishing that the notes had been destroyed in the usual course of business.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defense in particular seized upon the fact of the destruction of the notes, and urged upon the court that that fact alone necessitated the striking of the officer\u2019s testimony. It did not suggest to the court, by motion or otherwise, that a hearing be held to inquire into either the fact or the circumstances of the destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>Appellants now say the trial judge should, upon his own initiative, have held a hearing to determine whether the original pencil draft of the policeman\u2019s report had been destroyed. As the Supreme Court pointed out in Campbell v. United States,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the inquiry conducted by the judge upon such a matter is not an adversary proceeding controlled by rules as to burden of proof or persuasion, but is simply a proceeding necessary to aid the judge to discharge the responsibility laid upon him to enforce the statute. The trial judge in the case at bar, having the officer before him and hearing his testimony, was satisfied there was no cause for a hearing. The record indicates that the defense was similarly satisfied. The only objective of a hearing would have been to determine whether the throwing of the pencil notes into the trash had been in bad faith or not in normal course. No suggestion to that effect was made at the time. We cannot say the trial judge committed reversible error in failing to initiate an inquiry which no one who heard the officer\u2019s testimony thought necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">As to the argument that the destruction of the pencil notes after they had been typed and the typed copy signed made the officer\u2019s testimony inadmissible, Killian <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-13\">. 71 Stat. 595 (1957), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b961-14\">.

Officer Brown testi- \u25a0 fied that he observed the complaining witness, Mitchell, walking along the street. The appellants left a restaurant, and began pursuing Mitchell, walking at a fast rate. As they came close to him they began walking in the shadow of trees and ducking in and out between parked cars. Appellant Watkins testified that they had given Mitchell a dollar to \u25a0purchase a bottle of whiskey, and ran after him to recover that money. There was contradictory testimony with regard to what transpired when appellants caught up with Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-18\">The manner in which appellants approached Mitchell was a significant element in an evaluation of appellants\u2019 intent. Officer Brown\u2019s testimony suggested a stealthy approach. A written police report, which contained his signature, however, made no mention of hiding be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>hind cars, trees, and so forth. He explained away another inconsistency between his testimony and the report by stating that this report was merely a digest of a handwritten statement he had submitted to the clerk at the police precinct ; that statement was \u201cfull length\u201d; it \u201chad more.\u201d When asked whether he had the handwritten statement with him, he replied: \u201cNo. It was given \u2014 it went in the trash after it was [Q. Where?] A. It probably went in the trash after the clerk typed it. They just digest on this form.\u201d Counsel for appellant Watkins made a demand for the handwritten statement and argued that the destruction of the statement was' cause for striking the officer\u2019s testimony. The court rejected these motions but failed to order a hearing to determine whether the statement had in fact been destroyed and the circumstances of its destruction. This, I think, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">The handwritten statement, if it were in existence, clearly related to the subject matter of the witness\u2019 testimony. That statement may well have vitiated the officer\u2019s attempt to explain away the inconsistency between his testimony and the police report. \u201cAn appellate court should not confidently guess what defendant\u2019s attorney might have found useful for impeachment purposes in withheld documents to which the defense is entitled.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Having been made aware of the existence of a \u201cJencks\u201d statement the trial judge had an obligation to determine whether that statement had been destroyed and whether such destruction was in. good faith and in accord with normal practice. Killian v. United States, 368 U.S. 231, 242, 82 S.Ct. 302, 7 L.Ed.2d 256 (1961). He should have either summoned on his own motion the clerk who prepared the \u201cdigest\u201d or required the Government to produce him. Campbell v. United States, 365 U.S. 85, 94, 81 S.Ct. 421, 5 L.Ed.2d 428 (1961). The statute-\u201cimplies the duty in the trial judge-affirmatively to administer the statute in such way as can best secure relevant and available evidence necessary to decide between the directly opposed interests. * x * \u00bb 365 U.S. at 95, 81 S.Ct. at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">It is true that defense counsel appears-to have \u201cassumed\u201d that the handwritten notes had been destroyed. But I do not think this relieved the District Judge and the Government of the responsibilities-imposed on them by the Act and by the <em>Killian </em>and <em>Campbell </em>eases to determine-(1) whether the notes were in fact destroyed; (2) whether, if they were, this-was in the proper and normal course of business or otherwise in good faith; and. (3) whether, if they were not destroyed, they should have been produced, and if the failure to produce them was prejudicial to appellants\u2019 defense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-12\">I think the record should be remanded to the District Court to conduct such a. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>hearing. Cf. Moore v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 254, 328 F.2d 555 (1964); Williams v. United States, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 206, 328 F.2d 178 (1963), and cases cited.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-7\">. Rosenberg v. United States, 360 U.S. 367, 371, 79 S.Ct. 1231, 3 L.Ed.2d 1304 (1959). In that ease tbe witness bad written a letter to tbe Assistant United States Attorney, in anticipation of trial, indicating that ber memory bad dimmed, and that to refresh her memory she would have to reread the statement she made to the FBI. However, at the trial, the witness\u2019 testimony informed the defense counsel, and the jury, that her memory was quite poor. In a five to four opinion, the Court held that \u201cSince the same information that would have been afforded had the document been given to defendant was already in the possession of the defense by way of the witness\u2019 admissions while testifying, it would deny reason to entertain tbe belief that defendant could have been prejudiced by not' having had opportunity to inspect the letter.\u201d Ibid. In tbe instant case the officer made no-self-impeaching admission. On the contrary, he attempted to bolster his testimony with an explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-15\">Tbe Court, in <em>Rosenberg, </em>also held that. \u201cNo relevant purpose could have been served by giving petitioner\u2019s counsel a typewritten copy\u201d of a statement made by another witness since tbe defendant had boon given the original handwritten statement. 360 U.S. at 370, 79 S.Ct. at 1233. In the instant case tbe original handwritten statement, which was not produced, may have proved highly relevant as a tool for impeaching the police officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
