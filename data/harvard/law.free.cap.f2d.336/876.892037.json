Nor did appellant even comment upon ap-pellee\u2019s suggestion that, because of the absence of specifications of error, the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">We are hesitant to penalize a litigant, by declining to consider an appeal on the merits, because of the failure of his attorney to comply with the rules of this court. But the failure to set out in the opening brief, or at all, specifications of error providing the information specified in Rule 18, subd. 2(d), not only works a hardship on this court but is unfair to the appellee. The initial deficiency in this case is completely inexcusable, in view of the certificate that counsel had read Rule 18 in connection with the preparation of his brief. The failure to take corrective action after the matter was called to counsel\u2019s attention in the answering brief is inexplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-16\">We might neverthless, in the exercise of our discretion, undertake a review on the merits if we had a strong feeling that a substantial injustice or hardship would otherwise be worked upon appellant. But in view of the fact that the sign has already been removed and that the injunction is interlocutory, pending final disposition of a case in which both sides are seeking injunctive and monetary relief, we do not have that feeling about the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">By reason of the absence of specifications of error the appeal presents nothing for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">The appeal accordingly is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-11\">. Paul Martm died after the appeal was taken and Mrs. Martin, as sole owner of the real property in question, is now the only appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-12\">. Nor does the opening brief, or appellant\u2019s reply brief, contain a jurisdictional statement or an appendix listing exhibits, as required by our Rule 18, subd. 2(b) and (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b927-20\">. In its answering brief, appellee also called attention to tbe absence of a jurisdictional statement in tbe opening brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
