United States Air Conditioning, 128 N.L.R.B. 117 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-26\">Following entry of the consent decree, a dispute arose as to the amount of back pay due each such employee. A hearing was held before a trial examiner who made specific recommendations which were adopted in a supplemental order of' the NLRB. United States Air Conditioning, 141 N.L.R.B. 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-27\">In the instant proceeding the NLRB seeks enforcement by this court of the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>back pay order. Objections having been filed by respondent, briefs and memoran-da were filed by both parties under procedure established in N.L.R.B. v. Jack C. Robinson, C.A. 6, Case No. 12,928, by order dated April 3,1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The basic issue raised by respondent is its claim that it was foreclosed by the Trial Examiner from introducing evidence pertaining to unavailability of work for certain of the 22 employees ordered by the consent decree to be reinstated with back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The NLRB supplemental order dealt with this contention as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\u201cIn its brief filed after the hearing, the Respondent contends that the Trial Examiner foreclosed it from showing, at the hearing, the unavailability of employment for these 15 discriminatees by excluding the evidence it sought to adduce \u2018pertaining to economic consideration, lack of work, failure to have a job available for claimants, or any other defense set up in Respondent\u2019s answer.\u2019 We find no merit in the Respondent\u2019s contention that it was foreclosed from presenting any relevant evidence. The Trial Examiner did reject \u2014 and properly so \u2014 the Respondent\u2019s efforts to relitigate the issues previously determined in this case. It is clear from the record, however, that the Respondent was not precluded from adducing any competent evidence regarding layoffs or other economic factors bearing upon the availability of jobs during the backpay periods. Indeed, at one point in the record the Trial Examiner remarked that this was precisely the type of evidence which the Respondent should submit, as distinguished from testimony relating to whether the discriminatees were originally laid off for discriminatory or economic reasons, matters already determined by the Board and Court, but which the Respondent persisted in attempting to relitigate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Our examination of the memoranda and briefs filed in this court support this conclusion. The record before the Trial Examiner and respondent\u2019s brief and memorandum before us are replete with instances of efforts to introduce evidence concerning (or to reargue the legal validity of) the original discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Obviously, once the consent decree had been entered, relitigation of the fact issues upon which it was based was foreclosed. N.L.R.B. v. American Manufacturing Co., Inc., 132 F.2d 740 (C.A. 5, 1943), cert. denied, 319 U.S. 743, 63 S.Ct. 1030, 87 L.Ed. 1700 (1943); Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. N.L.R.B., 313 U.S. 146, 61 S.Ct. 908, 85 L.Ed. 1251 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Respondent has cited to this court no instance where it was prevented <em>from </em>introducing evidence dealing with economic circumstances affecting employment possibilities of these employees following the date of the Board\u2019s original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">We find substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding of constructive discharge as to five employees who were re-employed but not to their \u201cformer or substantially equivalent positions\u201d and as to whom the Board\u2019s order continued back pay after the date of respondent\u2019s original offer of reinstatement. In each instance evidence shows obvious and material deviation from the \u201cformer or substantially equivalent\u201d work without any valid economic justification therefor being shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">Nothing in the cases relied upon by respondent (N.L.R.B. v. Bird Machine Co., 174 F.2d 404 (C.A. 1, 1949); Wallace Corporation v. N.L.R.B., 159 F.2d 952 (C.A. 4, 1947)) serves to dispute the power of the Board to enter supplementary orders for reinstatement and back pay and for such purpose to determine the adequacy of compliance by respondent. In fact, these cases, plus N.L.R.B. v. C.C.C. Associates, Inc., 306 F.2d 534 (C.A. 2, 1962), squarely support such authority. The language relied upon by respondent refers to contempt proceedings which are not involved in the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Our review of the evidence presented hy the general counsel for the NLRB and hy respondent as to the back pay due each \u2022of the 22 persons found to have been illegally discharged indicates that in the \u25a0great majority of instances respondent\u2019s \u2022evidence sought to relitigate the original \u25a0discharge, and that in all instances there was substantial evidence to support the back pay figure arrived at by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Appellant\u2019s only other substantial contention is that the Board\u2019s supplementary \u2022order illegally included benefits from the \u2022company\u2019s profit sharing plan and Christmas bonus plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In computing back pay awards the NLRB should seek to restore the employee to the status quo he would have \u25a0enjoyed if the discriminatory discharge had not taken place. Moss Planing Mill Co., 110 N.L.R.B. 933, enforced as modified, N.L.R.B. v. Moss Planing Mill Co., 256 F.2d 653 (C.A. 4, 1958); Nabors v. N.L.R.B., 323 F.2d 686 (C.A. 5, 1963) cert. denied, 376 U.S. 911 (1964); N.L.R.B. v. Revlon Products Corp., 144 F.2d 88 (C.A. 2, 1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Dealing with a Christmas bonus question, Judge Miller wrote for this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201c[W]here so-called gifts are so tied to the remuneration which employees receive for their work that they are in fact a part of it, they are in reality wages within the meaning of the statute. This is a question of fact, and if the Board\u2019s finding to that effect is supported by \u2022substantial evidence, the finding must be accepted on this review. N.L.R.B. v. Niles-Bement-Pond Co., 199 F.2d 713, 714, C.A.2nd; N.L.R.B. v. Wheeling Pipe Line, 229 F.2d 391, 394-395, C.A. 8th; Singer Mfg. Co. v. N.L.R.B., 119 F.2d 131, 136, C.A. 7th, cert. denied, 313 U.S. 595, 61 S.Ct. 1119, 85 L.Ed. 1549.\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Electric Steam Radiator Corp., 321 F.2d 733, 737 (C.A. 6, 1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">See also N.L.R.B. v. Niles-Bement-Pond Co., 199 F.2d 713 (C.A. 2, 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">We find substantial evidence in this record to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the respondent\u2019s profit sharing plan and Christmas bonus plan were part of regular wages for purpose of the back pay awards.

Universal Camera Corp., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">A supplementary decree will issue enforcing the supplementary order of the NLRB.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
