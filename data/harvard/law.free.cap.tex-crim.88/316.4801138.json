We are of opinion that appellant should have been granted bail. Therefore, the judgment is reversed and appellant is admitted to bail in the sum of ten thousand dollars. The sheriff of Bexar county, or the officer having appellant in custody, will take and approve his bond in the above amount, in the terms of the law, and upon the giving- of which appellant shall be discharged from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">Reversed and bail granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-16\">\n<em>Bail granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
