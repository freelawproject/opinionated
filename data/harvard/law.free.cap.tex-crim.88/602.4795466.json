E. Cornelius v. State, also an appeal from Bowie County, charged with a violation of the same law. In that case it was held by this court that' the complaint and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>information were fatally defective and the cause was reversed and dismissed. An examination of the complaint and information in the instant case sows it to be an exact duplicate of the one in the Cornelius case, with the exception of the changes in the names and the number of the vat at which the party was expected to dip his cattle. It is not necessary to reiterate here what was said in the Cornelius case. Upon the authority of that case the instant one is ordered reversed and dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
