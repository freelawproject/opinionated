The facts alleged bring the \u2022election within the provisions of the statute on the subject, namely: Vernon\u2019s Sayles\u2019 Texas Civil Statutes, Volume IV., Chapter 5, Title 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">We find in the statement of facts, however, no proof supporting these allegations. The law being a local one, it is an essential predicate to conviction for its violation to, not only allege, but to prove its adoption within the territory wherein the offense is charged to have been committed. Hill v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 79. The courts do not take judicial knowledge of the holding and results of elections putting in force local option laws in a given territory. . Prather v. State, 12 Texas Crim. App., 401; Stewart v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">The absence of proof showing that the law prohibiting hogs from running at large was in force renders it necessary to order a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
