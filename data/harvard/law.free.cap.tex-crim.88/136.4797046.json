The jury was warranted in finding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">There is but one bill of exceptions in the record. It recites that defendant on cross-examination of the witness Middlebrook asked the following question: \u201cGrider\u2014do you know Grider\u2014you say you know Grider'? A. He picked cotton for me. Q. Do you consider him a straight, honest, upright fellow? The State: We object, to that as irrelevant and immaterial.\u201d Appellant stated that he offered this-evidence as tending to show Grider\u2019s connection with the check; \u201cthat he was of that kind or character and that Mr. Middle-brook knew his reputation, and I am just trying to prove his reputation as to being a law-abiding citizen, otherwise, for that purpose.\u201d The court sustained the State's objection, and appellant excepted. This is the bill. What Middlebrook would have answered, or what was expected in answer to the question is not stated. Whether his answer would have been favorable or unfaimrable is not shown. As the bill is presented we are unable to say that there was error, in the action of the. court. The reply of the witness, had he been permitted to answer, should have been stated so that this court could ascertain whether it was relevant or not. The bill is too indefinite for revision</p>\n<p id=\"b173-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-14\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b173-15\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-16\">November 10, 1920.</p>\n<author id=\"b173-17\">DAVIDSON, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A2D\">Appellant concedes in his motion for rehearing that the decision of the court as rendered was correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>on the questions discussed, but his contention, however, now is that the court below committed fundamental error in charging the jury that the testimony of the witness Maxey was admitted before them only for what they might consider it to be worth, if anything, upon the issue of the fraudulent intent of defendant and they should not consider it for any other purpose. His contention is that this is a charge upon the weight of the testimony. The testimony of Maxey was legitimate upon the question of intent. It is unnecessary to state the facts. If it be conceded that appellant is correct that this had a tendency to convey the idea of the court that the attempt of appellant to pass the alleged forged check upon Maxey was an indication of the court\u2019s view of that testimony, then it may be stated that there was no objection to the court\u2019s charge during the trial, either at the time it was delivered or even in the motion for a new trial, and is raised for the first time in this motion for rehearing. The statute, Article 735, C. C. P., requires that exceptions to the court\u2019s charge must be taken before it is read to the jury and in writing, specifying the grounds of objection. This was not done. Under the decisions an error or supposed error of the court in charging the jury will not be considered unless it be of a fundamental nature and goes to the basis of the case adversely to what the law is or ought to be. We do not understand this charge to be of that nature, even if it be conceded that it was somewhat on the weight of the testimony. It may be seriously doubted, however, whether that proposition would be a sound one if exception had been properly taken. Extraneous crimes of this sort may be introduced to show the intent of the party where an innocent purpose is claimed, or there be doubt as to the innocence of the act about which the complaint is made. The testimony of Maxey was clearly introducible as bearing upon intent of defendant in attempting to pass the check. This attempt occurred the same evening and a very short time before he undertook to pass it upon another party and upon which this conviction was obtained. We, therefore, hold that this error, if error at all, is not of such a nature that it requires this court to reverse under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The motion for rehearing will, therefore, be overruled. _</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
