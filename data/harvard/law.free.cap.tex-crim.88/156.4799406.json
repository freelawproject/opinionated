This Court held in Patterson v. State, 87 Texas Crim. Rep., 95, 221 S. W. Rep., 597, that the argument of the prosecuting attorney, with reference to his failure to attack the defendant\u2019s reputation because the same was not permitted by law, was not ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We are unable to say from this record that there is no evidence upon which the jury might have predicated their verdict.
