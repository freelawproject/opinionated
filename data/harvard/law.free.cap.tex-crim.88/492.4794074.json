Following Howell v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 494, and other cases; and where no charge was made that the instrument had been altered by making thereon a false indorsement, the allegation that it bore an indorsement was unnecessary but did not render the indictment bad, although it may have required proof of such indorsement.

W. Gumpert, then and there well knowing to be false and forged, he the said' L. W. Gumpert did pass the same as true, with intent to injure and defraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In the motion to quash and in arrest of judgment the indictment was assailed upon various grounds, none of which, in our opinion, were sound. The check, being an ordinary commercial instrument, no purport clause was necessary. Howard v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 494; Branch\u2019s Criminal Law, Sec. 379. The check was complete without the endorsement. Branch\u2019s Ann. Tex. Penal Code, Sections 1397 and 1409; Hennessy v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 354; Bishop\u2019s New Crim. Procedure, Vol. 3, Sec. 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">No attempt was made to charge that the instrument had been altered by making thereon a false endorsement. Strang v. State, 32 Texas Crim. Rep., 228; Carter v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The instrument which was the subject of the forgery, under the allegations, was a check. In alleging that it bore the endorsement \u201cRoy Miller\u201d the pleader put upon it an unnecessary descriptive averment, but did not thereby render the indictment bad. Passing a check which was known to be forged and which was passed with fraudulent intent, would constitute an offense whether the endorsement be forged or genuine. It is possible that, in describing the check as being endorsed in the manner stated, an unnecessary burden was assumed by the State to prove that the forged check passed bore the endorsement mentioned. This question, however, does not arise. The statute denouncing the passing of a forged instrument is not susceptible of the construction that a conviction would result if the instrument was knowingly passed without knowledge that it was a forgery. Guilty knowledge is an essential element in the offense. Such was the law at the time the statute was passed and such is the construction that has been uniformly given. Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence, Vol. 1, Sec. 35, page 138, note 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">The terms \u201csuch forged instrument\" used in the passing statute. Article 937, would include a forged check made by either the person passing it or by another. The indictment was not invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">For the first time on appeal the indictment is attacked upon the ground that it fails to charge the facts showing that the offense was committed \u201canterior to the presentment of the indictment.\u201d The indictment was presented on the 31st day of August, which was during the June term of court and charged the offense to have been committed on the 31st day of July, and \u201canterior to the presentment of the inditcment.\u201d We think the point is not meritorious. See Osborne v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 398; Murphy v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 24; Branch\u2019s Crim. Law, Sections 883, 888 and 905; Code of Criminal Procedure, Articles 576, 597 and 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Upon plea of guilty the statute, Article 566, Code of Criminal Procedure, requires in a case of felony where there is a discretion as to the term of punishment that evidence shall be submitted to enable the jury to determine the amount of the punishment. In such a case where the jury hearing the evidence assesses the lowest punishment, the sufficiency of the evidence is not open to question. Doans, v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 468. At least, such is the case where there is legal evidence before the jury to support the judgment. Woodall v. State, 58 Texas Crim. Rep., 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">In the instant case, in the absence of a statement of facts, the presumption is indulged that there was evidence before the court to support the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Finding no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">HAWKINS, Judge not sitting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
