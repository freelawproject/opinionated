C. P., defining theft by bailee, the contention of defendant that the prosecution cannot be sustained for embezzlement, is correct. Following Lee v. State, 81 Texas Crim. Rep., 129. But, where the bailment contemplated, that the defendant sold the goods, etc., as charged in the indictment, converting the money belonging to his principals, the embezzlement statute, Article 1416, C. C. P., would apply.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b190-8\">3. \u2014Same\u2014Theory of Defense\u2014Purchase\u2014Charge of Court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b190-9\">Upon trial of embezzlement by conversion of certain goods, etc., the defendant\u2019s theory of purchase should have been submitted as requested.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b190-10\">Appeal from the District Court of Erath.

From the State\u2019s standpoint, the facts disclose that Thompson placed in the possession of appellant certain produce, consisting of various articles invoiced in detail, with the price affixed to each article, aggregating something over $400. The appellant was to take the goods to Desdemona, and sell them at the prices named in the invoice, otherwise to return the articles. It was the state\u2019s theory that he sold a part of the property, and the fact that he returned a part of it is not disputed. Appellant\u2019s testimony was to the effect that he bought the goods outright. From the State\u2019s testimony, appellant\u2019s compensation was to arise from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>sale of the goods at a price beyond that of the invoice, and also he was to be compensated at the customary price of transporting the goods from Dublin, the place of the contract, to Desdemona.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\">We find in the record no satisfactory proof that appellant sold the goods, or any part of the goods, and converted them into money or into any particular sum of money. The indictment having charged that appellant converted money, it was essential that the proof sustain this allegation, and the absence of such proof renders it necessary that the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The appellant contends that the prosecution cannot be sustained for the reason that if an offense grows out of the facts proved, it would be that denounced by Article 1348, P. C., defining theft by bailee. If the appellant converted the goods, that is, if he appropriated the goods to his own use, the offense would come under the article named. We have so held in Lee v. State, 81 Texas Crim. Rep., 129, in which will be found other cases to the same effect. The bailment, however, contemplated that appellant would sell the goods, and, from the State\u2019s standpoint, that the money derived therefor, to the extent of the prices of the articles sold fixed in the invoice, would be held by the appellant for Thompson, and that he would be obliged to deliver it to Thompson. To these facts, we think, if appellant converted the money belonging to Thompson, the embezzlement statute would apply. See Article 1416, P. C., defining that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">On another trial, appellant\u2019s defense of purchase should be submitted, upon his request, in \u00e1 specific and affirmative manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">For the reason that the evidence fails to disclose that the money described in the indictment, or any specific part thereof, came into the possession of the appellant under the*transaction, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
