Roach testified that he saw this money about five o\u2019clock on the afternoon before the night of its loss. He also said that a few days before the burglary appellant saw this money in his possession. The next morning the money was gone. Appellant was at the Roach house the night the money was missed at about dark and saw Roach leave home accompanied by his wife and appellant\u2019s wife, going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>to church, from which some members of the party returned about ten-thirty o\u2019clock that night. Roach\u2019s wife testified that when she came back froip church she came back by appellant\u2019s home and that he opened the door and let her and his wife in. A brother of Roach\u2019s wife was sleeping in the Roach home during the absence of Roach and his wife at church, and this boy testified that he was awakened while they were gone by a noise as if someone were stumbling over a chair, but he was scared and did not get up. At once upon discovering his loss the next morning, Roach notified officers who searched appellant\u2019s premises during the day and found in a tin tobacco box thrust into the ground by the side of a post of the appellant\u2019s garden fence, the money of Roach, which he identified in the presence of appellant and his wife, neither of whom made any claim to same. When this money was found in appellant\u2019sq garden in said tobacco box it was wrapped in an envelope addressed to Ike Criswell, New Willard, Texas, that being appellant\u2019s address. The sheriff of the county testified that while they were searching appellant\u2019s house he appeared to be perfectly easy, but when they searched his garden he walked the floor and watched the searchers. On appellant\u2019s behalf he testified, denying the State\u2019s case throughout, and said he did not know how the money came in his garden. The record contains no bills of exceptions, and there is no brief on file for the appellant. The motion for new trial raises the sufficiency of the evidence in various ways, which we have carefully examined, but find ourselves unable to assent to the proposition that the evidence was not cogent enough to justify the jury in their verdict. It was a case of circumstantial evidence, and the law of this issue was submitted by the trial court. The fact of the appellant\u2019s knowledge of the presence of this money in Roach\u2019s possession,\u2014his being at the premises about dark and his presence not accounted for until ten-thirty o\u2019clock that night, the fact of someone being in the house in the meantime, the finding of the money on appellant\u2019s premises and in an envelope addressed to him the next morning after its loss, all of these are of sufficient weight we think, to justify the jury in their conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b640-5\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">March 2, 1921.</p>\n<author id=\"b640-7\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AOD\">Appellant makes only the contention that the evidence does not support the verdict. It would be useless for us to cite the long line of uniform decisions by this court affirming the doctrine, that possession of recently stolen property unexplained is sufficient to justify the conviction of a person in whose possession such property is found, of the theft thereof, or of burglary of the house in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>which such property was situated. In the instant case in addition to the fact of possession are the added circumstances of proof of the knowledge of appellant of the whereabouts of the.alleged stolen money prior to its disappearance, and also of the further fact that when same was found on appellant\u2019s premises the morning after it was taken it was wrapped in an envelope addressed to appellant. This seems so amply sufficient to justify the jury in their conclusion of his guilt that we will not further discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Appellant\u2019s motion is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
