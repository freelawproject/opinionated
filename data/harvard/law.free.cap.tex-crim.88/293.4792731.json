The appellant offered no testimony. The witness Trott testified that he had played a game of craps with the appellant at a certain place named by him. The other witness disclaimed any transaction of the kind. This constitutes all the evidence, and the record is absolutely bare of any testimony-showing that a bet was made at the game. It is the bet, or wager, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>is denounced by the statute, Article 557, P. C.
