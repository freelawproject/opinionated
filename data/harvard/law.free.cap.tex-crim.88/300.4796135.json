They have been thoroughly discussed by the court as it was constituted at the time the opinion in Ex parte Lingenfelder, 64 Texas Crim. Rep., 30, was written, and again in Zucarro v. State, 82 Texas Crim. Rep., 1, after the personnel of the court had been changed. Again the questions were reviewed at this term of the court in Hegman v. State, just decided. The writer differed with the majority of the court on those questions, but his views have not obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In obedience to those cases this judgment must be affirmed, and it is accordingly so ordered. \u2022 \u2022 -</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
