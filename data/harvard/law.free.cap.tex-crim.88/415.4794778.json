The complaint upon which the information is based does not begin \u201cIn the name and by the authority of the State of Texas.\u201d The information does begin \u201cIn the name and by the authority of the State of Texas.\u201d Motion in arrest of judgment was made because the complaint did not begin with the constitutional requirements: \u201cIn the name and by the authority of the State of Texas.\u201d This question has been before the court in several cases. It has been held that if the prosecution is upon an information it is not essential that the complaint on which it is based should begin \u201cIn the name and by the authority of the State of Texas.\u201d The information contains that necessary statement. It has been further held that where the prosecution is based alone upon a complaint in a court where such offense may be prosecuted, it is invalid unless it begins by using the words: \u201cIn the name and by the authority of the State of Texas;\u201d but if it does so begin in the information, then the omission of such expression from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the complaint is not fatal. Saine v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 144; Brown v. State, 46 Texas Crim. Rep., 572; Ex Parte Jackson, 50 Texas Crim. Rep., 324; Treadway v. State, 61 Texas Crim. Rep., 546; Jefferson v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 535; Johnson v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep., 465; Sessions v. State, 98 S. W. Rep., 243. Under these authorities the motion in arrest of judgment ovas correctly overruled. Had this case been prosecuted alone upon a complaint and not upon a complaint and information, a different holding would result. This criminal proceeding is carried on in the name and by the authority of the State of Texas as contained in the information, predicated upon the complaint. Therefore, under the authorities it is sufficient, and the court was correct in overruling the motion in arrest of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
