He was charged by complaint of murder. That the appellant killed the deceased was conceded. There was introduced evidence in mitigation of the offense. Without detailed discussion of the facts, we express the opinion that the case is not one in which bail should be denied. The order refusing it is reversed and bail granted in the sum of ten thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">\n<em>Bail granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
