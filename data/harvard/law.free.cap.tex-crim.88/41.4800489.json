We are of opinion that appellant should have been granted bail, and, therefore, the judgment is reversed and appellant is admitted to bail in the sum of ten thousand dollars. The sheriff of Galveston County, or officer having appellant in custody, will take and approve his-bond in the above amount in the terms of the law, upon the giving of which appellant will be discharged from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-19\">Reversed and bail granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-20\">\n<em>Badl granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
