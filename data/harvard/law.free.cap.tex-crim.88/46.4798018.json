What this testimony was is not specified, nor are the circumstances attending its admission stated. In fact, the record fails to disclose that appellant presented a bill of exceptions to the court\u2019s ruling in admitting, the testimony. The matter is so indefinitely presented, not being properly reserved for consideration, it presents no revisable error, and the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
