(\u201cBuffalo Transportation\u201d) petitioned pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(e)(8) for review of a final order of the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer for the Executive Office of Immigration Review (\u201cOCAHO\u201d) that found it to have committed substantive violations of Section 274A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and affirmed the imposition of fines by Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cICE\u201d). The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Buffalo Transportation had not timely complied with the requirements of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(b) and related regulations that require employers to verify that an employee is legally authorized to work in the United States through executing a Form 1-9 for each employee within three business days of hire. Buffalo Transportation petitioned this Court for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision on the grounds that the. violations were \u201cprocedural\u201d rather than substantive, and that ICE should have issued a warning rather than imposing fines. Buffalo Transportation also contends that the fines imposed were unreasonably high. We agree with the ALJ\u2019s determination of liability and adjustments of ICE\u2019s original fine amounts, and therefore DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">Buffalo Transportation is located in Buffalo, New York, and provides transportation services to individuals for medical appointments. On August 22, 2013, ICE notified Buffalo Transportation of a scheduled audit of its Forms . 1-9 to occur on August 28, 2013. At the audit, ICE found that six of the completed Forms 1-9 .had technical or procedural errors and allowed Buffalo Transportation to correct those errors. ICE also found, however, that all 54 of the completed Forms 1-9 were not created within three business days of the employees\u2019 hiring dates, and that Buffalo Transportation did not properly retain completed Forms 1-9 for 84 former employees. On March 14, 2014, ICE served Buffalo Transportation with a Notice of Intent to Fine in the amount of $794.75 per violation (for a total of $109,675.50) which it calculated using the regulatory scheme at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.l0(b)(2) and its own internal guidelines. These guidelines set the base and maximum fines for vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ous types of violations and adjust the fines for aggravating and mitigating circumstances. <em>See </em>ICE, Fact Sheet: 1-9 Inspection Overview, <em>available at </em>https://www. ice.gov/factsheets/i9-inspection (last visited Oct. 11, 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">' After receiving the Notice of Intent to Fine, Buffalo Transportation requested a hearing before an ALJ, as permitted by 5 UiS.C. \u00a7 554. Both Buffalo Transportation and ICE submitted briefing and evidence in support of their motions for a summary decision. The ALJ granted in part both Buffalo Transportation\u2019s and ICE\u2019s motions for summary decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ found Buffalo Transportation to have committed 81 violations for not retaining the Forms 1-9 for former employees for the proper time period (the later of three years from date of hire, or if terminated, one year from termination) and 54 violations for current employees for Forms 1-9 not prepared within three business days of hire.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ also determined that the fines assessed by ICE were excessive, and adjusted the penalty to $600 per violation for the former employees and $500 per violation for the current employees. Thus, the total fine that the ALJ assessed was $75,600. In making these adjustments to ICE\u2019s fines, the ALJ considered Buffalo Transportation\u2019s financial situation as well as other mitigating factors pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.10 (b)(2)(i)-(v). <em>See </em>J.A. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">We review an order of the OCA-HO issued pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a under the arbitrary and capricious standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(e)(8); <em>see Alaska Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Conservation v. E.P.A., </em>540 U.S. 461, 496-97, 124 S.Ct. 983, 157 L.Ed.2d 967 (2004) (applying arbitrary and capricious standard when the statute itself does not specify a standard for judicial review of agency action). We review an agency\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard, <em>N.Y. &amp; Atl. Ry. Co. v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>635 F.3d 66, 71 (2d Cir. 2011) (citations omitted), while we review an agency\u2019s determinations on questions of law <em>de novo, see Nwozuzu v. Holder, </em>726 F.3d 323, 326 (2d Cir. 2013) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">II. Substantive Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Section 274A(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act requires employers to verify that their employees are legally authorized to work in the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(b). Regulations designate the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (\u201cForm I-9\u201d) for this purpose, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.2(a)(2), and employers must complete these forms within three business days of hire, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 274a.2(b)(1)(ii). An employer must retain these forms and provide them for inspection by ICE upon three business days\u2019 notice for current employees, and retain forms for one year for terminated employees. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 274a.2(b)(2)(i)-(ii). If an employer does not comply with these requirements, it may face civil penalties between $110 and $1,100 per individual violation. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u00a7 274a.10(b)(2) (for violations prior to November 2, 2015). An employer may be \u201cconsidered to have complied\u201d with the Form I-9 requirements if there is only a \u201ctechnical or procedural failure\u201d so long as the employer made a \u201cgood faith attempt to comply.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(b)(6)(A). To avail itself of the good faith defense, an employer must also correct the relevant violations within ten business days of receiving notice of the technical or procedural failings. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1324a(b)(6)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The Immigration and Naturalization Services (the predecessor agency to ICE) (\u201cINS\u201d) issued interim guidance about what constitutes a \u201ctechnical or procedural violation\u201d as opposed to a \u201csubstantive violation\u201d for which the good faith defense would not be available. Memorandum of Paul W. Virtue, INS Office of Programs, Interim Guidelines: Section 274A(b)(6) of the INA (March 6, 1997), <em>available at </em>74 Interpreter Releases 706, App. I (April 28, 1997) (\u201cVirtue Memorandum\u201d). ICE has continued to follow that guidance. The OCAHO has consistently relied on the Virtue Memorandum to determine that the failure of an employer to complete a Form I-9 is a substantive violation of Section 274a.2. <em>See United States v. Anodizing Indust., Inc., </em>10 OCAHO 1184 (2013); <em>United States v. Platinum Builders of Cent. Fla., Inc., </em>10 OCAHO 1199 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Formal adjudications and agency-promulgated rules are given considerable deference under the Administrative Procedure Act and <em>Chevron. See Chevron, USA, Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Kruse v. Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc., </em>383 F.3d 49, 55 (2d Cir. 2004). An informal agency interpretation that is neither a formal adjudication nor a promulgated rule may still receive deference under <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944). Such informal agency guidance receives deference \u201c \u2018according to its persuasiveness,\u2019 as evidenced by the \u2018thoroughness evident in [the agency\u2019s] consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade.\u2019\u201d <em>Estate of Landers v. Leavitt, </em>545 F.3d 98, 107 (2d Cir. 2008) <em>as amended </em>(Jan. 15, 2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 221, 228, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001)) (internal citation omitted); <em>see also Ketchikan Drywall Servs., Inc. v. Immigration &amp; Customs Enft, </em>725 F.3d 1103, 1112-13 (9th Cir. 2013) (applying <em>Skidmore </em>deference to the Virtue Memorandum). We apply <em>Skidmore </em>deference to the Virtue Memorandum because we find it well-reasoned and thorough. It distinguishes between violations that effectively undermine immigration requirements (such as not filling out the form at all, or not including the employee\u2019s name) and those that create small but solvable problems (such as an omitted birth date). Moreover, the agency has greater expertise \u201cwhen it comes to determining which omissions are substantive and which ought to be excused.\u201d <em>Ketchikan, </em>725 F.3d at 1113. Thus, we agree with the Virtue Memorandum, and with prior decisions of the OCAHO, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Dr. Robert Schaus, D.D.S., </em>11 OCAHO 1239 (2014), that failing to prepare Forms I-9 within three business days of hire is a substantive violation of the INA and its accompanjnng regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The regulation clearly states that employers must have employees fill out the Form I-9, verify the employee\u2019s documentation, and have both employee and employer sign the form within three business days of hire. Failure to prepare a Form I-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>9 constitutes a substantive violation,. Virtue Memorandum at 3, and necessarily includes the failure to prepare a Form 1-9 within the time allotted by the regulations\u2014here, three business days. The ALJ correctly determined that the 54 Forms I-9 presented to ICE at the audit contained substantive violations, as there is no genuine dispute that any of the 54 forms had been completed within three business days of the employees\u2019 hiring dates. Indeed, it appears that Buffalo Transportation only prepared.the 54 Forms I-9 for its current employees in response to ICE\u2019s notice of inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Buffalo Transportation contends that it should have been given a Warning Notice pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.9(c) before receiving the ICE Notice of Intent to Fine. The government contends that this argument is unexhausted. Even assuming that Buffalo Transportation properly raised the warning notice claim, it is without merit. The regulation permits ICE or the Department of Labor \u201cin their discretion\u201d to give a warning of violations. <em>Id. </em>It does not require ICE to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Buffalo Transportation also argues that it substantially complied with the employee verification requirements by keeping each employee\u2019s identifying documents on file. That argument is unavailing, however, because the relevant regulations explicitly reject that approach: \u201c[Cjopying ... of [underlying documents] and retention of the copy or electronic image does not relieve the employer from the requirement to fully complete section 2 of the Form I-9.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.2(b)(3); <em>see Ketchikan, </em>725 F.3d at 1111 (rejecting the same argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">III. Fines</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Buffalo Transportation also challenges the amount of the fines imposed by the ALJ as arbitrary. ICE imposed a fine of $794.75 per violation, which it calculated using the regulatory scheme at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.10(b)(2) and its own internal guidelines, which ICE uses to set the base penalty and adjust the fine for aggravating and mitigating circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>ICE, Fact Sheet: I-9 Inspection Overview, <em>available at </em>https://www.ice.gov/factsheets/ i9-inspection (last visited Oct. 11, 2016). The ALJ considered that Buffalo Transportation was a small business, did not act in bad faith, lacked a history of violations, and that there was no evidence that Buffalo Transportation had hired unauthorized workers as mitigating factors. The ALJ also considered Buffalo Transportation\u2019s financial situation. In light of this evidence, Buffalo Transportation\u2019s arguments, and the statutory and non-statutory factors\u2014 including Buffalo Transportation\u2019s ability to pay\u2014the ALJ reduced the fines to $600 per violation for past employees and $500 per violation for current employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">When reviewing agency fines our inquiry is limited to whether the agency made \u201can allowable judgment in [its] choice of the remedy.\u201d <em>United States v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>170 F.3d 136, 143 (2d Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that the ALJ made such an allowable judgment here in determining the amount of the fines after properly assessing the various factors, including the seriousness and number of the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Buffalo Transportation next argues that because the regulation provides for a broad range of allowable fines (from $110 to $1,100) and the Virtue Memorandum includes no specific guidance, the ALJ im-permissibly made an arbitrary determination as to the amounts of the fines. Buffalo Transportation also contends that other similarly-situated employers received larger reductions from ICE-imposed fines than it did. We do not find these arguments convincing. The ALJ provided well-reasoned bases for the fine amounts based on Buffalo Transportation\u2019s specific circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the ALJ\u2019s determinations regarding liability were not arbitrary and capricious and were supported by substantial evidence, and that the fines were within the ALJ\u2019s allowable discretion. Accordingly, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-14\">. A review of the Forms I-9 reflects that many of the forms were prepared immediately prior to the inspection and more than three business days from the hiring date. <em>See, e.g., </em>Record on Appeal at 214-15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">. Both <em>the </em>relevant statute and regulations include the following factors: (i) size of the business'of the employer being charged, (ii) the good faith of the employer, (iii) the seriousness of the violation, (iv) whether or not the individual was an unauthorized alien, and (v) the history of previous violations of the employer. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(e)(5); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.10(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
