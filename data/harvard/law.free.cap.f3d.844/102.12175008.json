Larimer, <em>Judge), </em>after pleading guilty to conspiracies to distribute 100 or more kilograms of marijuana, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), 846; and to launder the proceeds of that illegal trafficking, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). Presently incarcerated, serving a 114-month prison term, Leonard appeals from a final order entered by the same court on June 15, 2015, which concluded that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court reasoned that, although a post-conviction, retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines had lowered the 121-to-15Lmonth Guidelines range identified by the court at Leonard\u2019s initial sentencing, the amended 97-to-121-month range was not lower than the 97-to-121-month range agreed to by the parties in their plea agreement under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C). Leonard challenges this conclusion, arguing that, once the district court accepted his 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, the sentencing range specified therein became his \u201capplicable\u201d range for purposes of determining \u00a7 3582(c)(2) eligibility. And because the amendment lowered that range to 78 to 97 months, Leonard maintains he is- eligible for a sentence reduction to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">The government defends the district court\u2019s ineligibility determination, maintaining that (1) Leonard\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d his 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, not the Sentencing Guidelines as required by \u00a7 3582(c)(2); and, (2) in any event, Leonard\u2019s 114-month sentence is within the now-amended applicable range, (a) precluding a finding that his applicable range was lowered by a subsequent amendment as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l), or (b) at least rendering any ineligibility error in this case harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">Neither party\u2019s argument is completely persuasive. Contrary to the government, we conclude that Leonard is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because his original sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines as that statutory phrase has been construed by the five justices in the majority in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 522, 525, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011) (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 534, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). At the same time, however, we conclude that the extent of the reduction for which Leonard is eligible is narrower than he urges because his \u201capplicable\u201d Guidelines range, as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.1(A), was the 121-to-151-month range calculated by the district court before accepting what was effectively a downward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>variance to the 97-to~121-month range prescribed in the parties\u2019 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. Because the relevant Guidelines amendment reduced Leonard\u2019s originally applic\u00e1ble 121-to-151-month range to a 97-to-121-month range, Leonard is eligible for a reduction of his 114-month sentence, but to no less than 97 months\u2019 incarceration, the low end of the amended range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). Whether to grant any reduction is, of course, a matter entrusted to the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Christie, </em>736 F.3d 191, 194-95 (2d Cir. 2013). Nevertheless, because we conclude that Leonard is at least eligible for such a reduction, we vacate the challenged order and remand for the district court to decide whether or not to exercise its reduction discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">A. Leonard Pleads Guilty Pursuant to a Buie 11(c)(1)(C) Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">On May 23, 2008, Leonard pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute \u201cat least 700 but less than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana,\u201d and to laundering the proceeds of that criminal activity in an amount \u201cmore than $30,000 but less than $70,000.\u201d App\u2019x 9-10. In a written plea agreement, Leonard and the prosecution noted their agreement to certain Sentencing Guidelines calculations, specifically, to a base offense level of 30 with a three-level upward adjustment for aggravating role and a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. With further agreement to a criminal history category of I, the parties\u2019 calculations yielded a \u201cguideline sentencing range\u201d of 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 13. Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), the parties agreed that Leonard should be sentenced within this Guidelines range and that, if the district court were to reject that part of the plea agreement, \u201cdefendant shall then be afforded the opportunity to withdraw the plea of guilty.\u201d App\u2019x 13.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">B. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">Prior to sentencing, the district court received a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) from the Probation Department (\u201cProbation\u201d), which calculated Leonard\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range at 151 to 188 months rather than the 97-to-121-month range referenced in the parties\u2019 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. While Probation agreed that Leonard\u2019s base offense level was 30 and that he was entitled to a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, it recommended a two-level increase for possession of firearms by a co-conspirator, and a four- (rather than three-) level increase for Leonard\u2019s organizing role. Further, because Leonard had committed the crimes of conviction while under conditional discharge from an earlier conviction, Probation calculated his criminal history category at II rather than I.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">At sentencing, the district court rejected the recommended firearms enhancement, but adopted the four-point role enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ment, as well as the higher criminal history category to yield a Guidelines range of 121 to 151 months. While the district court acknowledged that the parties had \u201csome issue\u201d with these enhancements, it reiterated its conclusion that \u201cthe guidelines are as I indicated, 121 to 151\u201d months. App\u2019x 94. Nevertheless, .it stated that it was \u201cprepared to accept\u201d the parties\u2019 11(c)(1)(C) agreement and to sentence Leonard \u201cwithin the range of 97 to 121 months\u201d identified therein, which it deemed \u201csufficient in my view, but not greater than necessary, to meet [statutory] sentencing objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94-95. Accordingly, the district court sentenced Leonard to 114 months\u2019 imprisonment, four years\u2019 supervised release, a $2,500 fine, and a $200 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">C.' Amendments to Applicable Guidelines Range</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Almost six years after Leonard\u2019s sentencing, the United States Sentencing Commission issued two relevant Guidelines amendments. Amendment 782, which took effect in 2014, amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 to reduce the offense levels associated with certain controlled substances crimes by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., Supp. to App. C, Amend. 782. Thus, the base offense level for the quantity of marijuana involved in Leonard\u2019s drug crime of conviction was reduced from 30 to 28. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6). Amendment 788, which also took effect in 2014, provided for retroactive application of Amendment 782. <em>See id. </em>at Supp. to App, C, Amend. 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">D. Motion To Reduce Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">On May 11, 2015, Leonard invoked the two aforementioned amendments to move <em>pro se </em>for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18. U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied the motion on June 15, 2015, concluding that Leonard was.ineligible for a sentence reduction. The court reasoned that, although it had \u201cdetermined the applicable Guidelines range to be 121-151 months,\u201d and the amendments had reduced that range to 97 to 121 months, it had in fact sentenced Leonard within the latter range pursuant to the plea agreement, such that Amendment 782 \u201c[did] not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d App\u2019x 191; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">Leonard timely appealed from the decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b148-12\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">Where, as here, a defendant seeks a sentence reduction based on a retroactive Guidelines amendment, a district court must determine (1) whether the defendant is eligible for .a reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and (2) whether a reduction is warranted in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>initial eligibility question\u2014the only one here at issue\u2014depends on statutory interpretation, our review is <em>de novo. See United States v. Williams, </em>551 F.3d 182, 185 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">B. Leonard\u2019s Eligibility for a Sentence Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Congress has pronounced a convicted defendant eligible for a sentence reduction if (1) he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment <em>based on </em>a sentencing range that has subsequently beep lowered,\u201d and (2) \u201csuch a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). The pertinent policy statement conditions reduction eligibility on \u201cthe guideline range <em>applicable to </em>that defendant halving] subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (d).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(l) (emphasis added). Thus, two requirements must be satisfied for a defendant to be eligible for a sentence reduction: (1) the original sentence must have been \u201cbased on\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines, and (2) the amendment must have lowered the Guidelines range \u201capplicable to\u201d the defendant at the time of the original sentencing. <em>See United States v. Pleasant, </em>704 F.3d 808, 810-11 (9th Cir. 2013) (observing that \u201capplicable to\u201d language from policy statement and \u201cbased on\u201d language from statute require \u201cseparate analysis\u201d);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>see also United States v. Martinez, </em>572 F.3d 82, 84 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding defendant convicted of crack conspiracy ineligible for sentence reduction based on- amendment lowering crack Guidelines because Guidelines applicable to defendant\u2019s sentence were those pertaining to career, offenders, which were not lowered).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">1. Leonard\u2019s, Sentence Was \u201cBased. On\u201d a Subsequently Lowered Guidelines Range</p>\n<p id=\"b149-12\">In deciding whether-Leonard\u2019s 114-month- sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d a subsequently lowered Guidelines range, we are guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 522, 131 S.Ct. 2685. In that case, the Court considered whether a sentence imposed pursuant to a 11(c)(1)(C) agreement could <em>ever </em>be said to have been \u201cbased on\u201d on the Sentencing Guidelines for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Five Justices answered that question in the affirmative, but for different - reasons. The four-member plurality reasoned that -because \u201cthe Guidelines must be consulted, in the regular course\u201d of imposing any sentence, including a sentence identified in an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, an 11(c)(1)(C) sentence was \u201clikely to be based on the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525, 534; 131 S.Ct. 2685 (plurality opinion, Kennedy, J., joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, JJ.) (explaining that U.S.S.G: \u00a7 6B1.2 requires district judge to evaluate recommended, sentence in light of defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range before accepting 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, <em>see id. </em>at 529-30, 131 S.Ct. 2685). Five \u2019 Justices specifically rejected this view, concluding that an 11(c)(1)(C) sentence is based not on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Sentencing Guidelines but on the parties\u2019 plea agreement. <em>See id. </em>at 534, 181 S.Ct. 2685 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment); <em>id. </em>at 545,131 S.Ct. 2685 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting, joined by Scalia, Thomas, Alito, JJ.). This led the dissenters to conclude that 11(c)(1)(C) sentences were categorically ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reductions. <em>See id. </em>at 547-48, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Justice Soto-mayor, however, joined in the plurality\u2019s favorable eligibility determination, explaining that \u201cif [an 11(c)(1)(C) ] agreement expressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offense to establish the term of imprisonment,. and that range is subsequently lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission, the term of imprisonment is \u2018based on\u2019 the range employed and the defendant is eligible for sentence \u25a0 reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). The concurrence\u2019s reasoning, as applied in <em>Freeman, </em>created little practical tension with the plurality because the sentencing range identified by the parties in their 11(c)(1)(C) agreement was the Guidelines range calculated by the district court, and the defendant agreed to have his sentence determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 527-28, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 542\u201444, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment). . ' -</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">This case is different. Although Leonard and the prosecutors agreed to an 11(c)(1)(C) sentence based on their Sentencing Guidelines calculation, that calculation yielded a lower range than the applicable range identified by the district court. Thus, we must consider whether the controlling rationale for decision in <em>Freeman </em>supports Leonard\u2019s claim that his sentence, although imposed pursuant to that agreed-to lower range, was nevertheless \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines for purposes of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Generally, \u201c[w]hen a fragmented [Supreme] Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result \u00e9njoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgment[ ] on the narrowest grounds.\u201d <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court has not identified in a published opinion which <em>Freeman </em>rationale is controlling. We have only assumed the controlling effect of Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion in a number of our unpublished summary orders. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Howell, </em>541 Fed.Appx. 13, 14 (2d Cir. 2013); <em>United States v. Kinsey, </em>533 Fed.Appx. 36, 37-38 (2d Cir. 2013). The parties appear to urge that conclusion here. The matter gives some pause, however, because the one point uniting eight members of the Court in <em>Freeman </em>is their rejection of Justice Sotomayor\u2019s rationale for decision. <em>See Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. at 532-34, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (plurality opinion) (observing that concurrence, by shifting focus of \u201cbased on\u201d inquiry from reasons for judge\u2019s sentence to terms of parties\u2019 plea agreement, risks arbitrary and disparate identification of defendants eligible for reductions from 11(c)(1)(C) sentences); <em>id. </em>at 544, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Roberts., C.J., dissenting) (agreeing with plurality that concurring opinion\u2019s approach is \u201carbitrary and unworkable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Further, our sister circuits have divided in identifying <em>Freeman\u2019s </em>controlling rationale. In published decisions, eight courts of appeals have recognized Justice Sotoma-yor\u2019s concurring opinion as the narrower and, therefore, controlling, rationale for decision. <em>See United States v. Benitez, </em>822 F.3d 807, 811 (5th Cir. 2016); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>States v. Graham, </em>704 F.3d 1275, 1278 (10th Cir. 2013); <em>United States v. Browne, </em>698 F.3d 1042, 1045-46 (8th Cir. 2012); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>687 F.3d 356, 359-60 (7th Cir. 2012); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>682 F.3d 285, 290 (3rd Cir. 2012); <em>United States v. Rivera-Martinez, </em>665 F.3d 344, 348 (1st Cir. 2011); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>658 F.3d 608, 611 (6th Cir. 2011); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>653 F.3d 337, 340 (4th Cir. 2011). A ninth court has done so summarily. <em>See United States v. Cover, </em>491 Fed.Appx. 87, 89 (11th Cir. 2012). Only one of these courts, however, reached that conclusion in circumstances akin to those presented here, that is, an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement to a Guidelines range that turns out to be lower than the applicable range calculated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>658 F.3d at 611. Meanwhile, two courts of appeals\u2014one sitting <em>en </em>banc\u2014have observed that Justice Sotomayor\u2019s rationale for decision in <em>Freeman </em>is not necessarily narrower than that of the plurality and, therefore, declined to accord it controlling effect. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>825 F.3d 1014, 1023 (9th Cir. 2016) <em>(en banc) </em>(concluding that <em>Freeman </em>\u201cplurality opinion is actually the narrower one in certain respects\u201d); <em>United States v. Epps, </em>707 F.3d 337, 350 <em>&amp; </em>n.8 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (suggesting that two rationales for decision are incompatible insofar as focus of plurality\u2019s inquiry is judge and focus of concurrence\u2019s inquiry is parties).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to these two courts, only the <em>Freeman </em>result\u2014\u201cthat \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief is not invariably barred when a sentence was imposed pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement\u201d\u2014is binding, <em>United States v. Epps, </em>707 F.3d at 351, leaving lower courts free to follow the more persuasive rationale for that result, which both courts decided is that of the plurality opinion, <em>see id.; accord United States v. Davis, </em>825 F.3d at 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">We need not here decide which of the <em>Freeman </em>rationales for decision is the narrower, or which is more persuasive, because we conclude that Leonard\u2019s 114-month sentence is properly recognized as \u201cbased on\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines under the reasoning of either the plurality or the concurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">To explain, we begin with the plurality, which recognized that even 11(c)(1)(C) sentences that varied from the Guidelines range calculated by the district court could be \u201cbased on the Guidelines\u201d; \u201cEven where the judge varies\u201d below the recommended Guidelines range, \u201cif the judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guidelines are in a real sense a basis for the sentence.\u201d <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. at 529, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (plurality opinion). This reasoning appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>to recognize the possibility that a sentence can be \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines even if departing or varying from the applicable Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\">That describes this case. The district court here began its consideration of Leonard\u2019s sentence by independently calculating his applicable Guidelines range, adopting certain recommendations by Probation (as to role) and rejecting others (as to firearms possession), without regard to the parties\u2019 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. Only after thus identifying the applicable Guidelines range and then considering it together with \u201call the factors under [18 U.S.C.] Section 3553(a)\u201d did the court effectively decide to vary from the Guidelines and to sentence Leonard within the lower range agreed to by the parties. App\u2019x 94; <em>see United States v. Kuhlman, </em>711 F.3d 1321, 1325 (11th Cir. 2013) (characterizing acceptance of parties\u2019 agreed-to below-Guidelines sentence as \u201ceffectively a ... downward variance\u201d from Guidelines); <em>United States v. Pleasant, </em>704 F.3d at 812 (viewing imposition of below-Guidelines sentence pursuant to plea agreement as equivalent of downward variance). In explaining its acceptance of the 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, the district court referenced the parties\u2019 agreement, but relied in the main on reasoning that would inform a sentence in any event, specifically, that the agreed upon range was \u201csufficient in my view, but not greater than necessary, to meet those [\u00a7 3553(a)] sentencing objectives.\u201d App\u2019x 94-95; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (requiring court to impose \u201csentence sufficient, but not-greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in this subsection\u201d); <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 101, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (recognizing \u201coverarching\u201d statutory obligation, even within Guidelines regimen, to impose sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to accomplish the goals of sentencing\u201d (internal quotation marks -omitted)). The court then proceeded to explain in some detail\u2014spanning seven pages of transcript\u2014how the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as applied specifically to Leonard, warranted a sentence of 114 months* incarceration. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 105-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On this record, we conclude that, under the <em>Freeman </em>plurality\u2019s rationale for decision, Leonard\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines because the district court used his Guidelines range as \u201cthe beginning point\u201d for its sentencing analysis, even though ultimately deciding to vary below that applicable range. <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. at 529, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Turning to Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence, its rationale for decision focused not on the sentencing judge\u2019s consideration of the Guidelines but on the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>See id. </em>at 536-37, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment) (rejecting idea that district courts could \u201creduce a term of imprisonment [pursuant to \u00a7. 3582(c)(2)] simply because the court itself considered the Guidelines\u201d). It concluded that, if an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement \u201ccall[ed] for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular Guidelines sentencing range,\u201d and the district court accepted the agreement, thereby obligating it \u201cto sentence the defendant accordingly,\u201d then \u201cthere can be no doubt that the term of imprisonment the court imposes is \u2018based on\u2019 the agreed-upon sentencing range within the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538, 131 S.Ct. 2685. Justice Sotomayor reached the same conclusion with respect to 11(c)(1)(C) agreements providing for a specific term of imprisonment if they made clear \u201cthat the basis for the specified term is a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 131 S.Ct. 2685.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>This case falls within the concurrence\u2019s first category. In their 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, the parties here not only called for Leonard to be sentenced within the Guidelines range of 97 to 121 months, but also detailed the Guidelines calculation producing that range, identifying the particular Guidelines providing for a base offense level of 30, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), (c)(5); a three-level upward adjustment for aggravating role, see <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(b); and a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a), (b); as well as identifying the Guidelines criminal history category of I. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 11-14. Under the concurrence\u2019s reasoning, when an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement thus expressly uses the Guidelines to identify the agreed-upon sentencing range, a district court\u2019s acceptance of the agreement and its imposition of the agreed-upon sentence satisfies the \u201cbased on\u201d requirement of \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Further, under the concurrence\u2019s rationale for decision, no different conclusion is warranted because, in the agreement, the parties acknowledged that the district court was \u201cnot bound by the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Whatever options were available to the district court before it accepted the parties\u2019 agreement, the <em>Freeman, </em>concurrence specifically states that, once the court indicated acceptance, it was \u201cobligate[d] ... to sentence the defendant accordingly,\u201d that is, according to the agreed-upon Guidelines calculation, so that its sentence was \u201c \u2018based on\u2019 the agreed-upon [Guidelines] sentencing range,\u201d <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. at 538, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">A question arises, however, as to whether the concurrence\u2019s rationale supports that \u201cbased on\u201d conclusion even where, as here, the Guidelines sentencing range agreed to by the parties is not the Guidelines range independently calculated by the district court. In short, can a miscalculated range be deemed \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2)? The <em>Freeman </em>dissenters posed that question as a challenge to the concurrence\u2019s reasoning. <em>See id. </em>at 550-r51,131 S;Ct. 2685 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Justice Sotoma-yor, however, did not hesitate to answer in the affirmative: \u201cBecause it is the parties\u2019 agreement that controls in the [11(c)(1) ](C) agreement context, ... even if the District Court had calculated the range differently than the parties, ... Freeman would still be eligible for resen-tencing, as long as the parties\u2019 chosen range was one that, was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 131 S.Ct. 2685 n.8 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). The dissenters characterized the answer as \u201csurprising\u201d given that \u201cthe governing Guidelines provision specifies that a defendant is only eligible for sentence reduction if the amended Guideline has \u2018the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u2019\u2014presumably the <em>correct </em>applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551,131 S.Ct. 2685 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (emphasis in original) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Because the district court in <em>Freeman </em>did not calculate defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range differently from the parties, these exchanges about a circumstance not before the Court can be viewed as <em>dicta. See United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 523, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008) (stating-that \u201cspeculations\u201d as to \u201ca case that is not before\u201d the Court are \u201cthe purest of dicta\u201d). Further, as we explain <em>infra </em>at Part H.B.2., a post-Freemcw amendment to \u00a7 lB1.10(a) commentary clarifies how a defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range is to be calculated. We need not here decide whether or how this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>clarification might prompt the Supreme Court, and Justice Sotomayor in particular, to refine their analysis of the \u201cbased on\u201d requirement for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. We conclude only that Justice Sotomayor, like her plurality colleagues, reasoned that sentences not within the Guidelines range calculated by the district court could be \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Thus, although the <em>Freeman </em>concurrence and plurality employ different rationales for decision, under either, Leonard\u2019s 114-month sentence is properly understood to be \u201cbased on\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines even though the parties calculated those Guidelines in their 11(c)(1)(C) agreement differently than did the district court. Thus, Leonard satisfies the first eligibility requirement for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">2. The Guidelines Range \u201cApplicable To\u201d Leonard Was Lowered by Amendment from 121 to 151 Months to 97 to 121 Months</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Although Leonard\u2019s sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines, he is only eligible for a sentence reduction to the extent \u201cthe guideline range <em>applicable to </em>[him] has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) (emphasis added); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) (stating that \u201cwhether, and to what extent\u201d defendant\u2019s sentence may be reduced is determined by amended applicable Guidelines range); <em>United States v. Pleasant, </em>704 F.3d at 812 (denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief to defendant because, although he satisfied statute\u2019s \u201cbased on\u201d requirement, crack Guidelines amendment did not lower career offender Guidelines \u201capplicable to\u201d him). The parties here agree that Amendment 782 lowered the Guidelines ranges for most drug crimes, including Leonard\u2019s. They dispute, however, what Guidelines range was \u201capplicable to\u201d Leonard when he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Leonard argues that his initial applicable range was 97 to 121 months, the range specified in his 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, which the district court accepted. Because Amendment 782 lowered that range to 78 to 97 months, Leonard submits he is eligible for a reduction to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">The government maintains that Leonard\u2019s applicable Guidelines range was 121 to 151 months, the range calculated by the district court before accepting the parties\u2019 agreement. It argues that because Amendment 782 lowered that range to 97 to 121 months\u2014the range within which Leonard was sentenced pursuant to his 11(c)(1)(C) agreement\u2014he is not entitled to any further reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">We agree that Leonard\u2019s applicable Guidelines range was 121 to 151 months, but we do not agree that he is <em>ineligible </em>for any reduction from his 114-month sentence. That applicable range having been lowered to 97 to 121 months, the district court\u2014in its discretion\u2014could reduce Leonard\u2019s sentence to anywhere from 97 to 113 months. Thus, Leonard is at least eligible for a sentence reduction to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">To explain our conclusion, we begin with the commentary to \u00a7 IB 1.10, which explicitly defines the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d that must be lowered to allow for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction as \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 lBl.l(a), which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the Guidelines Manual or any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(A). Two parts of this definition defeat Leonard\u2019s argument that the 97-to-121-month range agreed to by the parties in their 11(c)(1)(C) agreement became his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\u201capplicable\u201d range when the district court accepted the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">First, \u00a7 lBl.l(a), referenced in the above-quoted definition, states that \u201c[t]he <em>court </em>shall determine the kinds of sentence and the guideline range <em>as set forth in the guidelines,\u201d </em>whereupon it proceeds to specify the order in' which a court is to apply various Guidelines provisions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lBl.l(a) (emphases added). In short, the highlighted language plainly assigns responsibility- for determining the applicable Guidelines range to \u201cthe court,\u201d not the parties, and requires the court to make that determination \u201cas set forth.in the guidelines,\u201d not by reference to the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Second, and more compelling, the quoted definition states that the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is identified \u201cbefore consideration of any departure ... or' any variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(A). The Sentencing Commission explained that it added this language to the Guidelines commentary to resolve a circuit split on the issue of whether the applicable Guidelines range is determined before or after any departure or variance. <em>See id. </em>at App. C, Vol. Ill, Amend. 759, at 421. The definition makes plain that it is determined before. Our court has acknowledged as much in abrogating our own precedent at odds with the commentary definition. <em>See United States v. Steele, </em>714 F.3d 751, 754 (2d Cir. 2013) (observing that definition makes clear that \u201c \u2018applicable\u2019 amended Guidelines range ... does not incorporate any Guidelines \u2018departures\u2019 \u201d or variances, thus abrogating <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>662 F.3d 166 (2d Cir. 2011) (using sentencing range calculated <em>after </em>departure in determining defendant\u2019s eligibility for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction)); <em>see also United States v. Garrett, </em>758 F.3d 749, 753 (6th Cir. 2014) (stating that applicable Guidelines range is produced \u201cafter a <em>correct </em>determination of the defendant\u2019s total offense level and criminal history category but prior to any discretionary departures\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">As we have already explained, when a district court accepts an 11(c)(1)(C) sentence or sentencing range that is lower than its calculated Guidelines range, what the court effectively does is grant a departure or variance. <em>See supra </em>Part II. B.l. There is no doubt as to the court\u2019s authority to do so. But that does not transform the lower agreed-upon range into the applicable Guidelines range. As the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 makes plain, the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d for purposes of determining a defendant\u2019s eligibility for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is always that determined by the court as set forth in the Guidelines, without regard to the parties\u2019 agreement to a different calculation, and before the exercise of any departure or variance discretion. <em>See United States v. Pleasant, </em>704 F.3d at 811-12.</p>\n<p id=\"A6ci\">That conclusion is reinforced by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6B1.2(c), which states that \u201cthe court may accept\u201d an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement if the sentence agreed to therein is either (1) \u201cwithin the applicable guideline range\u201d or (2) \u201coutside the applicable guideline range for justifiable reasons.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6B1.2(c)(l), (2) (policy statement). The second option plainly recognizes that an 11(c)(1)(C) sentence or sentencing range may <em>not </em>fall within or equate to the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as that term is defined in the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 and identified pursuant to \u00a7 lBl.l(a). <em>See generally Brown v. Gardner, </em>513 U.S. 115, 118, 115 S.Ct. 552, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994) (presuming that \u201cgiven term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute\u201d); <em>accord United States v. Steele, </em>714 F.3d at 754 n.2 (applying principle to Guidelines). Thus, although \u00a7 6B 1.2(c) ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>proves 11(c)(1)(C) sentences \u201coutside the applicable guideline range for justifiable reasons,\u201d it does not thereby transform \u201cthe applicable guideline range\u201d to whatever the parties agree to in their 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. It simply recognizes, as we have here, the court\u2019s authority to impose 11(c)(1)(C) sentences that depart or vary from the applicable Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Pleasant, </em>704 F.3d at 812,</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Leonard maintains that the <em>Freeman </em>concurrence compels a different conclusion insofar as it states that, in the context of 11(c)(1)(C) sentences, \u201cit is -the parties\u2019 agreement that controls,\u201d so that \u201ceven if the District Court had calculated the range differently than the parties, [defendant] would still be eligible for resentencing, as <em>long as the parties\u2019 chosen range was one that was \u2022 subsequently ... lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. at 542 n.8, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment) (emphasis added); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>658 F.3d at 613 (holding that agreed-to range was applicable because <em>Freeman </em>makes clear that \u201cwhere the parties have entered into a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement that is based on the Sentencing Guidelines, the applicable Guidelines range for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c) is the one provided in the plea agreement\u201d). We are not persuaded that <em>Freeman </em>compels the. result Leonard urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">First, <em>Freeman </em>did not have to decide what constitutes the applicable sentencing range for purposes of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. The defendant\u2019s agreed-upon 11(c)(1)(C) sentence was there within the Guidelines range calculated by the district court, and there was no question that that range had been lowered by retroactive amendment. <em>See Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. at 527-28, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (plurality opinion). Thus, the only question for decision was whether such an 11(c)(1)(C) sentence could be deemed \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines as required for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. A majority answered that question in the affirmative, see <em>id. </em>at 526, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 534, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment); a minority in the negative, <em>see id. </em>at 544, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In these circumstances, whatever authority the <em>Freeman </em>concurring opinion commands under <em>Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. at 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, with respect to identifying 11(c)(1)(C) sentences \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines, that authority would not extend to identifying the Guidelines range \u201capplicable to\u201d a defendant when the district court calculates that range differently from the parties in their 11(c)(1)(C) agreement. The concurrence\u2019s \u201ceven if\u2019 conclusion about such a circumstance\u2014not then before the Court\u2014is at best <em>dictum. See United States v. Martino, </em>664 F.2d 860, 872-73 (2d Cir. 1981) (construing \u201cnarrowest grounds\u201d under <em>Marks </em>test as \u201cground that is most nearly confined to the precise fact situation before the Court, rather than to a ground that states more general rules\u201d). To the extent Leonard invokes such <em>dictum </em>.to extend reasoning unanimously rejected by all other members of the Court, we understandably hesitate. <em>See Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. at 532-34, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 544, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). In any event, there is a second, compelling reason for rejecting Leonard\u2019s \u201capplicable to\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Specifically, the construction Leonard infers from the <em>Freeman </em>concurrence is now at odds with a subsequent amendment to the Guidelines that explicitly defines the \u201capplicable\u201d range that must be lowered for a party to be eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>n.l(A). As already discussed, that definition provides for the court to calculate the applicable range according to the Sentencing Manual. <em>See supra </em>Part II.B.2. It does not contemplate that the parties will themselves identify the applicable Guidelines range, much less that they will do so differently than the district court. Nor does that definition permit a departure or variance\u2014which is effectively what the court grants when it accepts an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement specifying a lower Guidelines range than that calculated by the district court\u2014to reduce the applicable Guidelines range. Rather, the commentary defines the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d as \u201cthe guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.1(a)\u201d\u2014that is, by \u201cthe court ... as set forth in the Guidelines,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.1 (a)\u2014\u201cwhich is determined <em>before </em>consideration of any departure ... or variance,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.1(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Because this definition was added to the Guidelines on November 1, 2011, <em>id. </em>at App. C, Vol. Ill, Amend. 759\u215b at 421, some four months after the <em>Freeman </em>decision, it supersedes any contrary understanding of the - \u201capplicable\u201d Guidelines range that Leonard might urge from <em>dictum </em>in the concurring opinion. <em>See Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 46, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (holding that \u201cprior judicial constructions of a particular guideline cannot prevent the Commission from adopting a conflicting interpretation\u201d). Moreover, because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) expressly incorporates the Guidelines, the definition now binds the courts in assessing eligibility for a sentence reduction. <em>See generally Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. at 828, 130 S.Ct. 2683 (holding that Sixth Amendment does not require treating \u00a7 1B1.10 requirements for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction as merely advisory).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">To the extent the decision we reach today differs from that in <em>United States v. McCall, </em>649 Fed.Appx. 114 (2d Cir. 2016), we note, first, that <em>McCall </em>is a summary order and, therefore, does not preclude this panel from further considering the issues there addressed. <em>See Aguas Lenders Recovery Grp. v. Suez, S.A., </em>585 F.3d 696, 702 n.4 (2d Cir. 2009).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A21\">Second, <em>McCall </em>is distinguishable from this case in that, like in <em>Freeman, </em>the parties\u2019 arguments there focus\u00e9d on whether the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant McCall at 5-6, Brief for Appellee United States at 9-12, <em>United States v. McCall, </em>649 Fed.Appx. 114 (2d Cir. 2016) (No. 15-1814). The United States did not argue that, if defendant\u2019s sentence was based on the- Guidelines, his applicable range was the one calculated by the district court, rather than the lower range agreed to by the parties. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellee United States at 9-12, <em>United States v. McCall, </em>649 Fed.Appx. 114 (2d Cir. 2016) (No. 15-1814) (arguing principally that 11(c)(1)(C) agreement did not sufficiently tether agreed-upon sentence to Guidelines, as required to be \u201cbased on\u201d Guidelines under <em>Freeman </em>concurrence). Nor did any party call to the court\u2019s attention the intervening definitional amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ment to the Guidelines, expressly stating that the \u201capplicable\u201d sentencing range is to be determined \u201cpursuant to 1B1.1(a),\u201d and \u201cbefore consideration of any departure provision ... or any variance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.1(A). That definition does not contemplate recognizing a lower Guidelines range identified in parties\u2019 11(c)(1)(C) agreement as the applicable range. Thus, the <em>McCall </em>panel accepted the whole of the <em>Freeman </em>concurrence\u2019s footnote 8 without distinguishing the \u201cbased on\u201d and \u201capplicable to\u201d requirements for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Accordingly, while <em>Freeman' </em>sign\u00e1is that the 97-to-121-month range in Leonard\u2019s 11(c)(1)(C) agreement was \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines, commentary to the Guidelines now instincts that Leonard\u2019s \u201capplicable\u201d Guidelines range was 121 to 151 months, as calculated by the district court pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.1(a) and <em>before </em>it. accepted an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement, effectively granting a variance. Because <em>that </em>applicable. range was retroactively lowered by Amendments 782 and 788 to 97 to 121 months, Leonard is eligible for a sentence reduction, but only to the extent of that range, , in short, to between 97 and 113 months. We thus vacate the challenged order and remand for the district court to consider whether to exercise its reduction discretion. <em>See United States v. Mock, </em>612 F.3d 133, 137 (2d Cir. 2010) (holding that, where defendant is eligible for sentence reduction, district court may reduce sentence \u201cin its discretion\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In urging against vacatur and remand, the government argues that any error in the district court\u2019s understanding of Leonard\u2019s eligibility for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction was necessarily harmless because, \u201chaving already used\u201d a 97-to-121-month sentencing range\u2014pursuant to the parties\u2019 11(c)(1)(C) agreement\u2014to determine an appropriate sentence, \u201cit is beyond cavil that the district court would have imposed the same 114-month sentence\u201d in the exercise of its \u00a7 3582(c)(2) discretion. Appellee\u2019s Br. 15; <em>see United States v. Mock, </em>612 F.3d at 137. The argument is not without some force, but the urged conclusion is not certain. <em>Cf. United States v. Jass, </em>569 F.3d 47, 68 (2d Cir. 2009) (stating that procedural error in sentencing is harmless only where \u201crecord indicates clearly that the district court would have imposed the same sentence in any event\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). That is because we do not know what weight the district court gave the initial applicable Guidelines range in granting the variance reflected in the parties\u2019 agreed-to lower range. Thus, we cannot be certain that if the district court were presented with a lower applicable range equal to the agreed-to range, it would not sentence at the lower end of the range. <em>See United States v. Feldman, </em>647 F.3d 450, 459-60 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[Blecause the correct Guidelines, range is the starting point and the initial benchmark for federal sentences, we cannot lightly assume that [a different range calculation] would not affect the sentence.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In any event, a district court exercises its reduction discretion only \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent they are applicable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. at 824-25, 130 S.Ct. 2683; <em>United States v. Christie, </em>736 F.3d at 195 (observing that district court must \u201cconsider any applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discretion, the reduction ... is warranted ... under the particular circumstances of the case\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because this consideration can be informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>by post-sentencing behavior, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.1(B)(iii), the \u00a7 3553(a) factors may present differently on remand and be accorded different weights than at the initial sentence. In these circumstances, we cannot assume that just because the district judge, on weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors at the original sentenc: ing, granted an agreed-to variance within the very range to which the applicable range has now been lowered by amendment, the district court would not exercise its discretion to grant any further reduction within the available 97-to-113-month frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">We express no view as to how the district court should exercise its discretion. We conclude only that Leonard is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction of his 114-month sentence to a term not less than 97 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">To summarize, we conclude as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">1. To be eligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant must satisfactorily demonstrate (a) that his sentence was \u201cbased on\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines, and (b) that his \u201capplicable\u201d Guidelines range was lowered by a subsequent retroactive amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">2. Because (a) the district court considered the Guidelines in accepting the parties\u2019 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, and (b) the parties calculated the sentencing range specified in that agreement using the Sentencing Guidelines, Leonard\u2019s sentence within that range is properly deemed \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines under the reasoning of both the plurality and concurring opinions in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 522, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519, <em>see id. </em>at 525, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (plurality opinion); <em>id. </em>at 534, 131 S.Ct. 2685 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment), notwithstanding the fact that the district court, before accepting the agreement, had calculated the defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">3. While an 11(c)(1)(C) sentencing range that is lower than the district court\u2019s applicable, Guidelines calculation can be recognized as \u201cbased on\u201d the Guidelines under <em>Freeman, </em>such an agreed-to range does not thereby become the \u201capplicable\u201d range for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A post-<em>Freeman </em>amendment to Guidelines commentary now clarifies that the \u201capplicable\u201d Guidelines range is one determined (a) by the court according to the Guidelines Manual, not by the parties\u2019 agreement; and (b) \u201cbefore consideration of any departure ... or any variance,\u201d such as would be granted pursuant to an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement that contemplates a lower Guidelines range than that calculated by the district court. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">4. Leonard\u2019s initial \u201capplicable\u201d Guidelines range was 121 to 151 months, as determined by the district court before it accepted the parties\u2019 11(c)(1)(C) agreement specifying a 97-to-121-month range. Because that applicable range was retroactively amended to 97 to 121 months, Leonard is at least eligible for a reduction in- his 114-month Guidelines-based sentence, but not to any term lower than 97 months, with the ultimate decision whether to grant any reduction committed to the discretion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Accordingly, the final order of the district court holding Leonard ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-8\">. Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C) states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-9\">If the defendant pleads guilty ..., the plea agreement may specify that an attorney for the government will: ... (C) agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case, or that a particular provision of the Sentencing Guidelines, or policy statement, or sentencing factor does or does not apply (such a recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar\">A court \"may accept [an 11(c)(1)(C)] agreement, reject it, or defer a decision until the court has reviewed the presentence report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>11(c)(3)(A). If a court rejects such an agreement, however, it must \u201cgive the defendant an opportunity to withdraw the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>11(c)(5)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b148-6\">. That statute states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-7\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant ..., the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-16\">. In his plea agreement, Leonard waived the right to appeal or collaterally attack any component of a sentence falling within or below the 97-to-121-month range agreed to by the parties. Because the government does not argue that this waiver forecloses the instant appeal, we do not here consider that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\">. Insofar as <em>Pleasant </em>relied on <em>United States v. Austin, </em>676 F.3d 924 (9th Cir. 2012), in identifying Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 522, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), as controlling, <em>Austin </em>has now been overruled by <em>United States v. Davis, </em>825 F.3d 1014, 1022 (9th Cir. 2016) <em>(en banc), </em>thus abrogating that part of <em>Pleasant. </em>We discuss <em>Freeman </em>and <em>Davis </em>further <em>infra </em>at Part II.B.l. We here note only that the parts of <em>Pleasant </em>cited in this opinion appear unaffected by <em>Davis, </em>In any event, we would reach the conclusions stated herein even without support from <em>Pleasant.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\">. In concluding that the rationale for decision of the <em>Freeman </em>concurrence was not necessarily narrower than that of the plurality, the D.C. and Ninth Circuits hypothesized a scenario in which an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement provided for a particular Guidelines range to apply and a sentence at the bottom of that range to be imposed, only to have the district court, while accepting the agreement, conclude that the agreed-to range did not pertain at all because the career offender range was applicable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">Using Justice Sotomayor\u2019s standard, if the sentencing range used by the parties is subsequently reduced, the defendant would be eligible for a sentence reduction because the plea agreement was accepted and provided for a stipulated sentence based on a subsequently reduced range\u2014according to Justice Sotomayor, eligibility is determined based on the agreement. The plurality, however, would find this defendant ineligible because the range that the parties agreed to played no role in the court's determination that this was an appropriate sentence, despite the fact, that the court imposed the agreed-upon term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-13\"><em>United States v. Epps, </em>707 F.3d at 350 n.8 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord United States v. Davis, </em>825 F.3d at 1023.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b157-5\">. McCall was sentenced pursuant to an 11(c)(1)(C) agreement to a prison term of 108 months, which derived from the parties\u2019 calculation of an anticipated 108-to-135-month Guidelines range. At sentencing, the parties and the district court agreed that the Guidelines calculations underlying the agreement were erroneous and that defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range was 121 to 151 months. Nevertheless, relying on the <em>Freeman </em>concurrence, this court determined that McCall was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on the lowering of the agreed-to 108-to-135-month range to an 87-to-108-month range. <em>See United States v.
