Because there is no constitutional right to hybrid representation on appeal, <em>see United States v. Og-bonna, </em>184 F.3d 447, 449 <em>&amp; </em>n.l (5th Cir. 1999), Villafranca\u2019s pro se letter filed after the close of briefing is not considered herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-19\">Section 3B1.3 provides for a two-level upward adjustment if the defendant used a special skill in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense. We have held that the ability to drive a tractor trailer truck as evidenced by the possession of a commercial driver\u2019s license constitutes a special skill for purposes of \u00a7 3B1.3. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>627 Fed.Appx. 381, 382 (5th Cir 2015); <em>United States v. Ordonez, </em>334 Fed.Appx. 619, 624 (5th Cir. 2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While merely persuasive, <em>see Ballard v. Burton, </em>444 F.3d 391, 401 <em>&amp; </em>n.7 (5th Cir. 2006), our unpublished decisions are consistent with the decisions of - other circuits on this issue. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Berry, </em>717 F.3d 823, 834-35 (10th Cir. 2013); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>509 Fed.Appx. 889, 894 (11th Cir. 2013); <em>United States v. Vasallo, </em>518 Fed.Appx. 147, 149 (4th Cir. 2013); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>332 F.3d 455, 458-59 (7th Cir. 2003); <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>78 F.3d 460, 465 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-20\">Furthermore, in <em>Gonzalez, </em>627 Fed. Appx. at 382, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s commercial driver\u2019s license and years of truck-driving experience significantly facilitated his commission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>offense of transporting undocumented aliens because, without those special skills, he would have been unable to tow the tractors in which the aliens were hidden. As we explained in <em>United States v. Gill, </em>642 Fed.Appx. 323, 326 (5th Cir. 2016), by carrying the aliens in the truck\u2019s trailer, the defendant \u201cgave the appearance that he was hauling a legitimate load and made it much more difficult to identify the aliens.\u201d The record showed that Villafranca, who had fifteen years of commercial truck-driving experience, acted as a licensed truck driver purporting to carry a legitimate load through a checkpoint on one of the nation\u2019s busiest corridors where there are thousands of other tractor-trailers. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Villafranca\u2019s special skill of driving a tractor trailer truck significantly facilitated the commission of the offenses. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.3; <em>United States v. Pruett, </em>681 F.3d 232, 248 (5th Cir. 2012). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-17\">. Although both <em>Gonzalez </em>and <em>Ordonez </em>refer to this skill merely as \"possession\u201d of a commercial driver\u2019s license (\"CDL\u201d), their analysis makes it clear that possession of a CDL is shorthand for the knowledge and ability to drive a tractor trailer truck, evinced by the legitimate acquisition of a CDL. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>627 Fed.Appx, at 382 (\u201cAs the district court determined, Gonzalez not only possessed a commercial driver's license but also had a particular ability to drive a truck towing two additional tractors,\u201d); <em>Ordonez, </em>334 Fed.Appx. at 624 (\"We have never directly addressed the issue of whether a CDL may constitute a 'special skill,\u2019 but other courts have determined that a special skill enhancement based on the ability to drive a tractor trailer truck may be appropriate.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
