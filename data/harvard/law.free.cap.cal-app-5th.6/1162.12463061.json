Chambasis, and Victor Bibiano separately appeal their convictions and sentences for murder, attempted murder, and discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling following a gang-related shooting that killed two victims and seriously injured a third. We previously affirmed the judgments with certain corrections to their sentences. Our high court granted review and transferred the case to us for reconsideration of defendants\u2019 confrontation clause challenges to the gang expert\u2019s testimony in light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(2016) 63 Cal.4th 665 [204 Cal.Rptr.3d 102, 374 P.3d 320] <em>(Sanchez). </em>In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude reversal is not warranted under <em>Sanchez, </em>so we once again affirm the judgments as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-6\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-7\">Appellants were jointly charged with the murders of Javier Zamora and Justin Curiel (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a); counts 1 &amp; 2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the attempted premeditated murder of Jose Santa Ana (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 664; count 3), and discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling (\u00a7 246; count 4). For the murder counts, multiple-murder and gang-murder special circumstances were alleged. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3), (22).) A variety of firearm and gang enhancements were also alleged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A first trial ended in a mistrial after the jury deadlocked. On retrial, the jury found appellants guilty on all counts and found all special circumstances and enhancements true. At separate sentencing hearings, the trial court sentenced each appellant to life without the possibility of parole, a consecutive life sentence, and an additional 50 years to life in state prison as follows: life without the possibility of parole for count 1, plus 25 years to life pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d); and a consecutive life sentence on count 3, plus 25 years to life pursuant to section 12022.53, subdivision (d). The court imposed concurrent sentences on counts 2 and 4 and stayed the remaining enhancements for counts 1 and 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court imposed various fines, fees, and custody credits discussed further, <em>post, </em>as necessary. Appellants separately appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-8\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-9\">The shooting in this case was part of a long-standing rivalry between two gangs in Pacoima: Pacoima Terra Bella (Terra Bella) and the Pacoima Project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>Boys (Project Boys). The rivalry reached a heated point on May 5, 2008, when Project Boys member Jose Avila shot and killed Terra Bella member Alejandro Villa. Avila was convicted of the murder. The shooting by appellants here\u2014all Terra Bella members\u2014was viewed as retaliation for Villa\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-4\">On September 20, 2009, the day of the shooting, 16-year-old Project Boys member Santa Ana lived at the San Fernando Gardens housing project, which was in Project Boys gang territory. Santa Ana and fellow Project Boys member Zamora were on the porch of Rosemary Hurtado\u2019s apartment when Curiel joined them. Curiel was not a gang member and had just moved into San Fernando Gardens. About five minutes after Curiel arrived, three males approached, carrying firearms. Santa Ana recognized them and identified them at trial as Bibiano, also known as \u201cBlacky\u201d; Meraz, also known as \u201cCurley\u201d; and Chambasis, also known as \u201cBash.\u201d Bibiano asked the trio where they were from, which Santa Ana knew was gang parlance asking which gang they were from. Curiel tried to say he \u201cwasn\u2019t from anywhere.\u201d One of the appellants said they were from Terra Bella. Meraz told a group of young children playing nearby, including Curiel\u2019s brother, to leave. When the children left, appellants began shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-5\">Before the shooting, 12-year-old S.B. was playing near the porch where the shooting took place. She noticed three males approaching the victims on the porch. One of the approaching males had a gun in his hand, and S.B. identified him at trial as Chambasis. As the shooting began, she grabbed her younger brother and carried him inside her house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">Zamora was shot seven times, and three of the shots were fatal. Curiel was shot four times, and two of the shots were fatal. Santa Ana was shot five times, and although he survived, he pretended like he was dead. After appellants fled back the way they had come, Santa Ana saw his friends were dead, so he tried to walk toward a nearby fire station but collapsed on the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-7\">Hurtado heard the gunshots, emerged from her apartment to investigate, and saw Santa Ana and the other two victims. As she checked on her children, Santa Ana walked away. When she found him heading toward the fire station, he repeatedly told her \u201cTerra Bella\u201d shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-8\">Several Los Angeles police officers arrived at the scene. One officer approached Santa Ana and said to him, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die. Who shot you? What happened?\u201d Santa Ana responded, \u201cBlacky from Terra Bella Street,\u201d i.e., Bibiano, shot him. He told another officer \u201cBlacky\u201d had tattoos of a \u201c1\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1167\">*1167</page-number>and a \u201c3\u201d on his forearms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the hospital, Santa Ana was shown a series of photographs and he identified all three appellants as the shooters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-5\">Thirteen shell casings, eight bullets, and two partial bullets were recovered from the scene. A ballistics expert linked one of the casings to a gun used by Timothy Jenkins in a shooting eight days earlier. Jenkins was a member of the Pacoima Pirns gang, which had a friendly relationship with Terra Bella. He told police he traded the gun to Chambasis for marijuana on the day before the shooting at San Fernando Gardens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">All three appellants were arrested the day after the shooting. When officers contacted Meraz, he briefly attempted to flee but was apprehended. Officers recovered a cell phone and a belt buckle with the letter \u201cT\u201d on it. Chambasis and Bibiano were arrested when officers stopped the car they were riding in together. Bibiano gave officers a false name. A search of Chambasis\u2019s residence yielded two Pittsburgh Pirates baseball caps with \u201cRIP, Bones\u201d and \u201cTBST\u201d written on them, a rifle, a shotgun, and other items with his name on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-7\">While in custody, Bibiano and Meraz were placed in a cell together and their conversation was secretly recorded. Bibiano said he was going to \u201cdo life.\u201d He said officers got him in \u201cBash\u2019s car\u201d about an hour before. He claimed he did not know anything because he \u201cwas not even there.\u201d Meraz also claimed he \u201cwasn\u2019t even there\u201d and said he did not know Bash. Bibiano responded, \u201cMe neither.\u201d Bibiano said, \u201cThe rest of my life has gone to waste,\u201d to which Meraz responded, \u201cAll because of some stupid shit.\u201d Bibiano said Bash had told him, \u201cDon\u2019t trip, dude,\u201d and Bibiano had responded, \u201cI\u2019m no fuckin\u2019 rat, man.\u201d Meraz commented, \u201cIf you rat, foo\u2019, they\u2019fl make paperwork on you,\u201d and \u201cwhen you get to the big house, they fuck you up, foo\u2019. Don\u2019t say anything.\u201d Bibiano said, \u201cYeah, I know. It doesn\u2019t matter ain\u2019t gonna happen. I don\u2019t even got nothing. Shit, I was not even there, man. What the fuck I\u2019m gonna tell you?\u201d Meraz claimed all the police had was \u201ca bunch of gossip.\u201d Meraz said, \u201cWhat saved me foo\u2019, is that they asked me what I was doing. And I told him that\u2014that I was with Paula. And they called her and she said yes.\u201d Bibiano responded, \u201cHopefully my girl will also say yes.\u201d They talked about serving life in prison and Meraz said he had \u201clost everything . . . [a]ll because of one thing.\u201d Bibiano said, \u201cWe\u2019ll never get out, dude. Never.\u201d Bibiano said something about leaving the house and \u201cI wasn\u2019t even gonna go out, foo\u2019. I should\u2019ve stayed, I should\u2019ve stayed.\u201d Meraz agreed. When Bibiano said the police showed him a picture of Meraz, Meraz responded, \u201cWe should\u2019ve worn masks. Stupid ass, Bash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1168\">*1168</page-number>During an interview about the murders, Bibiano began to cry. He denied knowing Chambasis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-4\">At an interview with the police after appellants were arrested, Luis E. Orozco said Bibiano \u201cjumped\u201d him into the gang and Terra Bella had \u201cproblems\u201d with Project Boys after Villa\u2019s murder. Orozco was with appellants at a park three to five miles away from the San Fernando Gardens at around 5:00 p.m. the day of the shooting. He let Bibiano borrow his cell phone and Bibiano left the park around 5:20 p.m. After Bibiano left the park, he called Orozco later at home and told him, \u201cDon\u2019t go outside there\u2019s too much cops.\u201d At some point, Bibiano returned to say goodbye to his girlfriend and gave Orozco his phone back. Bibiano began to watch the news, which Orozco found suspicious. In response to a story showing \u201cladies crying\u201d in \u201cthe Projects right here,\u201d Bibiano seemed nervous and said, \u201cMan, fuck. I got to get the fuck out of here.\u201d He said he had \u201cfucked up\u201d and he was \u201cgoing to hell.\u201d A recording of the news broadcast from that day showed photographs of Zamora and Curiel with signs reading \u201cRest in peace, Javier, Pimps\u201d and \u201cRest in peace, Justin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">A search of the phone Orozco said he lent Bibiano and the phone recovered from Meraz revealed a text message was sent from Meraz\u2019s phone to Orozco\u2019s phone at 1:17 p.m. the day after the shooting reading, \u201cI\u2019m going to Sinaloa tonight. I already got my ticket.\u201d At 1:27 p.m., Orozco\u2019s phone responded, \u201cCan I go with you, or what[?]\u201d At 7:05 p.m. on the day of the shooting, Meraz\u2019s phone sent a text message to a different number reading, \u201cOn the run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">Officer Tyler Adams testified as a gang expert for the prosecution. He was assigned to monitor Terra Bella and he gathered information by talking to gang members, both in and out of custody, as well as interviewing them as part of conducting probation and parole services. Terra Bella had approximately 30 members and their symbols included \u201c13\u201d to signify affiliation with the Mexican Mafia and the hand signals and initials \u201cTB\u201d and \u201cTBS.\u201d The gang\u2019s primary activities were burglary, grand theft, carrying loaded and concealed firearms, assault with firearms, assault likely to cause great bodily injury, and felony vandalism. Officer Adams identified convictions of several Terra Bella gang members for those types of crimes. He confirmed the rivalry between Terra Bella and Project Boys, which became heated after Avila murdered Villa in May 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">Officer Adams confirmed all three appellants were Terra Bella gang members. Meraz had previously admitted he was a Terra Bella gang member, and when Officer Adams had previously stopped him, he had been with other gang members, had been wearing gang attire, and had \u201cPTB\u201d tattooed inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>his bottom lip. During one stop, Meraz said he was trying to get into Terra Bella and had to \u201csmoke somebody\u201d to do so. Bibiano had gang tattoos and when Officer Adams previously stopped him, he had been with other gang members. Officer Adams had also obtained a photograph showing Bibiano throwing gang hand signals. Chambasis also had gang tattoos and Officer Adams had previously stopped him in the presence of other Terra Bella gang members. Since his arrest, Chambasis had added tattoos to his face and neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">Officer Adams testified to the importance of respect in a gang and \u201cputting in work\u201d by typically committing crimes to move up in the gang. He believed the shooting in this case was bold within Terra Bella, given it occurred during the day in rival gang territory. When given a hypothetical question tracking the facts of the shooting, Officer Adams opined the shooting was retaliatory for Villa\u2019s murder. He also opined the murders were associated with, committed for, and likely committed at the direction of Terra Bella.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">Appellants did not testify. In his defense, Chambasis offered evidence that no fingerprint analysis was done on the casings recovered at the scene of the shooting. He elicited testimony that when police interviewed S.B. at the police station after the shooting, she said the gunman she remembered was shorter than the officer interviewing her, who was about five feet 10 inches tall, and had hair. She said the other men did not have guns. When she was shown two books of photographs, she pointed to someone who was not Chambasis and said, \u201cKind of No. 11 . . . but only had hair.\u201d Chambasis also elicited testimony that at the scene of the shooting and later in the hospital, Santa Ana claimed he did not know one of the assailants. In his defense, Bibiano elicited testimony that Santa Ana initially said at the scene of the shooting that he did not know from which direction the gunmen had come. He also said appellants all wore black and Meraz was the one who said, \u201cWhere you vatos from.\u201d He did not see them in a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">1. <em>Santa Ana Impeachment Evidence</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pA-g\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"44\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABegAAAAsAQAAAAA2/GU1AAAA7UlEQVR4nO2YMW7CQBBFv5ELunADuAm5GelyLCJxEOAEuAsSzj4KPGHlFqwv0LzSTzN6u3blBr0wM3fAQ2S9j6z3kfU+st5H1vvIeh9Z7yPrfbxH/VlSL6lI0pekH0kHSV0lCBkiphhPTbgOVYIbR6ADzhsoS+AD+AZ2lejXgwwRU/8ipiZc16/vIu6+Pn4ZH7/TI7f55HX1y3mP734laSFpPjxrpNuxPyvRxkCImGrHUxOua2sxfPe/wAX4A9gAW2APnCpRQoaIqTKemnBd4S6a/BtlI+t9ZL2PrPeR9T6y3kfW+8h6H1nv47Xrr3bcseGwVX8LAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"1512\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-9\">\n<em>2. Gang Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">Appellants jointly contend the trial court violated their Sixth Amendment rights to confrontation by allowing Officer Adams to give expert opinions based on out-of-court testimonial hearsay from declarants whom appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>did not have an opportunity to cross-examine. Before our high court decided <em>Sanchez, </em>we found no error. Reevaluating appellants\u2019 contentions in light of <em>Sanchez, </em>we conclude a narrow portion of Officer Adams\u2019s testimony was barred by the confrontation clause and state law, but the erroneous admission of that testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-4\">A. <em>Sanchez</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">In <em>Sanchez, </em>our high court considered the extent to which <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] <em>(Crawford) </em>limits an expert witness from relating case-specific hearsay in explaining the basis for an opinion, and it clarified the application of state hearsay rules to that kind of expert testimony. It held the case-specific out-of-court statements conveyed by the prosecution\u2019s gang expert constituted inadmissible hearsay under state law and, to the extent they were testimonial, ran afoul of <em>Crawford. (Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at pp. 670-671.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">As is typical in gang-related prosecutions, the gang expert in <em>Sanchez </em>testified to his background and experience \u201cinvestigating gang-related crime; interacting with gang members, as well as their relatives; and talking to other community members who may have information about gangs and their impact on the areas where they operate. As part of his duties, [he] read reports about gang investigations; reviewed court records relating to gang prosecutions; read jail letters; and became acquainted with gang symbols, colors, and art work.\u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 671.) He also testified about the gang to which the defendant allegedly belonged, including its primary activities and the convictions of two gang members demonstrating the gang\u2019s pattern of criminal activity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 672.) As to the defendant specifically, the expert testified about five contacts defendant had with police reflected in a STEP<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> notice, police reports, and a field identification (FI) card. The expert was not present during any of the contacts and only related the information recorded by other officers. Based on this information, the expert opined the defendant was a gang member. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 673.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">The defendant challenged the admission of the gang expert\u2019s testimony describing the defendant\u2019s prior contacts with police, arguing it was testimonial hearsay that violated his confrontation clause rights. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>Cal.4th at p. 674.) The defendant did <em>not </em>challenge the admission of the background testimony from the expert, such as his description of \u201cgeneral gang behavior or descriptions of the . . . gang\u2019s conduct and its territory.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 698.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">As the court explained, under <em>Crawford </em>and the confrontation clause, a hearsay statement is inadmissible unless it falls within an exception recognized at the time of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s adoption or the declarant is unavailable to testify and the defendant had a previous opportunity for cross-examination or that opportunity was forfeited. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 680.) Thus, a court\u2019s task in evaluating out-of-court statements under hearsay rules and <em>Crawford </em>is two-fold: \u201cThe first step is a traditional hearsay inquiry: Is the statement one made out of court; is it offered to prove the truth of the facts it asserts; and does it fall under a hearsay exception? If a hearsay statement is being offered by the prosecution in a criminal case, and the <em>Crawford </em>limitations of unavailability, as well as cross-examination or forfeiture, are not satisfied, a second analytical step is required. Admission of such a statement violates the right to confrontation if the statement is <em>testimonial hearsay, </em>as the high court defines that term.\u201d (Sanchez, <em>supra, </em>at p. 680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">On the state law question, the court drew a line between an expert\u2019s testimony as to general background information and case-specific facts. Traditionally, \u201can expert\u2019s testimony concerning his general knowledge, even if technically hearsay, has not been subject to exclusion on hearsay grounds,\u201d but experts have not been permitted to convey case-specific hearsay about which the expert has no personal knowledge. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 676.) The court defined case-specific facts as \u201cthose relating to the particular events and participants alleged to have been involved in the case being tried.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>An expert may \u201ctestify about more generalized information to help jurors understand the significance of those case-specific facts. An expert is also allowed to give an opinion about what those facts may mean. The expert is generally not permitted, however, to supply case-specific facts about which he has no personal knowledge.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court gave several examples of this distinction, one of which pertained directly to gang experts: \u201cThat an associate of the defendant had a diamond tattooed on his arm would be a case-specific fact that could be established by a witness who saw the tattoo, or by an authenticated photograph. That the diamond is a symbol adopted by a given street gang would be background information about which a gang expert could testify. The expert could also be allowed to give an opinion that the presence of a diamond tattoo shows the person belongs to the gang.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 677.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-8\">The court explained that courts frequently avoided any confrontation clause issues with this kind of expert basis evidence by \u201cconcluding that statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>related by experts are not hearsay because they \u2018go only to the basis of [the expert\u2019s] opinion and should not be considered for their truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at pp. 680-681.) The court disapproved this reasoning when the expert bases an opinion on case-specific facts about which he or she has no personal knowledge: \u201cIf an expert testifies to case-specific out-of-court statements to explain the bases for his opinion, those statements are necessarily considered by the jury for their truth, thus rendering them hearsay. Like any other hearsay evidence, it must be properly admitted through an applicable hearsay exception. Alternatively, the evidence can be admitted through an appropriate witness and the expert may assume its truth in a properly worded hypothetical question in the traditional manner.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 684, fn. omitted.) Because this testimony is hearsay, it implicates <em>Crawford </em>and the confrontation clause if the statements are also testimonial and none of <em>Crawford's </em>exceptions apply. (Sanchez, at p. 685.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">The court thus crafted the following rule: \u201cWhen any expert relates to the jury case-specific out-of-court statements, and treats the content of those statements as true and accurate to support the expert\u2019s opinion, the statements are hearsay. It cannot logically be maintained that the statements are not being admitted for their truth. If the case is one in which a prosecution expert seeks to relate <em>testimonial </em>hearsay, there is a confrontation clause violation unless (1) there is a showing of unavailability and (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-exantination, or forfeited that right by wrongdoing.\u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 686, fn. omitted.) Canvassing confrontation clause cases, it concluded hearsay statements are testimonial if they are made \u201cprimarily to memorialize facts relating to past criminal activity, which could be used like trial testimony. Nontestimonial statements are those whose primary purpose is to deal with an ongoing emergency or some other purpose unrelated to preserving facts for later use at trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 689.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Turning to the facts of the case, the court concluded the police reports, the STEP notice, and potentially the FI card were case-specific testimonial hearsay, violating the confrontation clause. First, the three contacts with the defendant reflected in police reports compiled by the investigating officers during the investigations of those crimes were \u201cstatements about a completed crime, made to an investigating officer by a nontestifying witness,\u201d which \u201care generally testimonial unless they are made in the context of an ongoing emergency ... or for some primary purpose other than preserving facts for use at trial.\u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 694.) It did not matter that the officers summarized the statements or that the defendant himself was not accused of the crimes. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 694-695.) Second, the sworn STEP notice retained by police recording the defendant\u2019s biographical and other information was testimonial because it was a formal sworn statement from a police officer that the information was accurate, and its primary purpose was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>collect information for later use at trial. <em>(Sanchez, </em>at p. 696.) Finally, the FI card memorializing the contact with the defendant could be testimonial, but the court did not decide the issue because the expert\u2019s testimony was unclear and confusing on this point. It noted \u2018\u201c[i]f the card was produced in the course of an ongoing criminal investigation, it would be more akin to a police report, rendering it testimonial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 697.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">The court found the confrontation clause violation prejudicial as to the gang enhancements because the main evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to benefit the gang was the expert\u2019s recitation of testimonial hearsay. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 699.) In doing so, it took care to note the defendant was not challenging the expert\u2019s \u2018\u201cbackground testimony about general gang behavior or descriptions of the . . . gang\u2019s conduct and its territory,\u201d which was \u2018\u201cbased on well-recognized sources in [the expert\u2019s] area of expertise. It was relevant and admissible evidence as to the . . . gang\u2019s history and general operations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 698.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">B. <em>Officer Adams\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">Like the expert in <em>Sanchez, </em>Officer Adams testified to his extensive training on gangs generally and how he gathered background information about Terra Bella. For training, he had attended gang courses and conferences; he had trained in the field with an officer who pointed out active gang members; he had responded to gang-related crimes; and he had spoken with gang officers and detectives. He had also been assigned to a gang crime-prevention task force responding to hot spots around Los Angeles, during which he would speak to gang officers and detectives about the gangs involved. As part of the gang unit in the Foothill Division monitoring Terra Bella, he had gathered intelligence on gang membership and rivalries to allow him \u201cto respond more effectively in response to a shooting or any other gang-related crimes.\u201d He received the \u201cmajority of our intelligence\u201d by \u201cspeak[ing] with gang members of all levels and ages, both in and out of custody, whether they\u2019re suspects, victims, witnesses, or none of the above. We conduct probation and parole services, at which time we would interview them about just general gang life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-8\">Based on this experience and background, he described the size of Terra Bella, its symbols, and its primary activities, and he identified the convictions of several Terra Bella members based on court records. He also described the rivalry between Terra Bella and Project Boys, which became heated after Avila murdered Villa in May 2008. He further testified to the importance of respect in a gang and \u201cputting in work\u201d by typically committing crimes to move up in the gang, and he believed the shooting in this case was bold because it occurred during the day in rival gang territory. When given a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>hypothetical question tracking the facts of the shooting, Officer Adams opined the shooting was retaliatory for Villa\u2019s murder and was committed in association with, for, and at the direction of Terra Bella.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-4\">As to appellants specifically, he opined all three appellants were Terra Bella gang members. Critically and in contrast to <em>Sanchez, </em>he based his opinion on his personal interactions with each of them, which were recorded on FI cards intended to \u201cdocument the basics of the stop for any future investigative use.\u201d For example, Officer Adams stopped Meraz two months before the shooting in this case, and Meraz told him he was trying to become a full-fledged member of Terra Bella, and to do so, he needed to \u201csmoke\u201d someone. Officer Adams interpreted this to mean he needed to shoot someone. Meraz also wore Terra Bella gang attire during this encounter and had a Terra Bella gang tattoo inside his bottom lip. Officer Adams contacted Bibiano several times while in the company of other Terra Bella gang members. He identified Bibiano in photographs in which he was displaying gang hand signals and gang tattoos. And Officer Adams contacted Chambasis twice in the presence of other gang members. He took photographs of Chambasis\u2019s gang tattoos and belt buckle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">Officer Adams did, however, also testify regarding FI cards filled out by other officers. In one, Meraz said he was a member of the Pierce Street gang, not Terra Bella. In another, it was noted Meraz was present with another gang member. In a third, it was noted Meraz was with a \u201cgang member associate.\u201d Officer Adams also testified about an arrest report from other officers related to another gang member indicating Meraz was with him when the gang member was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">C. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">Appellants argue almost all aspects of Officer Adams\u2019s general background testimony were case specific and testimonial, including his opinion that the shooting in this case was in retaliation for Villa\u2019s murder, how Terra Bella operates, the gang\u2019s primary activities, and the gang\u2019s pattern of criminal activity based on convictions of other gang members. In doing so, appellants attack the <em>sources </em>of Officer Adams\u2019s testimony, namely \u201cout-of-court statements made by both police officers and other gang members.\u201d They also focus on how the prosecution used Officer Adams\u2019s testimony to prove both the gang enhancements and the retaliatory motive for the shooting in this case. Appellants fundamentally misunderstand the scope and import of <em>Sanchez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">Under <em>Sanchez, </em>facts are only case specific when they relate \u201cto <em>the particular events and participants </em>alleged to have been involved in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>being tried,\u201d which in <em>Sanchez </em>were the defendant\u2019s personal contacts with police reflected in the hearsay police reports, STEP notice, and FI card. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 676, italics added.) The court made clear that an expert may still rely on general \u2018\u201cbackground testimony about general gang behavior or descriptions of the . . . gang\u2019s conduct and its territory,\u201d which is relevant to the \u2018\u201cgang\u2019s history and general operations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 698.) This plainly includes the general background testimony Officer Adams gave about Terra Bella\u2019s operations, primary activities, and pattern of criminal activities, which was unrelated to defendants or the current shooting and mirrored the background testimony the expert gave in Sanchez. It also falls in line with the <em>Sanchez </em>court\u2019s hypothetical example that an expert may testify that a diamond tattoo is \u2018\u201ca symbol adopted by a given street gang\u201d and the presence of the tattoo signifies the person belongs to the gang. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 677.) By permitting this type of background testimony, the court recognized it may technically be based on hearsay, but an expert may nonetheless rely on it and convey it to the jury in general terms. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 685.) Thus, under state law after <em>Sanchez, </em>Officer Adams was permitted to testify to non-case-specific general background information about Terra Bella, its rivalry with Project Boys, its primary activities, and its pattern of criminal activity, even if it was based on hearsay sources like gang members and gang officers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">We also conclude that none of this background information was testimonial. Unlike the STEP notice, police reports, and FI card in <em>Sanchez, </em>nothing in the record suggests Officer Adams obtained any of this information \u2018\u201cprimarily to memorialize facts relating to past criminal activity, which could be used like trial testimony.\u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 689.) Officer Adams described the sources of his background information on Terra Bella and the rivalry with Project Boys in only the most general terms. He conveyed no specific statements by anyone with whom he spoke, and reached only general conclusions based on his education, training, and experience. As we explained in a case before <em>Sanchez, </em>\u2018\u201c[d]ay in and day out such information would be useful to the police as part of their general community policing responsibilities quite separate from any use in some unspecified criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>(People v. Valadez </em>(2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 16, 36 [162 Cal.Rptr.3d 722].) To conclude otherwise would eviscerate the role of gang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>experts in gang-related prosecutions, a consequence the court in <em>Sanchez </em>neither contemplated nor likely intended.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-4\">Some portions of Officer Adams\u2019s testimony were case specific under <em>Sanchez, </em>namely, his interactions with appellants memorialized on FI cards. But unlike the hearsay documents in <em>Sanchez, </em>this testimony was not barred under state or federal law because Officer Adams was present during these contacts, had personal knowledge of the facts, and was subject to cross-examination at trial. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at pp. 676, 680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">Respondent concedes, and we agree, state hearsay rules barred the admission of Officer Adams\u2019s testimony on the FI cards and arrest report completed by <em>other </em>officers outside his presence, all of which conveyed the same type of case-specific information the court barred in Sanchez. Respondent also concedes, and we also agree, the arrest report was testimonial because it was most likely made during an investigation of a completed crime, like the police reports in Sanchez. Respondent disagrees, however, that the FI cards were testimonial because they were \u201cnot produced in the course of an ongoing criminal investigation, but rather were produced as investigative tools to help police solve crimes that may not have even occurred at the time F.I. card was produced.\u201d Yet, Officer Adams testified FI cards are created \u201cto document the basics of the stop for any future <em>investigative use \u201d </em>(Italics added.) Although the court in <em>Sanchez </em>did not decide whether the FI card at issue there was testimonial, it noted the FI card might be if it \u201cwas produced in the course of an ongoing criminal investigation.\u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 697.) It seems the FI cards here fall close to that fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">In any case, we will assume the FI cards at issue here were testimonial because we conclude their admission and the admission of the arrest report was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>63 Cal.4th at p. 698 [applying federal harmless error standard to confrontation clause violation].) The FI cards and arrest report purported to show Meraz\u2019s membership in Terra Bella, which could be relevant to the retaliatory motive and gang enhancements in this case. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 698-699 [noting gang membership was not element of gang enhancement but could be relevant to intent to benefit gang element].) But the evidence was duplicative of and weak compared to the other evidence that overwhelmingly demonstrated his Terra Bella membership. He admitted his gang affiliation to Officer Adams, explaining he was trying to become a full-fledged member of Terra Bella, and to do so, he needed to \u201csmoke\u201d (i.e., shoot) someone. And he wore Terra Bella gang attire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>and had a Terra Bella gang tattoo inside his bottom lip. To the extent the FI cards and arrest report tended to show Meraz harbored a gang retaliation motive for the shooting, the evidence of retaliation was already overwhelming. Meraz committed the shooting with fellow gang members Bibiano and Chambasis in the heart of Project Boys territory, the gang responsible for Terra Bella gang member Villa\u2019s murder. And just before the shooting Bibiano asked the victims where they were from, which everyone understood to be a gang challenge. On this record, any state or federal error in admitting the FI cards and arrest report was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">3.-7.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAsk\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"76\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABd0AAABMAQAAAACw0iMTAAABGklEQVR4nO2aMU7EMBQFX1YUdHAD9iZws6XjWCBxEMgJSJcglgwFcWTcIYiedvWmHf2vseMyHTpZ3nfugr+QeBeJd5F4F4l3kXgXiXeReBeJd5F4F4l3kXgXiXeReBeJd5F4F4l3kXgXiXdxBvFPkl4lDZKOkmZJSNJ9JaZFrqJMTe3UhuumWgiAK+ABeAYGYDrA8Rbmm0r0i1xFmeqbqS3X9ZWYdmoPPzSH/3Erv7/Lf15Xf5ozePOd9H22O0nXki4lXRRbxH6RRaxT+2Zqy3X7Sixv/hF4Ad6AD+ATmAEOlRgXuYoyNbZTG64bKzF1+XHCROJdJN5F4l0k3kXiXSTeReJdJN5F4l0k3kXiXSTeReJdJN7FScd/AQgus/pDVNtGAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"1501\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">We modify each appellant\u2019s judgment to strike the section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) enhancement, to strike the section 1202.45 parole revocation fine, to impose a $160 court security fee, and to impose a $120 criminal conviction assessment.
