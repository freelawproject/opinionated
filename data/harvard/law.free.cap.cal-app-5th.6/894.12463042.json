The People argue the sentence is lawful because the offense was a felony at the time the court imposed the enhancement and Proposition 47 does not apply retroactively to enhancements. While we agree Proposition 47 does not apply retroactively to enhancements, we conclude that, under the California Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>In re Estrada </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740, 748 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948] <em>(Estrada), </em>Proposition 47 applies to Section 667.5(b) enhancements in judgments that have not yet become final. Because the offense on which Evans\u2019s Section 667.5(b) enhancement was based is no longer a felony and his judgment is not yet final, Evans falls into the narrow class of offenders who are entitled to relief under <em>Estrada. </em>We therefore strike the enhancement from his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">On February 9, 2015, a jury found Evans guilty of battery of a cohabitant (Pen. Code, \u00a7 243, subd. (e)(1)), abuse of a dependent adult (Pen. Code, \u00a7 368, subd. (c)), assault likely to produce great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(4)), and violation of a no contact order (Pen. Code, \u00a7 166, subd. (c)(1)). Evans admitted having a prior strike conviction (Pen. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (c) &amp; (e)(1), 1170.12, subd. (c)(1)) and three prison priors (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). The prison prior at issue here is for a 2007 felony possession of a controlled substance conviction (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">On April 17, 2015, the trial court granted Evans\u2019s request to continue sentencing to May 15, 2015. In advance of the continued sentencing hearing, Evans asked the court to strike his 2007 prison prior enhancement. The People opposed his request, arguing Proposition 47 does not apply to Section 667.5(b) prior prison term enhancements because such enhancements are meant to punish recidivists, regardless of the classification of the underlying offense at the time of sentencing. In the alternative, the People argued that even if Proposition 47 does apply to Section 667.5(b) enhancements, it does not apply to them retroactively. They pointed out Evans\u2019s 2007 drug conviction currently remained a felony because the hearing on his Proposition 47 reclassification petition was not scheduled to take place until May 29, 2015, several days after his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">At the May 15, 2015 sentencing hearing, the trial court decided to continue the hearing again because \u201cMr. Evans has currently a petition to have that [2007 drug conviction] reduced pursuant to Prop. 47\u201d and the court needed time to research Proposition 47\u2019s application to enhancements. The continued hearing took place on June 26, 2015. At the start of the hearing, the court noted it was unable to locate any information on the outcome of Evans\u2019s reclassification petition. Defense counsel added, \u201cthose [Proposition 47] cases just have been getting continued, and they haven\u2019t been getting resolved, so my guess is . . . there\u2019s going to be another status hearing in about a month.\u201d The court refused to grant another continuance because sentencing had already been continued \u201cseveral [times in] . . . the last six months.\u201d Defense counsel again requested the court strike the prison prior for his 2007 conviction on the ground the underlying offense now qualified as a misdemeanor under Proposition 47. The court thought the issue was \u201cunclear,\u201d but ultimately agreed with the People that Evans\u2019s \u201cstatus as a recidivist\u201d warranted imposition of the enhancement. The court imposed a total term of nine years in prison, which included a one-year prison prior enhancement for the 2007 conviction. Less than a month after Evans filed his notice of appeal challenging his sentence, the trial court granted his Proposition 47 petition and designated his 2007 conviction a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Penal Code section 1170.18, subdivision (k) (Section 1170.18(k)) directs that any felony reclassified a misdemeanor under Proposition 47 \u201cshall be considered a misdemeanor <em>for all </em>purposes.\u201d (Italics added.) Evans argues the phrase \u201cfor all purposes\u201d includes for purposes of relief from Section 667.5(b) enhancements. The People agree Section 1170.18(k) provides relief from enhancements, but they argue the relief should be available only if the reclassification occurs <em>before </em>imposition of the enhancement. They argue Evans seeks an impermissibly retroactive application of Section 1170.18(k) because reclassification of his 2007 drug offense occurred <em>after </em>the court imposed the enhancement in his 2015 sentence. Evans contends he is entitled to the benefits of Section 1170.18(k) because his 2015 sentence is not yet final.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">This case therefore asks us to decide whether the benefits of Section 1170.18(k) apply to nonfinal judgments. Before we can answer this question, however, we must first determine whether Penal Code section 1170.18<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides relief from enhancements at all. Although the People concede Section 1170.18(k) provides prospective relief from enhancements, we must undertake an independent review of Proposition 47, applying the same principles that govern statutory construction. <em>(Kavanaugh v. West Sonoma County Union High School Dist. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 911, 916 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 811, 62 P.3d 54]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rizo </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 681, 685 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 375, 996 P.2d 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">A. <em>Section 1170.18(C) Applies Prospectively to Enhancements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">Proposition 47 changed portions of the Health and Safety and Penal Codes to reduce certain drug possession and theft-related offenses from felonies or wobblers to misdemeanors, unless the offenses were committed by certain ineligible offenders. The initiative also created a petitioning procedure designed to allow offenders who had previously been convicted of reclassified offenses to have their convictions designated misdemeanors and their sentences reduced. (\u00a7 1170.18, subds. (a), (b), (1) &amp; (g); <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 221, 228 [204 Cal.Rptr.3d 369] <em>(Jones).) </em>The plain language of the initiative made those changes retroactive, that is Proposition 47 \u201callows offenders to seek redesignation of and resentencing on felony convictions\u201d even if they \u201chave become final.\u201d <em>(Jones, </em>at p. 228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">The plain language of Proposition 47 also explicitly anticipates misdemeanor reclassification will affect the collateral consequences of felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>convictions. Among other things, suffering a felony conviction may result in the offender losing the right to vote (Elec. Code, \u00a7 2101); losing the right to own or possess a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 29800, subd. (a)(1)); being required to provide biological samples to law enforcement for identification purposes (Pen. Code, \u00a7 296, subd. (a)(1)); and, if the offender is convicted of a felony in the future, losing probation as a sentencing option (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203, subd. (e)) and being exposed to sentence enhancements (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)). To ensure qualified offenders gain relief from those collateral consequences, Section 1170.18(k) directs \u2018\u201c[a]ny felony conviction that is recalled and resentenced under subdivision (b) or designated as a misdemeanor under subdivision (g) <em>shall be considered a misdemeanor for all purposes, </em>except that such resentencing shall not permit that person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any firearm . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Section 1170.18(k)\u2019s \u201cfor all purposes\u201d language is broad, indicating the voters intended it to apply to all collateral consequences except firearm possession. <em>(Hisel v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 969, 974 [238 Cal.Rptr. 678] [statement of a \u201cspecific exception[] implies the exclusion of others\u201d].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Abdallah </em>(2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 736 [201 Cal.Rptr.3d 198] <em>(Abdallah), </em>our colleagues in Division Seven of the Second Appellate District concluded Section 1170.18(k) reflects the voters\u2019 clear intention that\u2014with the exception of firearm possession\u2014reclassified misdemeanors be treated like any other misdemeanor offense, including for purposes of enhancements under section 667.5, subdivision (a). <em>(Abdallah, </em>at p. 746 [\u201cOnce the trial court recalled Abdallah\u2019s 2011 felony sentence and resentenced him to a misdemeanor, section 1170.18, subdivision (k), reclassified that conviction as a misdemeanor \u2018for all purposes\u2019 \u201d].) The <em>Abdallah </em>court held the defendant\u2019s one-year enhancement was improper because the trial court imposed it after the underlying felony had been reclassified. <em>(Ibid. </em>[holding trial court erred by imposing enhancement because \u201cAbdallah was not a person who had committed \u2018an offense which resulted] in a felony conviction\u2019 \u201d].) We agree with <em>Abdallah\u2019s </em>interpretation that Section 1170.18(k) prohibits a court from imposing an enhancement based on an offense that has already been reclassified a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">This interpretation finds support in section 17, subdivision (b) (Section 17(b)), which contains similar language directing a crime designated a misdemeanor \u201cis a misdemeanor for all purposes.\u201d Section 17(b) addresses when a crime that can be punished as a felony or a misdemeanor (a wobbler) must be treated as a misdemeanor. The statute directs that an offense \u201cis a misdemeanor for all purposes\u201d when, among other circumstances, \u201cthe court grants probation to a defendant without imposition of sentence and at the time of granting probation, or on application of the defendant or probation officer thereafter, the court declares the offense to be a misdemeanor.\u201d (\u00a7 17, subd. (b)(3).) The California Supreme Court has interpreted that language to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>mean once a court designates a wobbler offense a misdemeanor, \u201cthe offense thereafter is deemed a \u2018misdemeanor for all purposes,\u2019 except when the Legislature [or electorate] has specifically directed otherwise.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Park </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 782, 795 [156 Cal.Rptr.3d 307, 299 P.3d 1263] <em>(Park).) </em>In <em>Park, </em>the trial court enhanced a sentence by five years because the offender had suffered a prior serious felony conviction. However, the court presiding over the prior case had reduced the felony conviction to a misdemeanor under Section 17(b) before the defendant had committed the present offense. <em>(Park, </em>at p. 787.) The Supreme Court held \u201cwhen the court in the prior proceeding properly exercised its discretion by reducing the [felony] conviction to a misdemeanor, that offense no longer qualified as a prior serious <em>felony . . . </em>and could not be used ... to enhance defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">We reach the same conclusion here. <em>(People v. Cornett </em>(2012) 53 Cal.4th 1261, 1269, fn. 6 [139 Cal.Rptr.3d 837, 274 P.3d 456] [recognizing \u201cthe rule of statutory construction that identical language appearing in separate statutory provisions should receive the same interpretation when the statutes cover the same or analogous subject matter\u201d].) Imposing a one-year enhancement based on a prison prior under Section 667.5(b) requires proof the defendant (1) was convicted of a felony, (2) was imprisoned as a result, (3) completed the term of imprisonment, and (4) did not remain free for five years of prison custody and committing a new offense that resulted in a felony conviction. <em>(In re Preston </em>(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1115 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 340].) Once the trial court granted Evans\u2019s petition, \u201csection 1170.18, subdivision (k), reclassified that conviction as a misdemeanor \u2018for all purposes\u2019 \u201d and he no longer satisfied the first element of Section 667.5(b). <em>(Abdallah, supra, </em>246 Cal.App.4th at p. 746.)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">B. <em>Section 1170.18(k) Applies to Nonfinal Enhancements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The People argue our conclusion applies Section 1170.18(k) retroactively because Evans\u2019s 2007 offense was not reclassified until after the trial court imposed the enhancement in his 2015 sentence. We recently held in <em>Jones </em>that Proposition 47 does not allow \u201cthe courts to strike prison prior enhancements imposed prior to Proposition 47 based on prior convictions designated as misdemeanors after judgment and sentence have become final.\u201d <em>(Jones, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.5th at p. 229.) However, Evans does not ask us to depart from the holding in <em>Jones. </em>Evans asks us to recognize only that petitioners whose sentences <em>are not yet fined </em>when their underlying felony is reclassified may receive the benefits of Section 1170.18(k). The California Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Estrada </em>supports Evans\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">Under <em>Estrada, </em>when an amendatory statute mitigates punishment, contains no saving clause, and \u201cbecomes effective prior to the date the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>judgment of conviction becomes final,\u201d then \u201c[that statute,] and not the old statute in effect when the prohibited act was committed, applies.\u201d <em>(Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 744, 748.) Under this long-settled precedent, the \u201ckey date\u201d in deciding whether a defendant receives the benefit of the statutory change is \u201cthe date of final judgment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 744.) \u201cA judgment becomes final when the availability of an appeal and the time for filing a petition for certiorari [with the United States Supreme Court] have expired.\u201d <em>(People v. Smith </em>(2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1460, 1465 [185 Cal.Rptr.3d 68].)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The <em>Estrada </em>rule is based on legislative intent. \u201cWhen the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now deemed to be sufficient should apply <em>to every case to which it constitutionally could apply. </em>The amendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not final.\u201d <em>(Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 745, italics added.) The Supreme Court noted the Legislature could indicate a desire that a defendant be punished under the law in existence at the time the offense was committed by enacting a saving clause spelling out such an intent, but held \u201c[i]f there is no saving clause [the defendant] can and should be punished under the new law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 747.)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The same principles guide our interpretation of successful ballot initiatives. <em>(Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 796.) As we discussed in part IIA., <em>ante, </em>Section 1170.18(k) shows the voters specifically anticipated reclassification would have collateral effects and directs that a reclassified offense \u201cshall be considered a misdemeanor for <em>all </em>purposes.\u201d (Italics added.) This language is broad and not limited by a saving clause that would indicate the voters intended offenders should continue being punished under the old law. The plain language of the statute therefore indicates the voters intended offenders should be able to avoid punishment for reclassified offenses imposed through Section 667.5(b) enhancements, so long as they are not subject to final judgment. Consistent with this understanding, the statute specifies it does not apply to convictions or sentences that are subject to final judgment. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (n) [\u201cNothing in this and related sections is intended to diminish or abrogate the finality of judgments in any case not falling within the purview of this act\u201d].) We therefore conclude the electorate, in passing Proposition 47, determined the penalties for drug possession crimes like Evans\u2019s were too severe and intended to reduce those penalties in every case to which the proposition constitutionally could apply. As a result, offenders may challenge prison prior enhancements based on reclassified convictions so long as the enhanced sentence is not subject to a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>Here, Evans\u2019s 2015 sentence had not yet been imposed when he sought to take advantage of Proposition 47 reclassification and reduce his 2007 felony drug conviction to a misdemeanor. He asked the trial court to wait to sentence him until after the hearing on his reclassification petition, but the court did not do so. By the time the trial court granted his petition, his sentence had already been imposed but it was not yet final because it was on appeal to this court. Thus, Proposition 47 provided a means for Evans to mitigate punishment, and he successfully took advantage of that procedure before his sentence became final.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Evans\u2019s request that we correct his sentence on appeal therefore does not seek to apply Proposition 47 in a retroactive manner not approved by the voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">At oral argument, the People argued the <em>Park </em>decision supports the contrary view based on dicta indicating a defendant whose prior felony sentence the court reduced to a misdemeanor under Section 17(b) \u201cwould be subject to the . . . enhancement had he committed and been convicted of the present crimes before the court reduced the earlier offense to a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>(Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 802, citation omitted.) The People contend this language shows Evans is not entitled to relief because he committed and was convicted of his 2015 offenses before the court reclassified his 2007 offense. <em>Park </em>does not support such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">As we discussed above, the <em>Estrada </em>rule applies to Section 1170.18(k) because Proposition 47 expresses the electorate\u2019s determination that we have punished a class of offenders too harshly. That determination implies the benefits of Proposition 47 \u201cshould apply to every case to which it constitutionally could apply,\u201d including to pending cases in which the judgment is not yet final. <em>(Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Section 17(b) is different. As the <em>Park </em>court explained at length, Section 17(b) recognizes incarceration in state prison may not be appropriate for some defendants\u2014not a class of offenders\u2014who commit wobbler offenses. (Pa<em>rk, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 790.) To address this concern, the provision vests the trial court with discretion to designate wobbler offenses misdemeanors if doing so would be more likely to rehabilitate the particular offender. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, Section 17(b) is <em>not </em>a provision expressing the electorate or Legislature\u2019s determination \u201cthat its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment is proper.\u201d <em>(Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 745.) Rather, Section 17(b) intentionally and explicitly leaves that judgment up to the trial court. The <em>Estrada </em>rule therefore does not apply to Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>17(b) and the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of that provision in <em>Park </em>could not implicate, much less answer, the question we face here.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The People\u2019s argument is wrong for the additional reason that <em>Park </em>does not address retroactivity at all. As discussed above, <em>Park </em>involved the <em>prospective </em>consequence of the trial court\u2019s decision to designate the defendant\u2019s wobbler offense a misdemeanor. <em>(Park, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 787 [\u201cwhen the court in the <em>prior proceeding </em>properly exercised its discretion by reducing the [felony] conviction to a misdemeanor, that offense . . . could not be used [thereafter] ... to enhance defendant\u2019s sentence\u201d (italics added)].) We therefore conclude the People\u2019s reliance on <em>Park </em>to avoid the application of the <em>Estrada </em>rule is doubly misguided.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 616, 684 [114 Cal.Rptr.3d 133, 237 P.3d 474] [\u201c \u2018The holding of a decision is limited by the facts of the case being decided, notwithstanding the use of overly broad language by the court in stating the issue before it or its holding or in its reasoning\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Finally, the People argue imposition of the enhancement remains appropriate despite reclassification on the ground the enhancement is meant to punish Evans for his recidivism, not for the underlying offense. This argument contravenes the language of Section 667.5(b), which makes suffering a felony conviction a necessary requirement for imposing the enhancement. Contrary to the People\u2019s view, Section 667.5(b) is not intended to punish any and all recidivists. It is reserved only for those who have committed a <em>felony, </em>served a prison term, and reoffended. (\u00a7 667.5(b) [authorizing enhancement <em>only if </em>the offender has a felony conviction <em>and </em>has served a term of imprisonment as a result]; <em>In re Preston, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.4th at p. 1115.) With the passage of Proposition 47, the voters have determined Evans\u2019s 2007 drug offense never should have been a felony. One consequence of this policy judgment is that Evans no longer is the type of recidivist Section 667.5(b) was enacted to punish.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">We strike the one-year prison prior term based on Evans\u2019s 2007 conviction and direct the trial court to issue an amended abstract of judgment reflecting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>modified sentence for a total of eight years in prison and to forward a certified copy of the amended abstract of judgment to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b879-5\">Ramirez, P. J., and McKinster, J., concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was granted February 22, 2017, S239635.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\"> We granted Evans\u2019s request to take judicial notice of a September 9, 2015 minute order showing the trial court granted his Proposition 47 petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-11\"> Undesignated statutory citations refer to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b877-8\"> The People contend <em>Estrada\u2019s </em>holding does not apply here because the sentence for Evans\u2019s 2007 felony drug offense has long been final. The People misunderstand the finality aspect of the <em>Estrada </em>analysis.

In any event, these cases have been taken up for review by the Supreme Court and depublished.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
