J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8I\">Real parties in interest, Kevin Hicks et al., filed an action against petitioner Elliott Homes, Inc. (Elliott), the builder of their homes, seeking damages for construction defects. Elliott moved to stay the litigation until real parties in interest complied with the prelitigation procedure set forth in what is commonly referred to as \u201cSB 800\u201d or Right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Repair Act (Act), Civil Code sections 895 through 945.5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u00a7 930, subd. (b).) Real parties in interest opposed the motion, arguing that the prelitigation procedure did not apply because they had not alleged a statutory violation of the Act. The trial court denied Elliott\u2019s motion for a stay, and Elliott petitioned this court for a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order, and enter a new order granting the motion for a stay. We issued an alternative writ of mandate and stayed the proceedings in the trial court. Elliott contends the trial court erred in concluding that real parties in interest need not comply with the prelitigation procedure set forth in the Act prior to filing the underlying action and in denying the motion to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">We shall grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Real parties in interest, the owners of 17 single-family homes built by Elliott, filed a first amended complaint for strict products liability, strict components product liability, and negligence. Real parties in interest alleged that their homes were in a defective condition at the time they took possession, and that the defects resulted in physical damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The Act \u201capplies only to new residential units where the purchase agreement with the buyer was signed by the seller on or after January 1, 2003.\u201d (\u00a7 938.) The purchase agreements for the homes at issue here were signed by Elliott after January 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The Act establishes a nonadversarial inspection and repair procedure that allows builders to attempt to resolve homeowners\u2019 construction defect claims in advance of litigation. (\u00a7\u00a7 910-938.) Pursuant to that procedure, a homeowner must serve the builder with notice of a construction defect claim, and the builder has the opportunity to repair the purported defect within a given time period. (\u00a7\u00a7 910, 914, 917.) If the homeowner files a lawsuit before this prelitigation procedure is completed, the builder may obtain a stay of the lawsuit. (\u00a7 930, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">It is undisputed that real parties in interest did not give Elliott notice of the alleged defects or otherwise comply with the Act\u2019s prelitigation procedure before filing suit. Elliott moved to stay the litigation, which real parties in interest opposed. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>parties in interest were not required to comply with the Act\u2019s prelitigation procedure because they had not pleaded a statutory cause of action under the Act. The court explained that \u201c[although the pre-litigation procedures are mandatory where homeowners plead statutory SB 800 causes of action [citation], there is no similar mandate where they plead only common law causes of action encompassing actual damage. (See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brookfield Crystal Cove LLC </em>(2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 98, 104-108 [163 Cal.Rptr.3d 600]; accord <em>Burch v. Superior Court </em>(2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1411, 1414-1415, 1418 [168 Cal.Rptr.3d 81].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Writ Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u2018\u201cA writ of mandate \u2018must be issued in all cases where there is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law.\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086.) Writ review is deemed extraordinary and appellate courts are normally reluctant to grant it. [Citations.] The Supreme Court has identified general criteria for determining the propriety of writ review. \u2018These criteria include circumstances in which \u201cthe party seeking the writ lacks an adequate means, such as a direct appeal, by which to attain relief\u2019 or \u201cthe petitioner will suffer harm or prejudice in a manner that cannot be corrected on appeal.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Baeza v. Superior Court </em>(2011) 201 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1220-1221 [135 Cal.Rptr.3d 557].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Elliott claims it is entitled to the benefits of the prelitigation procedure that permits it to attempt to repair the claimed defects before real parties in interest may bring an action against it in court, but the trial court\u2019s order denies them that opportunity. If Elliott may not appeal that ruling until after judgment, the benefits of the prelitigation procedure will be lost, even if it does prevail on appeal. We conclude Elliott does not have \u201ca plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Overview of the Act</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">The Act is comprised of five chapters. Chapter 1 defines several terms not relevant here. (\u00a7 895.) Chapter 2 sets forth standards for residential construction, the violation of which constitutes an actionable defect. (\u00a7\u00a7 896, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>897.) Chapter 3 imposes obligations on the builder, including the obligation to furnish a minimum one-year express limited warranty. (\u00a7\u00a7 900-906.) Chapter 3 also imposes obligations on the homeowner, including the obligation to follow all reasonable maintenance obligations and schedules. (\u00a7 907.) Chapter 4 prescribes a nonadversarial prelitigation procedure that allows builders to attempt to resolve homeowners\u2019 construction defect claims in advance of litigation. (\u00a7\u00a7 910-938.) It requires a homeowner to serve the builder with notice of a construction defect claim, and gives the builder an opportunity to repair the purported defect within a given time period. (\u00a7 912.) If the homeowner files a lawsuit before the prelitigation procedure is completed, the builder may obtain a stay of the lawsuit. (\u00a7 930, subd. (b).) Chapter 5 sets out the procedure for claims brought under the Act, including the applicable statute of limitations (\u00a7 941), the burden of proof (\u00a7 942), the exclusiveness of the Act (\u00a7 943), the damages that may be recovered (\u00a7 944), and the affirmative defenses that may be asserted (\u00a7 945.5). It also provides that the Act\u2019s \u201cprovisions, standards, rights, and obligations ... are binding upon all original purchasers and their successors-in-interest.\u201d (\u00a7 945.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The Scope of the Act</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The question before us is whether the trial court properly denied Elliott\u2019s request for a stay of the litigation until real parties in interest comply with the prelitigation procedure set forth in chapter 4. To answer this question, we must determine whether real parties in interest are required to comply with the Act\u2019s requirements, including its prelitigation procedure, when they have not alleged a statutory violation under the Act. As we shall explain, the answer lies in the statutory language, which is clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, a court seeks to determine and give effect to the intent of the enacting legislative body.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Braxton </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 798, 810 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 46, 101 P.3d 994].) \u201c \u2018We first examine the words themselves because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent. [Citation.] The words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.\u2019 [Citation.] If the plain, commonsense meaning of a statute\u2019s words is unambiguous, the plain meaning controls.\u201d <em>(Fitch </em>v. <em>Select Products Co. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 812, 818 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 591, 115 P.3d 1233].) If, however, the statute is susceptible to more than one interpretation, we \u201cmay consider various extrinsic aids, including the purpose of the statute, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Torres </em>v. <em>Parkhouse Tire Service, Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 995, 1003 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 564, 30 P.3d 57].)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Real parties in interest contend that we need look no further than section 910 to determine whether they were required to comply with the statutory prelitigation procedure before filing the underlying action. Section 910 provides in relevant part: \u201cPrior to filing an action against any party alleged to have contributed to a violation of the standards set forth in Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 896), the claimant shall initiate the following prelitigation procedures . . . .\u201d Real parties in interest assert that \u201c[t]he plain and ordinary meaning of the phrase \u2018an action against any party alleged to have contributed to a violation of the standards set forth in Chapter 2\u2019 is that an action is for violation of the SB800 building standards,\u201d and thus, it was \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s intent that the Pre-Litigation Procedures are only to be applied where a party alleges violation of the SB 800 standards enumerated in Civil Code [section] 896 et seq.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">As detailed above, section 910 is part of a statutory scheme, and must be construed with reference to the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part. <em>(Smith v. Superior Court </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 77, 83 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 394, 137 P.3d 218].) Of particular significance here is section 896, which sets forth the basic scope of the claims to which the Act applies. It provides in pertinent part: \u201cIn any action seeking recovery of damages arising out of, or related to deficiencies in, the residential construction, ... a builder . . . shall, except as specifically set forth in this title, be liable for, and the claimant\u2019s claims or causes of action shall be limited to violation of, the following standards, except as specifically set forth in this title.\u201d  Thus, the Act applies broadly to \u201cany <em>action </em>seeking recovery of damages arising out of, or related to deficiencies in, the residential construction,\u201d and in such an action, a homeowner\u2019s \u201cclaims or causes of action shall be limited to violation of\u2019 the standards set forth in section 896, except as otherwise specified in the Act. (\u00a7 896, italics added.) Section 896 makes an exception for condominium conversions, \u201cAs to condominium conversions, this title does not apply to or does not supersede any other statutory or common law.\u201d Section 943 also contains an exception, \u201c[T]his title does not apply to any action by a claimant to enforce a contract or express contractual provision, or any action for fraud, personal injury, or violation of a statute.\u201d (\u00a7 943, subd. (a).) Section 931 provides, \u201cIf a claim combines causes of action or damages not covered by this part, including, without limitation, personal injuries, class actions, other statutory remedies, or fraud-based claims, the claimed unmet standards shall be administered according to this part . . . .\u201d Common law causes of action related to single-family homes, like those asserted by real parties in interest, are not among the claims excepted from the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Section 897 confirms that the Legislature intended to create a comprehensive set of standards, and for those standards to be actionable under the Act. It provides, \u201cThe standards set forth in this chapter are intended to address every function or component of a structure. To the extent that a function or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>component of a structure is not addressed by these standards, it shall be actionable if it causes damage.\u201d (\u00a7 897.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Section 943 confirms that the Legislature intended to strictly limit causes of action and claims seeking to recover damages arising out of, or related to deficiencies in, residential construction. It provides in pertinent part: \u2018\u201cExcept as provided in this title, no other cause of action for a claim covered by this title or for damages recoverable under Section 944 is allowed.\u201d (\u00a7 943, subd. (a).) Section 944 authorizes recovery of damages for \u2018\u201cthe reasonable value of repairing any violation of the standards set forth in this title, the reasonable cost of repairing any damages caused by the repair efforts, [and] the reasonable cost of repairing and rectifying any damages resulting from the failure of the home to meet the standards . . . .\u201d Thus, the Act encompasses actions seeking to recover for repair of a defect itself or for repair of any damage caused by the defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Having considered the entire statutory scheme, we conclude that the Legislature intended that all claims arising out of deficiencies in residential construction, involving new residential units where the purchase agreement was signed on or after January 1, 2003 (\u00a7 938), with limited exceptions not relevant here, be subject to the standards and requirements of the Act; homeowners bringing such claims must give notice to the builder and engage in the prelitigation procedure set forth in chapter 4 of the Act prior to filing suit in court; and where the complaint alleges deficiencies in construction that constitute violations of the standards set out in chapter 2 of the Act, the claims are subject to the Act, and the homeowner must comply with the prelitigation procedure, regardless of the theory of liability asserted in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The legislative history is consistent with our interpretation of the Act\u2019s scope. The analysis by the Senate Judiciary Committee states: \u201cThis bill would make major changes to the substance and process of the law governing construction defects. It is the product of extended negotiations between various interested parties. Among other things, the bill seeks to respond to concerns expressed by builders and insurers over the costs associated with construction defect litigation, as well as concerns expressed by homeowners and their advocates over the effects of a recent Supreme Court decision that held that defects must cause actual damage prior to being actionable in tort. <em>[Aas </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 627 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 718, 12 P.3d 1125]].\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 800 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 28, 2002, p. 1.) \u201cThis bill would provide that any action against a builder . . . seeking recovery of damages arising out of, or related to deficiencies in, residential construction, . . . shall be governed by detailed standards set forth in the bill relating to the various functions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>components of the building.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 2.) \u2018\u201cThis bill would establish a mandatory procedure prior to the filing of a construction defect lawsuit. This procedure would provide the builder with the right to attempt a repair of the defect prior to litigation . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 2-3.) \u2018\u201cThis bill would set detailed standards .... Except in certain specified circumstances, the bill would provide that these standards govern any action seeking recovery of damages arising out of or related to construction defects. The bill would provide that any function or component not specifically addressed by the standards shall be actionable if it causes damage. As a result, the bill would preserve homeowners\u2019 ability to recover for defects that cause damage that are not otherwise covered by the standards. [\u00b6] In addition, except where explicitly specified otherwise, liability would accrue under the standards regardless of whether the violation of the standard had resulted in actual damage or injury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 4.) Describing the prelitigation procedure and the builder\u2019s right to repair, the analysis provides: \u2018\u201cThe bill establishes a mandatory process prior to the filing of a construction defect action. The major component of this process is the builder\u2019s absolute right to attempt a repair prior to a homeowner filing an action in court.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">In <em>Aas </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th 627, referenced in the legislative history quoted above, our Supreme Court held that construction defects in residential properties that did not result in actual property damage were not actionable in tort. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 632.) Thus, after <em>Aas, </em>homeowners could not recover in tort for costs of repair or the diminution in value of their homes arising from construction defects that had not caused property damage. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 632-633.) Needless to say, <em>Aas </em>represented a substantial victory for the building industry. Under the construction urged by real parties in interest, the Act created new statutory causes of action for defects that have not yet caused damage, while leaving intact the common law causes of action available once property damage has occurred. Under such a construction, the building industry gained nothing under the Act. To the contrary, it lost. It defies common sense to think that building groups would have negotiated such a result. Moreover, the construction urged by real parties in interest fails to respond to concerns expressed by builders and insurers over the costs associated with construction defect litigation, which the legislative history indicates the bill sought to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Consistent with the statutory language itself, the legislative history establishes that the Legislature intended that any action against a builder seeking to recover damages arising out of, or related to deficiencies in, residential construction is subject to the Act\u2019s prelitigation procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The trial court relied on <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Brookfield Crystal Cove LLC, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at pages 104-108 <em>(Liberty </em>Mutual) as the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>for its conclusion that real parties in interest were not required to engage in the Act\u2019s prelitigation procedure because \u201cthey plead only common law causes of action encompassing actual damage.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that case, Eric Hart purchased a new home built by Brookfield. <em>(Liberty Mutual, </em>at pp. 100-101.) A few years later, a pipe in the home\u2019s sprinkler system burst, causing extensive damage. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 101.) Brookfield acknowledged its liability for, and repaired, the damage to Hart\u2019s home. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Hart moved into a hotel for a few months while the repairs were made, and Hart\u2019s homeowners insurer, insurer Liberty Mutual, paid for the hotel and other relocation expenses. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Liberty Mutual then filed a subrogation action against Brookfield to recover the expenses it paid. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The operative complaint alleged causes of action for strict liability, negligence, breach of contract, breach of warranty, equitable estoppel, and declaratory relief. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 101-102.) Brookfield demurred to the complaint, arguing it was time-barred under the Act. <em>(Liberty Mutual, </em>at p. 100.) The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that \u201cthe Act does not eliminate a property owner\u2019s common law rights and remedies, otherwise recognized by law, where, as here, actual damage has occurred,\u201d and thus, \u201cLiberty Mutual\u2019s complaint in subrogation, based on Hart\u2019s right to recover actual damages, states causes of action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">In their return to the petition for writ of mandate, real parties in interest assert that <em>Liberty Mutual </em>is \u201cimmaterial,\u201d and we need not consider whether it was correctly decided because unlike <em>Liberty Mutual, </em>whether real parties are precluded under the Act from pursuing their common law causes of action is not before us. According to real parties in interest, \u201cIt could have been, but Elliott did not demur to these causes of action. Instead, it brought forth a Motion to Stay. [\u00b6] Accordingly, the question before the trial court was, as follows: given that [real parties in interest] only pled common law causes of action and not an SB800 cause of action, were [they] required to complete the SB 800 statutory pre-litigation procedures before litigating the common law causes of action?\u201d We agree that we need not determine whether real parties in interest can pursue their common law causes of action in the first instance; rather, the issue before us is: assuming that real parties in interest can pursue their common law causes of action, were they required to comply with the Act\u2019s prelitigation procedure before initiating the underlying lawsuit? We disagree, however, with real parties in interest claim that <em>Liberty Mutual </em>is immaterial to our analysis of that issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In concluding that \u201cthe Act does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>provide the exclusive remedy in cases where actual damage has occurred\u201d <em>(Liberty Mutual, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at p. 109), the <em>Liberty Mutual </em>court found that \u2018\u201cthe statutory language shows Liberty Mutual\u2019s subrogation claims [common law causes of action arising from actual damages] are not covered by the Right to Repair Act,\u201d and thus, Hart was not subject to the time limitations set forth therein. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 104-105, some capitalization omitted.) Here, real parties in interest assert and the trial court found that common law claims arising from actual damages are not covered by the Act, and thus, they were not subject to the prelitigation procedure set forth therein. Moreover, the trial court cited <em>Liberty Mutual </em>as the basis for its decision. Thus, we shall consider <em>Liberty Mutual's </em>finding that common law claims arising from actual damages are not covered by the Act and explain why we respectfully disagree with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In interpreting the scope of the Act, the <em>Liberty Mutual </em>court relied on the \u201c \u2018general rule\u2019 \u201d that statutes should not be interpreted to alter or abrogate the common law unless its language clearly and unambiguously evidences an intention to do so. <em>(Liberty Mutual, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at p. 105.) As previously discussed, section 896 states that the Act broadly applies to <em>''any action </em>seeking recovery of damages arising out of, or related to deficiencies in, . . . residential construction,\u201d and in such an action, a homeowner\u2019s \u201cclaims or causes of action shall be limited to violation of\u2019 the standards set forth in section 896, except as otherwise specified in the Act. (Italics added.) In determining that Brookfield\u2019s claims were not covered by the Act, the <em>Liberty Mutual </em>court failed to analyze the language of section 896. <em>(Liberty Mutual, </em>at p. 108.) Instead, it analyzed Brookfield\u2019s argument, which it rejected as \u201ccircular.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cBrookfield argues the language \u2018any action\u2019 means that the present case must fall within the Right to Repair Act. Brookfield\u2019s argument, however, is circular; Brookfield\u2019s argument is essentially that any action arising out of the Act is an action under the Act.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Section 896 does not provide that \u201cany action arising out of the Act is an action under the Act.\u201d To the contrary, it provides that \u201c[i]n any action seeking recovery of damages arising out of, or related to deficiencies in, the residential construction, ... a builder . . . shall, except as specifically set forth in this title, be liable for, and the claimant\u2019s claims or causes of action shall be limited to violation of, the following standards, except as specifically set forth in this title.\u201d (\u00a7 896.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The statutory language contained in section 896 as well as the code sections previously discussed, i.e. sections 897, 931, 943, 944, clearly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>unequivocally expresses the legislative intent that the Act apply to all actions \u201cseeking recovery of damages arising out of, or related to deficiencies in, . . . residential construction\u201d (\u00a7 896), except as specifically set forth in the Act. The Act does not specifically except actions arising from actual damages. To the contrary, it authorizes recovery of damages for, among other things, \u201cthe reasonable cost of repairing and rectifying any damages resulting from the failure of the home to meet the standards . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 944.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Real Parties in Interests\u2019 Claims Fall Within the Scope of the Act</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Here, the operative first amended complaint alleged residential construction defects in components or functions for which standards have been established in section 896.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, real parties in interests\u2019 claims fall within the scope of the Act. Section 910 provides that before a homeowner files \u201can action against any party alleged to have contributed to a violation of the standards set forth in Chapter 2,\u201d the homeowner must give written notice to the builder of the claim that the construction of the residence violates any of the standards in that chapter. If a homeowner fails to provide such notice or otherwise comply with the prelitigation procedure, the builder may bring a motion to stay any subsequent court action until the homeowner complies with that procedure. (\u00a7 930, subd. (b).) Because real parties in interest did not notify Elliot of their claims or otherwise comply with the statutory prelitigation procedure, Elliott is entitled to a stay of the action until the statutory prelitigation process has been completed.
