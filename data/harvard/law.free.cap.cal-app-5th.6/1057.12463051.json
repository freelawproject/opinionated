J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_F\">Defendant Michelle Dianne Franske and the People both appeal from a resentencing proceeding pursuant to Proposition 47, which added a new resentencing provision, Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sechon 1170.18, under which \u201c[a] person currently serving a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section (\u2018this act\u2019) had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence\u201d and request resentencing. <em>{Id., </em>subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Here, the court granted defendant\u2019s request under section 1170.18 to reduce her November 2010 conviction for felony second degree commercial burglary to misdemeanor shoplifting under section 459.5, a crime added by Proposition 47, and reduced her punishment for that offense only. In doing so, the court rejected the People\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s conduct actually did not constitute shoplifting and also rejected defendant\u2019s additional request to strike the associated on-bail enhancement. Defendant and the People appeal from these rulings. We conclude the trial court got it right on both rulings and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">Sometime shortly before 11:45 a.m. on September 22, 2010, defendant went into Dole Transportation in Yreka \u2018\u201cto inquire about a motor home that was possibly for sale.\u201d Dole Transportation employee M. \u201cwalked out of the main oflicc/lobby area to contact the owner and when she returned, she found the defendant in her office.\u201d Missing from M.\u2019s purse that was in her office were her wallet and cigarettes. M. \u201cconfronted the defendant by her vehicle and had her walk back into the office.\u201d Defendant removed M.\u2019s wallet from her pants. M. called police, and after police arrested defendant, they found M.\u2019s cigarettes and the $242 that was missing from M.\u2019s wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">In November 2010, defendant pled no contest to (among other crimes committed on earlier dates, including a first degree residential burglary) felony second degree commercial burglary and admitted she committed this felony offense while released on bail for first degree residential burglary. She received an aggregate prison sentence of 10 years eight months, which included a consecutive eight months for the felony second degree commercial burglary and a consecutive two years for the on-bail enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">In February 2016, over the People\u2019s objection, the court granted defendant relief under Proposition 47 for the second degree commercial burglary, reducing it to misdemeanor shoplifting, thereby reducing her aggregate prison sentence to 10 years. The court rejected defendant\u2019s argument to strike an additional two years from the 10 years for the on-bail enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">From these rulings, both defendant and the People timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">\n<em>Under the Plain Language of the Shoplifting Statute, Defendant\u2019s Crime Qualifies as Shoplifting</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">The People contend that defendant \u201cwas not eligible for Proposition 47 relief because her burglary offense is not \u2018shoplifting\u2019 under Penal Code section 459.5.\u201d We disagree with the People based on the plain language of the shoplifting statute. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Blackburn </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 1113, 1123 [191 Cal.Rptr.3d 458, 354 P.3d 268] [in questions of statutory interpretation, courts \u201cbegin with the text\u201d and \u201c \u2018[i]f no ambiguity appears in the statutory language, we presume that the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute controls\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">\u201c[S]hoplifting is defined as entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be taken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950).\u201d (\u00a7 459.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">There is no ambiguity in the shoplifting statute as it applies to defendant\u2019s conduct. Defendant entered Dole Transportation \u201cto inquire about a motor home that was possibly for sale.\u201d One appellate court has construed \u201ccommercial establishment\u201d in this statute to mean \u201cone that is primarily engaged in commerce, that is, the buying and selling of goods or services.\u201d <em>(In re J.L. </em>(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1110, 1114 [195 Cal.Rptr.3d 482] [a minor student who stole another student\u2019s cell phone out of a school locker had not engaged in theft from a \u201ccommercial establishment,\u201d so the minor\u2019s offense was not eligible for reclassification as misdemeanor shoplifting under Prop. 47].) At a minimum, Dole Transposition was engaged in selling motor homes, fitting within this definition of a \u201ccommercial establishment.\u201d Defendant entered Dole Transportation, while it was open during regular business hours, around 11:45 a.m. and, while inside, committed theft of cigarettes and a wallet out of which she took $242, which is a form of larceny. (\u00a7 490a [\u201cWherever any law or statute of this state refers to or mentions larceny, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>embezzlement, or stealing, said law or statute shall hereafter be read and interpreted as if the word \u2018theft\u2019 were substituted therefor\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">Notwithstanding this specific definition of \u2018\u201cshoplifting\u201d provided by our Legislature, the People argue that \u2018\u201c[t]he plain language of this [statute] shows that the crime of shoplifting is meant to track the common understanding of that term, which is the larcenous stealing of openly displayed merchandise from a commercial establishment during business hours.\u201d But the People\u2019s reading of the statute relies not on its plain words, but on a 1699 English law, legal encyclopedias, and dictionaries that they claim require that only \u2018\u201cthe larcenous stealing of openly displayed merchandise from a commercial retailer\u201d qualifies as shoplifting. Resorting to these sources adds words that do not appear in the statute, such as \u2018\u201copenly displayed merchandise.\u201d This violates a \u2018\u201cbedrock\u201d rule of statutory construction that if \u201c \u2018the law-maker gives us an express definition, we must take it as we find it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Delaney </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 785, 804 [268 Cal.Rptr. 753, 789 P.2d 934], quoting <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Dennison </em>(1857) 7 Cal. 297, 307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">Defendant\u2019s conduct fits within the definition of misdemeanor shoplifting in the statute. It is this definition that is the operative language, not the title of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pA-t\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"56\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABe0AAAA4AQAAAABIku78AAABAUlEQVR4nO2ZMU6EUBRFL4TCTnegOxl3NnYuy0lciLoC6cSIHIuZZ760I7nR3FNyeC+HDx0d+sO89+6C80i+k+Q7Sb6T5DtJvpPkO0m+k+Q7Sb6T5DtJvpPkO0m+k+Q7Sb6T5DtJvpNekiZJs6RFku4kHSQ9SxobQckSNcV6asN1qBGSBPACjMC0h+UauATugcdGzLuTLFFT36KmNlw37xoBU6/VASzrAxh1znn+8rofr0f/49u/kXQl6eJ0oZOOz3fbiKHuLlFTw3pqw3VDK6Tjt/8GfACfAHvgAXgCXhuxlCxRU8t6asN1C42AqctfdSPJd5J8J8l3knwnyXeSfCdfKTG12x7DPoIAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"1517\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">The order resentencing defendant is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1034-10\">Murray, J., and Hoch, J., concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b1034-11\">The petition of appellant Michelle Dianne Franske for review by the Supreme Court was granted February 15, 2017, S239732.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-13\"> All further section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1033-10\"> The California Supreme Court is currently reviewing whether a defendant convicted of second degree burglary for entering a bank to cash forged checks is entitled to resentencing under section 1170.18 on the ground the offense meets the definition of shoplifting under section 459.5. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 35 [194 Cal.Rptr.3d 856], review granted Feb. 17, 2016, S231171 [entry into a bank to cash a forged check was not larceny within the meaning of \u00a7 459.5]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vargas </em>(2016) 243 Cal.App.4th 1416 [197 Cal.Rptr.3d 638], review granted Mar. 30, 2016, S232673 [entry into check cashing establishment with intent to commit theft by false pretenses by cashing a forged check was an intent to commit \u201clarceny\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1034-12\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1057.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
