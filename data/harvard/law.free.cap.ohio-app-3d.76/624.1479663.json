Mathews and Nella Mathews, appeal from an order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees, Maysville Seafoods, Inc. and L. &amp; R. Seafoods Marketing, Inc. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that, on August 20, 1989, they dined at a Long John Silver Seafood Restaurant (\u201cL.J.S.\u201d) in Middletown operated by Maysville Seafood, Inc. James Mathews consumed a fish fillet supplied to L.J.S. by L &amp; R Seafoods Marketing, Inc. The fish fillet contained a fish bone, alleged to have been some one and a half inches in length, which penetrated Mathews\u2019 small bowel, requiring surgery. Plaintiffs alleged negligence on the part of the defendants. A loss of consortium claim was made by Nella Mathews.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">The defendants moved for summary judgment. They argued that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate that any action on their part was the proximate cause of James Mathews\u2019 injury, that as a matter of law the presence of a fish bone in a piece of fish could not give rise to a negligence claim, and that plaintiffs were not husband and wife on August 20, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The trial court overruled the motions for summary judgment on the proximate causation issue, but, citing <em>Allen v. Grafton </em>(1960), 170 Ohio St. 249, 10 O.O.2d 289, 164 N.E.2d 167, found that as a matter of law James Mathews should have reasonably anticipated and guarded against fish bones in a fish dish. The loss of consortium claim was found to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in sustaining the motion for summary judgment as a genuine issue of material fact exists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Plaintiffs urge us to adopt the \u201creasonable expectation\u201d test as opposed to the \u201cforeign-natural\u201d test in cases where a consumer is injured by a substance which is natural to the food item consumed. The \u201cforeign-natural\u201d test is found in <em>Mix v. Ingersoll Candy Co. </em>(1936), 6 Cal.2d 674, 682, 59 P.2d 144, 148:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">\u201cBones which are natural to the type of meat served cannot legitimately be called a foreign substance, and a consumer who eats meat dishes ought to anticipate and be on his guard against the presence of such bones.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">The \u201creasonable expectation\u201d test is found in <em>Zabner v. Howard Johnson\u2019s Inc. </em>(Fla.App.1967), 201 So.2d 824, 826-827: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>The leading case in Ohio is <em>Allen v. Grafton </em>(1960), 170 Ohio St. 249, 10 O.O.2d 289, 164 N.E.2d 167, in which the plaintiff was injured after swallowing a piece of oyster shell contained in a serving of fried oysters. The <em>Allen </em>court held in the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>\u201cThe test should be what is \u2018reasonably expected\u2019 by the consumer in the food as served, not what might be natural to the ingredients of that food prior to preparation. * * * As applied to the action for common-law negligence, the test is related to the foreseeability of harm on the part of the defendant. The defendant is not an insurer but has the duty of ordinary care to eliminate or remove in the preparation of the food he serves such harmful substances as the consumer of the food, as served, would not ordinarily anticipate and guard against.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>\u201cThe presence in one of a serving of six fried oysters of a piece of oyster shell approximately 3x2 centimeters (about lVs inches by % of an inch) in diameter will not justify a legal conclusion either (a) that that serving of fried oysters constituted \u2018food\u2019 that was \u2018adulterated\u2019 within the meaning of Section 3715.59, Revised Code, or (b) that that serving constituted food not \u2018reasonably fit for\u2019 eating.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The <em>Allen </em>court explained its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">\u201cIn the instant case, it is not necessary to hold, as some of the above-cited cases do, that, because an oyster shell is natural to an oyster and thus not a substance \u2018foreign\u2019 to an oyster, no liability can be predicated upon the sale of a fried oyster containing a piece of oyster shell. However, the fact, that something that is served with food and that will cause harm if eaten is natural to that food and so not a \u2018foreign substance,\u2019 will usually be an important factor in determining whether a consumer can reasonably anticipate and guard against it. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">\u201cIn our opinion, the possible presence of a piece of oyster shell in or attached to an oyster is so well known to anyone who eats oysters that we can say as a matter of law that one who eats oysters can reasonably anticipate and guard against eating such a piece of shell, especially where it is as big a piece as the one described in plaintiff\u2019s petition.\u201d <em>Allen, supra, </em>at 258-259, 10 O.O.2d at 294, 164 N.E.2d at 174.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">A review of the cases reveals that most courts believe that the <em>Allen </em>court adopted the \u201cforeign-natural\u201d test. See <em>Jackson v. Nestle-Beich, Inc. </em>(1991), 212 Ill.App.3d 296, 301, 155 Ill.Dec. 508, 511, 569 N.E.2d 1119, 1122; <em>Evart v. Suli </em>(1989), 211 Cal.App.3d 605, 611, 259 Cal.Rptr. 535, 539, n. 4; <em>Phillips v. Town of West Springfield </em>(1989), 405 Mass. 411, 412, 540 N.E.2d 1331, 1332; <em>Matthews v. Campbell Soup Co. </em>(S.D.Tex.1974), 380 F.Supp. 1061, 1063; <em>Musso v. Picadilly Cafeterias, Inc. </em>(La.App.1965), 178 So.2d 421, 426. See, also, <em>Webster v. Blue Ship Tea Room, Inc. </em>(1964), 347 Mass. 421, 198 N.E.2d 309. However, the court in <em>Koperwas v. Publix Supermarkets, Inc. </em>(Fla. App.1988), 534 So.2d 872, 873, appears to find <em>Allen </em>aligned in the \u201creasonable expectation\u201d test column. This is also the apparent opinion of the court in <em>Thompson v. Lawson Milk Co. </em>(1976), 48 Ohio App.2d 143, 2 O.O.3d 112, 356 N.E.2d 309. Other Ohio courts following <em>Allen </em>have not addressed the question. See <em>Krumm v. ITT Continental Baking Co. </em>(Dec. 9, 1981), Fairfield App. No. 23-CA-81, unreported, 1981 WL 6575; <em>Schoonover v. Red </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>Lobster Inns of America, Inc. </em>(Oct. 15, 1980), Hamilton App. No. C-790547, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">However, it is not necessary to decide whether the \u201creasonable expectation\u201d test or the \u201cforeign-natural\u201d test holds sway in Ohio since, under either test, the order granting summary judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">While meaning no offense to James Mathews, we start with the proposition, bluntly stated in <em>Yong Cha Hong v. Marriott Corp. </em>(D.Md.1987), 656 F.Supp. 445, 449, that \u201ceveryone but a fool knows that tiny bones may remain in even the best fillets of fish.\u201d We acknowledge that the fish bone in the instant case, alleged to have measured about an inch and a half in length, might not be considered tiny. However, we are confident that it must be reasonably expected that even a fish fillet may contain fish bones. <em>Polite v. Carey Hilliards Restaurants, Inc. </em>(1985), 177 Ga.App. 170, 338 S.E.2d 541; <em>Schoon-over v. Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc., supra. </em>In <em>Polite, supra, </em>the granting of a summary judgment was affirmed where plaintiff swallowed a one-inch fish bone concealed in a fish fillet. The <em>Polite </em>court employed the \u201cforeign-natural\u201d test. In <em>Koperwas v. Publix Supermarkets, Inc., supra, </em>the court, using the \u201creasonable expectation\u201d test, stated that even under that test a directed verdict was sometimes proper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201cAn occasional piece of clam shell in a bowl of clam chowder is so well known to a consumer * * * that we can say the consumer can reasonably anticipate and guard against it.\u201d <em>Koperwas, supra, </em>534 So.2d at 873.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">In <em>Ex parte Morrison\u2019s Cafeteria of Montgomery, Inc. </em>(Ala.1983), 431 So.2d 975, the court adopted the \u201creasonable expectation\u201d test, but still held for the defendant as a matter of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">\u201c[A] one-centimeter bone found in a fish fillet \u2018makes that fish neither unfit for human consumption nor unreasonably dangerous.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\u201cCourts cannot and must not ignore the common experience of life and allow rules to develop that would make sellers of food or other consumer goods insurers of the products they sell.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 979; see <em>Zabner v. Howard Johnson\u2019s Inc., supra, </em>at 828 (application of the \u201creasonable expectation\u201d test is a jury question in <em>most </em>cases).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Accordingly, we hold that as a matter of law a consumer must reasonably anticipate and guard against the presence of a fish bone in a fish fillet. This assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">\u201cJames and Nella Mathews have been common law husband and wife since June 1986.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>This assignment is moot given the disposition of the first assignment of error above. In any event, the assignment cannot be passed upon since the trial court did not reach the merits of the loss-of-consortium claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b660-7\">Jones, P.J., and Walsh, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b660-8\">Edward J.
