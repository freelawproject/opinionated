Young, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">This matter is before this court upon the appeal of CC Bars Sahara, Inc., d.b.a. Sahara Lounge (\u201cSahara\u201d), appellant, from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in favor of the Ohio Liquor Control Commission (\u201ccommission\u201d), appellee. Appellee seized nine bottles of whiskey from appellant\u2019s place of business. A chemist for the state analyzed the whiskey and found that six of the nine bottles seized were below the advertised eighty proof. The results also demonstrated a discrepancy from the reference standard in the extracts, acidity and esters. The comparison was made to a reference standard which is compiled yearly by the commission. Thereafter, the commission filed a complaint against the appellant, alleging that the bottles had been refilled and/or diluted in violation of R.C. 4301.68 and Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">The commission conducted a hearing and determined that the permit holder, appellant, had violated R.C. 4301.68 and Ohio Adm.Code 4301:1-1-47, and ordered that the liquor permit be revoked. The appellant appealed that decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. When the trial court affirmed the commission\u2019s decision, this appeal ensued. The appellant now asserts the following three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-12\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. I:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-13\">\u201cThe Department of Liquor Control failed to compare the properties of the seized bottles of liquor from the permit holder to the formulae provided by the manufacturers of the various brands which the appellant was charged with diluting or refilling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u201cAssignment of Error No. II:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">\u201cThere was no testimony to indicate that the permit holder or an agent or employee of the permit holder refilled or diluted any of the bottles under Regulation 4301:1-1-47 of the regulations of the Ohio Liquor Control Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. Ill:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">\u201cThe reference standards and the seized permit holder\u2019s liquor bottles all contained less than eighty (80) proof whiskey which is less than the advertised proof on each of the various Canadian whiskeys.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">In the first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the state\u2019s chemist did not use the formulae provided by each particular manufacturer in making the comparison between the bottles seized and a standard of reference. Appellant argues that the bottles seized from appellant\u2019s premises could have been processed three years before or three years after the sample used by the chemist in the standard of reference, which would result in varying congeneric properties. Appellee asserts that the commission annually tests a sample of each type of liquor sold in the state of Ohio and uses that analysis as the reference standard. Furthermore, each manufacturer must notify the Ohio Department of Liquor Control when there is a new product, or a change in the production of a current product, and forward a sample so that it can be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">R.C. 4301.68 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">\u201cNo person shall sell, offer for sale, or possess intoxicating liquor in any original container which has been diluted, refilled, or partly refilled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">Upon review, there is no statute or regulation which dictates that the commission must use the formulae provided by the manufacturers as a standard of reference, for comparison purposes, under circumstances such as those in the matter herein. In <em>Langdon v. Bd. of Liquor Control </em>(1959), 112 Ohio App. 232, 16 O.O.2d 149, 175 N.E.2d 866, syllabus, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-12\">\u201cAn order of the Board of Liquor Control revoking a liquor permit for possession of diluted intoxicating liquor in an original container which has been refilled or partially refilled in violation of Section 4301.68, Revised Code, and the regulations of the board, is supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law, where evidence before such board consisted of testimony of the board\u2019s chemist that an analysis of bottles found on the permit premises showed that the congeneric properties of the contents thereof did not compare with the manufacturer\u2019s formula <em>or with an analysis of such brand made by the Department of Liquor Control </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>In accordance with <em>Langdon, </em>the state chemist submitted six reports concerning the makeup of the liquor seized, which demonstrated that the alcohol content deviated from the reference standard by as much as 5.9 percent, extract by as much as 16.3 percent, acidity by as much as 46.1 percent, esters by as much as 73.6 percent, and color by as much as 8.1 percent. This evidence was uncontroverted, since the appellant offered no testimony or other evidence to support its claim that the liquor seized from its premises had not been tampered with prior to its seizure by the agents of the Ohio Department of Liquor Control. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">In the second assignment of error, appellant asserts that there was no testimony which demonstrated that the bottles seized had been diluted and/or refilled. Upon review, the record indicates that the commission was responding to a complaint that liquor being served at appellant\u2019s premises was diluted. The investigators answering the complaint arrived at the premises in the afternoon and identified themselves. Based upon their experience, they seized nine bottles that appeared to have worn labels. The contents of the bottles were tested and three of the bottles were found to be satisfactory. However, six of the bottles did not approximately match the reference standard and, thus, the state\u2019s chemist\u2019s written analysis indicates his conclusion, in each instance, whether the bottle analyzed was refilled, or diluted and refilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error asserts that the reference standards contained less than eighty proof whiskey. However, appellant presents this assertion without any supportive argument. The record indicates that the reference standards allow for a slight deviation below eighty proof, but generally do not allow for a deviation above eighty. The chemist for the state testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201cCOMMISSIONER SWEENEY: Excuse me. How much of a margin do you allow below the advertised\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: The law states it should be within half a proof; but in this case because of the way we do it, we are allowed to give some balance, you know, 79 or 78.8. In other words, we are not \u2014 we are doing it just for the purpose of comparing them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">\u201cCOMMISSIONER SWEENEY: But you are also using it for these studies as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Right, for comparing. And more often \u2014 can we go off the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u201cCOMMISSIONER SWEENEY: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201c(Discussion off the record.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I don\u2019t recall any bottle that has been done that a report has been done for the DB &amp; D that has has <em>[sic </em>] been substandard proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cCOMMISSIONER SWEENEY: In this testing does it run on both sides of 80 roughly even. That is 81 as compared with 79?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: No, T never\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">\u201cCOMMISSIONER SWEENEY: Does it generally run below?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yeah, right. That is primarily, we feel that they are very careful because the federal government would come very heavy on them because of the proof count.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">There was no evidence presented that the reference standard used in this case by appellee showed a material deviation from the manufacturers\u2019 formu-lae.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">Accordingly, based on the evidence, the reference standards were within the proof count deviation allowed by law. Appellant has not demonstrated otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">Based on the foregoing, appellant\u2019s first, second and third assignments of error are not well taken and are overruled. The judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-15\">Peggy Bryant and Tyack, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
