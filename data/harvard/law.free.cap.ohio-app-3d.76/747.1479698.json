The patio was enclosed by a board fence and gate, both approximately six feet high; defendant relied solely on a chain looped over the gate post and the top of one or more boards of the gate to secure the gate in the closed position, as the gate had no operable latch or lock mechanism.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">On September 27, 1988, Shannon Tucker, a two-year-old child who resided nearby, was just outside the gate of defendant\u2019s patio when defendant\u2019s dogs escaped from the patio. Although the testimony of eyewitnesses differed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>number of details, the witnesses agreed generally that both dogs participated in an attack on Shannon, who died as a result of the injuries resulting therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Defendant was indicted and tried on one count of failing to confine or restrain a vicious dog in violation of R.C. 955.22(D), and one count of involuntary manslaughter. At trial, the state sought to convict defendant only as to the American Pit Bull Terrier, conceding that the rottweiler was not a \u201cvicious dog\u201d as defined by R.C. 955.22(A). A jury found defendant guilty of failing to confine or restrain a vicious dog, with a specification that the dog caused serious harm to Shannon, but acquitted defendant of involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charge based on the fact that the statutory structure failed to comport with due process requirements of the Constitutions of the state of Ohio and the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\">\u201cII. The trial court erred in instructing the jury by allowing the jury to find that a \u2018breed commonly known as a pit bull\u2019 was a vicious dog as defined in the statute even if the evidence was uncontradicted that the dog had never in the past injured or killed a human being or killed a dog as mandated in the first two subsections of the appropriate definition of vicious dog as set forth in Section [sic] 955 of the Ohio Revised Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">\u201cHI. The evidence as presented to the jury was insufficient as a matter of law to allow conviction and the finding of the jury was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-10\">\u201cIV. The trial court erred in finding that the charge and the verdict of the jury permitted an indefinite sentence pursuant to the statutory provisions of \u00a7 2929.11 O.R.C.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">We first addressed defendant\u2019s assignments of error in our opinion of December 26, 1989, finding that R.C. 955.22(D) was unconstitutionally vague. Accordingly, we sustained defendant\u2019s first assignment of error and reversed defendant\u2019s conviction solely on that basis, without considering defendant\u2019s remaining three assignments of error. On February 13, 1991, the Supreme Court reversed our determination as to the constitutionality of R.C. 955.22(D), and remanded the case to this court for determination of defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error. <em>State v. Ferguson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 176, 566 N.E.2d 1230. Thus, we consider in this opinion only defendant\u2019s second, third, and fourth assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that R.C. Chapter 955 permitted the jury to find that a dog belonging to the \u201cbreed commonly known as a pit bull dog\u201d was a vicious dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Defendant argues that R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a) defines a \u201cvicious dog\u201d only in terms of the elements set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) thereof, a dog that, without provocation, has killed or caused injury to any person, or killed another dog, and that subsection (iii) of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a) provides only that evidence that the dog in question is a pit bull dog creates a <em>prima facie </em>case as to the elements set forth in subsections (i) and (ii); hence, defendant may rebut the state\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case by showing that the dog in question has not, without provocation, killed or caused injury to any person, or killed another dog. The state responds that the foregoing statute specifically provides that a vicious dog is one that satisfies the requirements of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii); consequently, a dog belonging to the breed commonly known as a pit bull dog may be a vicious dog even if such dog has not, without provocation, killed or caused injury to any person, or killed another dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">R.C. 955.22(A) specifies that a \u201cvicious dog\u201d has the same meaning as used in R.C. 955.11, which provides that a \u201cvicious dog\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">\u201c * * * [A] dog that, without provocation and subject to division (A)(4)(b) of this section, meets any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">\u201c(i) Has killed or caused serious injury to any person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-9\">\u201c(ii) Has caused injury, other than killing or serious injury, to any person, or has killed another dog;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-10\">\u201c(iii) Belongs to a breed that is commonly known as a pit bull dog. The ownership, keeping, or harboring of such a breed of dog shall be prima-facie evidence of the ownership, keeping, or harboring of a vicious dog.\u201d R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Because R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a) defines \u201cvicious dog\u201d in the alternative, a dog may be deemed a vicious dog under subsection (iii) thereof if the dog belongs to the breed commonly known as a pit bull dog, even if such dog has not, without provocation, killed or caused injury to any person, or killed another dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">We disagree with defendant\u2019s contention that the foregoing construction of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a) renders ineffective the last sentence of subsection (iii) thereof. Specifically, the last sentence of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii) allows defendant to rebut the state\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>showing that defendant\u2019s dog is a vicious dog even if defendant admits to the truth of the element contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the first sentence of R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii), that the dog in question belongs to the breed commonly known as a pit bull dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In contrast, if defendant admits to the truth of the elements contained in R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(i) or (ii), the dog in question is conclusively deemed a vicious dog. We further note that, to give effect to R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii), evidence of the absence of the elements contained in R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(i) and (ii), standing alone, is insufficient as a matter of law to rebut the state\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>showing that defendant\u2019s dog was a \u201cvicious dog\u201d as defined by R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Defendant\u2019s third assignment of error contends that the evidence presented to the jury was insufficient as a matter of law to support his conviction, and that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In assessing the merits of defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, we note the test for determining the sufficiency and weight of the evidence \u201c * * * is whether any reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, an appellate court\u2019s function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation omitted.] Thus, in reviewing both weight and sufficiency of the evidence, the same test is applied. The verdict will not be disturbed unless the appellate court finds that reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier of facts. * * * \u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492, 503. Consequently, the weight to be given the evidence and determinations as to credibility of witnesses are matters primarily for the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. Within those parameters, the judgment of the trial court is supported by the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a) provides that evidence that the dog in question is a member of the breed commonly known as a pit bull dog is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that such dog is a vicious dog. Moreover, the Supreme Court has enumerated behavioral traits characteristic of this breed, including \u201c \u2018 * * * unusual relentless ferocity or the extreme concentration on fighting and attacking, * * * a history of catching, fighting, and killing instinct * * * aggression, tenacity, and unpredictability, which prompted the legislature to specifically include members of the pit bull breed in the statutory definition of vicious dog. <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 168, 170, 172-173, 566 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>N.E.2d 1224, 1225-1226, 1227-1228, certiorari denied (1991), 501 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 2904, 115 L.Ed.2d 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Defendant, having admitted that the dog in question was a pit bull, the state made out a <em>prima facie </em>case that such dog was a \u201cvicious dog\u201d as defined by R.C. 955.11(A)(4)(a)(iii). Further, the state presented evidence, from which a jury could reasonably conclude that defendant\u2019s pit bull exhibited the behavioral traits characteristic of pit bulls which prompted the legislature to define members of the pit bull breed as vicious dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Specifically, William Ransbotttom, a neighbor who frequently walked past the outside of defendant\u2019s patio, testified that the dogs jumped often against the fence enclosing defendant\u2019s patio, and that the dogs \u201chit that fence with a tremendous force,\u201d causing the entire fence to move. Another neighbor, John Petrella, testified that \u201cthe dogs would bang up against the fence. * * * If the dogs were out there, no one, no one, would go up to move the chain * * * \u201d which held the gate closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Gayle Tucker described a specific incident in which defendant\u2019s dogs jumped against the gate after Tucker ran along the sidewalk outside defendant\u2019s patio, startling Tucker, her daughter Shannon, and Tucker\u2019s roommate. Defendant\u2019s next-door neighbor, Dale Hysell, related that he saw and heard both of defendant\u2019s dogs jump against the fence, and that the jumping startled passersby and discouraged Hysell from using his patio when the dogs were out.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Like Hysell, defendant\u2019s other next-door neighbor, Andrew Pinkston, testified that the dogs jumped against the fence; that in so doing the dogs were able to separate sections of the board fence by two-to-three inches along the bottom; that the jumping discouraged him from using his patio; and that he generally would not let his wife go out on their patio unaccompanied when the dogs were out. Pinkston also related that defendant\u2019s pit bull once burrowed under the fence to gain access to Pinkston\u2019s patio before Pinkston could prevent this from recurring; that defendant had bragged about defendant\u2019s pit bull attacking a neighbor\u2019s pit bull; and that defendant\u2019s pit bull had killed the Tucker\u2019s cat. Even Dennis Parker, who described the dogs as well behaved and well trained, testified that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let my little boy go over to [the dogs] by himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">As to whether defendant\u2019s actions were reckless, R.C. 2901.22(C) provides that a person acts recklessly when \u201c * * * with heedless indifference to the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that his conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could conclude that defendant acted \u201crecklessly\u201d as defined by the foregoing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">In particular, defendant admitted that he had studied books about the pit bull breed, and that he was aware from media reports of what pit bulls can do to children. In addition, Pinkston testified that he warned defendant that the dogs were going to hurt someone if defendant did not watch them closely.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Defendant also testified that the inside latch on his patio gate was inoperable when he leased his condominium; that defendant thereafter made no attempt to install a new latch even though defendant estimated the cost thereof at no more than ten dollars; and that defendant chose instead to rely solely on the chain to secure the gate, even though the effectiveness of this method of securing the gate depended upon whether or not defendant\u2019s children, aged eight and twelve, remembered to put the chain in place after using the gate, and even though any passerby who wished to do so could remove the chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Having determined that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to prove the elements of R.C. 955.22(D) and that the trial court\u2019s judgment was not against the manifest weight of the evidence, we overrule defendant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error maintains that the trial court erred in imposing an indefinite sentence, since R.C. 2929.11(D) requires imposition of a definite sentence for conviction of a felony of the fourth degree when defendant did not cause physical harm to any person during the commission of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">Defendant first argues that R.C. 2929.11(G) bars imposition of an indefinite sentence for a felony of the fourth degree pursuant to R.C. 2929.22(B)(6) or (7) unless the indictment, count in the indictment, or information charging defendant with the offense contains a specification which complies with R.C. 2941.143. However, R.C. 2929.11(G) establishes no conditions for imposition of an indefinite sentence for a felony of the fourth degree pursuant to R.C. 2929.11(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">Defendant next contends that imposition of an indefinite sentence requires a finding that defendant caused physical harm to a person during commission of the offense charged; that the jury\u2019s finding that the dog in question had seriously injured a person did not constitute a finding that defendant caused physical harm to a person during defendant\u2019s violation of R.C. 955.22(D); and that, absent the requisite finding for imposition of an indefinite sentence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>trial court was required to impose the definite sentence prescribed by R.C. 2929.11(D). The state responds that the trial court properly imposed an indefinite sentence, because defendant caused physical harm to a person during defendant\u2019s violation of R.C. 955.22(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">R.C. 955.99(G) provides that a violation of R.C. 955.22(D) involving a vicious dog is a felony of the fourth degree if the dog in question kills or seriously injures any person. R.C. 2929.11(D) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">\u201cWhoever is convicted of or pleads guilty to a felony of the third or fourth degree and did not, during the commission of that offense, cause physical harm to any person * * * shall be imprisoned for a definite term * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">R.C. 2929.11(D) therefore excludes a trial court from imposing a definite sentence for any offense during which defendant caused physical harm to any person. <em>State v. Jones </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App.3d 85, 87, 30 OBR 182, 184, 506 N.E.2d 1187, 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">After finding defendant guilty of violating R.C. 955.22(D), the jury made a special finding that defendant\u2019s pit bull seriously injured Tucker; thus, defendant\u2019s violation of R.C. 955.22(D) was a felony of the fourth degree. Since such injury to Tucker occurred when defendant\u2019s pit bull was not confined as prescribed by R.C. 955.22(D), the trial court did not err in concluding that defendant caused physical harm to Tucker during defendant\u2019s violation of R.C. 955.22(D), and in sentencing defendant to an indefinite term. Therefore, we overrule defendant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Having overruled defendant\u2019s three assignments of error which remained after the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition of defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b786-11\">Peggy Bryant and Petree, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b786-12\">Archer E.
