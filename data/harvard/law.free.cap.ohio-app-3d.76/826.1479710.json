Toensing, Richard R. Toensing, and Cheryl L. Toensing (\u201cappellants\u201d) appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee MK-Ferguson Co. (\u201cappel-lee\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The facts giving rise to the instant appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>Appellants\u2019 decedent, Robert V. Toensing, commenced his employment with appellee in 1968 and occupied the position of Manager of Information Systems. On October 31, 1986, decedent died of a heart attack while he was seated at his desk while he was in the employ of appellee. It was not disputed that decedent smoked cigarettes and had a family history of cardiovascular disease. Nor was there a dispute that decedent had problems with his pulmonary and circulatory systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">On or about June 30, 1987, appellants filed an application for workers\u2019 compensation with the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation. Appellants claimed that decedent suffered a heart attack and died in the course of and arising out of his employment with appellee. According to appellants, decedent\u2019s death was accelerated by physical and emotional stresses brought on by his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">After a hearing was conducted on February 7, 1988, the district hearing officer ordered that the appellants\u2019 claim be denied. On or about April 20, 1988, appellants appealed the denial of their claim to the Cleveland Regional Board of Review of the Industrial Commission of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">On August 17, 1988, a hearing was conducted on appellants\u2019 appeal. On October 7, 1988, the Cleveland Regional Board of Review overturned the district hearing officer\u2019s denial and allowed appellants\u2019 claim for death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">On or about October 21, 1988, appellee appealed the Cleveland Regional Board of Review\u2019s decision to the Industrial Commission of Ohio, which conducted a hearing on May 25, 1989. On July 8, 1989, the Industrial Commission of Ohio vacated the order of the Cleveland Regional Board of Review and reinstated the order of the district hearing officer. Accordingly, appellants were denied death benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">On July 24, 1989, appellants filed a notice of appeal with the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Appellants claimed that they were entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">On February 1, 1991, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that appellants\u2019 claim for death benefits was not compensable, since no work-related injury or occupational disease was shown to have caused decedent\u2019s premature death. On March 25, 1991, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal and subsequently raised the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of plaintiffs-appellants by granting the motion for summary judgment of defendant-appellee MK-Ferguson Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Appellants argue that decedent\u2019s death was caused by stress at work, which aggravated a pre-existing condition. In support of their argument, appellants cite Dr. T. Rey Rivera\u2019s affidavit and Certificate in Proof of Death. In both documents, Dr. Rey Rivera stated that decedent\u2019s death was accelerated by stress, under which he was placed due to the added travel, responsibility and work load at his employment. Dr. Rivera specifically concluded that decedent\u2019s work aggravated a pre-existing condition which caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">A death caused by a heart attack at the workplace may be compensable for a claimant seeking to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund. <em>Ryan v. Connor </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 406, 28 OBR 462, 503 N.E.2d 1379. In order for such a claim to be compensable, there must be evidence that the heart attack was caused by work-related physical exertion and greater stress than that customary in the decedent\u2019s usual work routine. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 28 OBR at 465, 503 N.E.2d at 1382. Further, there must be proof that the stress precipitated the heart attack sooner than it would have occurred under ordinary circumstances. <em>Schmidt v. Mayfield </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 157, 530 N.E.2d 1331, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Upon a review of the evidence in this case, we find that there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether decedent\u2019s heart attack was work related. Dr. Rivera\u2019s statements in his affidavit and Certificate in Proof of Death clearly raised questions whether decedent\u2019s death was caused by stress he was allegedly subjected to while working for appellee. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Appellants\u2019 assignment of error is well taken and is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">The trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b861-12\">Spellacy and James D. Sweeney, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AAV\">John F. Corrigan, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-17\">. James L. Mayfield, Administrator of the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, was named as a defendant in this case. However, we find that the trial court's judgment renders appellants\u2019 complaint against him moot. Thus, the trial court judgment is a final appealable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>order and Civ.R. 54(B) is not applicable to said judgment. See <em>Wise v. Gursky </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 241, 20 O.O.3d 233, 421 N.E.2d 150.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b861-13\">John F.

Catrett </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 317, 323-324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552-2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265, 273-274, the United States Supreme Court held that the plain language of the summary judgment rule mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery, and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d at 273. In such a situation, there can be no \u201cgenuine issue as to any material fact,\u201d since a complet\u00e9 failure of proof concerning an essential element of a non-moving party\u2019s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In <em>Ryan v. Connor </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 406, 28 OBR 462, 503 N.E.2d 1379, the Supreme Court held that a physical injury occasioned solely by mental or emotional stress received in the course of, and arising out of, an injured employee\u2019s employment is compensable under R.C. 4123.01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">\u201cWe * * * hold that in order for a stress related injury to be compensable, the claimant must show that the injury resulted from \u2018greater emotional strain or tension than that to which all workers are occasionally subjected * * V <em>Wilson v. Tippetts-Abbott-McCarthy-Stratton </em>(1964), 22 App.Div.2d 720, 721, 253 N.Y.Supp.2d 149, 150. See, also, <em>Santacroce v. 40 W. 20th St., Inc. </em>(1961), 10 N.Y.2d 855, 222 N.Y.Supp.2d 689 [178 N.E.2d 912].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-8\">\u201cOnce a claimant has met this first test, he still must establish that the stress to which he (or claimant\u2019s decedent) was subjected in his employment was, in fact, the medical cause of his injury. In this regard, the claimant must show a substantial causal relationship between the stress and the injury for which compensation is sought. The claimant therefore must \u2018show by a preponderance of the evidence, medical or otherwise, * * * that a direct or proximate causal relationship existed between * * * [the stress] and his harm or disability,\u2019 <em>Fox v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 569 [55 O.O. 472, 125 N.E.2d 1], paragraph one of the syllabus; or, when death benefits are sought, that the claimant\u2019s decedent\u2019s death was \u2018accelerated by a substantial period of time as a direct and proximate result of the * * * [stress].\u2019 <em>McKee v. Electric Auto-Lite Co. </em>(1958), 168 Ohio St. 77 [5 O.O.2d 345, 151 N.E.2d 540], syllabus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409-410, 28 OBR at 465, 503 N.E.2d at 1382.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">In this case, however, plaintiffs\u2019 evidence was wholly insufficient to establish the requisite elements of comparative stress and substantial causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">As to the first element, comparative stress, plaintiffs asserted that the decedent had taken seven business trips during the last three months of his life. Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment established, however, that the comparative stress element could not be proven as defendant demonstrat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>ed that eighty percent of the decedent\u2019s co-workers travelled more than did the decedent. Plaintiffs presented absolutely no evidence to the contrary and therefore failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to this element.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Having failed to establish this essential element of their cause of action, plaintiffs could not prevail, and the trial court therefore properly granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment pursuant to <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, supra. </em>I would affirm the judgment rendered below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
