(\u201cNLO\u201d), for injuries caused by an occupational disease. Following a hearing, a district hearing officer issued an order allowing Kelly\u2019s claim and denying NLO\u2019s motion to depose the Industrial Commission (\u201cthe commission\u201d) of Ohio\u2019s specialist, Dr. Lockey. On appeal by NLO, the Dayton Regional Board of Review modified the order by granting NLO\u2019s motion and by holding the question of Kelly\u2019s claim in abeyance. After reviewing the deposition of Dr. Lockey, the regional board ordered that Kelly be examined by a new doctor and then remanded the claim to the district hearing officer. Upon Kelly\u2019s appeal, two staff hearing officers at the commission affirmed the board\u2019s order as to the new medical examination, but ordered that the allowance of the claim be decided by the regional board.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">NLO then appealed the commission\u2019s decision to the court of common pleas. The common pleas court denied motions to dismiss the appeal filed by Kelly, the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cthe bureau\u201d) and the commission, and granted NLO\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Kelly, the bureau and the commission then filed appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">Appellants\u2019 assignments of error on appeal contend that the court of common pleas improperly denied their motions to dismiss NLO\u2019s appeal and improperly granted NLO\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Because the trial court lacked jurisdiction over NLO\u2019s appeal, we sustain appellants\u2019 assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">R.C. 4123.519 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">\u201cThe claimant or the employer may appeal a decision of the industrial commission or of its staff hearing officer made pursuant to division (B)(6) of section 4121.35 of the Revised Code in any injury or occupational disease case, other than a decision as to the extent of disability, to the court of common pleas * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">NLO argues that the decision of the commission to remand Kelly\u2019s claim to the regional board does not involve the extent of disability and that, therefore, NLO could appeal that decision to the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">However, pursuant to R.C. 2505.03, only final orders of administrative agencies may be reviewed on appeal by a court of common pleas. A final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>order is an \u201corder that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The decision of the commission remanding Kelly\u2019s claim to the regional board rather than remanding it to the district hearing officer does not affect a substantial right in this action which would prevent a judgment. Therefore, the commission\u2019s decision does not constitute a final order which may be reviewed by the common pleas court. Cf. <em>Seabloom Roofing &amp; Sheet Metal Co. v. Mayfield </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 108, 519 N.E.2d 358 (Industrial Commission\u2019s order denying employer\u2019s motion to vacate allowance of claim affects a substantial right which is appealable to the common pleas court). Thus, the trial court did not possess subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain NLO\u2019s appeal of the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Because the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal filed by NLO, it improperly granted NLO\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and improperly denied appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss the appeal. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this cause for the entry of an order dismissing NLO\u2019s appeal to the court of common pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b35-8\">Doan, P.J., Klusmeier and Hildebrandt, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
