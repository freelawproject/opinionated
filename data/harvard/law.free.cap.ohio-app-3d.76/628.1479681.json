On appeal, appellant asserts the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">\u201cA. The trial court erred in denying plaintiff-appellant Millis Transfer, Inc.\u2019s motion for sanctions against Z &amp; Z Distributing Company on the basis that it acted in bad faith in pursuing a cause of action without any lawful basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">\u201cB. The trial court erred in denying plaintiff-appellant Millis Transfer, Inc.\u2019s motion for sanctions against Z &amp; Z Distributing Company\u2019s attorney for violating Rule 11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">Appellant, a common carrier, brought suit on October 19, 1989, against appellee, Z <em>&amp; </em>Z Distributing Company, to collect transportation and delivery charges incurred by appellee, plus interest, costs, and expenses. Appellee denied appellant\u2019s claim and also filed a counterclaim against appellant asserting that the goods delivered were spoiled because they were not properly refrigerated. Appellant denied appellee\u2019s counterclaim. On June 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>1990, the court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed appellee\u2019s counterclaim for lack of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Appellant moved for summary judgment on its complaint, arguing that it was required by federal law to collect its tariff and that federal law barred appellee\u2019s defenses. In addition, appellant also filed the affidavit of its Director of Revenue Accounting, who attested that a timely claim for damaged goods was never filed with it by appellee. Appellee did not file a response to the motion for summary judgment. On August 31, 1990, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the \u201cComplaint, as well as on Defendant\u2019s Counterclaim,\u201d and awarded appellant its damages, plus interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">On December 5, 1990, appellant filed a motion for sanctions \u201cpursuant to Rule 11 of the <em>Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure </em>on the grounds that defendant and defendant\u2019s attorney willfully violated Civ.Rule 11.\u201d Appellant\u2019s law and argument centered on Civ.R. 11, except for one sentence in his motion which states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">\u201cThere is no doubt that defendant and his counsel acted in bad faith justifying plaintiff\u2019s recovery of reasonable attorney fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Filed with the motion was the affidavit of appellant\u2019s counsel, Daniel T. Ellis, which he made to support the \u201cmotion for Rule 11 sanctions.\u201d Ellis attested that he contacted appellee on July 10, 1989, and informed it of appellant\u2019s claim and that appellee had to file a claim for damaged goods with appellant before appellee\u2019s claim could be considered. Ellis further attested that he informed appellee that the alleged claim of damaged goods was not a valid defense to appellant\u2019s claim for collection of its tariff. Ellis attests that he then contacted appellee\u2019s counsel, Walter J. Skotynsky, on July 10, 1989. Ellis told Skotynsky that appellee did not have a valid defense and mailed Skotynsky the statutes, regulations, and administrative rulings that supported appellant\u2019s argument. Ellis attests that he was informed on September 1, 1989, that appellee would not pay the tariff and that appellant would have to file suit to collect the tariff. Ellis further attested that appellant paid his firm $630.10 for the prosecution of the complaint and $3,402.24 for the defense of the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">On December 18,1990, appellee opposed the motion for sanctions. Appellee argued that Civ.R. 11 did not permit the court to subject the party to sanctions. In addition, appellee argued that monetary sanctions were not appropriate under Civ.R. 11. Appellee also argued that sanctions were not warranted because he was merely making appellant prove its claim. Appellee argued that there was no allegation of unjustified pleading. Finally, appellee argued that the American Rule allows attorney fees to be awarded only if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>party acted in \u201cbad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, obdurately, or for oppressive reasons,\u201d citing <em>Sorin v. Warrensville Hts. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 177, 181, 75 O.O.2d 224, 226, 347 N.E.2d 527, 529. Appellee argued that the mere fact that a defense failed does not demonstrate bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">On January 7, 1991, appellant replied to appellee\u2019s memorandum in opposition. Therein, appellant argued that \u201cDefendant and its attorney acted in bad faith, in a vexatious manner, obdurately and for oppressive reasons justifying the court\u2019s imposition of sanctions against both of them.\u201d Thus, appellant asserted it was seeking attorney fees against appellee because it acted in bad faith and against Skotynsky for willfully violating Civ.R. 11. Appellant alleged that appellee\u2019s answer and counterclaim \u201cwere not based upon \u2018good grounds\u2019 and were interposed for improper purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The municipal court denied appellant\u2019s motion for sanctions. The court noted that the motion specifically requested \u201cexpenses and attorney fees pursuant to Rule 11 of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In its first assignment of error, appellant argues that the court erred when it denied the motion for sanctions against appellee, since appellee acted in bad faith in bringing its counterclaim without any lawful basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Since this issue was presented to the municipal court only in appellant\u2019s reply brief to appellee\u2019s memorandum in opposition to the motion for sanctions and the municipal court did not consider this issue, there is nothing for us to review as an appellate court. Therefore, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">In its second assignment of error, appellant argues that the court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s Civ.R. 11 motion for sanctions against appellee\u2019s attorney who signed appellee\u2019s answer denying appellant\u2019s claim and asserting a counterclaim. Appellant argues that the sanction should have been imposed because appellee was clearly liable based upon the law and facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">The decision to impose sanctions under Civ.R. 11 is left to the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown. <em>State ex rel. Fant v. Sykes </em>(1987), 29 Ohio St.3d 65, 29 OBR 446, 505 N.E.2d 966. An abuse of discretion constitutes \u201cmore than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable * * *.\u201d <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 169, 559 N.E.2d 1301, 1308, citing <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">We recently considered the issue of whether the trial court has the discretion to award reasonable attorney fees as a sanction for a willful violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Civ.R. 11 in <em>Gordon Food Service, Inc. v. Hot Dog John\u2019s, Inc. </em>(Oct. 25, 1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 105, 601 N.E.2d 131, Lucas App. No. L-90-293, unreported. Following <em>Mitchell v. Whitaker </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 170, 514 N.E.2d 937, we held that reasonable attorney fees incurred to respond to unjustified pleadings could be awarded as a sanction. See, also, <em>Boyd v. Biggert </em>(Nov. 4, 1988), Ottawa App. No. 4355, unreported, 1988 WL 118595. Accord <em>Newman v. Al Castrucci Ford Sales, Inc. </em>(1988), 54 Ohio App.3d 166, 561 N.E.2d 1001; <em>Buller v. Respicare, Inc. </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 17, 18, 528 N.E.2d 1282, 1283 (Whiteside, J., concurring); and <em>Stevens v. Kiraly </em>(1985), 24 Ohio App.3d 211, 24 OBR 388, 494 N.E.2d 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In the case before us, the municipal court concluded that appellant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, without stating its reasons, with regard to the merits of the case. We presume that the court concluded that appellant was entitled to collect its tariff and that no valid defense to collection existed. Appellee did not challenge the granting of summary judgment. The affidavit of appellant\u2019s attorney evidences that appellee\u2019s attorney was informed of the law and facts supporting appellant\u2019s claim, but still filed the answer denying the claim and asserting a counterclaim. We find that this conduct constitutes a willful violation of Civ.R. 11. We further find that there were no mitigating factors presented by appellee\u2019s attorney to justify his actions. Accordingly, we find that the municipal court abused its discretion when it denied appellant\u2019s request for attorney fees as a Civ.R. 11 sanction. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is found well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The judgment of the Toledo Municipal Court is reversed. This cause is remanded to the Toledo Municipal Court for a hearing regarding the amount of reasonable attorney fees to be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">We find that there were reasonable grounds for this appeal. Appellee is hereby ordered to pay the court costs incurred on appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b664-8\">Abood and Melvin L.
