In support of her appeal, defendant raises a single assignment of error, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201cThe trial court erroneously overruled the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress when the city failed to establish that the defendant\u2019s vehicle had been lawfully stopped by the arresting officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The arresting officer testified that he had been dispatched to a White Castle restaurant on a complaint of a drunken driver. When he arrived at the scene, he noticed a police officer talking to the defendant. Although he was three feet from defendant, the arresting officer, a police sergeant, noticed nothing unusual about the defendant. However, as they walked away, the officer informed the police sergeant that he believed that defendant might be under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">About one-half hour later, as he was driving on a nearby street, the police sergeant observed a moving automobile which looked like the one defendant had been standing next to in the parking lot. The sergeant stopped the vehicle and discovered that defendant was the driver of the vehicle. At this point, the police sergeant made an evaluation of defendant\u2019s sobriety and determined that there was no probable cause to arrest her for driving under the influence. However, after placing defendant in the back seat of his cruiser, the sergeant ran a check through the LEADS computer and discovered that the defendant\u2019s license had been suspended. Defendant was then arrested for that violation, and her car was impounded. The sergeant stated that he did not observe defendant commit any violation, traffic or otherwise, and that he pulled her vehicle over (prior to the time he ascertained that defendant was in fact the operator) only because of the other officer\u2019s comments about defendant and because of his own \u201csixth sense\u201d and intuition.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The basic issue before us is whether the police sergeant, when he stopped defendant\u2019s vehicle, had a sufficient reasonable basis for doing so. The city contends that the officer was entitled to make a so-called Terry-type stop for investigation predicated upon the information that he had, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>would give rise to an articulable and reasonable suspicion that defendant was operating the vehicle in violation of law. See <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, and <em>Delaware v. Prouse </em>(1979), 440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660. The appropriate rule is set forth in <em>State v. Chatton </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 59, 11 OBR 250, 463 N.E.2d 1237. In that case, there was no question as to the reasonableness of the initial stop since the vehicle displayed neither front nor rear license plates. However, the vehicle did have a temporary license tag, which was visible from the rear windshield. After stopping the vehicle, the officer ascertained that the temporary tag was visible from the rear window and, thus, the vehicle was not being operated without a license plate. Despite having made that determination, the officer proceeded to conduct a computer check and ascertained that the operator\u2019s driver\u2019s license has been suspended. The officer then arrested the person for operating a motor vehicle while under suspension. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction, finding that there was an improper search and seizure, the Supreme Court stating that, even where there is a valid basis for an initial stop of a vehicle, when that basis is explained away, \u201c * * * the driver of the vehicle may not be detained further to determine the validity of his driver\u2019s license absent some specific and articulable facts that the detention was reasonable. * * * \u201d <em>Chatton, </em>at 63, 11 OBR at 254, 463 N.E.2d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The evidence in this case is somewhat confusing as to time sequence. The sergeant testified that, after stopping defendant\u2019s vehicle, he made an evaluation of sobriety and determined not to arrest her for driving under the influence of alcohol. That evaluation \u201cconsisted of my looking into her eyes for the presence or absence of any redness, any odor of an alcoholic beverage upon her breath, any unsteadiness of feet as she walked from her car to my car, and any confusion or inconsistencies with regard to her answers to questions raised by me.\u201d After making this determination, the officer caused her to sit in the back of the police cruiser while he checked the LEADS computer to determine her driver\u2019s license status. While he testified that he did ask for her driver\u2019s license, it was unclear as to whether he asked for the driver\u2019s license before or after determining not to arrest her for operating the motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. If he asked her for the driver\u2019s license after such determination, under the rule of <em>Chatton, supra, </em>the further inquiry would have been improper, and evidence obtained as a result thereof should be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">More basic, however, is the fact that the sergeant admitted that he had observed defendant violate no traffic laws and predicated the stop upon intuition and the comment of the officer at the White Castle parking lot that defendant might be under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The other police officer also testified at the hearing. He could not recall any conversation with the sergeant concerning defendant\u2019s condition. However, his testimony as to defendant\u2019s condition conflicted with that of the sergeant. The officer testified that, at the White Castle parking lot, the defendant was clearly drunk but was not operating the vehicle at that time. He told her not to drive the vehicle because she was drunk, and he left the scene. He stated that he smelled an odor of alcohol about defendant\u2019s person, that she staggered and was having a hard time walking, and had slurred speech and glassy eyes. He indicated that \u201cher physical characteristics indicated to me she was definitely under the influence of alcohol and very drunk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The other police officer\u2019s testimony as to his observation of defendant in the parking lot would give rise to a reasonable basis for his stopping her one-half hour later if he observed her operating that motor vehicle. However, the officer indicated that he could not recall communicating any of this information to the sergeant, and the sergeant testified that the officer told him only that defendant \u201cmight\u201d be under the influence, which is inconsistent with the officer\u2019s testimony that he thought defendant was \u201cvery drunk.\u201d The salient issue, however, is that the stop cannot be predicated upon the other officer\u2019s observations or opinion, which were not communicated to the sergeant. Rather, it may be predicated only upon that which the sergeant knew at the time he stopped the vehicle and made the initial detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Giving the state the benefit of the most favorable interpretation of the sergeant\u2019s testimony, there is no reasonable basis for a stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle at the time that the officer stopped the vehicle. He admitted that, although the vehicle was the same vehicle he saw defendant standing next to, he did not know who was driving the vehicle until after he stopped it and observed that defendant was the driver. He further admitted that he saw no traffic violations committed while he observed the automobile being driven. Rather, he justified that he predicated his stop upon \u201cvery intricate and broad knowledge of the street.\u201d He stated that he surmised from his \u201csixth sense\u201d that whoever was driving the vehicle \u201creally doesn\u2019t want to have any contact with me.\u201d As the result of \u201cthe kind of intuition that you won\u2019t find in a law book,\u201d he further admitted that he identified the vehicle as being the one he had seen earlier, not from observing that defendant was the operator of that vehicle and not from the license number, but only from its color, size, and general appearance. He further admitted that \u201ctheoretically under probability, it could have been another green car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Under these circumstances, the officer had insufficient evidence upon which to predicate a stop. He had no reasonable basis for suspecting that a traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>law was being violated. Nor did he even contend that he had a basis for suspecting that the operator of a vehicle was violating some law. In short, the officer stopped the vehicle based primarily upon his intuition. Such intuition is insufficient information upon which to predicate a traffic stop predicated at best solely upon a hunch that the operator of the vehicle may be violating a traffic law.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The trial court, in overruling the motion to suppress, obviously relied upon the other officer\u2019s testimony as to defendant\u2019s condition. The court stated the correct test, that an officer in effecting an investigative stop must have a reasonable suspicion based on objective facts that the operator of the vehicle involved is engaged in some type of prohibited activity. In addition, the trial court was under the misapprehension that the sergeant personally saw defendant operating the vehicle prior to the stop. The officer\u2019s testimony was that he did not know defendant was operating the vehicle until after he stopped it, but did suspect that it was the same vehicle, although there was a \u201ctheoretical probability\u201d otherwise. In addition, the sergeant\u2019s testimony was unclear as to when he asked for defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license since he testified that it was immediately prior to his placing her in the back seat of his cruiser, but also indicated that he made a determination to the effect that she was not under the influence of alcohol prior to placing her in the cruiser. In any event, the evidence permits a conclusion only that the sergeant did not have sufficient facts to provide him with a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was operating a vehicle while under the influence, or committing any other traffic offense, at the time he stopped her. In other words, at the time of the investigative stop by the sergeant, he did not have a reasonable suspicion based on the objective facts that the operator of the vehicle (whoever it was) was engaged in any type of activity prohibited by law, operating a motor vehicle under the influence, violating a traffic law, or violating any other law. The assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the assignment of error is sustained, the judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court with instructions to sustain the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded with instructions.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b232-8\">McCormac and Martin, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b232-9\">William J.
