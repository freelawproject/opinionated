The court\u2019s reliance on <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mutual [Automobile] Insurance Co., </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 431 [23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555] and <em>Wood v.

Senig, cross-appeal in case Nos. 91AP-1416 and 91AP-1425, respectively. Plaintiffs raise a single assignment of error, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in holding that the decedent\u2019s grandchildren are not legally entitled to recover under the wrongful death statute, and therefore, are not entitled to uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Inasmuch as these appeals have been consolidated <em>sua sponte </em>by this court, we will decide them together in a single opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">John Senig, the father of plaintiffs Michael and James Senig, who are brothers, was killed in an automobile accident caused by the negligence of an uninsured motorist. At the time of the accident, decedent was not residing with either plaintiff and had uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage with United Ohio Insurance Company (\u201cUnited Ohio\u201d) for $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence. Decedent\u2019s widow, Helen Senig, was named the executor of his estate, to which United Ohio paid $88,500 in damages pursuant to decedent\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage. Plaintiffs each received $4,454.19 from the probate court\u2019s distribution of this insurance award.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Plaintiffs James and Michael Senig, individually and in their capacity as guardians for their minor children, filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that they and their minor children could each claim damages for the wrongful death of decedent under their respective insurance policies. Plaintiff James Senig had an automobile insurance policy with defendant Nationwide that provided uninsured and underinsured motorists coverage with limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per occurrence. The Nationwide policy provides that the insured is entitled to damages \u201cdue [the insured] by law from the owner or driver of an underinsured vehicle.\u201d Both of James Senig\u2019s minor children, eleven months old and three years old, are insured under his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Plaintiff Michael Senig had a similar insurance policy with defendant Lightning Rod that provided uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage with liability limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence. However, the Lightning Rod policy restricts recovery by providing that the <em>insured </em>must be the person to suffer bodily injury. Michael Senig\u2019s two minor children, nine years old and ten months old, are insured under his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted based on the authority of <em>Sexton v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 431, 23 O.O.3d 385, 433 N.E.2d 555; <em>Ross v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Sept. 27, 1990), Franklin App. No. 90AP-165, unreported, 1990 WL 140549, appeal dismissed (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 33, 584 N.E.2d 1184; and <em>Barr v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 595, 595 N.E.2d 531. Defendant Nationwide timely appealed, as did defendant Lightning Rod. Plaintiffs filed a timely cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The Supreme Court of Ohio delineated the elements for granting summary judgment in <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 273:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201cCiv. R. 56(C) specifically provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it must be determined that: (1) No genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Furthermore, the moving party has the burden of demonstrating that there remain no genuine issues of material fact, <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>By defendant Nationwide\u2019s three assignments of error and by defendant Lightning Rod\u2019s first four assignments of error, defendants raise the following determinative issue: whether the uninsured motorist coverage in defendants\u2019 respective automobile insurance policies issued to plaintiffs cover plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising out of the death of their father, who was not insured under either policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">This issue has been decided by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Sexton, supra, </em>the syllabus of which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201c1. R.C. 3937.18 provides protection for insured persons for damages for bodily injury and death, <em>inter alia, </em>which they are legally entitled to recover from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">\u201c2. An insured father is entitled to recover those damages, which he was legally obligated to pay, under his uninsured motorist coverage for the wrongful death of a minor child, even if the child was not an insured according to the terms of the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">In <em>Sexton, </em>the plaintiff claimed wrongful death damages from his insurance company as a result of his daughter\u2019s death in an automobile accident caused by an uninsured motorist. The plaintiff\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage limited recovery to an insured who had suffered bodily injury and who resided in plaintiff\u2019s household. The court found the restrictions to be contrary to R.C. 3937.18(A), which mandates that uninsured motorist coverage be offered in automobile insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The court reasoned that, to come within the meaning of the statute, four requirements must be met. First, there must be an insured. Second, the insured must be entitled to recover damages sustained because of injury or death caused by an uninsured motorist. Third, the damages must result from injury, sickness, disease or death. Fourth, the tortfeasor must be the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The court succinctly stated that the first, third, and fourth requirements had been met by the plaintiff. As for the second requirement that the insured be entitled to recover damages, the court stated that the plaintiff was legally entitled to recover damages under R.C. 2125.02, the wrongful death statute. Having found that the plaintiff came under the meaning of R.C. 3937.18, the court concluded that the limitations in plaintiff\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage were contrary to law and void, stating in <em>Sexton, supra, </em>at 434-436, 23 O.O.3d at 387-388, 433 N.E.2d at 558-560:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">\u201cAlthough the statute does not indicate who must have sustained the bodily injury, it does not specify that it be the insured. Because the statute should be construed liberally, * * * we will not add that limitation. The pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>language of the statute requires that the insured be legally entitled to recover damages because of bodily injury. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201cStatutory mandates must be complied with by insurers. The restrictions in this policy, which permit an insurer to avoid providing uninsured motorist coverage, thwart the legislative intent. Therefore, the restrictions are contrary to R.C. 3937.18 and void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Thus, the court held that the plaintiff was entitled to claim wrongful death damages under his uninsured motorist coverage despite limiting language in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">This court has repeatedly followed the principle of <em>Sexton. </em>In <em>Barr, supra, </em>the plaintiffs mother was killed in an automobile accident caused by an uninsured motorist. The plaintiffs uninsured motorist coverage restricted recovery to bodily injury suffered by an insured, and plaintiffs mother was not insured under the policy. The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendant insurance company, which we reversed. We found <em>Sexton </em>to be controlling and determined that the plaintiffs uninsured motorist policy covered the plaintiffs claim arising out of the death of his mother, despite the restriction in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Later, in <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Chivington </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 700, 595 N.E.2d 1002, the defendants\u2019 parents were killed as the result of an automobile accident caused by the negligence of an underinsured motorist. The defendants\u2019 uninsured/underinsured<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motorist policy provided that the insured could recover damages for bodily injury \u201cthat are due [the insured] by law.\u201d Because the defendants\u2019 insurance contract was not contrary to R.C. 3937.18 and was consistent with the principle of <em>Sexton, supra, </em>we reversed the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">In <em>Ross, supra, </em>we held that the sister and daughter of a decedent, who was killed in an automobile accident by an underinsured motorist, could recover damages for the wrongful death of the decedent pursuant to their underin-sured motorist coverage. Like the defendants in <em>Nationwide, supra, </em>the plaintiffs in <em>Ross </em>had uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage that provided for the insured to recover damages for bodily injury that were \u201cdue [the insured] by law.\u201d As in <em>Nationwide, </em>we reversed the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment for defendant since plaintiffs\u2019 policy was consistent with R.C. 3937.18 and <em>Sexton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>In all of these cases <em>(Barr, Nationwide </em>and Ross), we were bound by the controlling Supreme Court case, <em>Sexton, </em>because the facts were indistinguishable. However, in <em>Erie Ins. Group v. McCoy </em>(Jan. 9,1992), Franklin App. No. 91AP-631, unreported, 1992 WL 4857, we distinguished <em>Sexton, </em>as well as <em>Barr, supra, </em>and <em>Nationmde, supra. </em>Although defendants rely upon <em>Erie, </em>we find no basis upon which to distinguish the case herein from <em>Sexton, Barr </em>and <em>Nationmde. </em>Since the <em>Erie </em>court distinguished <em>Sexton, Barr </em>and <em>Nationmde, </em>it necessarily follows that this case is, likewise, distinguishable from <em>Erie.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Thus, applying the criteria set forth in <em>Sexton, </em>plaintiffs Michael and James Senig fall within R.C. 3937.18 and are entitled to uninsured motorist coverage under the Nationwide and Lightning Rod policies. First, said plaintiffs are concededly insured under their respective policies, which provide uninsured motorist coverage. Second, said plaintiffs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are legally entitled to recover for the death of their father, which was caused by the malfeasance of an uninsured motorist, pursuant to the wrongful death statute, R.C. 2125.02. Such statute provides that an action for wrongful death shall be brought \u201cfor the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse, <em>the children, </em>and the parents of the decedent * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because plaintiffs are the children of decedent, they clearly come within the scope of the statute and are entitled to recover damages for decedent\u2019s wrongful death. Third, the damages claimed by plaintiffs admittedly result from the death of their father. Also, R.C. 2125.02(A) provides that the wrongful death action is for the \u201cexclusive benefit of * * * the children * * * all of whom are rebuttably presumed to have suffered damages by reason of the wrongful death.\u201d Unless and until rebutted by defendants, the plaintiffs are presumed to have suffered damages. Finally, the tortfeasor in this case was both the owner and operator of the uninsured motor vehicle involved in the accident. Consequently, the requirements of <em>Sexton </em>have been satisfied, and plaintiffs Michael and James Senig are entitled to claim damages under their uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In sum, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment for plaintiffs Michael and James Senig. Because there remain no genuine issues of material fact and, as a matter of law, said plaintiffs are entitled to recover damages for the death of their father under their respective insurance policies, summary judgment was properly granted. Accordingly, defendant Nationwide\u2019s three assignments of error and defendant Lightning Rod\u2019s first two assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>By its third assignment of error, Lightning Rod contends that coverage should be denied because its insured did not live in the same household with the decedent, relying upon <em>Erie, supra. </em>Such contention is contrary to the holdings in <em>Sexton, supra, Barr, supra, </em>and <em>Nationwide, supra, </em>all of which were distinguished by this court in <em>Erie. </em>Here, however, we are unable to distinguish <em>Sexton, Barr, </em>or <em>Nationwide, </em>which permit no deviation from R.C. 3937.18(A) on the basis that the insured and decedent did not live together. Neither does R.C. 2125.02(A) permit such an automatic distinction between children who are rebuttably presumed to have suffered damage as a result of the wrongful death of their parent. <em>Lightning Rod\u2019s </em>third assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Defendant Lightning Rod argues that the limiting language in its policy issued to plaintiff Michael S. Senig prohibits plaintiffs\u2019 claim for uninsured motorist coverage. The limiting language to which Lightning Rod refers is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201cWe will pay damages which an insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by an insured and caused by an accident. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Lightning Rod asserts that, because decedent was not insured under the policy and the policy clearly requires an insured to suffer bodily injury in order to recover, plaintiffs may not recover. This same language and argument were rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Sexton, supra. </em>That court held such a policy restriction to be contrary to the legislative purpose of R.C. 3937.18 and unenforceable. See <em>Sexton, supra. </em>For the same reasons, we find the provision in Lightning Rod\u2019s policy issued to plaintiff Michael Senig to be void and unenforceable. Lightning Rod\u2019s fourth assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">By defendant Lightning Rod\u2019s fifth assignment of error, it contends that before plaintiff Michael Senig is entitled to collect under his uninsured motorist coverage with Lightning Rod, the limits of any other collectible insurance must have been reached. Defendant Lightning Rod argues that decedent\u2019s own uninsured motorist coverage must be exhausted before plaintiff Michael Senig may claim uninsured motorist coverage under his policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">In support of this contention, defendant Lightning Rod points to the following provision in the uninsured motorist policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">\u201cOTHER INSURANCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">\u201cIf there is other applicable similar insurance, we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits. If this policy and any other policy providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>similar insurance apply to the same accident, the maximum limit of liability under all the policies shall be the highest applicable limit of liability under any one policy. However, any insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any other collectible insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACVk\">Defendant Lightning Rod also cites the following sentence in the policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">\u201c * * * We will pay under this coverage only after the limits of liability under any applicable bodily injury liability bonds or policies have been exhausted by payment of judgments of settlements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The issue as raised by defendant Lightning Rod under this assignment of error pertains to the amount of damages and not to whether coverage exists. Because the trial court in granting summary judgment addressed the issue of liability alone, the issue of the amount of recovery is not properly before us on appeal. The limitation does not prevent coverage where the damages exceed the maximum coverage limit under the other policy but instead merely limits coverage to the extent of such excess. Accordingly, defendant Lightning Rod\u2019s fifth assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">By plaintiffs\u2019 single assignment of error, they contend that the trial court erred as a matter of law in finding that their minor children are not entitled to recover damages for the wrongful death of decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The trial court ruled that plaintiffs\u2019 minor children, although insured under plaintiffs\u2019 uninsured motorist coverage, were not entitled to recover damages for decedent\u2019s wrongful, death because they were not \u201cother next of kin\u201d within the purview of the wrongful death statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">As stated previously, plaintiffs Michael and James Senig are entitled to recover damages under their uninsured motorist coverage because they come within the ambit of R.C. 3937.18. One requirement of the statute, as explained in <em>Sexton, supra, </em>is that the claimant be entitled to recover damages for the bodily injury caused by the uninsured motorist. R.C. 2125.02 provides that an action for wrongful death shall be brought \u201cfor the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse, <em>the children, </em>and the parents of the decedent, all of whom are rebuttably presumed to have suffered damages by reason of the wrongful death, and for the exclusive benefit of the <em>other next of kin </em>of the decedent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Consequently, as children of decedent, plaintiffs James and Michael Senig are beneficiaries under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The issue presented by plaintiffs\u2019 assignment of error, however, is whether, under the circumstances herein, the grandchildren of decedent are beneficiaries under the statute. The wrongful death statute does not expressly include grandchildren. It does, however, provide that a claim may be for the \u201c * * * exclusive benefit of the <em>other next of kin </em>of the decedent.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>added.) Grandchildren are kin and may be <em>next </em>of kin in some instances, but the question is whether they are <em>next </em>of kin of their grandparents while their parents are still living. Plaintiffs contend that grandchildren qualify as \u201cother next of kin\u201d of decedent and are consequently beneficiaries under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 941, explains that \u201cnext of kin\u201d has the following meanings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">\u201c * * * (1) <em>nearest </em>blood relations according to law of consanguinity and (2) those entitled to take under statutory distribution of intestate\u2019s estates, and term is not necessarily confined to relatives by blood, but may include a relationship existing by reason of marriage * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">A standard dictionary, Random House Dictionary (2 Ed.1987 unabridged) 1296, similarly defines \u201cnext of kin\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">\u201c1. a person\u2019s nearest relative or relatives; * * * 2. <em>Law. </em>the nearest relative or relatives who share in the estate of a person who dies intestate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">In other words, ordinarily, the <em>nearest </em>relatives of a decedent are his or her \u201cnext of kin.\u201d Not all kin or relatives of a decedent are <em>\u201cnext </em>of kin,\u201d regardless of the degree of relationship. Rather, under this construction, the relatives <em>nearest </em>to decedent are the \u201cnext of kin.\u201d Thus, \u201cnext of kin\u201d includes all blood relatives of the same degree of relationship. For this purpose, the degree of relationship necessarily is determined by counting outward from the decedent rather than downward from a common ancestor.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">However, the Ohio Supreme Court has recently resolved this issue, stating in paragraph two of the syllabus<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of <em>Ramage v. Central Ohio Emergency Serv., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 97, 592 N.E.2d 828:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">\u201cPursuant to the Ohio wrongful death statute, R.C. 2125.02, other next of kin, although not presumed to have sustained damages, may recover damages for mental anguish and loss of society upon proper proof thereof, even though there is a surviving parent, spouse, or minor children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s finding precluding the grandchildren from being beneficiaries of a wrongful death claim was incorrect. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-13\">For the foregoing reasons, all of defendant Nationwide\u2019s and defendant Lightning Rod\u2019s assignments of error are overruled, plaintiffs\u2019 assignment of error is sustained, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Pleas is affirmed except as to its holding that the grandchildren are not entitled to recover under the wrongful death statute, and this cause is remanded to that court for modification of the judgment and for further proceedings in accordance with law consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b607-6\">Bowman and Petree, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-11\">. We explained the difference between uninsured motorist coverage and underinsured motorist coverage in that opinion. Since the underinsured motorist coverage is not at issue herein, we will not concern ourselves with the distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">. Whether plaintiffs' minor children are also legally entitled to recover for the wrongful death of decedent will be discussed under plaintiffs\u2019 sole assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b606-14\">. Although the syllabus refers to \"minor\" children, the statute, R.C. 2125.02(A)(1), apparently includes all children since the adjective \u201cminor\u201d does not appear in the statute except with respect to the nature of some of the compensatory damages defined in R.C. 2125.02(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
