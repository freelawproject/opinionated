On June 17, 1988, the bureau and the police conducted a \u201craid\u201d on the property. No illegal activity was discovered; however, an investigator with the bureau conducted an inspection of the premises. He found numerous violations of the motor vehicle dealers licensing laws. The investigator took photographs of the condition of the premises and submitted his report and the photographs to the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Appellant was subsequently notified that a complaint was received by the Ohio Motor Vehicle Dealers Board and that the board would consider suspension or revocation of appellant\u2019s motor vehicle dealer\u2019s license. Appellant requested a formal adjudication hearing pursuant to R.C. 119.06. At the hearing, the investigator testified for the state concerning what he had observed about appellant\u2019s premises. The investigator\u2019s photographs were also admitted by the state as evidence. Appellant\u2019s father was the sole witness to appear on appellant\u2019s behalf. Thereafter, appellant was notified of the decision to revoke his license for violations of R.C. 4517.03(C), R.C. 4517.10, Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-3-03, 4501:1-3-04 and 4501:1-3-08. Appellant thereupon filed a notice of appeal with the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The court of common pleas reviewed the record and affirmed the board\u2019s decision. Appellant now timely appeals from the judgment entry to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Appellant has failed to file a brief in accordance with App.R. 19 and App.R. 16. However, appellant is acting <em>pro se, </em>and it is \u201ca basic tenet of Ohio jurisprudence that cases should be decided on their merits.\u201d <em>Perotti v. Ferguson </em>(1983), 7 Ohio St.3d 1, 7 OBR 256, 454 N.E.2d 951. Therefore, since dismissal is not warranted in this case, this court will use its discretionary power to consider the appeal. <em>Perry v. Perry </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 318, 7 OBR 413, 455 N.E.2d 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error seems to be the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">\u201cThe Motor Vehicle Dealers Board\u2019s order revoking appellant\u2019s license was not done in accordance with the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">This assignment of error lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Appellant argues that the board improperly revoked his license because there was insufficient evidence to support its finding that appellant violated dealer licensing laws. Specifically, he argues that it was improper to base the revocation on the testimony of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles inspector. These arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">R.C. 4517.12 states in relevant part the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u201c(A) The registrar of motor vehicles shall deny the application of any person for a license as a motor vehicle dealer, motor vehicle leasing dealer, or motor vehicle auction owner and refuse to issue him the license if the registrar finds that the applicant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\"><em>(&lt; </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201c(2) Has not complied with sections 4517.01 to 4517.45 of the Revised Code * * * <em>)f</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Further, R.C. 4517.33 provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-11\">\u201cThe board may make rules governing its actions relative to the suspension and revocation of dealers\u2019 * * * licenses, * * *, and may, upon its own motion, and shall, <em>upon the verified complaint in writing of any person, </em>investigate the conduct of any licensee or permit[t]ee under sections 4517.01 to 4517.65 of the Revised Code. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-12\">&lt;&lt; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-13\">\u201cThe board may suspend or revoke any license or permit <em>if the licensee or permittee has in any manner violated the rules issued pursuant to sections 4517.01 to 4517.65 of the Revised Code, </em>or has violated section 4501.02 of the Revised Code, or has been convicted of committing a felony or violating any law that in any way relates to the selling, taxing, licensing, or regulation of sales of motor vehicles.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">The board based its revocation of appellant\u2019s license on violations of several laws relating to the sale of motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">In revoking appellant\u2019s license, the board made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-16\">\u201cOn or about September 22, 1988, a Bureau of Motor Vehicles field inspection of Respondent\u2019s dealership premises revealed that the display area did not have the required 3,500 square feet of display area of hard surface and the area was littered with debris, salvage and carcasses of animals. The report also indicated that the dealership was not separated from another business; the office had no electricity, heat, or telephone; the office was not kept in a neat and orderly fashion, was not easily accessible or open to the public and was not identified exclusively for the sale of motor vehicles. Also, the inspection revealed the records of the business were not easily accessible; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>no sign for the business was posted; and the dealer permit was not displayed; all in violation of Sections 4517.03(C) and 4517.10 of the Ohio Revised Code and Sections 4501:1-3-03, 4501:1-3-04 and 4501:1-3-08 of the Ohio Administrative Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">At the revocation hearing, the board heard testimony from the field inspector who visited appellant\u2019s dealership. The inspector testified that a survey- or\u2019s report indicated the appellant\u2019s dealership actually consisted of four adjoining properties. He further testified that upon his visit to appellant\u2019s dealership, he initially observed there was no 3,500-square-foot display area. The inspector then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">\u201c * * * There was no direct entrance onto the Kiss property itself in question here as far as the used car dealership is concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">\u201cI thought that this was a salvage yard when I first saw it, and I looked for the sign and it did . say telephone \u2014 it gave a couple of telephone numbers and the time from 10:00 to 4:00. That was all that the sign entailed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u201cI went onto the property and began taking photographs. The first thing I noticed was the overwhelming stench coming off of the property. There were bones around the locations where the dogs had been tied. There was also two rats at that location, * * * in order to get to the office door * * * you have to go across Mr. Kiss\u2019 property, the property owned by another person onto the Kiss property behind a van. When you went behind the van, this is where the dead rats were and all these bones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">\u201c * * * I observed the entrance and you couldn\u2019t walk directly into the entrance. You had to weave around one object there that appeared to be an old refrigerator or something plus other cars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">\u201cThe front door was open and I walked in. The place was piled with trash and junk of all kinds as I walked in. There was an office with 180 degrees behind me to the left, and this also was cluttered with junk. I took photographs of all of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">\u201cThere was a telephone laying <em>[sic </em>] on the floor with the receiver off. I picked it up and listened to it. I received no dial tone. I couldn\u2019t turn on any lights. There was no heating. The place was just in plain English a disaster area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-12\">\u201cI looked around for the permit. I couldn\u2019t find the permit on the walls, on top of the trash, nowhere. I did see Mrs. Kiss later and I asked her about the permit. She said she didn\u2019t keep it there because she was afraid it would get stolen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The field inspector had taken photographs of the conditions he observed, and these photographs were also admitted into evidence at the revocation hearing. Subsequently, the board found violations of R.C. 4517.03(C) and 4517.10 and Sections 4501:1-3-03, 4501:1-3-04 and 4501:1-3-08 of the Ohio Administrative Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The board\u2019s findings are adequately supported by the record in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">R.C. 4517.03(C) requires a used motor vehicle dealer to sell vehicles at an established place of business that is used exclusively for the purpose of selling motor vehicles. The evidence adduced at the hearing supported a finding that appellant was in violation of this statute. The photographs show the property was littered with salvage, debris and vehicles in various states of repair or disrepair. The inspector had difficulty contacting the dealership using the posted telephone numbers: one number was not in service and the other was answered by a \u201chello\u201d and not with the name of the business. He testified that the dealership did not appear to be open for business.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Additionally, the board found violations of Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-3-08. This code section requires the place of business to be separated from any other business or residence with a permanent physical barrier. That section also requires a minimum lot size of 3,500 square feet and \u201cadequate ground cover * * * to prevent unsightly conditions.\u201d The investigator\u2019s testimony verified by the photographs supported the board\u2019s finding that there was no barrier separating the dealership property from adjoining properties, no ground cover, and that there existed many unsightly conditions, <em>e.g., </em>overgrown weeds, trash, junk, debris, dead rats and bones for dogs to name a few.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-3-08 further provides that the permanent structure for conducting the business on the property should meet some basic requirements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The testimony and the photographs both indicate these requirements were not met. The inspector testified the building on the premises lacked both a heating system and a working telephone. He testified he had difficulty moving around in the building due to the piles of trash therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>The board also found a violation of Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-3-04,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> since appellant\u2019s business records were not maintained on the business premises for reasonable inspection. The inspector testified he could not find appellant\u2019s business records in the structure; he later found the records were kept in Mrs. Kiss\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Furthermore, Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-3-03 requires the business to have a \u201csuitable sign.\u201d The testimony showed appellant\u2019s sign to be wholly inadequate; it consisted of two incorrect telephone numbers and \u201cthe time from 10:00 to 4:00. That was all that the sign entailed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Appellant\u2019s license was also revoked for a violation of R.C. 4517.10, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201cEach dealer, * * * shall keep his license or a certified copy thereof and, in the case of a dealer, a current list of his licensed salespersons, showing the names, addresses, and serial numbers of their licenses, posted in a conspicuous place in each place of business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The investigator\u2019s testimony revealed a license was neither displayed nor was it even on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Appellant\u2019s witness corroborated most of the evidence of these violations. None of the state\u2019s relevant evidence was seriously contradicted by appellant. Any conflict in the testimony is resolved by the trier of fact. In this instance the Motor Vehicle Dealers Board was the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">A review of the record indicates the board based its decision to revoke appellant\u2019s motor vehicle dealer\u2019s license on sufficient facts supporting its finding of obvious violations of the statutes pertaining to the selling of motor vehicles. Under such circumstances, the board acted within its power when it revoked appellant\u2019s license. Thus, it can be said that the board\u2019s decision was made in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error seems to be the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-13\">\u201cThe court of common pleas erred in affirming the board\u2019s decision to revoke his license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>This assignment of error also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">Appellant argues the board\u2019s decision was not based upon reliable evidence; therefore, the court of common pleas acting in its appellate capacity could not properly have held the board\u2019s order was appropriate. This argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Pursuant to R.C. 119.12, the court of common pleas must review the entire record to determine if the administrative agency\u2019s order is supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law. <em>Haley v. Ohio State Dental Bd. </em>(1982), 7 Ohio App.3d 1, 7 OBR 1, 453 N.E.2d 1262. Appellate review of the court of common pleas decision is, in turn, limited to a determination of whether the court committed an abuse of discretion. <em>Kinney v. Dept. of Adm. Serv. </em>(1984), 14 Ohio App.3d 33, 14 OBR 37, 469 N.E.2d 1007; <em>A.G. &amp; G. Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 47 Ohio App.3d 117, 547 N.E.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\u201cIn this context, the meaning of the term \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 connotes more than an error of judgment; it implies a decision without a reasonable basis, one which is clearly wrong.\u201d <em>Angelkovski v. Buckeye Potato Chip Co. </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 159, 161-162, 11 OBR 242, 244, 463 N.E.2d 1280, 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was sufficient evidence, some of it uncontro-verted, before the trial court of obvious and longstanding violations by appellant of the statutes pertaining to the selling of motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The testimony of the field inspector verified by the photographs taken the day of his inspection show appellant\u2019s property to be overgrown with weeds and littered with debris, including salvage auto parts, bones for dogs, dead rats and vehicles in various stages of repair or disrepair, with an office that was appropriately labeled \u201ca disaster area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The court of common pleas decision that the board\u2019s order revoking appellant\u2019s license was based upon substantial, reliable and probative evidence had a <em>more </em>than \u201creasonable\u201d basis. Thus, the court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion in affirming the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b715-12\">Matia and Blackmon, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\">. Ohio Adm.Code 4501:1-3-08 provides in relevant part the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">\"There shall be a permanent structure on the .premises * * * which shall include, at minimum, windows, electric lighting, heating, a telephone in service, a desk, three chairs and a filing cabinet, all of which shall be kept in a neat and orderly fashion.
