Bryant, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b675-19\">This is an interlocutory appeal from a ruling of the Court of Common Pleas of Union County granting defendant-appellee\u2019s motion to suppress evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>allegedly obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. This appeal is brought by the state pursuant to R.C. 2945.67 and Crim.R. 12(J).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">On September 19, 1990, defendant-appellee, Todd A. Spain, was arrested pursuant to a bench warrant. He was taken to the police station by Sergeant Nicol and escorted to Lieutenant Coutts\u2019s office. When appellee arrived in Lieutenant Coutts\u2019s office, Lieutenant Coutts asked appellee, \u201cDo you know why you\u2019re here?\u201d Appellee then allegedly made an incriminating statement. The trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion to suppress that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On appeal, the state asserts one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress statements of the defendant, volunteered by the defendant after a law enforcement officer asked the defendant \u2018Do you know why you are here?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\"><em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, requires police officers to advise a suspect of his right to remain silent, his right to an attorney and his right to have an attorney appointed if he is unable to afford one before he is questioned about the crime for which he is a suspect. The <em>Miranda </em>safeguards are required when a suspect has been taken into custody and is subjected to interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">\u201cInterrogation\u201d has been defined as \u201cnot only * * * express questioning, but also * * * any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1689-1690, 64 L.Ed.2d 297, 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">It is undisputed that appellee was in custody at the time he was taken to Lieutenant Coutts\u2019s office, having been arrested on a bench warrant. Lieutenant Coutts testified that he did not read appellee his <em>Miranda </em>rights before asking him, \u201cDo you know why you\u2019re here?\u201d He testified that it was his intent to read the <em>Miranda </em>rights after appellee answered the question. He further testified that he asked appellee this question because appellee was \u201cin Municipal Court on a number of charges\u201d and he wanted to make sure appellee understood which charge he wanted to question him about.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Lieutenant Coutts testified that he did not know what the bench warrant was for, but he wanted to question appellee about the charge that is the subject of this prosecution \u2014 unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-12\">\u201cQ. What was it that you wanted to question him about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-13\">\u201cA. The unauthorized use of the motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-14\">\u201cQ. And you knew he was a suspect on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201cQ. And you knew he had been arrestedf?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">It is clear from a review of the record that Lieutenant Coutts was not asking a question normally attendant to arrest and custody when he asked appellee if he knew why he was in his office. On the contrary, Lt. Coutts admitted that it was his express intention to interrogate appellee regarding an offense for which Lt. Coutts considered appellee to be a suspect. Under these circumstances, we can only conclude that this interview was a custodial interrogation. See <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, supra. </em>Accordingly, we believe appellee was entitled to receive the <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to being questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The ruling of the Court of Common Pleas of Union County is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b677-10\">Shaw, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b677-11\">Evans, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b677-12\">Evans, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ai6\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">This case requires us to determine, based only on the facts of record, whether appellee, Todd A. Spain, was compelled to incriminate himself due to deliberately coercive or improper tactics on the part of law enforcement officials. Because I find that appellee in this ease was not subjected to \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as defined by the United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Ohio, and this court, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the trial court\u2019s granting of appellee\u2019s motion to suppress. See, <em>e.g., Arizona v. Mauro </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 520, 530-531, 107 S.Ct. 1931, 1937-1938, 95 L.Ed.2d 458, 468-469; <em>Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 291, 299, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 1688-1689, 64 L.Ed.2d 297, 306-307; <em>State v. Perry </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 256, 262, 43 O.O.2d 434, 438, 237 N.E.2d 891, 895; <em>In re Potts </em>(Aug. 17, 1978), Allen App. No. 1-78-15, unreported, at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-14\">The court in <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, set out the guideline for states to follow in order to preserve criminal suspects\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights to avoid coerced self-incrimination. <em>Miranda </em>mandates that all individuals who are taken into official custody must be advised of their constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and be given the chance to voluntarily waive those rights before being interrogated about suspected misbehavior. Thus, law enforcement officials will ensure that statements made by suspects are voluntary and uncoerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Although the <em>Miranda </em>court suggested that the failure to administer the warnings would create a presumption of coercion when a suspect is in police custody, the court later refused to read <em>Miranda </em>so restrictively, stating,</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\u201cWe must conclude that, absent deliberately coercive or improper tactics in obtaining the initial statement, the mere fact that a suspect has made an unwarned admission does not warrant a presumption of compulsion.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Elstad </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 298, 314, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 1296, 84 L.Ed.2d 222, 235. Indeed, as stated by the <em>Miranda </em>court, \u201cConfessions remain a proper element in law enforcement * * *. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment * * *, [and] [a]ny statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The prosecution in this case conceded, and with this concession I agree, that appellee was \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>However, I do not agree that appellee, in the given circumstances, was subjected to \u201cinterrogation\u201d which would render the statement at issue inadmissible as evidence at trial. The Supreme Court has cautioned courts against extending Miranda\u2019s protections further than originally intended:</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">\u201cIn deciding whether particular police conduct is interrogation, we must remember the purpose behind our decisions in <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards [v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378]: preventing government officials from using the coercive nature of confinement to extract confessions that would not be given in an unrestrained environment.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Mauro </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 520, 529-530, 107 S.Ct. 1931, 1937, 95 L.Ed.2d 458, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">The action of Lieutenant Coutts in this case does not undermine this purpose in any way. Appellee was seated not in an \u201cinterrogation room,\u201d but opposite the lieutenant in his private office, unfettered and unhandcuffed. No one else was present in the room. I do not find any coercive elements in this scenario which would have rendered the simple preliminary question asked of appellee a \u201cploy\u201d to \u201csubjugate the individual to the will of [an] examiner\u201d in order to elicit an incriminating response. See <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 299, 300, 100 S.Ct. at 1688-1689, 64 L.Ed.2d at 306-307 (\u201c \u2018Interrogation,\u2019 as conceptualized in the <em>Miranda </em>opinion, must reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.\u201d). See, also, <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 468, 86 S.Ct. at 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d at 720; <em>Minnesota v. Murphy </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 420, 433, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 1145, 79 L.Ed.2d 409, 423 (\u201cthe coercion inherent in custodial interrogation derives in large measure from an interrogator\u2019s insinuations that the interrogation will continue until a confession is obtained\u201d). Furthermore, I see no evidence even of \u201csubtle compulsion,\u201d which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Supreme Court rejected as equating with coercion in <em>Innis. Id., </em>446 U.S. at 303, 100 S.Ct. at 1691, 64 L.Ed.2d at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">My research has uncovered only one published case in which the precise question, \u201cDo you know why you are here?\u201d was asked of a suspect, followed by an incriminating response which was suppressed by the trial court. In <em>People v. Lowe </em>(1980), 200 Colo. 470, 616 P.2d 118, a detective, before advising a suspect of his <em>Miranda </em>\u201crights,\u201d asked him, \u201cDo you know why you are here?\u201d However, based on the attendant facts, I am unpersuaded by the <em>Lowe </em>holding. A careful reading of <em>Lowe </em>reveals that \u201cthe detective [admittedly] <em>intended </em>to elicit an incriminating response from the defendant,\u201d and thus \u201cshould have known that his question was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the defendant.\u201d Accordingly, the Colorado court found that, <em>\u201cgiven the circumstances of this case </em>* * * [t]he trial court properly suppressed the defendant\u2019s response to this question.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id., </em>200 Colo, at 475, 616 P.2d at 122 (citing <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 302, 100 S.Ct. at 1690, 64 L.Ed.2d at 308) (\u201csince the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">I find that other cases, based on their facts and rationale, <em>i.e., </em>their substance, rather than the mere form of a question buried in facts very unlike those in this case, are more analogous to the situation before us. See, <em>e.g., State v. Dixon </em>(1991), 25 Conn.App. 3, 9, 592 A.2d 406, 410 (Police officer\u2019s question, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d asked of defendant following his arrest, was not an \u201cinterrogation\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes; rather, question was aimed at determining nature of situation confronting police, and there was no indication that question was likely to elicit incriminatory response); <em>Robertson v. United States </em>(D.C.App.1981), 429 A.2d 192, 195 (officer\u2019s question, \u201cDo you know why I\u2019m here?\u201d asked of newly arrested suspect was not impermissible custodial interrogation, since, taken in context, it would not normally elicit an incriminating response; such question simply calls for a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Lt. Coutts testified at the suppression hearing that he had no intent to elicit an incriminating statement from appellee, asserting that he simply wanted to make sure appellee understood which of several pending charges he was to be questioned about:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">\u201cA. My intent was for the defendant, Mr. Spain, to understand why I wanted to interview him. I did not expect any type of a response that I got, an incriminating response. I expected a yes or no answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>As stated by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, \u201cWe may not assume, contrary to the evidence at the suppression hearing, that [the officer] intended to evoke an incriminating response by his statement to [the suspect].\u201d <em>Hawkins v. United States </em>(D.C.App.1983), 461 A.2d 1025, 1030, at fn. 6, certiorari denied (1984), 464 U.S. 1052, 104 S.Ct. 734, 79 L.Ed.2d 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Furthermore, I agree with appellant that the question posed to appellee was in the nature of a \u201croutine formality,\u201d similar to asking a suspect in custody whether he understands the charges against him. See <em>State v. White </em>(Me. 1983), 460 A.2d 1017, 1021 (suspect\u2019s \u201cblurting out\u201d of incriminating admission in response to routine \u201cpreliminary\u201d question was found to be voluntary, and not the result of official interrogation).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">I conclude that appellee\u2019s statement was given voluntarily, free of any compelling or deceptive influence. In my view, the proper action for us to take in the circumstances of this case would be to reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for a trial on the issues.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
