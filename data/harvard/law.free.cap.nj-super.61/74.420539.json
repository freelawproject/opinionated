Plaintiff moves to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">We shall first treat of plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-15\">Plaintiff argues that since an order appointing a receiver, whether under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14:1\u00bfU3 (admittedly the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>to which reference was made in the pleadings and order), or under the general equity powers of the court, is interlocutory in nature, the order <em>sub judies </em>is interlocutory and no application having been made to this court within ten days from the date of that order in accordance with <em>B. B. </em>2:2-3, the appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">We are not confronted on this motion with the academic question of whether an order appointing a receiver is an interlocutory order, but rather whether the judgment here appealed is a final judgment. It becomes necessary to consider the applicable statute under which the complaint was framed and the court acted. <em>N. J. 8. A. 14:14-3 </em>reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">\u201cAATien any corporation shall become insolvent * * * or if its business has been and is being conducted at a great loss and greatly prejudicial to the interest of its creditors or stockholders, any creditor, or any stockholder who owns at least ten per centum (10%) of the capital stock of the corporation, may, in an action, apply to the Superior Court for <em>injunctive relief and the appointment of a receiver </em>or receivers or trustees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">\u201cThe court upon such notice as it may direct, may proceed in a summary manner or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">\u201cIf it shall appear to the court that the corporation has become insolvent * * \u00ae or that its business has been and <em>is being conducted at a great loss and greatly prejudicial to the interest of its creditors or stockholders, so that its business cannot be conducted with safety to the public </em>and advantage to the stockholders, it may <em>enjoin the corporation and its officers and agents from exercising any of its privileges or franchises and from collecting or receiving any debts, or paying out, selling, assigning or transferring any of its real or personal property whatsoever, except to a receiver appointed by the court, until the court shall otherwise order.\u201d </em>(EmiAasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-11\"><em>R. 8. </em>14:14-4 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">\u201cThe court of chancery, <em>at the time of ordering the injunction, or at any time thereafter, </em>may appoint a receiver or receivers or trustees for the creditors and stockholders of the corporation. The court of chancery may remove any receiver or trustee and appoint another or others in liis place, or fill any vacancy which may occur.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>A proceeding for the statutory injunction and the consequent permissive appointment of a receiver is summary in nature. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14:14^3. <em>B. B. </em>4:85-1 <em>et seq. </em>govern the procedure for actions permitted by statute to be undertaken in a summary manner. Action is commenced by the filing of a verified complaint, <em>B. B. </em>4:85-2. No summons shall issue. Process shall be a <em>copy </em>of an order to show cause served at least ten days before the return day, in the manner required for service of summons, B. <em>B. </em>4:85-3. The defendants shall, no later than two days before the return day, or within such time as the court may allow, serve (a) an answer, (b) an answering affidavit, or (c) a motion returnable on the return day, <em>B. B. </em>4:85-4. Upon the return day, or on such short day as the court may fix, the court shall hear the matter either on the affidavits and pleadings or as in a plenary trial and \u201crender final judgment thereon.\u201d <em>B. B. </em>4:85-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The decision of the court on the return day of the order to show cause under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14:14-3 is the final adjudication upon the requested grant of the injunction \u2014 the primary relief sought. All that remains to be accomplished is a liquidation of the corporate assets, distribution to creditors and distribution of any surplus to the stockholders. If such surplus be sufficient, however, to warrant resumption of the corporate business or if sufficient additional capital can be obtained for that purpose, the court may permit such resumption of business; otherwise, the court may \u201cmake a judgment dissolving the corporation and declaring its charter forfeited and void.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14:14r-10. A receiver is appointed to accomplish the liquidation of assets and the distribution of the proceeds thereof \u2014 a means to carry the judgment into effect. These proceedings under the statute are in the nature of \u201can equitable <em>quo warranto </em>designed to destroy the corporate existence and not to preserve it.\u201d <em>Smith v. Washington Casualty Ins. Co., </em>110 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>122 <em>(Ch. </em>1932). A judgment which grants the injunction and appoints a receiver is no less final because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>some future orders may possibly become necessary to carry the judgment into effect. See <em>In re Caruso\u2019s Will, </em>18 <em>N. J. 26, </em>32 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In <em>Pierce v. Old Dominion Copper Mining &amp; Smelting Co., </em>67 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>399, 414 <em>(Ch. </em>1904) the court held that an order granting the statutory injunction was a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Plaintiff argues, however, that on appeal the Court of Errors and Appeals rejected this conclusion in the following language, <em>Pierce v. Old Dominion Copper Mining &amp; Smelting Co., </em>74 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>450, 451 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1908):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">\u201cWe concur in the views expressed by the learned Vice Chancellor so far as they are pertinent to the questions raised by the present appeal, and the decree under review should therefore be affirmed, with eosts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">He reasons that the court inferentially approved the conclusion in <em>Franklin Electric Light Co. v. Fort Wayne Electric Corp., </em>58 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>543 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1899), in which the court held that the appointment of a <em>statutory receiver </em>was an interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">It is first to be noted that the sole question before the court in <em>Pierce, </em>as reported in 67 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>399, was an application for an interlocutory injunction, 67 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>418. Second, the appeal concerned in 74 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>450 was not from the order denying the preliminary injunction treated of in 67 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>399, but from the denial of a final injunction under the general equity powers of the court after a final hearing, <em>Pierce v. Old Dominion Copper Mining &amp; Smelting Co., </em>72 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>595 <em>(Ch. </em>1907), and cannot be said to have any bearing on the conclusions involving the statutory proceeding. Nor, as pointed out in <em>Pierce, </em>67 <em>N. J. Eq., </em>at <em>page </em>419, does <em>Franklin Electric Light Co. v. Fort Wayne Electric Corp., supra, </em>conflict with the earliest <em>Pierce </em>case. In <em>Franlclin </em>there was involved an order granting a <em>statutory injunction and the appoint</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>merit of a receiver. </em>The appeal was <em>only </em>from the appointment of the receiver. The court concluded the appeal was from an interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Any doubt that an adjudication of the statutory requirement for and the granting of an injunction against the exercise of corporate privileges and franchises constituted a final judgment was eliminated by Chancellor Walker in <em>Bull v. International Power Co., </em>84 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>6, 9 <em>(Ch. </em>1914), affirmed 85 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>306 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1915), where the court expressly held that the judgment was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In <em>Laredef Corporation v. Federal Seaboard Terra Cotta Corporation, </em>131 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>368 <em>(Ch. </em>1943), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\u201cThe summary proceeding on bill, answer and affidavits is a final hearing, a proceeding <em>in rem </em>which fixes the status of the corporation in respect of the exercise of corporate powers. <em>Pierce v. Old Dominion, etc., Smelting Co., supra; Bull v. International Power Co., supra; Nottebaum v. Leckie, </em>3 <em>Cir., </em>31 <em>F. 2d </em>556, <em>certiorari </em>denied <em>Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. Noxon Chemical Products Co., </em>280 <em>U. S. </em>558, 50 <em>S. Ct. </em>17, 74 <em>L. Ed. </em>613. It is \u2018a sort of an equitable <em>quo warranto </em>designed to destroy the corporate existence and not to preserve it.\u2019 <em>Smith v. Washington Casualty Ins. Co., supra </em>(110 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>122, 159 <em>A. </em>517).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\"><em>Laredef </em>was a reiteration of the conclusion in <em>Pierce, </em>67 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>399, based upon 38 additional years of practical application and administration of the statutory proceedings by the Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The primary relief sought under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14:lU-3 upon the required statutory proof, as above stated, is an injunction against \u201cthe corporation and its officers and agents from exercising any of its privileges or franchises and from collecting or receiving any debts * * The power of a court to appoint a receiver \u201cat the time of ordering the said injunction, or at any other time thereafterwards,\u201d arises only upon and incidental to the grant of that injunction. Absent an injunction against exercise of corporate privileges and franchises, based upon the required statutory finding, the court has no power to appoint a receiver. <em>Pierce v. Old </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>Dominion Copper Alining &amp; Smelting Co., </em>61 <em>N. J. Eq., </em>at <em>page </em>414.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Plaintiff argues, however, that no injunction was granted against exercise of corporate privileges and franchises in the case <em>mb judice, </em>and that the appointment of the statutory receiver here is therefore an interlocutory judicial action. Such reasoning is clearly fallacious. No receiver can be appointed under the statute except as incidental to a final judgment granting an injunction. To follow plaintiff\u2019s reasoning to its logical conclusion would lead to this anomalous result: Since a statutory receiver can be appointed only contemporaneously with or after entry of a final judgment granting the injunction, if the jurisdictional requisite, t. <em>e., </em>injunctive relief, is not granted, the order is transmuted from a final judgment to an interlocutory order. The appeal here, although in effect from an order appointing a receiver, is as the notice of appeal describes it, from the \u201cPinal Judgment * * * entitled Order Appointing Statutory Receiver.\u201d It is an attack upon the judgment (order) for failure of the court to make the statutorily required precedent finding \u201c* * * that its [Harmyl Inn, Inc.] business has been and is being conducted at a great loss and greatly prejudicial to the interest of its creditors or stockholders, so that its business cannot be conducted with safety to the public and advantage to the stockholders,\u201d <em>Kron v. Trenton Automotive Collateral Co., </em>96 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>162 <em>(Ch. </em>1924), and the failure or refusal of the court to grant an injunction against an exercise of corporate privileges and franchises.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Further, the receiver is vested with all of the corporate privileges, franchises and property. He may \u201cpledge, sell, assign, transfer, convey and otherwise deal with [the] real and personal property, franchises, rights, privileges, credits and effects\u201d of the corporation. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14:14-9. The result of the order appealed from is to clothe the receiver with all of the powers required to implement an injunction against exercise of corporate privileges and franchises based upon the precedent required statutory finding. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>conceivable that tbe receiver here appointed could completely liquidate the corporate assets without the above essential jurisdictional finding and injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The effect of the appointment of a statutory receiver was the complete crippling of the exercise of corporate functions by the stockholders, officers and directors of the corporation. Whether the failure to grant the injunction against the exercise of corporate privileges and franchises was intentional or inadvertent, the appointment of a \u201cstatutory\u201d receiver, to all intents and purposes,' attained the same practical objective as such an injunction would have attained. It is, in effect, a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The court deleted from the form of order submitted by plaintiff the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201cIt is further Ordered that all creditors, mortgagees, lien holders and stockholders show cause before this Court on the day of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-7\">, 1959, at 10 o\u2019clock in the forenoon, or as soon thereafter as counsel can be hehrd, at the Court House, Camden, New Jersey, why the aforementioned Receiver should not be continued, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">This is further indicative of an intent that the judgment be final. The order purports to be a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">We hold, therefore, that the order, insofar as it purports to be bottomed upon <em>N. J. S. \u00c1. </em>14:14-3 is a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">We shall next consider the judgment insofar as it purports to appoint a \u201cstatutory\u201d receiver. As above noted, absent the required finding of fact and an injunction against the exercise of corporate privileges and franchises, the court is without power to appoint a receiver under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14:14^3. <em>Pierce v. Old Dominion Copper Mining &amp; Smelting Co., </em>67 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>399, <em>supra. </em>The order, failing to contain the essential injunction, is fatally defective and is therefore void.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">In any event, even if we were to conclude for the purposes of this opinion alone that the omission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>injunction from the order was inadvertent, plaintiff failed to prove that defendant's business was \u201cbeing conducted at a great loss and greatly prejudicial to the interest of its creditors or stockholders, so that its business cannot be conducted with safety to the public and advantage to the stockholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Although there was proof that the defendant, from the inception of its business on about July 4, 1958 to the close of business for the winter in October 1958, sustained an operating loss, the business was operated from its reopening in April 1959 to July 1959 at a profit of some $3,200. It should be noted parenthetically that plaintiff was in complete charge of the management of the business from July 4, 1958 at least to August 31, 1958. The defendant has, in addition, from April 1959 to July 1959 paid some $3,000 on account of its indebtedness; paid for the installation o\u00a3 a heating system in the tavern owned by it; promptly paid current bills; and paid current taxes and license fees. Its two principal creditors and its two suppliers of merchandise are satisfied to continue to advance credit. The agent of the receiver who had operated the business from July 10, 1959 to July 20, 1959 considered the business sound and profitable. Plaintiff was, in any event, not entitled to an injunction against the exercise of corporate privileges and franchises.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">TII.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Plaintiff argues that the court did not err in appointing a receiver under its general equity powers, asserting that the allegations of the complaint and the demand for relief were sufficiently broad to justify such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">The complaint contains no averment of fact which, if proved, would entitle plaintiff to the appointment of a general equity receiver. The factual allegations and the demand for relief in the complaint are in the classical form of complaints seeking relief under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14:14-3. There is no intimation that plaintiff was seeking redress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>under the general equity power of the court. The complaint proper \u201casks this court to appoint a Receiver under the provisions of the statute * * Of the five paragraphs of the demand for relief the first three are couched in language extensively paraphrasing <em>N. J.. S. A. </em>14:14-3 and the last two seek to implement the relief demanded by the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The order to show cause described the application as for \u201ca judgment * * * that the business of defendant corporation has been and is being conducted at a great loss and greatly prejudicial to the interest of plaintiff, creditors and stockholders * * and \u201cinjunction * * * pursuant to the statutes of the State of New Jersey * * *\u201d and the appointment of \u201cthe Custodial Receiver\u201d as a \u201cpermanent Receiver under the provisions of the statute * * The'order appealed from recites in the preamble that the order to show cause concerned the appointment of \u201ca permanent receiver under the statute.\u201d That plaintiff\u2019s counsel contemplated that the recourse sought in the complaint was concerned solely with <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14:14h-3 is demonstrated by the argument on the return day where he admitted that the question of the appointment of a general equity receiver came up \u201cbecause of the answering affidavits and if necessary I ask leave to amend to add the paragraph about dissension and mismanagement.\u201d Uo leave was granted to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Plaintiff argues that his demand for \u201csuch other and further relief as may be necessary\u201d is sufficient to entitle him to the appointment of an equity receiver, citing <em>Freidus v. Kaufman, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>601 (Ch. 1955), affirmed 36 <em>N. J. Super. </em>321 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955). It should be noted that in <em>Freidus, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>612, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">\u201cThe relief sought in the complaint and the above-quoted section of the order to show cause are sufficiently broad to warrant the appointment of a custodial receiver. It would seem, therefore, that in the public interest and for the proper protection of the stock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>holders, creditors and others who might do business with the defendant corporation, and the protection of the <em>res </em>here involved, there is a necessity for the present judicial intervention of this court, at least under its general Chancery powers, to appoint a custodial receiver and to grant such other relief as may be necessary, <em>pendente lite, </em>in order to prevent probable immediate, substantial and irreparable injury, loss or damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><em>Freidus </em>is not apposite to the factual allegations of the complaint and the demand for relief in the matter <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\"> The objectives of pleading, although simplified since 1948, remain the same as at common law. The objective of pleadings is to get to issues where one party asserts the affirmative and the other the negative on questions of law and fact and continues as heretofore but in \u201csimple, concise and direct\u201d language. <em>Grobart v. Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures, 2 N. J. </em>136, 150 (1949). Plaintiff cannot extend the scope of his pleadings by the filing of affidavits in answer to those filed by defendant. See <em>Grobart v. Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The demand for \u201cother and further relief\u201d has reference to relief incidental to the primary relief sought, <em>i. e., </em>an injunction and the appointment of a receiver under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>14:14-3 and not to a separate cause of action not speciScally pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The appointment of a general equity receiver of a corporation is only a means to an end. It is not the end in and of itself. <em>Orshefsky v. Mechanics Trust Co. of New Jersey, </em>20 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>527 <em>(Ch. </em>1936). Such receivers are appointed as ancillary or incidental to some other relief sought, and do not become vested with title to corporate assets. They are <em>pendente lite </em>appointees. <em>Smith v. Washington Casualty Ins. Co., </em>110 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>122, <em>supra; </em>45 <em>Am. Jur., Receivers </em>\u00a7 28, <em>p. </em>31; 75 <em>C. J. S., Receivers </em>\u00a7 5, <em>p. </em>662.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The appointment of a general equity receiver was not within the allegations or demand for relief, or appropriate thereto, as stated in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">^Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
