Memorandum: Upon remittitur of this case from the Court of Appeals, we consider those contentions previously raised by defendant but not decided by us <em>(see, People v Paul, </em>174 AD2d 996, <em>revd </em>79 NY2d 970). We conclude that the verdict finding defendant guilty of third degree sexual abuse is supported by sufficient evidence and is not against the weight of the evidence <em>(People v Bleakley, </em>69 NY2d 490, 495). Further, the court did not err in denying a hearing on defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct. There was no showing that the victim had been told not to speak with defendant\u2019s investigator, and we cannot conclude that the prosecutor interfered with defendant\u2019s pretrial investigation. (Appeal from Judgment of Ontario County Court, Reed, J. \u2014 Sexual Abuse, 3rd Degree.) Present \u2014 Den-man, P. J., Callahan, Balio and Lawton, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
