United States, 65 Cust.Ct. 697, 314 F.Supp. 784, R.D. 11718 (1970), wherein the trial judge upheld dumping duty appraisements on fourteen entries of portland gray cement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> exported by Fabrica Dominicana de Cemento C, por A. in the Dominican Republic during the period between October 25, 1962 and March 25, 1963, and entered at the port of San Juan, Puerto Rico.

The said Commission, after such investigation as it deems necessary, shall notify the Secretary of its determination, and, if that determination is in the affirmative, the Secretary shall make public a notice (hereinafter in this Act called a \u201cfinding\u201d) of his determination and the determination of the said Commission. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aeb\">Section 201(c) of the Antidumping Act of 1921, as amended (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (c)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-20\">(c) The Secretary, upon determining whether foreign merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than its fair value, and the United States Tariff Commission, upon making its determination under subsection (a) of this section, shall each publish such determination in the Federal Register, with a statement of the reasons therefor, whether such determination is in the affirmative or in the negative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-21\">The \u201crecord\u201d is entirely documentary and consists of certified copies of papers filed with the United States Tariff Commission during its investigation, and the Commission\u2019s \u201cDetermination of Likelihood of Injury\u201d (TC Publication 87, April 19, 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-22\">The \u201coffici\u00e1l record\u201d before the Commission discloses that:</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-23\">On January 21, 1963, the Commission was advised by the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury that portland cement, other than white, nonstaining Portland cement, from the Dominican Republic was being or was likely to be sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of the Anti-dumping Act of 1921, as amended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-24\">On January 25, 1963 the Commission issued a notice that it had instituted an investigation pursuant to section 201(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>of the Antidumping Act \u201cto determine whether an industry in the United States is being or is likely to be injured, or is prevented from being established, by reason of the importation of such merchandise into the United States\u201d. Such notice was published in the Federal Register. 28 F.R. 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">On April 19, 1963, the Commission issued a determination (Chairman Dorfman dissenting) \u201cthat an industry in the United States is likely to be injured by reason of the importation of portland cement, other than white, nonstaining Portland cement, from the Dominican Republic, sold at less than fair value within the meaning of the Antidumping Act, 1921, as amended\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As required by section 201(c) of the Antidumping Act of 1921 (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c)), the majority and minority determinations of the Commission were followed by a statement of reasons therefor. T.C. Publication 87, <em>supra; </em>28 F.R. 4047.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">The views stated by the majority of the Commission are quoted <em>in extenso, </em>and provide a helpful factual background :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-7\">The imports of portland cement from the Dominican Republic sold at less than fair value were entered largely at the port of New York. The imports entered at that port were marketed almost exclusively in the metropolitan area of New York City. For purposes of this determination this area constitutes a \u201ccompetitive market area.\u201d The domestic plants that have historically supplied portland cement in this competitive area and in recent years have sold substantial quantities of cement there are considered to constitute \u201can industry\u201d for the purposes of the Antidumping Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-8\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-9\">The Dominican producer has the capacity to sell considerably increased quantities o.f portland cement in the United States and has sufficient motivation to do so. In recent years the Dominican market has provided an outlet sufficient to take only about half of the potential production of that country\u2019s cement plant. Even with substantial exports, it has generally operated, with considerable excess capacity. Through a form of price discimination [sic] \u2014 i. e., through sales at prices below those charged in the home market \u2014 but at prices sufficiently high to cover out-of-pocket costs and to make a positive contribution to net return, the Dominican producer can achieve more complete utilization of plant capacity and a lowering of average unit costs. His inducement to attain a level of output approaching full capacity therefore is strong. Consequently, the very substantial market in the New York metropolitan area constitutes a continuing and attractive lure for the Dominican management seeking to expand production and reduce costs. Indeed, the instant case represents the second occasion in which the Treasury Department has advised the Commission that portland cement from the Dominican Republic was being sold in the United States at less than .fair value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-11\">Somewhat comparable circumstances cause the domestic producers of cement which customarily supply the New York metropolitan market to be vulnerable to competition from imports sold in the United States at less than fair value. In recent years producers supplying this market have generally operated at about 70 percent of capacity. Not only do sales of imported cement at less than fair value tend to repress prices in that marketing area but it is also difficult for domestic producers to compete therewith inasmuch as the price is based not on lower costs but on discrimination. Domestic manufacturers, moreover, are precluded from making as complete use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>of their productive facilities as they would be able to do in the absence of such competition. The injury that is likely to be sustained thereby would be reflected in continuing market instability and higher production costs. Because of both legal and economic restraints, however, domestic producers would be unable to increase volume by resort to the same kind of price discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-4\">Little has occurred in recent months to alter the situation that has twice given rise to sales in the United States of Dominican portland cement at less than fair value. , The capacity and incentive for making such shipments remain. Domestic producers will be no less vulnerable in the future than they have been to date. In the opinion of the Commission, therefore, the port-land cement industry serving the New York metropolitan market is likely to be injured by reason of importation of such cement sold in the United States at less than fair value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">Appellants\u2019 sole claim is that the Tariff Commission\u2019s \u201cinjury determination\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is invalid. Such claim is advanced on the theory that in the absence of a valid injury determination by the Commission, there can be no valid dumping duty appraisement. Cf. United States v. Central Vermont Railway Co., 17 CCPA 166, T.D. 43474 (1929); United States v. Tower &amp; Sons, 14 Ct.Cust.App. 421, T.D. 42058 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\">In support of their claim, appellants contend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-7\">(1) The Tariff Commission violated its statutory authority in basing its injury determination in part on the mere presence of sales at less than fair value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-10\">(2) The Tariff Commission functioned as an agency within the meaning of Administrative Procedure Act and its injury determination should be set aside as arbitrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-11\">(3) The Tariff Commission\u2019s determination, insofar as it encompasses Puerto Rican imports, constitutes excessive remedial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-12\">We shall consider appellants\u2019 contentions in the above order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-13\">(1) Appellants\u2019 argument is, -in essence, that the Commission substantially equated injury with sales at less than fair value; and consequently, the Commission\u2019s action is <em>ultra vires </em>or in excess of its delegated authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-14\">The Act requires that the Commission shall determine \u201cwhether an industry in the United States is being or is likely to be injured * * * <em>by reason of </em>the importation of [dumped] merchandise\u201d. [Emphasis added.] Thus, the statute in effect mandates the Commission to focus upon dumped imports as a cause of injury or likelihood of injury to domestic industry. Consequently, we fail to understand appellants\u2019 position that the Commission exceeded its delegated authority by considering the factor of dumped imports. Especially in the present case, where the Commission was faced with recurring or renewed dumping of portland cement by the exporter, clearly the Commission would have failed in its statutory duty had it ignored that factor in determining whether a domestic industry was injured or was likely to be injured \u201cby reason of\u201d such dumping. Hence, while the presence of dumping may not be regarded by the Commission as <em>ipso facto </em>injurious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1405\">*1405</page-number>to a domestic industry,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> such dumping nevertheless must be evaluated as a causation factor in making the finding prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">In the present case, we see no indication in the Commission\u2019s \u201cMajority Statement of Reasons\u201d that sales at less than fair value were considered <em>ipso facto </em>injurious. On the contrary, the Commission\u2019s finding of likelihood of injury (viz., \u201ccontinuing market instability\u201d and \u201chigher production costs\u201d) was based on such\u2019\u2019factors \u201cas price repression in the New York metropolitan marketing area, diminished utilization o.f productive capacity, and finally the exporter\u2019s capacity and incentive to make future sales in the United States at less than fair value.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-7\">* * * The theory of law underlying its decision, namely, that a likelihood of injury is as sufficient as an actual injury and that such factors as sales at less than fair value and capacity and incentive for making future sales, may properly be considered, is correct. * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">(2) Appellants contend that the Commission\u2019s finding \u201cis primarily founded upon the fact of recurring sales at less than fair value and is therefore arbitrary, an abuse of discretion and contrary to law\u201d. Review is sought pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1009(e) (B) (1),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which is part of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1463-9\">This court has held that \u201cthe Administrative Procedure Act is applicable to proceedings under the Antidumping Act of 1921\u201d. Elof Hansson, Inc. v. United States, 43 Cust.Ct. 627, A.R.D. 114, 178 F.Supp. 922 (1959), rev\u2019d on other grounds, United States v. Elof Hansson Inc., 296 F.2d 779, 48 CCPA 91, C.A.D. 771 (1960), cert. den. 368 U.S. 899, 82 S.Ct. 179, 7 L.Ed.2d 95 (1961); see also The Hoenig Plywood Corporation v. United States, 51 Cust.Ct. 336, R.D. 10569 (1963). Without making reference to the foregoing pertinent decisions in its brief or oral argument, appellee nevertheless insists that the Administrative Procedure Act has no applicability to our review of injury determinations of the Tariff Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-14\">Under the circumstances of this case, we do not deem it necessary to decide whether the Commission\u2019s finding may be set aside under \u00a7 1009(e) (B) (1) of the Administrative Procedure Act, since in any event we are not persuaded that such finding is arbitrary, an abuse of discretion or otherwise contrary to law. As stated <em>swpra, </em>recurring or renewed dumping of Portland cement was a causation factor which the Commission properly considered in making its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-15\">Appellant further argue that the Commission\u2019s finding is \u201clacking in any supportable evidence\u201d. Such contention overlooks the fact that a Tariff Commission injury investigation is not required to be \u201con the record\u201d, but rather is authorized to be made upon \u201csuch investigation as it [Commission] deems necessary\u201d. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(a). Much of the Commission\u2019s information may be confidential and not open to public inspection or judicial review. Under these circumstances, plainly the substantial evidence rule is inappropriate in reviewing injury determinations of the Tariff Commission. Cf. Kleberg &amp; Co., Inc. v. United States, 71 F.2d 332, 21 CCPA 110, T.D. 46446 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>(1933); but cf. City Lumber Co. et al. v. United States, 64 Cust.Ct. 826, A.R.D. 269, 311 F.Supp. 340 (1970); appeal pending. See also Metzger and Musrey, Judicial Review of Tariff Commission Actions and Proceedings, 56 Cornell L. Rev. 285, 329-330 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">(3) Finally, we consider appellants\u2019 contention that these Puerto Rican importations should be exempted from the imposition of dumping duties inasmuch as the Commission- found likelihood of injury to the Portland cement industry serving only the New York metropolitan market.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 theory is that the Tariff Commission possesses a \u201cselection of remedial action\u201d and that \u201cthe determination rendered was excessive in its application to Puerto Rican imports\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\">Appellants\u2019 theory, in our view, manifests a misconception concerning the scope of the power and duties of the Tariff Commission under the Antidumping Act. Essentially, the Commission\u2019s role under the Act is a limited one, viz: to ascertain (by such investigation as it deems necessary) whether an industry in the United States is being or likely to be injured or prevented from being established, by reason of dumping; and to notify the Secretary of the Treasury of its determination. The Commission formulates no \u201corder\u201d or \u201cdecree\u201d. Although the Commission may exercise broad discretion in the selection of methods used to find the facts called for by the statute, it clearly has no discretion to fashion antidumping remedies. In point of fact, the Commission has no authority to take any direct remedial action to restrain dumping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">While the Act mandates the taking of prescribed remedial action in the event of dumping and resultant injury to an industry in the United States, authority to take such action rests with the Secretary of the Treasury and the customs officials. Moreover, and in any event, under the Constitution the assessment of duties<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> must be uniform throughout the United States, and by statute the same duties must be assessed on merchandise imported into Puerto Rico as are required to be collected on importations into the United States. U.S.Const. Art. 1, \u00a7 8, Cl. 1; 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 739; see also 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-10\">We conclude, therefore, that when dumping duties are imposed they are applicable to importation of the affected merchandise at every port of entry, including Puerto Rico, whether or not importations of such merchandise at a particular port are causing injury to an industry in the United States. Accordingly, the dumping duty appraisements herein are valid, notwithstanding the absence of injury or likelihood of injury to the Portland cement industry in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-11\">In view of the foregoing, we agree with the determination of the trial court upholding the validity of the Tariff Commission\u2019s finding, and the appraisements under the Antidumping Act. This court hereby adopts and incorporates by reference the findings of fact made by the trial court, and concludes as matters of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-12\">1. That the Tariff Commission did not exceed the scope of its delegated authority under the Antidumping Act of 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>2. That the Commission s finding was not arbitrary, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">3. That the imposition of dumping duties on importations into Puerto Eico was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">4. That the appraisements for purposes of assessing special dumping duties under the Antidumping Act of 1921 were</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">made pursuant to a valid finding of likelihood of injury by the Tariff Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-8\">5. That the values and prices returned by the appraiser under the provisions of the Antidumping Act of 1921 were not challenged and are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-9\">The decision and judgment of the trial court are affirmed. Judgment will be entered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1460-11\">. This case is the third in a series involving dumping of portland gray cement. See City Lumber Co. et al. v.
