All elements of the action are conceded except that of dependency. The trial judge found that the deceased employee left no widow or child hut that his mother, the appellee, \u201cwas partially dependant for support upon said deceased son, who contributed regularly more than one-half of the total income of said mother,\u201d for her support.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u201cWe early held that the question of the dependency of a father and mother was <em>one of fact </em>and the finding of the trial Judge will not, therefore, he disturbed, if <em>supported by any material evidence.\u201d Sweeton </em>v. <em>Tenn. Consol. Coal Co., </em>179 Tenn. 216, 218, 164 S. W. 2d 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Is there \u201cany material evidence\u201d to support the finding of the trial judge <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The mother testified that the deceased had lived with her all his life; that he supported her \u2014 more than half; that he paid monthly payments on a house she purchased with the allotment he made her during the war and the allotment of her present husband; that her husband worked but squandered his money, only giving her $10.00 per week for groceries; that this deceased son \u201cstopped me from work and set me down\u201d; that since her son\u2019s death she had had to go back to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>The trial judge saw and heard this witness and accepted her story. This is material evidence. We are bound thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">Counsel for the appellant argues evidentiary facts as wholly rebutting the finding of the trial judge. It is not our function to weigh this evidence. The principal argument is that the support of this petitioner should be borne by her husband whose legal duty it is to support his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The right to compensation, as a dependent of a deceased employee, is a fact question of the petitioners reliance, in whole or part, for support furnished by the deceased. The existence of the right to compel her husband to support her will not affect her position as a dependent if in fact she is one. See <em>Martilla </em>v. <em>Quincy Min. Co., </em>221 Mich. 525, 191 N. W. 193, 30 A. L. R. 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">For the reasons given the judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b104-6\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
