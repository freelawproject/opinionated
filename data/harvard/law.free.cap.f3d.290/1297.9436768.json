If the district court was correct in denying the motion to intervene, this court\u2019s jurisdiction evaporates and we must dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction. If the district court erred, we retain jurisdiction and must reverse.\u201d <em>F.T.C. v. Am. Legal Distribs., Inc., </em>890 F.2d 363, 364 (11th Cir.1989). This rule only applies, however, if what the district court denied was intervention as a matter of right under section (a) of Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and not permissive intervention under section (b) of that very same rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cStanding alone, an order denying permissive intervention is neither a final decision nor an appeal-able interlocutory order because such an order does not substantially affect the movant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Meek v. Metro. Dade County, </em>985 F.2d 1471, 1476 (11th Cir.1993). Therefore, whether we have jurisdiction over the instant appeal ultimately hinges on whether the plaintiffs were seeking intervention as a matter of right or permissive intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">Recognizing this fact, the plaintiffs have asserted in their briefs that they moved in the district court for intervention as a matter of right. This contention belies their actual motion, in which they asked to intervene \u201c[p]ursuant to Rules 24(a) and 24(b).\u201d Moreover, just because they moved for intervention as a matter of right does not mean they were entitled to do so; the district court may have decided that they had no right to intervene under Rule 24(a) and treated their motion as one for permissive intervention under Rule 24(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Worlds v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Rehabilitative Servs., </em>929 F.2d 591, 595 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cIf there is no right to intervene under Rule 24(a), it is wholly discretionary with the court whether to allow intervention under Rule 24(b) and even though there is a common question of law or fact, or the requirements of Rule 24(b) are otherwise satisfied, the court may refuse to allow intervention.\u201d) (quoting 7C Charles A. Wright, et ah, Federal Practice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>Procedure \u00a7 1913, at 376-77 (2d ed.1986) (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">In order <em>for </em>a party <em>to </em>intervene as a matter of right under Rule 24(a), he must establish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-5\">(1) his application to intervene is timely; (2) he has an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action; (3) he is so situated that disposition of the action, as a practical matter, may impede or impair his ability to protect that interest; and (4) his interest is represented inadequately by the existing parties to the suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\"><em>Purcell v. BankAtlantic Fin. Corp., </em>85 F.3d 1508, 1512 (11th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Chiles v. Thornburgh, </em>865 F.2d 1197, 1213 (11th Cir.1989)). Here, the proposed in-tervenors \u2014 one black employee and two white employees \u2014 seek to intervene in the <em>Reynolds </em>litigation, because they believe their interests are not being represented. The <em>Reynolds </em>litigation, however, involves charges of racial discrimination by ALDOT against its employees. It is unclear how Manley, Davis, and Green, who are already represented demographically in the <em>Reynolds </em>litigation by either the black plaintiff class or the Adams Intervenors (an already approved group of non-black inter-venors), can claim that their interests are not being represented in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">In actuality, their alleged interests\u2014 non-race-related violations of Consent Decree I and the use of a recent reclassification study, the HayGroup study, to circumvent Consent Decree I \u2014 have little to do with the racial discrimination that was the basis of the <em>Reynolds </em>litigation. They simply believe that ALDOT has violated Consent Decree I, which the district court for the Middle District of Alabama adopted on March 16, 1994, as a partial settlement of the <em>Reynolds </em>litigation. Even if we assume that their allegations are true, they have not shown how the disposition of the <em>Reynolds </em>litigation, as a practical matter, may impede or impair their ability to seek recompense for violations of Consent Decree I. They are still free to seek any applicable legal remedies for workplace discrimination \u2014 whether it arises due to Consent Order I or for any other reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-10\">In our previous opinion in <em>Reynolds v. Roberts, </em>207 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir.2000), we emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-11\">[I]f in the future a black employee \u2014 or <em>any </em>employee, for that matter \u2014 suffers racial discrimination in the work place, the employee\u2019s remedy (if the grievance cannot be resolved) will be to seek relief in a <em>separate </em>lawsuit, brought in state or federal court. If brought in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, the suit will be assigned to a district judge under the court\u2019s random assignment system. In other words, the suit will not be made a part of the <em>Reynolds </em>litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1301 (emphasis in original). This mandate holds true in this case, even though the proposed intervenors\u2019 claims have nothing to do with racial discrimination. In fact, it holds even more saliency <em>because </em>the proposed intervenors\u2019 claims have nothing to do with racial discrimination \u2014 since racial discrimination was the focus of the <em>Reynolds </em>litigation. <em>Cf. Moore v. Tangipahoa Parish Sch. Bd., </em>625 F.2d 33, 34-35 (5th Cir.1980) (finding that a teacher had no standing to enforce a court order directing the defendant school board to use objective criteria in the selection of principals, because her interest\u2014 \u201cfreedom from arbitrary or politically-inspired employment decisions\u201d' \u2014 fell outside of the zone of interests that the order was meant to protect \u2014 namely, \u201cthe establishment and maintenance of a racially-neutral, unitary school system\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-13\">Accordingly, the proposed intervenors have no basis for intervention as a right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>and therefore, we must dismiss their appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1354-11\">. The litigation in which Manley, Davis, and Green seek to intervene is a long-standing racial discrimination class action brought by black employees and job applicants against ALDOT. The procedural history of the case can be found in our opinion in <em>Reynolds v. Roberts, </em>202 F.3d 1303, 1305-11 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">. Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-7\">Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-9\">Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers a conditional right to intervene; or (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. When a party to an action relies for ground of claim or defense upon any statute or executive order administered by a federal or state governmental officer or agency or upon any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement issued or made pursuant to the statute or executive order, the officer or agency upon timely application may be permitted to intervene in the action. In exercising its discretion the court shall consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1355-13\">.
