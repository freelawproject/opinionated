J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-11\">Libellant more than two years ago commenced her action to have her marriage decreed a nullity. A mass of testimony was taken by a commissioner; his report has mysteriously disappeared.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-12\">The commissioner reported in favor of libellant; after his report had been filed respondent obtained an order to reopen the testimony and produce some testimony tending to show knowledge on the part of libellant when she married him that he was a married man. This she in turn denied. At the first hearing, after a hasty examination of the commissioner\u2019s report, we were of the opinion that a decree should be made, in favor of libellant. The testimony taken subsequent to the rep\u00f3rt and subsequent events have not altered this conclusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-13\">We think it would be imposing an undue hardship on libellant to compel her to retake or produce her testimony. If a proper decree nullifying the marriage is presented we will sign it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-14\">Rule absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-15\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court. \u2022</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A34\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>March 14, 1904 :</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-4\"><em>John F. </em>Sullivan, with him <em>A. V Dively, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzFS\">It was the duty of the court when the testimony with the master\u2019s report thereon had been lost to refer the matter back to him for the purpose to retake the testimony, not to go ahead and decree a divorce without having before him any of the testimony that was taken before the master: Newhart v. Newhart, 8 Kulp, 288. A proceeding for a divorce is subject in the appellate court to scrutiny from beginning to end; particularly is this directed to the testimony in order that the merits or demerits of the application may on the whole be determined: Hull v. Hull, 14 Pa. Superior Ct. 520.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-5\"><em>A. W. Porter, </em>with him <em>W. P. Manley, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A4vz\">Orlady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">From the record in this case it appears that subsequent to a report by a master in favor of the libellant, an order was made to reopen the hearing so as to allow additional testimony to be taken, and when the case was finally presented to the court, a mass of testimony which had been taken by the commissioner and also his first report had mysteriously disappeared. The court had made a hasty examination of the first report; its impression in regard thereto was not changed by the subsequent testimony and a final decree was entered in favor of the libellant, from which the respondent appealed. All the recent decisions of our appellate courts require full proof of a sufficient cause for divorce, and a careful examination by the courts of all the testimony. This duty is as imperative on the courts of last resort as it is on the common pleas. It may be difficult and expensive to supply the lost evidence, but this does not relieve this court of its bounden duty to have the full record before it when a final decree is made. Of whatever drudgery the court of original jurisdiction may relieve itself, in this class of cases, by appointing an examiner, neither it nor we can escape the burden of a careful consideration of the evidence in order to ascertain whether it does in very truth establish the statutory grounds for a divorce: Middleton v. Middleton, 187 Pa. 612; Hull v. Hull, 14 Pa. Superior Ct. 620; Howe v. Howe, 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The decree entered is reversed and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
