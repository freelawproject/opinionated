It does not determine the validity or invalidity of the alleged will, or the claim of proponents to have it probated, nor reverse or affirm the order of the county court, but is for costs only. Costs are incidental to the determination of some other right or question, but here there is none.</p> <p id=\"b419-4\" pgmap=\"419\">The 21st section of Chap. 33, of the Revised Statutes, provides that \u201c in all cases of appeal from the decision of a county court in matters of probate, the costs shall be in the discretion of the appellate court; \u201d but this implies that the subject-matter of the decision appealed from shall be disposed of.</p> <p id=\"b419-5\" pgmap=\"419\">The judgment for costs only is inappropriate to the issue made and found, and therefore erroneous.
