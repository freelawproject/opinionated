But it is no less clear that the plaintiff also during all this time had actual knowledge of its condition, and well understood that the peril of an attempt to cross it with a team was both great and imminent, \u2014 and so manifested a want of ordinary care for his own safety in voluntarily incurring it.</p> <p id=\"b421-3\" pgmap=\"421\">It is well settled that in such a case he cannot lawfully recover for the negligence of the defendant, however gross, unless it be willful \u2014 of which there is here no pretense.</p> <p id=\"b421-4\" pgmap=\"421\">If it were necessary to cite authorities for a proposition so familiar they may be found in abundance in the opinion above referred to. Any discussion of the other questions raised would be altogether unprofitable.</p> <p id=\"b421-5\" pgmap=\"421\">For the error of the circuit court in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict \u2014 which was thus against the law and the evidence \u2014 we must reverse this judgment.</p> <p id=\"b421-6\" pgmap=\"421\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
