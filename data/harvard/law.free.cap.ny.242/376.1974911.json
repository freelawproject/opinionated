Y. 187; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Duff-Gordon, </em>222 N. Y. 88; <em>Champion Spark Plug Co. </em>v. <em>Automobile Sundries Co., </em>273 Fed. Rep. 74.) The purpose .of the agreement being to create the defendant sole agent, in the absence of language expressly imposing the obligation on the defendant to take a minimum quantity, the defendant is not hable. <em>(First Nat. Bank of Litchfield </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>219 N. Y. 312; <em>Poel </em>v. <em>Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co. of N. Y., </em>216 N. Y. 310; <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>52 N. Y. 53.) The expression <em>\u201c </em>To be taken each year as required \u201d is not to be construed as an obligation to take a minimum quantity. <em>(Schlegel Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Cooper\u2019s Glue Factory, </em>231 N. Y. 459; <em>Vellie Motor Car Co. </em>v. <em>Kopmeier, </em>194 Fed.

Rosenschein </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arq\">The contract as a whole is <em>\u201c </em>instinct with an obligation \u201d on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>of the defendant not merely to be an agent of the seller, but to purchase the minimum quantities per year. <em>(Hargraves </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>137 App. Div. 695; <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>211 N. Y. 187; <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>Pincus, </em>191 N. Y. 377; <em>Dixie </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>168 App. Div. 337; <em>Fellows </em>v. <em>Fairbanks, </em>205 App. Div. 271; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Duff-Gordun, </em>322 N. Y. 88; <em>Edison El. Ill. Co. </em>v. <em>Thacher, </em>229 N. Y. 172.) The contract in so many words provides for the purchase by the defendant of the quantities of marble stated. <em>(Moran </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>211 N. Y. 196.) The provision for exclusive agency does not impair the obligation to purchase. <em>(St. Regis Paper Co. </em>v. <em>Hubbs, </em>235 N. Y. 30; <em>Champion Spark Plug Co. </em>v. <em>Automobile Sundries Co., </em>273 Fed. Rep. 74.) The provision for cancellation in the event of defendant\u2019s default does not destroy plaintiff\u2019s right to an action for damages. <em>(Bernard </em>v. <em>Golden Date Mfg. Co., </em>187 App. Div. 542; 231 N. Y. 591; <em>White Furnace Co. </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>131 App. Div. 559; <em>Bezer </em>v. <em>Hall Signal Co., </em>22 App. Div. 489; <em>Fairchild </em>v. <em>City &amp; County Contract Co., </em>153 App. Div. 277; <em>Eyers v.

He, therefore, demands from the defendant $40,000 for refusal and failure to take and pay for during a period of years a certain grade of marble known as jura yellow. The defendant, appellant, construes the contract as one of agency with no obligation to purchase the quantities stated therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The motion upon the pleadings to dismiss the complaint brings up for consideration the meaning of this contract. It is, therefore, necessary to set forth the contract in full, to determine what the parties intended by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>\u201c </em>New York, <em>Nov. 25th, </em>1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u201c Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"AqV\"><em>\u201c </em>Between</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u201c Dr. Kaempfer &amp; Company, Gliesmarode-Braunschweig, Germany</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u201c and</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u201c Tompkins-Kiel Marble Company, New York City, N.

Sudlo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">There would, of course, be no appeal and no dissents in the Appellate Division unless there were forceful reasons to sustain both contentions. Our decision, therefore, that the contract is one of agency means solely that the reasons for this view appear the more convincing to us. The plaintiff\u2019s assignor, Dr. Kaempfer &amp; Co., appointed the defendant \u201c sole sales agents of their Jura Yellow Light and Jura Yellow Dark in the United States, Dominion of Canada and Cuba.\u201d The contract is for a period of five years with the privilege of renewal for an additional five years. The agreement does more than specify the quantity which is to be taken each year; it refers to the quantity each year \u201c as required.\u201d In the event that the number of cubic meters specified is not taken in any one particular year, the other party has the right to cancel the contract. The defendant was also given the exclusive sale of this product in the territory mentioned. All these facts indicate in our judgment that the defendant was constituted sales agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>of the Dr. Kaempfer &amp; Co., with the right to take specified amounts of marble during any one of the five years, with the privilege of exclusive sale within their territory. The Kaempfer Co. had the right to cancel the agency in case a sufficient amount of marble was not taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">This meaning of the agreement seems to us more reasonable than to suppose that the defendant absolutely bound itself for a period of five years to take the increasing number of cubic meters specified for delivery each year, With the privilege of renewal for five years longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The orders below should be reversed, with costs in all lourts, and motion granted, with costs and ten dollars costs of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The question certified should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">His cock, Ch. J., Cardozo, Pound, McLaughlin, Andrews and Lehman, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
