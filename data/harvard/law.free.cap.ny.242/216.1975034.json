Van Thun, Jr., </em>and <em>Harold J.

The trial court also erred in refusing to charge the jury as requested by the defendant that the jury cannot consider, in arriving at a determination of the claim of the plaintiff in this action, that other fires at other times had occurred in the cemetery grounds. <em>(Wooster </em>v. <em>Broadway &amp; Seventh Avenue R. R. Co., </em>72 Hun, 197; <em>Zucker </em>v. <em>Whitridge, </em>205 N. Y. 50; <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Syracuse, B. &amp; N. Y. R. R. Co., </em>205 N. Y. 226; <em>Flannagan </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>211 App. Div. 694; <em>Warner </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., </em>44 N. Y. 465; <em>Senecal </em>v. <em>Thousand Islands Steamship Co., </em>79 Hun, 574; <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>L. I. R. R. Co., </em>129 App. Div. 415; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Ins.

Such incompetent and irrelevant testimony was clearly harmful to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ant\u2019s case; and the refusal by the trial court to charge as requested by the defendant was also harmful to the defendant\u2019s case. The admission of such testimony and the refusal to charge had a natural tendency to mislead the jury and impair the fairness of the trial. <em>(Engel </em>v. <em>United Traction Co., </em>203 N. Y. 321; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Rosemond, </em>238 N. Y. 356; <em>Hanrahan </em>v. <em>N. Y. Edison Co., </em>238 N. Y. 194.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-5\"><em>Sidney A.

Y., O. &amp; W. R. R. Co., </em>209 App. Div. 211; 239 N. Y. 507.) Even if the rulings were error, they are not substantial and defendant was not harmed. (Civ. Pr. Act, \u00a7 106; <em>Post </em>v. <em>Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., </em>195 N. Y. 62.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b256-6\">Pound, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2n\">The action was brought to recover damages for the destruction of a building and contents owned by plaintiff adjoining the hay fields in defendant\u2019s cemetery, by means of a grass fire alleged to have been started in the cemetery grounds on January 6, 1920, and negligently permitted to escape to the premises of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The question of negligence was tried out before a jury which found for plaintiff. The evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict for the plaintiff although the defendant denied that the fire started on its land. The question of damages was then tried out before a referee who reported the damages at $29,718. Final judgment was thereupon entered. The Appellate Division affirmed by a divided court.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The court received over objection and exception evidence, not of prior negligent fires on defendant\u2019s property . which would have been inadmissible as tending to show a custom of negligence <em>(Zucker </em>v. <em>Whitridge, </em>205 N. Y. 50, 60), but of prior fires, not negligent, sometimes very late in the fall and in the early spring, which tended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>establish nothing relative to the fire of January 6, 1920. This was error. At the same time it might be urged that the reception of the evidence was unsubstantial and not reversible error as the whole matter of the earlier fires was gone into and it was fairly well established that the burning over of the grass lot in January had no relation to the customary operations of the defendant. The trial justice might have so instructed the jury. On the contrary, the following appears on the record (fol. 691-2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">\u201c Mr. Van Thun: The jury cannot consider, in arriving at a determination of the claim of the plaintiff in this action, that other fires at other times had occurred in the cemetery ground, that any such testimony in the case would have no bearing on the question in issue here, namely, whether on January 6th, 1920, a fire was negligently started by the defendant in the part of the cemetery immediately adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s property and communicated thereto, or that the defendant negligently omitted to watch, tend and control a fire and thereby prevent its spreading to the plaintiff\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201c The Court: The question whether this fire was negligently started, or whether it was allowed to spread through negligence of the defendant, that is the sole question for you to determine in this case. Other than that I refuse to charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\"><em>\u201c </em>Mr. Van Thun: Your Honor refuses to charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court: In your words, yes. In your words I refuse to charge it, other than as amended by my statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The jury was thus permitted to consider the fact that other fires at other times had occurred on the cemetery grounds as bearing on the question whether on January 6, 1920, defendant negligently started a fire on its property or negligently permitted the fire to spread to plaintiff\u2019s property. As there was no direct evidence as to the manner in which the fire of January 6 was started <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the error was vital. That because there had been periodically grass fires on the cemetery grounds there must have been a grass fire on January 6 which spread from defendant\u2019s premises to those of plaintiff is a <em>non sequitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The judgments should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Hiscock, Ch. J., McLaughlin, Crane, Andrews and Lehman, JJ., concur; Cardozo, J., absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Judgments reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
