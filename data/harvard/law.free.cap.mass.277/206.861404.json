The Commonwealth offered no evidence in support of the complaint except the chemical analysis above recited and attending circumstances from which inferences might be drawn. The defendant and his wife testified that no cream was removed from the small can. The statute (G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 19) under which the complaint was drawn, provides, in part, as follows: \u201cNo person himself or by his servant or agent shall sell, exchange or deliver or have in his custody or possession with intent so to do, or expose or offer for sale or exchange, . . . milk from which the cream or a part thereof has been removed . . . .\u201d This section also provides a penalty for its violation. At the close of the evidence the defendant requested the trial judge to rule that under G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 37, the complaint would not lie against him, as he had not been given the notice provided for in that section. The judge refused so to rule and found the defendant guilty, to which refusal the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\">The expert evidence offered by the Commonwealth, if believed, amply warranted the judge in finding the defendant guilty of the offence charged. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>210 Mass. 109, the defendant, as here, was charged with having in his possession, with intent to sell, milk from which the cream or a part thereof had been removed. \u25a0 It was held that upon the evidence, which was similar to that here presented, a verdict of guilty was warranted. The case at bar cannot be distinguished in principle from that case but is governed by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">It is the contention of the defendant that he cannot properly be convicted because he did not receive the notice required by G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 37, which provides in part that \u201cNo producer of milk shall be liable to prosecution for the reason that the milk produced by him is not of good standard quality . . . unless he shall fail to bring the milk produced by him to the legal standard for milk solids and milk fat within twenty days after written notice that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>below said standard has been sent to him by the officer taking said sample . . . .\u201d The offence charged in the present case is not the failure to produce milk of standard quality but the removal of cream therefrom. The case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Titcomb, </em>229 Mass. 14, charged the defendant with a violation of R. L. c. 56, \u00a7\u00a757 and 62, as amended by St. 1910, c. 641, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, now embodied in part in G. L. c. 94, \u00a7 37. It is apparent that \u00a7 37 refers to an entirely distinct and different offence from that set forth in \u00a7 19 of the same chapter. The purpose of the notice in \u00a7 37 was to give the producer whose milk was not of standard quality an opportunity of bringing the milk produced by him up to the required standard before rendering him liable to prosecution. Section 37, relating to the production of milk of standard quality and which requires a written notice to be given if the milk is below such standard, does not apply to a case where milk has been watered or where the cream has been removed. A difference is recognized between milk naturally deficient and milk made so by dilution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Titcomb, </em>229 Mass. 14, 16. <em>St. John </em>v. <em>New York, </em>201 U. S. 633, 637. It is obvious that \u00a7 37 has no application to \u00a7 19 which refers to a case where milk has been tampered with by adding water or any foreign substance, or from which cream has been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">\n<em>'Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
