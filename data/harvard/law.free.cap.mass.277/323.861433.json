The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was denied and she excepted. A verdict for the plaintiff resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">There was evidence of ordinary negligence on the part of the defendant, but of no other or greater culpability, so that a verdict for her should have been directed if the. plaintiff was merely her guest. <em>Massaletti </em>v. <em>Fitzroy, </em>228 Mass. 487. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>273 Mass. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">A finding more favorable to the plaintiff than that she was a guest of the defendant was not warranted. There was testimony that the defendant took her sister, the plaintiff, in an automobile from the plaintiff\u2019s home in Dorchester to Boston so that she might get $200 to lend to the defendant\u2014 the plaintiff having no other reason for going to Boston at the time and having been promised by the defendant that she would take her carefully and bring her home if she could get the money for the defendant, that the plaintiff obtained the money and turned it over to the defendant, and that as they were on their way back to Dorchester in the automobile operated by the defendant the accident occurred. The plaintiff testified that she took no promissory note from the defendant or her husband, charged no interest on the loan and fixed no date for the return of the money other than \u201cas soon as they could,\u201d and that she was not in the business of lending money, but in this instance \u201cwanted to help . . . [her] sister out.\u201d It could not have been found on this evidence that the plaintiff was a passenger for hire. She neither paid nor agreed to pay the defendant anything directly for her transportation. The defendant\u2019s undertaking to transport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>her sister was gratuitous unless the benefit derived by the defendant from the loan gave the undertaking a different character. But the loan was not made as payment for the transportation. The transportation was incidental to the loan and partook of its nature. By necessary inference from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony the loan was gratuitous and created no contractual obligation between the parties beyond the obligation of the defendant to repay the money. The evidence, like that in the case of <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Hurwitch, </em>265 Mass. 360, which governs the case at bar, was \u201cinsufficient to indicate anything more than the friendly relations or the sense of mutual obligation arising between kindred.\u201d Page 361. See also <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>231 Mass. 550, 554. In this respect the case differs from <em>Loftus </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>223 Mass. 63, <em>Lyttle </em>v. <em>Monto, </em>248 Mass. 340, <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Queen, </em>257 Mass. 515, <em>Labatte </em>v. <em>Lavallee, </em>258 Mass. 527, and <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>264 Mass. 557, 558, relied on by the plaintiff. A benefit, though measurable in money, resulting from such relations, or sense of obligation, is not hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>Judgment for defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
