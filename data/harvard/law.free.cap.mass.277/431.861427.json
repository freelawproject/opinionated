The treads of the stairs were covered with corrugated iron plates. The plaintiff had reached the next to the last step from the platform in the middle of the stairway when he slipped and fell, receiving the injury for which the action was brought. This stairway in the part where the plaintiff fell is covered by a canopy protecting it from the elements. The plaintiff looked to see what had caused his foot to slip and observed on the stair just below the platform a substance that looked like an old apple. It was \u201cblack and dirty and covered with grime.\u201d It was all flattened down and adhered to the metal stair. It was entirely dry except where the plaintiff\u2019s toe slipped on it and it had a moist mark in that spot. It looked like an apple only because it had a stem on it and was entirely flattened out. It was a little less than the size of the palm of the hand of the plaintiff, about three and one half to four inches in length, and was an irregular oval in appearance. It appeared to have been trampled upon. There was a \u201cskid mark\u201d on the apple where the plaintiff slid on it and some of the apple was on the sole of the plaintiff\u2019s left shoe near the end. The plaintiff did not trip on the stair but slipped upon the apple as described. The defendant had in its employ a porter whose duty it was to keep the stairs clean by sweeping them from time to time. This porter was on duty in the station when the accident occurred. There was no evidence that the apple had been seen on the step by any one prior to the plaintiff\u2019s fall. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant rested and the judge allowed its motion for a directed verdict to which the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">It is a matter of common knowledge that large numbers of people would be passing over these stairs on a week day at about the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. If the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>stance described had been dropped or left where it was by a person passing over the place a moment before it might have presented the appearance described. It may have been flattened by people stepping upon it before it first appeared upon the step or this result may have been caused in a moment by people passing over the stairway. Whether it was made to adhere to the metal step by the pressure of many feet or by that of a single step upon it or-even by the plaintiff himself when he slipped upon it was a matter of conjecture. The evidence did not warrant a finding that the substance on which the plaintiff slipped had been on the step so long that it should have been discovered and removed by the employee of the defendant who had the duty to keep the stairway clean. The facts of this case bring it within the authority of <em>Goddard </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>179 Mass. 52, <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Hudner, </em>213 Mass. 257, <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. Boston <em>Elevated Railway, </em>248 Mass. 362, <em>Mascary </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>258 Mass. 524, 525, <em>Bornstein </em>v. <em>R. H. White Co. </em>259 Mass. 34, and <em>Cartoof </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>262 Mass. 367, and distinguish it from cases like <em>Anjou </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>208 Mass. 273, where there was evidence that the banana peel upon which the plaintiff slipped looked as though it had been trampled upon a great deal, and <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>275 Mass. 469, in which the evidence tended to prove that when the substance causing the injury was scraped off the floor the place under it was clean while the floor around that place had dirt upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
