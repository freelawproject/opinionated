G. L. c. 152. By agreement compensation was paid the employee for incapacity for work between December 26, 1928, and February 11, 1929, resulting from an injury sustained by him in December, 1928, and was then discontinued. Thereafter, the reviewing board, affirming findings and decision of the single .member .filed October 9, 1930, found that the employee \u201chas continued to be incapacitated as a result of the injury of December 1928,\u201d and decided that \u201ccompensation shall be resumed from the date it was discontinued up to the present time, with the exception of the time he worked,\u201d and \u201ccontinue in accordance with the terms of the act.\u201d From a decree of the Superior Court entered in accordance with this finding and decision the insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The finding as to injury \u2014 the correctness of which is not questioned \u2014 was that when the employee was \u201clifting a block of ice, weighing some three hundred pounds, with the assistance of another man, the whole of the weight was put upon him when his assistant released his hold\u201d and the employee \u201csustained a bad strain, particularly of the back, chest and arms.\u201d The employee testified at the hearing before the single member that after February 11, 1929, he worked one day in February, 1929, from March 13, 1929, to January 6, 1930, from February 20, 1930, to March 1, 1930, and on March 31, 1930, at the same employment as before his injury, and that he had not worked since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">The insurer\u2019s contention is that the evidence did not warrant a finding that the employee\u2019s incapacity for work after January, 1930, if any, resulted from the injury sustained by him in December, 1928.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">We cannot say that the finding attacked finds no support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>in the evidence. On the employee\u2019s testimony as to his ability to work, a finding of incapacity during the periods after February 11, 1929, when he was not working, was warranted. There was medical evidence justifying the board\u2019s finding that the employee\u2019s incapacity was due to \u201cintercostal neuritis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">There was medical evidence also that the disease was the result of the injury sustained in December, 1928. A medical witness testified that he \u201cbelieves that . . . [the employee\u2019s] condition is the result of the strain he received,\u201d and in reply to the question whether \u201cit is witness\u2019s opinion that the injury was an adequate cause of . . . [the employee\u2019s] present condition,\u201d answered, \u201cdecidedly yes.\u201d Another medical witness testified that the \u201cstrain itself\u201d was not \u201ccleared up at any time,\u201d. that the employee \u201calways had symptoms,\u201d and that the injury was an \u201cadequate cause\u201d of the employee\u2019s condition, though it was \u201cpossible that something else could have caused\u201d it. This witness \u201cclaims that the intercostal neuritis was brought about by the strain.\u201d This testimony could have been interpreted by the board as amounting to expressions by these witnesses of reasoned opinions based upon expert knowledge and observed facts, as distinguished from mere gu\u00e9sses, as to the cause of the employee\u2019s disease. Recognition of the possibility of another cause does not wholly destroy the probative force of such evidence. The employee was not required to exclude all other possibilities. <em>Navien </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>268 Mass. 427, 431. <em>Young </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>273 Mass. 567, 570. These expressions of opinion went beyond statements that the strain might have had a causal relation to the incapacitating disease. See <em>Green\u2019s Case, </em>266 Mass. 355, 357. The weight to be given to them was for the board. <em>Carmossino\u2019s Case, </em>268 Mass. 35, 38. Nothing in the testimony of these medical witnesses necessarily vitiated their conclusions, nor were these conclusions in such conflict with facts of common knowledge that the board could not accept them as correct. See <em>Weiner </em>v. <em>D. A. Schulte, Inc. </em>275 Mass. 379, 384. The testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the employee to the work which he did after February 11, 1929, did not as matter of law preclude a finding by the board that there was a causal relation between his injury in December, 1928, and his incapacity after January, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"A_0G\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
