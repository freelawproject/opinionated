The only question argued by the defendant is that this plaintiff is barred from recovery because of her own contributory negligence. The evidence on this point need not be narrated in detail. The plaintiff was injured while as a pedestrian she was crossing a street in Boston. Whether she ought to have stopped in order to let the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle pass in front of her or whether she had a right in the exercise of reasonable judgment for her own safety to undertake to pass in front of the approaching truck, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 14, as amended, was a question of fact and could not be ruled as matter of law. The case at bar falls within the authority of cases like <em>Gauthier </em>v. <em>Quick, </em>250 Mass. 258, <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>250 Mass. 578, and <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>H. E. Shaw Co. </em>273 Mass. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Because the female plaintiff was entitled to go to the jury, the case of her husband was also rightly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
