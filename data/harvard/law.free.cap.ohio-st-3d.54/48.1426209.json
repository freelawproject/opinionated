Osborn, </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 41, 75 O.O. 2d 132, 346 N.E. 2d 141. However, the correctness of this conclusion does not make the court of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>peals\u2019 acceptance of the case on its docket a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">R.C. 2505.02 defines \u201cfinal order\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">\u201cAn order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, an order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment, or an order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The mere docketing of a case by the court of appeals does not constitute an \u201corder\u201d as described in R.C. 2505.02. Therefore, docketing the case is not a final order subject to immediate appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">FOP also argues that the court\u2019s enjoining of collective bargaining during pendency of the appeal is itself a final, appealable order because it was made in a special proceeding and affects a substantial right, citing <em>Amato </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 253, 21 O.O. 3d 158, 423 N.E. 2d 452. In <em>Amato, </em>we held that a trial court\u2019s class certification order in a class action is a final, appealable order, and that determining immediate appealability under the \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d clause of R.C. 2505.02 \u201c* * * is resolved through a balancing test. This test weighs the harm to the \u2018prompt and orderly disposition of litigation,\u2019 and the consequent waste of judicial resources, resulting from the allowance of an appeal, with the need for immediate review because appeal after final judgment is not practicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 21 O.O. 3d at 161, 423 N.E. 2d at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">FOP\u2019s argument fails this test. Nothing makes appeal to this court following the court of appeals\u2019 decision \u201cnot practicable.\u201d FOP argues that there has been too much delay already, which has deprived employees of their proper representation. Conceding this still does not make appeal \u201cnot practicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">More important, we have frequently held that denial of a motion to vacate a common pleas court\u2019s temporary restraining order or temporary injunction is not a final order under R.C. 2505.02. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>First Natl. Bank of Bellaire </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 642, 176 N.E. 567, syllabus; <em>State, ex rel. Northern Ohio Tel. Co., </em>v. <em>Winter </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St. 2d 6, 52 O.O. 2d 29, 260</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">N. E. 2d 827; <em>Forest Hills Util. Co. </em>v. <em>Whitman </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 25, 70 O.O. 2d 114, 322 N.E. 2d 646; <em>State, ex rel. Add Venture, Inc., </em>v. <em>Gillie </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 164, 16 O.O. 3d 198, 404 N.E. 2d 151. See, also, <em>State, ex rel. Tilford, </em>v. <em>Crush </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St. 3d 174, 529 N.E. 2d 1245. We find no reason to apply a different rule to injunctions issued by a court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">FOP also argues that the court of appeals had no authority to issue the temporary injunction under App. R. 7, but this argument is rebutted on the face of the rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-14\">\u201c(A) * * * A motion * * * for an order * * * granting an injunction during the pendency of an appeal may be made to the court of appeals * * *. * * * The motion * * * normally will be considered by at least two judges of the court * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-16\">Moreover, R.C. 2727.05 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-17\">\u201c* * * Upon like proof [an affidavit satisfactory to the court], an injunction also may be allowed by the supreme court or court of appeals, or by a judge of either, as a temporary remedy, during the pendency of a case on appeal in such courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-18\">R.C. 2727.03 also provides for issuance of injunctions by courts of appeals. Accordingly, the motions to certify the record and to dissolve the injunction are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>FOP\u2019s Request for a Writ of Prohibition and OCB\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"Ayd\">Motion to Intervene (Case No. 90-538)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">OCB has filed a motion to intervene under Civ. R. 24. Civ. R. 24(A) states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201cUpon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: * * * (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant\u2019s interest is adequately represented by existing parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">FOP has not objected to OCB\u2019s intervention. In <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Hamoudi </em>(1986), 29 Ohio App. 3d 350, 352, 505 N.E. 2d 1010, 1013, the Court of Appeals for Franklin County held that Civ. R. 24(A)(2) should be liberally construed to permit intervention, citing McCormac, Ohio Civil Rules Practice (1970), at 81, Section 4.36. Moreover, in <em>Schucker </em>v. <em>Metcalf </em>(Nov. 15, 1984), Franklin App. No. 84AP-548, unreported, reversed on other grounds (1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 33, 22 OBR 27, 488 N.E. 2d 210, Judge McCormac, writing for the court of appeals, permitted persons who were not public officials to intervene in a prohibition case under Civ. R. 24(A)(2). We follow this rule of liberal construction and grant OCB\u2019s motion to intervene in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Respondents argue in their motion to dismiss that a court of appeals has authority to determine its own jurisdiction, that appeal and not prohibition is the proper remedy for any error, that the relevant statutes and certain cases construing them do not reveal a total lack of jurisdiction over the case, and that R.C. 2727.05 and App. R. 7 specifically authorize the temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Many cases hold that courts of general jurisdiction have authority to determine their own jurisdiction, that appeal is an adequate remedy, and, in any case, prohibition is not an appropriate remedy to correct errors made by the court. See, <em>e.g., State, ex rel. Barbee, </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1917), 96 Ohio St. 10, 117 N.E. 13, and <em>State, ex rel. Eaton Corp., </em>v. <em>Lancaster </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 404, 409, 534 N.E. 2d 46, 52. <em>State, ex rel. Emery-Thompson Machinery &amp; Supply Co., </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1917), 96 Ohio St. 506, 118 N.E. 115, applied this holding to courts of appeals. However, in <em>State, ex rel. Adams, </em>v. <em>Gusweiler </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St. 2d 326, 59 O.O. 2d 387, 285 N.E. 2d 22, we announced an exception to this general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">\u201cIf an inferior court is without jurisdiction whatsoever to act, the availability or adequacy of a remedy of appeal to prevent the resulting injustice is immaterial to the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction by a superior court to prevent usurpation of jurisdiction by the inferior court.* * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 59 O.O. 2d at 388, 285 N.E. 2d at 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">In <em>State, ex rel. Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>v. <em>Kornowski </em>(1974), 40 Ohio St. 2d 20, 60 O.O. 2d 90, 317 N.E. 2d 920, we intimated, and reaffirmed in later cases, that the restriction on jurisdiction must also be \u201cpatent and unambiguous\u201d for a writ of prohibition to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">In <em>Osborn, supra, </em>affirming <em>State, ex rel. Mansfield Tel. Co., v. Mayer </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St. 2d 222, 34 O.O. 2d 428, 215 N.E. 2d 375, we stated that in a case of \u201cpatent and unambiguous\u201d lack of jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">\u201c* * * [A] superior court will afford an inferior court the opportunity to decide its own jurisdiction before granting an extraordinary writ * * *, but where the court, in deciding its own jurisdiction attempts to confer jurisdiction upon itself where in fact no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>jurisdiction whatsoever exists, such an improper assumption of jurisdiction is a usurpation of judicial power and any order made by a Court of Common Pleas pursuant to such a usurpation of judicial power is void and of no force or effect. * * *\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 75 O.O. 2d at 137, 346 N.E. 2d at 147.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">However, this procedure has not always been followed. For example, in the <em>Gusweiler </em>case, we did not wait for the lower court to determine its own jurisdiction. Similarly, in <em>State, ex rel. Tollis, </em>v. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Appeals </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 145, 532 N.E. 2d 727, we granted a writ of prohibition and prohibited the court of appeals from considering the appeal of a preliminary injunction before that court had determined its own jurisdiction, stating that the preliminary injunction was patently and unambiguously not a final order. Most recently, in <em>State, ex rel. Lewis, </em>v. <em>Warren Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St. 3d 249, 556 N.E. 2d 1184, we issued a writ of prohibition to prevent a court of common pleas from taking jurisdiction in proceedings to enjoin annexation <em>before </em>the court had ruled on its own jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">We find the procedural language of <em>Osborn </em>and <em>Mayer </em>irreconcilable with these latter cases. Therefore, we hold that a court considering a writ of prohibition may issue the writ in the interests of judicial economy as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">When a court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to consider a matter, a writ of prohibition will issue to prevent assumption of jurisdiction regardless of whether the lower court has ruled on the question of its jurisdiction. <em>Mayer, supra, </em>and <em>Osborn, supra, </em>are overruled to the extent that they are inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The court of common pleas based its decision on <em>Osborn, supra, </em>in which we held that the director of a state department does not have a right of appeal under R.C. 119.12 because to appeal, a party must be a \u201cperson\u201d as defined in R.C. 119.01(F), and that a state department is not a \u201cperson.\u201d Respondents argue that <em>Osborn\u2019s </em>authority has been weakened by <em>South Community, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 224, 527 N.E. 2d 864, and <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities </em>v. <em>Professionals Guild of Ohio </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St. 3d 147, 545 N.E. 2d 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">In <em>South Community, </em>we held in the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">\u201cThe State Employment Relations Board is an \u2018agency\u2019 whose adjudications are made subject to judicial review pursuant to R.C. 119.12, specifically by R.C. 4117.02(M).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">In that case, we construed restrictions on collective bargaining appeals strictly. However, we were not called on to decide the \u201cperson/party\u201d issue of <em>Osborn </em>since South Community, Inc. is a corporation, which is defined as a \u201cperson\u201d under R.C. 119.01(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">In <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd., </em>we held that a <em>county </em>mental retardation and developmental disabilities board is a body corporate and politic and thus is a \u201cperson\u201d and a \u201cparty\u201d entitled to appeal under R.C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">Although <em>South Community </em>and <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. </em>broadened rights of appeal from SERB orders, they did not overrule <em>Osborn, supra, </em>insofar as it holds that R.C. 119.12 prevents appeal by a state agency as a \u201cparty.\u201d Clearly, OCB is a state agency, a division of the Department of Administrative Services. It is not a body corporate and politic. Therefore, the court of common pleas was correct in holding that OCB had no right to appeal under R.C. 119.12 and that the court consequently had no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">We recognize that lack of jurisdiction in a trial court would not ordinarily preclude a court of appeals from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>hearing an appeal on the issue of whether the trial court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction. However, in this case, appeal to the court of appeals is also governed by R.C. 119.12, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">\u201cThe judgment of the court [of common pleas] shall be final and conclusive unless reversed, vacated, or modified on appeal. Such appeals may be taken either by the <em>party </em>or the <em>agency </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We have already determined that OCB is not a \u201cparty,\u201d as defined in R.C. 119.01(G). Neither is it an \u201cagency,\u201d as defined in R.C. 119.01(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this context, SERB is the agency. See <em>South Community, supra, </em>at 225-226, 527 N.E. 2d at 865. Therefore, like the court of common pleas, the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction under R.C. 119.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">As the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction generally, it will necessarily lack jurisdiction to issue the injunction. See <em>State, ex rel. Northern Ohio Tel. Co., </em>v. <em>Winter </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St. 2d 6, 52 O.O. 2d 29, 260 N.E. 2d 827. Accordingly, based on R.C. 119.12 and <em>Osborn, supra, </em>we hold the court of appeals has no jurisdiction to hear OCB\u2019s appeal and that lack of jurisdiction is \u201cpatent and unambiguous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The prerequisites for issuing a writ of prohibition are (1) that the respondent is about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial authority, (2) the authority is unauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ will result in injury for which no other adequate remedy exists in the ordinary course of law. <em>Tollis, supra. </em>Here, there is no doubt that all prerequisites are satisfied. The first is undisputed. The second is fulfilled by our finding of no jurisdiction, and the third is satisfied because a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction makes availability of either appeal or injunction irrelevant. <em>Gusweiler, supra; State, ex rel. Coyne, </em>v. <em>Todia </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St. 3d 232, 543 N.E. 2d 1271. Accordingly, we overrule respondents\u2019 motion to dismiss and grant a peremptory writ of prohibition, as no issue remains to be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">FOP\u2019s Request for a Writ of Mandamus (Case No. 90-539)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">Having granted FOP\u2019s request for a writ of prohibition in case No. 90-538, we nevertheless decline to issue a writ of mandamus in case No. 90-539. At the time the complaint was filed in this court, intervening respondent OCB was prevented from bargaining by the injunction of the court of appeals. In effect, our decision to grant the writ of prohibition dissolves the injunction, but we do not issue an anticipatory writ of mandamus. OCB clearly has a statutory duty to enter into collective bargaining. See R.C. 4117.14(B)(4). However, \u201c[m]andamus will not lie to remedy the anticipated nonperformance of a duly.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Home Care Pharmacy, Inc., v. Creasy </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 342, 343, 21 O.O. 3d 215, 216, 423 N.E. 2d 482, 483. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>believe that with the termination of litigation and dissolution of the injunction, OCB will follow the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Accordingly, we issue a writ of prohibition in case No. 90-538, deny the writ of mandamus in case No. 90-539, and overrule the motion to certify the record in case No. 90-537.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\n<em>Writ of prohibition allowed; writ of mandamus denied; motion to certify the record overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b110-6\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright, H.

I write separately to object to the statement by the majority that in <em>South Community, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 224, 527 N.E. 2d 864, South Community, Inc. was a corporation. In that case, no determination was made regarding the corporate status of South Community, Inc. As such, it is improper (if not error) to now determine that South Community, Inc. was, indeed, a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Further, I write separately because of the majority\u2019s statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">\u201c* * * Clearly, OCB is a state agency, a division of the Department of Administrative Services. It is not a body corporate and politic. <em>Therefore, </em>the court of common pleas was correct in holding that OCB had no right to appeal under R.C. 119.12 and that the court consequently had no jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">In my judgment, OCB has no right to appeal under R.C. Chapter 119 even if it is a body corporate and politic. A body corporate and politic is not, without more, a \u201ccorporation\u201d and, hence, neither a \u201cperson\u201d nor a \u201cparty\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> within the meaning of R.C. 119.12.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">The problem with the majority\u2019s analysis of the \u201cperson/party issue\u201d in the case at bar stems from this court\u2019s decision in <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities </em>v. <em>Professionals Guild of Ohio </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St. 3d 147, 545 N.E. 2d 1260. In <em>Hamilton Cty.

The majority in <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. </em>reached this conclusion by determining that the county board of mental retardation and developmental disabilities is a body corporate and politic. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 545 N.E. 2d at 1264. However, a county is not a corporation or a legal person and a majority of this court clearly erred in determining otherwise. <em>Id. </em>at 156-157, 545 N.E. 2d at 1270 (Douglas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">On October 12, 1989, SERB certified FOP as the exclusive bargaining representative for a bargaining unit comprised of Ohio Highway Patrol sergeants. It is now the latter part of 1990 and, because of appeals, FOP and OCB do not even know the shape of the bargaining table, let alone the issues to be presented for bargaining. I make this observation merely to point out how the bargaining process is frustrated by premature and improper appeals, and to express my continued concern that R.C.
