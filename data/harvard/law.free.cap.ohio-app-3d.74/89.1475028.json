Sweeney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Defendant-appellant, Suburban Power Piping Corporation, timely appeals the trial court\u2019s granting of a motion for summary judgment filed by plaintiffappellee, Power &amp; Pollution Services, Inc., on appellee\u2019s action to recover monies owed it for services rendered under a subcontract. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The essential facts in this case are undisputed. Appellee worked as a subcontractor on a construction project for which appellant was general contractor. Appellee did satisfactory work and is owed a balance of $31,082, together with interest thereon. The trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Appellant now timely appeals, raising one assignment of error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and in denying defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment because the contract language in question bars recovery for the appellee subcontractor since the appellant is not obligated to pay appellee until the owner pays appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In appellant\u2019s brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment and on this appeal, appellant contends that a \u201cpay-when-paid\u201d clause in the parties\u2019 written contract establishes that appellant\u2019s receipt of payment from the owner, LTV Steel Corporation (\u201cLTV\u201d), is a condition precedent to appellant\u2019s obligation to pay appellee on the contract. Appellant has not been paid by the owner, LTV, because LTV filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Thus, appellant argues that the \u201cpay-when-paid\u201d clause excuses it from paying appellee. Appellee contends that these provisions should be construed as an unconditional promise to pay, with the time of payment being postponed until a certain event or for a reasonable period of time if the event does not take place. Appellee\u2019s interpretation is the majority view in this country, which we find applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The written contract between the parties provided, in pertinent part (\u201cpay-when-paid\u201d clause):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">\u201c5(d) * * * Company [Suburban] shall not be required to pay any such monthly billing of the subcontractor prior to the date Company receives payment of its corresponding monthly billing from the Owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">\u201c5(e) * * * Within ten (10) days after said final payment by the Owner, Company shall pay the subcontractor the balance of the subcontract sum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Ohio courts have not previously addressed the issue of how \u201cpay-when-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>paid\u201d clauses should be interpreted and enforced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals dealt with this issue in depth in <em>Thomas J. Dyer Co. v. Bishop Internatl. Eng. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1962), 303 F.2d 655. In <em>Dyer, </em>the contractor relied on a \u201cpay-when-paid\u201d clause<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in refusing to pay a subcontractor where the owner filed for bankruptcy. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held the clause delayed payment for a \u201c * * * reasonable period of time after the work was completed, during which the general contractor would be afforded the opportunity of procuring from the owner the funds necessary to pay the subcontractor * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-4\">\u201cIn the case before us we see no reason why the usual credit risk of the owner\u2019s insolvency assumed by the general contractor should be transferred from the general contractor to the subcontractor. It seems clear to us under the facts of this case that it was the intention of the parties that the subcontractor would be paid by the general contractor for the labor and materials put into the project. We believe that to be the normal construction of the relationship between the parties. If such was not the intention of the parties it could have been so expressed in unequivocal terms dealing with the possible insolvency of the owner. * * * \u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The <em>Dyer </em>decision has been adopted by a majority <em>of </em>courts in other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Applying the reasoning of the court in <em>Dyer </em>to the present case, we find the provision in dispute here does not set a condition precedent to the general contractor\u2019s duty to pay the subcontractor, but rather constitutes an absolute promise to pay, fixing payment by the owner as a reasonable time for when payment to the subcontractor is to be made. If the parties intended to shift the risk of solvency of the owner to the subcontractor, such intention should have been unambiguously expressed in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>In view of the above, we find the trial court did not err in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment since appellee is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Assignment of Error I is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b126-7\">Nahra, P.J., and James D.
