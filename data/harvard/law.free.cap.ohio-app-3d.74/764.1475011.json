(Relator has not responded to the motion to dismiss.) Respondent argues that release of the records at issue in this action is not required because they are \u201crecords pertaining to * * * probation * * * proceedings\u201d and \u201crecords the release of which is prohibited by state * * * law.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-16\">R.C. 149.43(B) requires that all public records be made available for inspection and that copies of public records be made available at cost. R.C. 149.43(C) authorizes relief by way of mandamus for a person \u201callegedly aggrieved * * * by the failure of a governmental unit\u201d to make a public record available for inspection or to make a copy available.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>The issue presented by respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss, therefore, is whether the records which relator seeks are \u201cpublic records.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-4\">\u201c \u2018Public record\u2019 means any record that is kept by any public office, including, but not limited to, state, county, city, village, township, and school district units, except medical records, <em>records pertaining to </em>adoption, <em>probation, </em>and parole proceedings, * * * and <em>records the release of which is prohibited by state * * * law.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Before a court can grant probation to a person convicted of a felony, the court is required to consider a presentence investigation report prepared by a probation officer. R.C. 2951.03; Crim.R. 32.2. A review of the docket in <em>State v. Wes Hadlock, </em>Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas case No. CR-190162, reflects that relator was found guilty on two felony counts\u2014 kidnapping and extortion. As a consequence, the records which relator requests through this action are \u201crecords pertaining to * * * probation * * * proceedings\u201d and are not public records. Relator is not, therefore, entitled to relief by way of mandamus under R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has reached the same conclusion with regard to presentence investigation reports. \u201cThe judges\u2019 personal notes and presentence reports are not considered to be public records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mothers Against Drunk Drivers v. Gosser </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 30, 32, 20 OBR 279, 280, 485 N.E.2d 706, 709, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">We must reach the same conclusion with regard to the other records requested in the <em>ad damnum </em>clause as \u201crelied on to compile\u201d the presentence investigation report. In <em>State ex rel. Lipschutz v. Shoemaker </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 88, 551 N.E.2d 160, relator Lipschutz brought an original action in mandamus before the Supreme Court of Ohio against the Director of the Adult Parole Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">\u201cLipschutz also asks that respondent be directed to give him copies of any documents the Parole Board may have reviewed in preparation for the hearing [after which he was denied parole], as well as all documents containing the board\u2019s findings. However, he suggests no theory that would entitle him to the documents he seeks. The documents are not public records, since they are \u2018records pertaining to * * * parole proceedings.\u2019 R.C. 149.43(A)(1). We find that Lipschutz has no clear legal right to see them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 551 N.E.2d at 162. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Gaines v. Adult Parole Auth. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 104, 5 OBR 241, 449 N.E.2d 762; <em>State ex rel. Williams v. Cleveland </em>(Jan. 18, 1991), Cuyahoga App. No. 57769, unreported, at 26, 1991 WL 6365 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>(records 64 and 65 exempt from disclosure under R.C. 149.43[A][1] because each \u201cpertains to parole\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Of course, R.C. 149.43(A)(1) excludes from the definition of \u201cpublic records\u201d \u201crecords pertaining to adoption, <em>probation, and parole proceedings. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) The logic of <em>Lipschutz </em>regarding records pertaining to <em>parole </em>proceedings would, therefore, necessarily apply to this action involving records pertaining to <em>probation </em>proceedings. As a consequence, the records which were \u201crelied on to compile\u201d the presentence report are not public records just as \u201cany documents the Parole Board may have reviewed in preparation for the [parole] hearing,\u201d <em>Lipschutz, supra, </em>at 90, 551 N.E.2d at 162, are not \u201cpublic records\u201d as defined by R.C. 149.43(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Furthermore, the presentence investigation report is a record \u201cthe release of which is prohibited by state * * * law.\u201d R.C. 149.43(A)(1). R.C. 2947.06 and Crim.R. 32.2 provide that presentence investigation reports are \u201cconfidential.\u201d (Prior to October 1, 1987 and from October 1, 1989 until November 20, 1990, R.C. 2951.03 provided that presentence investigation reports were \u201cconfidential.\u201d See Sub.H.B. No. 73, 142 Ohio Laws, Part II, 1948 <em>et </em>seq.; Am.Sub.S.B. No. 258, 143 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1308, 1473. R.C. 2951.03 currently requires that the sentencing court permit a defendant or counsel to read the presentence investigation report \u2014 with the exception of specified portions of the report \u2014 before sentencing.) As a consequence, a presentence investigation report is not a \u201cpublic record\u201d as defined by R.C. 149.43(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted. Relator to pay costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b801-8\">James D. Sweeney and Harper, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
