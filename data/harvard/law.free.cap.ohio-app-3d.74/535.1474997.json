The complaint, as amended, alleged that the defendant exposed her breast at a Cincinnati bar. The defendant pleaded not guilty and filed a motion to dismiss. Following a hearing on the motion, on June 18, 1990, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. According to the record of the proceedings, the trial court held that the allegations of the amended complaint with respect to the exposure of the female breast did not, in law, state a violation of R.C. 2907.09(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">In its sole assignment of error, the state asserts that the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, reasoning that the term \u201cprivate parts,\u201d as found in R.C. 2907.09(A)(1), includes the female breast. For the reasons discussed below, we must affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">R.C. 2907.09 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\">\u201c(A) No person shall recklessly do any of the following, under circumstances in which his or her conduct is likely to be viewed by and affront others, not members of his or her household:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-14\">\u201c(1) Expose his or her private parts, or engage in masturbation[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">Although R.C. Chapter 2907 fails to provide a specific definition for \u201cprivate parts,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we are convinced that, in its commonly understood meaning, the term does not include the female breast. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court properly dismissed the amended complaint on its face because the material allegations contained within it did not, as a matter of law, state a violation of Ohio law with respect to the offense codified in R.C. 2907.09(A)(1). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>amended complaint being invalid on its face, we overrule the prosecution\u2019s assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-6\">Shannon, P.J., Hildebrandt and Utz, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-16\">. It is worth noting that the Ohio jury instruction for R.C. 2907.09 defines \"private parts\" to mean genitals. 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (1991), Section 507.09.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
