Studier brought survival actions for medical malpractice and wrongful death against six medical defendants. After the entry of certain settlements, dismissals and amended complaints not the subject of this appeal, only claims for spoliation or destruction of evidence against the pathologist and hospital remained at issue. The trial court awarded judgment on the pleadings to these defendants, concluding that Ohio does not recognize such a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">On appeal, Studier raises two assignments of error,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which controvert the entry of judgment on the pleadings. The pathologist and hospital both cross-appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> challenging the propriety of Studier\u2019s fourth amended complaint and the denial of the cross-appellants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. Upon review, we \u00e1ffirm the judgment of the trial court in part, reverse it in part and remand it for disposition of outstanding claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Sixty-four-year-old Virginia Moriana died within weeks of elective hernia surgery at the hospital. She suffered perforations of the small bowel with contamination of the peritoneal cavity by food and fecal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The pathologist performed an autopsy at the behest of the family. His report omitted reference to the small bowel and indicated infection caused the death. Studier posits that the pathologist\u2019s omission of evidence vital to her medical claims destroyed her ability to obtain the amount of damages for which she prayed in her fourth amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">The medical claims were arbitrated in 1989. The arbitrators awarded $1,291,000 in damages to Studier against the surgeon. The administratrix settled and dismissed the claims against the remaining medical defendants for $750,000. The panel declined to arbitrate the spoliation claim against the pathologist as it was not \u201c * * * causally related to a compensable medical claim.\u201d The panel noted, however, that the pathologist \u201c * * * deviated from acceptable medical practice in that he failed to report findings on autopsy which were material to the mechanisms which ultimately caused death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">We must first, <em>sua sponte, </em>address an issue of jurisdiction. While the entry of judgment on the pleadings as to the spoliation claims in the third and fourth amended complaints contains the necessary language to make it a final appealable order pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B), we note other claims in the suit have not been fully resolved. The trial court entered a judgment dismissing, as settled, Studier\u2019s claims against three doctors. The entry, however, requires approval by the probate court. This approval has not been journalized in the record of this case. For lack of jurisdiction, we specifically decline to review the pathologist\u2019s second cross-assignment of error and the hospital\u2019s fourth cross-assignment of error challenging the denial of their motions for summary judgment which are interlocutory and not final orders pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B). <em>Palmer v. Westmeyer </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 296, 549 N.E.2d 1202. Thus we confine our examination to those issues contained in the order for judgment on the pleadings which we find to be a final appealable order. <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 17, 540 N.E.2d 266; <em>Douthitt v. Garrison </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 254, 3 OBR 286, 444 N.E.2d 1068. See, also, <em>Stewart v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 124, 543 N.E.2d 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">We will initially address the pathologist\u2019s first and the hospital\u2019s fifth cross-assignments of error, both of which controvert the propriety of the plaintiff\u2019s fourth amended complaint. The defendants complain that the court erroneously allowed the amended complaint only four days before trial was scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Studier\u2019s 1987 third amended complaint put forth claims for medical malpractice, wrongful death, the intentional destruction of evidence and conspiracy to destroy evidence. She pled no specific amount of monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Two years later and just four days before the scheduled trial, the court allowed an unjournalized, oral motion by the plaintiff to amend the complaint. That fourth amended complaint differed from its predecessors in that it (1) added two new plaintiffs; (2) deleted the medical claims and relied solely on the spoliation of evidence claim; (3) enlarged the spoliation claim to include negligent, fraudulent and malicious destruction of evidence; and (4) added a prayer for $1,171,116.68 compensatory and $10,000,000 punitive damages. The court continued the trial upon motion of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Civ.R. 54(C) sets forth in relevant part that \u201c * * * a demand for judgment which seeks a judgment for money shall limit the claimant to the sum claimed in the demand unless he amends his demand not later than seven days before the commencement of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">This mandate supersedes the more general Civ.R. 15(A) language which provides that a party may obtain leave to file an amended complaint \u201c * * * when justice so requires.\u201d <em>Williams v. Glen Manor Home for Jewish Aged, Inc. </em>(1986), 27 Ohio App.3d 246, 27 OBR 289, 500 N.E.2d 929; <em>Fulton v. Aszman </em>(1982), 4 Ohio App.3d 64, 4 OBR 114, 446 N.E.2d 803. Civ.R. 54(C) is mandatory. <em>Douthitt, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">We find that the court impermissibly allowed Studier to amend her demand for money judgment four days before trial in violation of Civ.R. 54(C). <em>Douthitt, supra. </em>As a result, Studier is limited to the zero dollar sum claimed in her third amended complaint. Civ.R. 54(C); <em>Digital Design Corp. v. North Supply Co. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 36, 540 N.E.2d 1358; <em>Bishop v. Grdina </em>(1985), 20 Ohio St.3d 26, 20 OBR 213, 485 N.E.2d 704; <em>Raimonde v. Van Vlerah </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 21, 71 O.O.2d 12, 325 N.E.2d 544; <em>Mers v. Dispatch Printing Co. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio App.3d 99, 529 N.E.2d 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">We also find the court erroneously allowed Studier\u2019s amendment as to the substance of her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Civ.R. 15(A) permits a party to amend her pleadings by leave of court. <em>Hambleton v. R.G. Barry Corp. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 179, 12 OBR 246, 465 N.E.2d 1298; <em>Meadors v. Zaring </em>(1987), 38 Ohio App.3d 97, 526 N.E.2d 107; <em>Holsman Neon &amp; Elec. Sign Co. v. Kohn </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 53, 516 N.E.2d 1284; <em>Solowitch v. Bennett </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 115, 8 OBR 169, 456 N.E.2d 562. The grant of leave is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The motion seeking leave to file the amendment must be in writing, unless made during a hearing or trial. Civ.R. 7(B)(1). The rule has been construed to require the motion to contain a brief written statement of the reason supporting it. <em>Maintenance Unlimited, Inc. v. Salemi </em>(1984), 18 Ohio App.3d 29, 18 OBR 54, 480 N.E.2d 113; <em>Rosenberg v. Gattarello </em>(1976), 49 Ohio App.2d 87, 3 O.O.3d 151, 359 N.E.2d 467. This the plaintiff failed to do. Further, there is no evidence in the record that Studier made her oral motion during a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The court should grant leave only where to do so would not unduly prejudice the defendants and where, from plaintiff\u2019s timely and good faith motion for leave, it appears she has an actionable claim. <em>Hambleton, supra; DiPaolo v. De Victor </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 166, 555 N.E.2d 969; <em>Holsman Neon &amp; Elec. Sign Co., supra; Solowitch, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">In this case, two years after asserting the spoliation of evidence claim and four days before trial, the plaintiff sought to amend her fatally defective complaint not only by correcting its omissions and oversights, but by adding new claims and new parties. As these efforts appear futile in sight of her untimely attempt to plead actual damages, the court improperly granted leave to file the fourth amended complaint. <em>Meadors </em>and <em>Solowitch, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">These assignments of error have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Studier\u2019s two assignments of error contend that the court erroneously granted defendants judgment on the pleadings on her claims for fraudulent, negligent and intentional spoliation of evidence. The court entered judgment on these claims, as set forth in Studier\u2019s third and fourth amended complaints, after determining that Ohio does not recognize such cause of action. Our discussion will necessarily address the hospital\u2019s first three cross-assignments of error which also posit that the spoliation claim is not cognizable in Ohio. We note the disposition of the pathologist\u2019s first and the hospital\u2019s fifth cross-assignments of error renders the fourth amended complaint void and so we confine our review to the third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Pursuant to Civ.R. 12(C), the trial court may properly enter judgment on the pleadings, as a matter of law, where the plaintiff fails to allege a cognizable cause of action. <em>Peterson v. Teodosio </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 161, 63 O.O.2d 262, 297 N.E.2d 113; <em>Janea v. First Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn, of Cleveland </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 211, 21 OBR 225, 486 N.E.2d 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Civ.R. 8(A) requires that a claim for relief must include \u201ca demand for judgment for the relief of which he deems himself entitled.\u201d Where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>actual damages are not pled, an actionable cause is not stated. <em>Jemo v. Garman </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 267, 24 O.O.3d 358, 436 N.E.2d 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In her third amended complaint, Studier alleged that \u201c * * * as a direct and proximate result of the intentional and deliberate destruction of evidence * * * plaintiffs have had and will have to incur additional costs in investigation and prosecution of their claim and have been deprived of crucial evidence in preparing their cause of action.\u201d Litigation expenses are not recoverable as compensatory damages because such necessary expenses are recoverable as costs pursuant to Civ.R. 54(D). Cf. <em>Sorin v. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 177, 75 O.O.2d 224, 347 N.E.2d 527; <em>Convention Ctr. Inn, Ltd. v. Dow Chemical Co. </em>(1984), 19 Ohio Misc.2d 15, 19 OBR 422, 484 N.E.2d 764. See, also, <em>Bookatz v. Kupps </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 36, 528 N.E.2d 961; <em>Jones v. Pierson </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 447, 2 OBR 542, 442 N.E.2d 791. Further, as previously noted, Studier recovered over $1,000,000 on the claims for which she seeks litigation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"Avp\">Studier also failed to assert \u201cactual malice, fraud or insult\u201d in her third amended complaint. Without such allegations, she did not state a claim entitling her to the punitive damages she requested. <em>Helmick v. Republic-Franklin Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 71, 529 N.E.2d 464; <em>Hoskins v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 272, 6 OBR 337, 452 N.E.2d 1315, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Ali v. Jefferson Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 105, 5 OBR 220, 449 N.E.2d 495; <em>Convention Ctr. Inn, Ltd., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Finally, as we have already noted, Studier prayed for no specific dollar amount of damages. Civ.R. 54(C) thus limits her recovery potential to the zero dollar amount pled. <em>Bishop, Raimonde, </em>and <em>Mers, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">As Studier did not denominate actual damages, she failed, as a matter of law, to state an actionable cause. Thus, the court properly entered judgment on the pleadings for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">The judgment entry of the trial court also stated that spoliation of evidence is not a cause of action recognized in Ohio. We decline to reach that issue as it is mooted by plaintiffs failure to delineate an actionable claim for relief. We will not reverse a judgment that is correct, irrespective of the reasoning used by the trial court. <em>Joyce v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 551 N.E.2d 172, 174; <em>Agricultural Ins. Co. v. Constantine </em>(1944), 144 Ohio St. 275, 284, 29 O.O. 426, 430, 58 N.E.2d 658, 663; <em>April v. Reflector-Herald </em>(1988), 46 Ohio App.3d 95, 546 N.E.2d 466; <em>Taylor v. Yale &amp; Town Mfg. Co. </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 62, 520 N.E.2d 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The plaintiffs two assignments of error are not well taken. The hospital\u2019s first, second and third cross-assignments of error are dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded to strike the fourth amended complaint and for disposition of outstanding claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-6\">Krupansky, C.J., and John F.
