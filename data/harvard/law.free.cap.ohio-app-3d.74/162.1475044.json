Four assignments of error are raised which have been rearranged for purposes of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Assignment of Error II</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant and in violation of rights conferred by Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">In the course of an investigation in Lorain, Detectives Resendez and Cambarare secured the services of an informant. After wiring him with a radio transmitter, the detectives instructed the informant to locate drug dealers in a particular area known to the police for drug sales and use. He thereupon contacted several individuals and was told that \u201cEito\u201d possessed crack cocaine for sale. The informant then approached Moon who divulged that he could supply the drugs he sought. Claiming that he would be back after he obtained some money, the informant returned to the detectives to confirm what they had heard over the transmitter.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">The detectives then met with Officer Rewak who had observed Moon earlier that evening. He was able to verify that the suspect\u2019s clothing matched a description given to the detectives by the informant. All three men were aware of Moon\u2019s prior arrest and conviction for crimes involving crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Officer Rewak then proceeded, with the detectives, to the location where Moon had last been seen. The officer described this neighborhood as <em>\u201ca </em>known area for violent crimes and open drug dealing.\u201d Officer Rewak immediately recognized Moon. He physically apprehended him, placed him against the police vehicle, and conducted a search which revealed a bag containing crack cocaine hidden in the lining of Moon\u2019s hat. Moon was promptly arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Moon filed a pre-trial motion to suppress this evidence which he believed was obtained as a result of a search in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution. A two-day hearing was conducted on this matter at which both Detective Resendez and Officer Rewak testified. The court concluded that the search was valid and proceeded with trial. The issue is now before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The trial court implicitly found, and we agree, that when Officer Rewak grabbed Moon by the arm and placed him up against the police cruiser, Moon had been \u201cseized\u201d for Fourth Amendment purposes. <em>United States v. Mendenhall </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 544, 552-555, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1876, 64 L.Ed.2d 497, 508. Once Moon moved to suppress the evidence, the prosecution bore the burden of proving the constitutional propriety of the warrantless search. <em>Xenia v. Wallace </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 216, 524 N.E.2d 889, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The state was able to persuade the trial court that Officer Rewak was entitled to search Moon as part of a legitimate stop and frisk. This exception to the warrant requirement is employed when the investigating officers do not have sufficient \u201cprobable cause\u201d to arrest a suspect but still harbor \u201creasonable suspicions\u201d of criminal activity. <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 909. This \u201cnarrowly drawn authority\u201d has been allowed so that an officer may protect himself by searching the individual for weapons before continuing the investigation. <em>Id.; </em>see, also, <em>Adams v. Williams </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 143, 145-146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612, 616-617; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 58, 60-63, 554 N.E.2d 108, 110-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The trial court\u2019s resort to the intermediate \u201cstop and frisk\u201d standard is problematic. Officer Rewak did not suggest, and it does not appear likely, that he removed Moon\u2019s cap and searched its lining because he feared that a readily accessible weapon was hidden therein. To the contrary, Detective Resendez indicated at the hearing that the search was for \u201ccontraband.\u201d As far as we are aware, an investigative \u201cstop and frisk\u201d of a person exclusively for drugs has never been constitutionally permissible absent \u201cprobable cause\u201d to suspect criminal activity. See <em>State v. McDonald </em>(1990), 2 AOA 68, 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">We therefore turn to the more stringent \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard. To effectuate a valid arrest, the facts available to the officers at that moment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>must warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been committed. <em>Beck v. Ohio </em>(1964), 379 U.S. 89, 96, 85 S.Ct. 223, 228, 13 L.Ed.2d 142, 148, 31 O.O.2d 80, 83-84. We are convinced that probable cause existed in this case when (1) a known drug abuser, (2) confided in an informant, (3) while police were listening, (4) that he possessed crack cocaine for sale, and (5) in an area known for open drug transactions. See <em>State v. Wac </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 84, 87-88, 22 O.O.3d 299, 301, 428 N.E.2d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The officers, therefore, were entitled to place Moon under arrest, at that time, in complete compliance with constitutional requirements. <em>United States v. Watson </em>(1976), 423 U.S. 411, 423-424, 96 S.Ct. 820, 827-828, 46 L.Ed.2d 598, 608-609; <em>United States v. Santana </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 38, 42, 96 S.Ct. 2406, 2409, 49 L.Ed.2d 300, 305. Consequently, any contemporaneous search of his person for contraband was fully justified as incident to the lawful arrest. <em>United States v. Robinson </em>(1973), 414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477, 38 L.Ed.2d 427, 440-441, 66 O.O.2d 202, 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Much is made of Officer Rewak\u2019s decision to seize Moon first, conduct the search, and <em>then </em>formally arrest him. Nevertheless, the mere fact that the patrolman failed to utter the word \u201carrest\u201d <em>prior </em>to the search is not dispositive. <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 98, 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 2564, 65 L.Ed.2d 633, 645-646; <em>State v. Farndon </em>(1984), 22 Ohio App.3d 31, 34, 22 OBR 107, 110, 488 N.E.2d 894, 897; <em>State v. Fahy </em>(1988), 49 Ohio App.3d 160, 161, 551 N.E.2d 1311, 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">In <em>State v. Smith </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 255, 263-264, 544 N.E.2d 239, 246-247, the Supreme Court of Ohio recognized that a valid search need only be contemporaneous with a lawful arrest to be \u201cincident\u201d thereto. The United States Supreme Court reversed on other grounds, disapproving of the Ohio court\u2019s apparent justification of the ensuing arrest by evidence obtained from the prior search. <em>Smith v. Ohio </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 541, 110 S.Ct. 1288, 108 L.Ed.2d 464. The court quoted <em>Sibron v. New York </em>(1968), 392 U.S. 40, 63, 88 S.Ct. 1889, 1902, 20 L.Ed.2d 917, 935-936; \u201cIt is axiomatic that an incident search may not precede an arrest and serve as part of its justification.\u201d <em>Smith v. Ohio, supra, </em>494 U.S. at 543, 110 S.Ct. at 1290, 108 L.Ed.2d at 467. That pitfall is avoided in the case at bar given that the probable cause is not based, in any way, upon the discovery of drugs in Moon\u2019s hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Finally, we are aware that Detective Resendez remarked at the hearing that the search, in his view, was not incident to the arrest, but rather \u201cinvestigative.\u201d Regardless, the subjective conclusions of the arresting officers are not controlling as our determination must be rendered objectively from the totality of facts and circumstances presented. <em>United States v. Clark </em>(C.A.5, 1977), 559 F.2d 420, 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">This assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Assignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant, and in violation of rights conferred by Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for disclosure of the identity of the informant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The accused\u2019s need to obtain the identity of a confidential informant must be balanced with the public\u2019s legitimate interest in protecting the free flow of information to government authorities. <em>Roviaro v. United States </em>(1957), 353 U.S. 53, 62, 77 S.Ct. 623, 628-629, 1 L.Ed.2d 639, 646. The Ohio Supreme Court has squarely held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u201cThe identity of an informant must be revealed to a criminal defendant when the testimony of the informant is vital to establishing an element of the crime or would be helpful or beneficial to the accused in preparing or making a defense to criminal charges.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 74, 4 OBR 196, 446 N.E.2d 779, syllabus; see, also, <em>State v. Menter </em>(1990), 4 AOA 151, 152.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">In the case before us, the informant did not testify at either the suppression hearing or trial. Consequently, his presence was not \u201cvital\u201d to the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Moon insists, nevertheless, that cross-examination of the informant during the hearing would have been \u201chelpful or beneficial\u201d in determining whether there was probable cause to arrest. We disagree. Initially, the informant\u2019s conversation was overheard by the detectives, in its entirety, allowing the defense to inquire as to what actually took place. The confrontation, moreover, occurred in front of a number of witnesses, further reducing the need for the informant\u2019s testimony. <em>Williams, supra, </em>4 Ohio St.3d at 76, 4 OBR at 197-198, 446 N.E.2d at 781. While it is theoretically possible that the informant might have refuted the accounts of Detective Resendez and Officer Rewak so persuasively as to require the court to grant the motion for suppression, we will not compromise the strong public interest in favor of confidentiality upon such speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">This assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">Assignment of Error III</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant and in violation of rights conferred by Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution, and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Evid.R. 802, when over the objection of appellant, the trial court permitted Detective Resendez to testify to out-of-court statements of a non-testifying informant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">Detective Resendez testified at trial, over objection, that prior to the arrest the informant verified that Moon had crack cocaine for sale. The specifics of the conversation were not described in any detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>These statements by the detective were not, contrary to Moon's contentions, hearsay since they were not offered \u201cto prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Evid.R. 801(C). The testimony regarding the informant was advanced simply to describe the course of the investigation leading to the arrest. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232, 15 O.O.3d 234, 240, 400 N.E.2d 401, 407-408. The situation explained was \u201crelevant, equivocal and contemporaneous with the statements,\u201d and was therefore admissible. <em>State v. Blevins </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 147, 149, 521 N.E.2d 1105, 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Moon further argues that this evidence should have been excluded pursuant to Evid.R. 403(A) due to its prejudicial impact. We note that his counsel did not address this specific provision in his objection to the trial court. Regardless, we cannot agree that this testimony necessarily and unfairly impaired Moon\u2019s defense. A trial judge could properly determine \u2014 were a challenge squarely raised \u2014 that such background material was needed to complete the state\u2019s case against Moon while creating little possibility that he would be convicted of a crime he did not commit. See <em>Parma v. Manning </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 67, 69, 514 N.E.2d 749, 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">This assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Assignment of Error IV</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in violation of rights conferred by Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, when it granted appellee\u2019s motion to exclude a defense witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Moon was arrested on May 9, 1990, and formally indicted on June 5, 1990. A motion for discovery was submitted by the state on July 6,1990. On the morning of the second day of trial, August 7, 1990, Moon\u2019s counsel announced \u2014 for the first time \u2014 that he was going to call James Moore to the stand. This witness was supposedly \u201cwith Moon the entire time.\u201d No attempt was made to explain why an individual with such obvious ties to the events in question could not be \u201cdiscovered\u201d until nearly three months from date of the alleged offense had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Undoubtedly, a criminal defendant enjoys the right \u2014 as embodied in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution \u2014 to offer testimony of witnesses on his behalf. <em>Washington v. Texas </em>(1967), 388 U.S. 14, 18-19, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 1922-1923, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019, 1022-1023; <em>Lakewood v. Papadelis </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 1, 4-5, 511 N.E.2d 1138, 1140-1142. A trial judge may, nevertheless, exclude such evidence when the orderly administration of justice is threatened by the accused\u2019s failure to promptly disclose witnesses. <em>Taylor v. Illinois </em>(1988), 484 U.S. 400, 410-418, 108 S.Ct. 646, 653-658, 98 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>798, 811-817; <em>Maryland v. Craig </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 836, -, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 3165-3166, 111 L.Ed.2d 666, 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The eleventh-hour appearance of James Moore in these proceedings was extremely suspicious. There was absolutely no justification for his absence from the witness list previously submitted by the defense. Counsel did not suggest, by means of a proffer or otherwise, that James Moore could add anything to the proceedings that the other defense witnesses were unable to supply. Accordingly, Moon\u2019s constitutional rights were not infringed by the trial court\u2019s refusal to accept the surprise witness. See <em>State v. Harcourt </em>(1988), 46 Ohio App.3d 52, 54-55, 546 N.E.2d 214, 217-219.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">This assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The trial court is affirmed consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b204-10\">Quillin, P.J., and Baird, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
