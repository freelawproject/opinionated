The allegations contained in the complaint included spousal abuse of Erin by Roy, physical abuse of Samantha by Roy, Erin and Roy\u2019s history of emotional instability, and Roy\u2019s inability to maintain a clean home while Erin was in the hospital. At the time of the filing, Jessica and Samantha were in the care of Roy\u2019s sister, while Laura, who suffers from cerebral palsy, was staying with a teacher. The court granted temporary custody of the children to PCCS later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">On April 24, 1989, the court held a shelter care hearing, wherein it appointed a guardian ad litem for the children and appointed counsel for the Piepers. Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the court ordered the children to remain in shelter care and continued PCCS\u2019s temporary custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">PCCS filed an amended complaint on August 17, 1989, which contained new allegations that Roy sexually abused Jessica and Samantha, in addition to reasserting the claims set forth in the original complaint. Both Roy and Erin subsequently entered pleas denying the allegations. After counsel for the Piepers had either withdrawn or resigned from the case on four separate occasions, the bench trial commenced on June 25, 1990. Due to the vast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>amount of testimony given, the court twice recessed the matter until August 21, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">In a decision and entry dated September 11, 1990, the court found all three children to be neglected as defined by R.C. 2151.03. Jessica and Samantha were further deemed sexually abused children pursuant to R.C. 2151.031(A), and Samantha was additionally declared an abused child per R.C. 2151.031(C). The court held a dispositional hearing regarding PCCS\u2019s request for permanent custody on September 13, 1990. In its September 25, 1990 entry, the court granted the request and divested Roy and Erin of all parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Erin and Roy appealed separately in a timely manner. Erin\u2019s brief presents the following assignments of error for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">\u201cThe juvenile court erred to the prejudice of appellant Erin Pieper when it assumed jurisdiction, when it initially removed Laura, Jessica and Samantha Pieper from appellant\u2019s care, custody, and control, and when it subsequently held an adjudicatory hearing to terminate appellant\u2019s parental rights and duties, because the facts and circumstances alleged in the original and amended complaints failed to set forth acts and omissions upon appellant\u2019s part which occurred on or about the date alleged in the complaint which demonstrated neglect by appellant or inadequate care for her children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">\u201cThe juvenile court erred to the prejudice of appellant by including evidence of the best interest of the Pieper children in its adjudication decision and relying upon the children\u2019s best interest as justification for its adjudication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">Assignment of Error No. 3:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">\u201cThe juvenile court erred to the prejudice of appellant in using appellant\u2019s alleged failure to cooperate with and her resentment of Children\u2019s Services, which occurred following the filing of the initial and amended complaints, as a justification for finding the Pieper children abused and neglected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">Assignment of Error No. 4:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">\u201cThe juvenile court twice erred to appellant\u2019s prejudice in admitting evidence attacking appellant\u2019s credibility in violation of Evid.R. 608(B).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-14\">Assignment of Error No. 5:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-15\">\u201cThe adjudication and disposition in this case are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-16\">Roy submits the following as error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Assignment of Error No. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred to allow at the adjudication stage of the proceedings evidence of what was in the children's best interests.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">Assignment of Error No. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred to admit the hearsay statements of appellant\u2019s children in that their admission violated appellant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-8\">Assignment of Error No. 3:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred to allow the state\u2019s witness to testify that the child hearsay declarent [sic] was capable of accurately relating personal experiences and that she had been truthful about her claim of sexual abuse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-10\">Assignment of Error No. 4:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-11\">\u201cAppellant Roy Pieper was denied effective assistance of counsel in that his trial counsel failed to object to hearsay statements tending to show that appellant had sexually abused his own children and in failing to object to the testimony of a state\u2019s witness as to whether a hearsay declarent [sic] was telling the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-12\">Assignment of Error No. 5:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-13\">\u201cThe trial court erred to find that the children were abused, neglected, and dependent in that its finding was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-14\">In her first assignment of error, Erin contends that the allegations set forth in the complaint and amended complaint failed both to establish that the juvenile court had jurisdiction and to apprise her of the claims against her. Specifically, she points to the allegations relating to a prior history of drug involvement, passing bad checks, and admittance to a battered women's shelter as being vague and conclusory pursuant to Juv.R. 10 and R.C. 2151.27.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">Juv.R. 10(B) provides that a complaint must \u201cstate in ordinary and concise language the essential facts which bring the proceeding within the jurisdiction of the court * * Where a complaint contains an allegation that a child is abused, neglected or dependent, R.C. 2151.27(A) requires the complaint to allege the particular facts upon which the allegation is based. In order to avoid the filing of lengthy complaints, however, this court has held that Juv.R. 10(B) does not \u201cforce a complainant to state in the complaint every fact surrounding each incident described.\u201d <em>In re Sims </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 37, 43, 13 OBR 40, 46, 468 N.E.2d 111, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">Upon reviewing the allegations set forth in both the complaint and amended complaint, we find they have the specificity required by R.C. 2151.27 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Juv.R. 10. Although the allegations do not provide exact dates in several instances, they sufficiently notified Erin of the nature of the charges against her and permitted her to plan a defense. The claims brought forth also gave the trial court jurisdiction over the case. As a result, the first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Erin\u2019s second and Roy\u2019s first assignments of error maintain that the trial court improperly considered the best interest of the children during the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings. Both parties specifically cite as error that portion of the court\u2019s September 11, 1990 entry which noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">\u201cSince the children have been in the custody of Children\u2019s Services, they have made significant progress. The situation of Jessica and Samantha could perhaps be described as normal improvement or maturing; however, the improvement in Laura\u2019s situation is much more dramatic. Regular attendance at the clinic and at the Twin Valley School, and the home program faithfully followed by the foster parents, have resulted in Laura\u2019s making much greater, and unexpected, progress than she had made previously.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Before a child may be removed from parental custody, a bifurcated judicial proceeding must be held. <em>In re Hodgkin </em>(Dec. 31, 1990), Preble App. No. CA90-03-007, unreported, 1990 WL 235496. The sole issue before the court at the first, or adjudicatory, hearing is whether the child is neglected or dependent. <em>In re Sims, supra, </em>13 Ohio App.3d at 38, 13 OBR at 40, 468 N. E.2d at 113. The focus is on the parent\u2019s ability to provide food, shelter and care, and what they are capable of providing in the future. <em>In re Vickers Children </em>(1983), 14 Ohio App.3d 201, 204, 14 OBR 228, 231, 470 N.E.2d 438, 442. A consideration of the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the child is not involved at this step and is only permitted after the proceeding has shifted to the second, or dispositional, stage. <em>In re Cunningham </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 100, 107, 13 O.O.3d 78, 82, 391 N.E.2d 1034, 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">It is contended that the above-referenced language illustrates that the court prematurely considered evidence which is admissible only at the dispositional stage. However, when this brief passage regarding the children\u2019s progress is read in conjunction with the remainder of the court\u2019s decision, it is evident that the trial court abided by the correct standard in adjudicating PCCS\u2019s neglect and abuse claims. See <em>In re Adkins </em>(Feb. 22, 1988), Butler App. No. CA87-03-038, unreported, 1988 WL 21304. As a result, Erin\u2019s second and Roy\u2019s first assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">Erin\u2019s third assignment of error alleges that the trial court erroneously considered evidence of her resentment of PCCS and her failure to comply with the case plan during the adjudicatory phase. In its entry dated September 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>1990, the court noted that both Roy and Erin \u201chave not complied, in any meaningful manner, with the case plan\u201d and have been \u201cnot only resistive, but abusive and aggressive towards the various caseworkers.\u201d It is contended such evidence is not probative of the issue of whether the children were neglected or abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">As this court reiterated in <em>In re Vickers Children, supra, </em>14 Ohio App.3d at 206, 14 OBR at 233, 470 N.E.2d at 444, the focus during the adjudicatory stage of a hearing \u201cis on the parent, the parent\u2019s conduct and how that conduct has hurt the children.\u201d Evidence that the parents were uncooperative with caseworkers from the children\u2019s services agency reflects adversely on the parent\u2019s ability to care for their children since the parents are fully aware that failure to abide by the agency\u2019s guidelines could result in the divestiture of their rights. The same is true regarding evidence of the parents\u2019 compliance with the case plan. As such, it was evidence which could be considered by the court. Accordingly, no merit is found in Erin\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Erin\u2019s fourth assignment of error alleges that the state impermissibly used witnesses to attack her credibility in violation of Evid.R. 608(B) on two separate occasions during the trial. In pertinent part, Evid.R. 608(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">\u201cSpecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting his credibility, other than conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">It is maintained that the first Evid.R. 608(B) violation occurred when a fraud investigator from Dayton Power and Light Company testified about visiting the Pieper residence on December 6, 1989 concerning an overdue bill. According to the investigator, a female confronted him at the front door of the house who originally denied but later admitted to being Erin.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">Despite Erin\u2019s contentions, the admission of the investigator\u2019s testimony is directly relevant to her ability to provide shelter and care for her children. Although the incident occurred approximately four months after the filing of' the amended complaint, it provides some evidence of her ability to provide a basic necessity, namely electricity, for the children in the future. Accordingly, it was not error to admit such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">The second violation cited by Erin allegedly took place during cross-examination when she stated she had filed a complaint for assault on July 16, 1990, against a PCCS caseworker following a dispute over an unscheduled visit at the PCCS office. On rebuttal, a Preble County Deputy Sheriff testified that Erin told him the caseworker used the palm of her hand to guide Erin out of a room. The caseworker supervisor against whom the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>was filed further testified that she never touched Erin during the incident. Two other PCCS caseworkers corroborated the supervisor\u2019s testimony. Erin maintains the trial court\u2019s admittance of the rebuttal testimony is improper since the state is \u201cstuck\u201d with unsatisfactory answers it receives to collateral issues on cross-examination. See <em>State v. Carroll </em>(May 31, 1985), Warren App. No. CA84-08-056, unreported, 1985 WL 8687.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">As noted earlier, only where it appears that the trial judge actually considered inadmissible testimony in reaching its decision will an appellate court reverse on the basis of the admission of such testimony. <em>In re Sims, supra, </em>13 Ohio App.3d at 41, 13 OBR at 43, 468 N.E.2d at 116. Upon reviewing the court\u2019s entry, no specific reference to this incident is mentioned. Instead, the court stated in conclusory fashion that Erin had been uncooperative with and resistant towards PCCS and its caseworkers. Given that Erin herself testified to having a stormy and uncooperative relationship with PCCS, it cannot be presumed that the trial court relied solely on the rebuttal testimony in finding as it did. Thus, the fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">It is asserted in both Erin\u2019s and Roy\u2019s fifth assignments of error that the trial court\u2019s adjudication is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Erin additionally argues that the disposition is against the manifest weight of the evidence. In addition to finding all three children neglected, the court found Jessica and Samantha sexually abused and Samantha physically abused. As a reviewing court, our inquiry \u201cis limited to a determination of whether sufficient credible evidence exists to support the trial court\u2019s adjudication. <em>In re Hodgkin, supra, </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Before addressing the merits of this consolidated assignment of error, we note that each of the parent\u2019s interests will be considered separately with regard to both the sexual abuse and neglect findings. Although this approach may be novel, we find it proper in light of the juvenile court\u2019s authority to award legal custody of a neglected child to either parent requesting custody prior to the dispositional hearing. R.C. 2151.353(A)(3). By looking at the actions of each parent respectively, the goal of the adjudicatory hearing to examine each parent\u2019s ability to be an adequate parent will be better realized. Moreover, such an analysis comports with the main purpose of R.C. 2151.01 <em>et seq., i.e., </em>upholding family unity, since only the truly blameworthy parent will be held accountable for their actions. Furthermore, by evaluating each parent\u2019s behavior apart from the other\u2019s, we respect the well-recognized and fundamental right of personal choice in family matters. <em>State ex rel. Heller v. Miller </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 6, 15 O.O.3d 3, 399 N.E.2d 66. Finally, this approach is particularly appropriate in a case such as this where one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>parents was hospitalized for a period of time immediately preceding the filing of the neglect complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In attacking the court\u2019s finding that the girls were sexually abused, Roy argues that there is no medical evidence indicating physical proof of such abuse and enlists as support the testimony of Dr. Ellen Buerk. After conducting physical examinations of the girls, Dr. Buerk testified that Jessica exhibited suspicious, but not definitive, signs of sexual abuse, while Samantha failed to demonstrate any positive physical signs of abuse. Based on this testimony, Roy maintains that the court\u2019s decision finding the two girls sexually abused is against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The testimony of other witnesses, however, provides sufficient credible evidence that the girls had been abused. Dr. Marilyn Shea, a psychologist, opined that both girls had been sexually abused after they told her that Roy and their half-brother, Brian, put \u201ctheir things inside of\u201d them. Based on observations of the children during therapy, a licensed clinical counselor, Barbara Evans, opined that Jessica and Samantha exhibited severe signs of sexual abuse. Linda Daily, a PCCS caseworker supervisor, testified that the girls informed her that Roy had repeatedly touched their vaginas with his mouth, fingers and penis. The girls also told Daily that Brian and some of Roy\u2019s friends had engaged in similar behavior. Roy\u2019s sister, Sharon Phillips, testified that both Jessica and Samantha told her that Roy had \u201cstuck his ding dong in me.\u201d This statement is corroborated by Dr. Buerk\u2019s testimony that both Jessica and Samantha told her that Roy \u201cstuck\u201d them in the vaginal area. Based on the above testimony, we find there is sufficient credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Roy sexually abused Jessica and Samantha.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">However, there is no such evidence indicating that Erin sexually abused the children. Indeed, the guardian ad litem\u2019s brief concedes that \u201cmost of the evidence in this case deals with the abuse of the children by the father.\u201d Moreover, there is scant evidence that Erin even had knowledge that the abuse occurred. Twice during the trial, Erin denied having any knowledge that Jessica and Samantha had been sexually abused. In short, absent sufficient credible evidence indicating Erin sexually abused the girls or had knowledge of such activity by Roy, we deem it inappropriate to admonish her for actions undertaken by her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The next issue which will be addressed pertains to the court\u2019s finding of neglect. The fault, unfitness or unsuitability of the parent is a necessary element in determining that a child is neglected. <em>In re Sims, supra, </em>13 Ohio App.3d at 45, 13 OBR at 48, 468 N.E.2d at 120, quoting <em>In re East </em>(1972), 32 Ohio Misc. 65, 66-67, 288 N.E.2d 343, 344-345. As a result, a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>culpable acts by the parent which caused the child\u2019s neglected condition must be made. <em>Id. </em>Such a showing is necessary since \u201c[a] parent\u2019s primary rights to the care and custody of a child are rights that must be protected * * <em>In re Bibb </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App.2d 117, 122, 24 O.O.3d 159, 163, 435 N.E.2d 96, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Upon a review of the record, we find sufficient credible evidence to warrant such a finding regarding Roy\u2019s behavior. To give but one example of his unfitness as a parent, after a fight with Roy in April 1989, Erin took the children with her to a battered women\u2019s shelter in Richmond, Indiana. The shelter subsequently sent them to a local hospital for an alleged child abuse evaluation. The doctor conducting the examination of Samantha testified that the bruises about the girl\u2019s buttocks, thighs and knees were consistent with her story that Roy had beaten her with a stick several days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The record, however, fails to attribute any culpable act to Erin which caused the children\u2019s neglected condition. To begin, several of the neglect conditions alleged in the complaint, including the charges relating to the cleanliness of the house, occurred when Roy remained at home while Erin was hospitalized from April 12 to April 20, 1989. Furthermore, despite Roy\u2019s apparent apathy about the well-being of his children, evidence elicited at trial indicated Erin demonstrated a sincere interest in the children, particularly Laura. According to the testimony of Jonathan Smith, supervisor of Laura\u2019s school, Erin exhibited concern about Laura and made trips to visit her at the school. Erin further testified that she regularly cleaned and bathed Laura before school. The record also reflects that Erin displayed a desire to become a better parent by attending a child development course at a local university as well as a young adulthood course at a community college, although it is unclear as to when she attended the courses.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">On the other hand, the court\u2019s only reference to Erin\u2019s allegedly unsuitable behavior states that her failure to take her medicine for her bipolar disorder resulted in her being hospitalized twice over a one-and-one-half-year period. Pursuant to our ruling in <em>In re Sims, supra, </em>such evidence is clearly insufficient to establish a finding of neglect on Erin\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">The state counters that Erin\u2019s failure to inform the court about her future with Roy reflects adversely on her ability to protect the children and warrants the termination of her parental rights. Such an argument ignores the reality that the burden of proof during the adjudicatory stage is \u201cupon the state to justify a governmental intrusion into the family unit involving the possible severance of the right of a parent to the custody of * * * her children.\u201d <em>In re Sims, supra, </em>13 Ohio App.3d at 39, 13 OBR at 41, 468 N.E.2d at 114. Simply put, the state has failed to prove that Erin\u2019s conduct, separate and apart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Roy\u2019s, caused her children to be neglected. As Erin, with mixed metaphor, states in her brief, \u201cwhatever may be Mr. Pieper\u2019s faults, it is unfair and unjust to tar and feather [me] with the same brush.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">In view of the above, Roy\u2019s fifth assignment of error regarding the manifest weight of the trial court\u2019s adjudication is overruled, while Erin\u2019s fifth assignment of error pertaining to the same issue is deemed well taken. Having sustained that portion of Erin\u2019s assignment dealing with the adjudication, we have no need to discuss her argument regarding the disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Roy\u2019s second assignment of error contends that the trial court\u2019s admission of the children\u2019s hearsay statements regarding sexual abuse violated his constitutional right of confrontation. According to the Confrontation Clause, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d In support of his argument, Roy cites the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Idaho v. Wright </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, wherein the court held that the trial court improperly admitted a doctor\u2019s testimony concerning certain statements made by an alleged child abuse victim which amounted to a violation of the defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights. The court noted that hearsay statements may be admitted only upon a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness or a firmly rooted hearsay exception. <em>Id. </em>at-, 110 S.Ct. at 3148, 111 L.Ed.2d at 653. For purposes of the Confrontation Clause, the \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d must \u201cbe drawn from the totality of the circumstances that surround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 110 S.Ct. at 3149, 111 L.Ed.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Although the court declined to adopt a mechanical test, it did provide several factors which it believed properly related to the reliability of a child declarant\u2019s hearsay statements in child sexual abuse cases. Among those listed by the court included spontaneity and consistent repetition, mental state of the declarant, and use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age. <em>Id. </em>at-, 110 S.Ct. at 3150, 111 L.Ed.2d at 656. While this list is not exclusive, the underlying principle behind any factor is whether the declarant \u201cwas particularly likely to be telling the truth when the statement was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Corroborating evidence, the court concluded, is not a basis for finding the declarant trustworthy but rather applies to rendering the admission of hearsay statements harmless. <em>Id. </em>at-, 110 S.Ct. at 3150-3151, 111 L.Ed.2d at 656-658.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">Ignoring for the moment that the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is not applicable in a case involving the termination of parental rights in a noncriminal proceeding, <em>In re Burchfield </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 148, 555 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>N.E.2d 325, we nevertheless find the hearsay statements admitted by the court in the instant case contained \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Unlike <em>Wright, </em>where the defendant challenged the testimony of a single pediatrician, Roy contends that the hearsay statements in this case are \u201ctoo numerous to mention.\u201d For purposes of brevity, we will concern ourselves with the testimony of two witnesses which was instrumental in finding that the girls had been sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Barbara Evans, a licensed clinical counselor with specialized training in sexually abused children, testified that during several therapy sessions Jessica placed anatomically correct dolls in several sexual positions. While playing with the dolls, Jessica referred to the male doll as daddy and friends, and the little girl doll as herself. Evans also recalled that during one session, Jessica put the father doll over the little girl doll and told her that \u201cdaddy does this to Sammie, too.\u201d Finally, Evans stated that Jessica referred to the dolls\u2019 penis and vagina as ding dong and pussy, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The Piepers\u2019 caseworker, Mary Myers, also testified to attending one of Evans' sessions with Jessica. In particular, she recalled Jessica sticking the penis of the daddy doll in Evans\u2019 mouth, and moments later, repeating the same procedure on her. Myers also remembered that Jessica threw the doll on the floor and in the trash can and told her that \u201che did that to my sister, too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Jessica\u2019s explicit knowledge of sexual terms and the sensuality of her behavior at such an early age adequately supports the underlying trustworthiness of her statements. It is difficult to imagine that a child of her age would adequately comprehend and appreciate the implication of her behavior during the therapy sessions. Jessica\u2019s behavior also indicates she was particularly likely to be telling the truth when she made the statement about Samantha and her father. Upon a review of the record, we find the majority of the hearsay statements admitted by the court contained Wright-type factors which rendered the girls particularly worthy of belief. Accordingly, we find no violation of Roy\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights and overrule his second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Roy\u2019s third assignment of error essentially raises two issues for review regarding the testimony of the court-appointed psychologist, Dr. Eugene S. Cherry. Roy initially argues that Dr. Cherry impermissibly commented on the truthfulness of Jessica\u2019s sexual abuse claim during a dialogue with the court. He also alleges that Dr. Cherry improperly testified about Jessica\u2019s ability to accurately relate personal experiences.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">To support his argument, Roy cites <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 545 N.E.2d 1220, wherein the Ohio Supreme Court held that an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>may not state his opinion on the veracity of an allegedly sexually abused child\u2019s statements. Such an opinion, the court noted, \u201c \u2018infringed upon the role of the fact finder, * * * who bears the burden of assessing the credibility and veracity of witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128-129, 545 N.E.2d at 1240, quoting <em>State v. Eastham </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 307, 312, 530 N.E.2d 409, 414 (H. Brown, J., concurring). However, as noted previously, the trial judge is presumed capable of disregarding improper testimony when acting as the fact-finder. <em>In re Sims, supra, </em>13 Ohio App.3d at 41, 13 OBR at 43, 468 N.E.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Although it was error to permit Dr. Cherry to testify as to such matters, there has been no showing that the trial court actually relied on his testimony. Indeed, the court\u2019s entry makes no mention of Dr. Cherry\u2019s testimony. Rather, the court noted that it was Jessica\u2019s statements as well as the symptoms displayed by the children that caused it to conclude Roy had sexually abused the children. Therefore, we deem the admittance of Dr. Cherry\u2019s testimony harmless error and overrule Roy\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In his fourth assignment of error, Roy maintains that counsel\u2019s failure to object to both Dr. Cherry\u2019s testimony and the alleged hearsay statements of the children (previously cited herein as Roy\u2019s second and third assignments of error) constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Counsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance. <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus, certiorari denied (1990), 497 U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 3258, 111 L.Ed.2d 768. In order to show prejudice, the complaining party must prove with reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different. <em>Id., </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 143, 538 N.E.2d at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Having overruled the assignments of errors which formed the basis of Roy\u2019s claim, we find no showing of prejudice has been made. Therefore, there is no merit to Roy\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">Based on our rulings herein, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to divest Erin Pieper of all parental rights, and affirm the court\u2019s decision to divest Roy Pieper of all parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-13\">Jones, P.J., and Koehler, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
