The facts of this case have been stipulated and, therefore, are not in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Appellant is a sixty-six-year-old woman with a twenty-year history of mental illness. Appellee is her daughter. Appellant\u2019s condition, which has been diagnosed as schizophrenia, is effectively managed through the use of psychotropic medication except during occasional periods when she refuses to take the medications. One such period occurred in late 1990 and led to appellant\u2019s involuntary hospitalization pursuant to R.C. Chapter 5122. During the hospitalization, appellant continued to refuse treatment, prompting appellee to file an application to be appointed guardian of the person of appellant, Nadine Willis.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Appellant opposed the application and counsel was appointed to represent her. The matter was referred to a referee of the probate court, who filed his report recommending that appellee\u2019s application be granted. The probate court adopted the referee\u2019s recommendation, over appellant\u2019s objection, expressly finding that appellant was an \u201cincompetent person\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2111.01 and appointing appellee as guardian with specific authority to authorize appropriate medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Appellant appeals the probate court\u2019s judgment and raises the following assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-9\">\u201cI. The trial court erred by ordering and approving the application of guardianship solely to grant the guardian authority to administer psychotropic medication to the ward against her will as said order violated the ward\u2019s right to refuse psychotropic medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-10\">\u201cII. The court erred in granting the application of guardianship by adhering to the \u2018best interest\u2019 standard when the court should have considered whether the ward presented a present physical \u2018danger to herself or others\u2019 when granting the guardianship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Appellant\u2019s assignments of error are interrelated and will be discussed together. Appellant argues that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s use of a \u201cbest interest\u201d standard instead of a \u201cdanger to herself or others\u201d standard amounted to a denial of appellant\u2019s right to due process. Appellant contends that she has a constitutional right to refuse the adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>tration of psychotropic medication regardless of her competency so long as she does not present a risk of physical harm to herself or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Appellant does not take issue with the finding of incompetency entered in conjunction with her original December 19, 1990 commitment to Riverside Hospital pursuant to R.C. Chapter 5122. Apparently, she concedes the court\u2019s authority and the constitutional regularity of the prior competency proceeding; yet, she maintains, regardless of her competency, that she can refuse to take psychotropic medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">R.C. 2111.02(C) provides that, prior to the appointment of a guardian, the potential ward must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard. The ward has the right to counsel and the applicant must prove incompetency by clear and convincing evidence. R.C. 2111.02(B)(1) allows the probate court to appoint a limited guardian if it is in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the incompetent. Continuing, R.C. Chapter 2111 imposes an absolute duty on the guardian to provide appropriate medical care to the incompetent. Finally, R.C. 2111.50(C) addresses the standard to be applied by the probate court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">\u201cExcept for the powers specified in division (D) of this section, all powers of the probate court that are specified in this chapter and that relate either to any person whom it has found to be an incompetent or a minor subject to guardianship and for whom it has appointed a guardian and all powers of a guardian that relate to his ward or guardianship as described in division (A)(2) of this section, shall be exercised in the best interest, as determined in the court\u2019s or guardian\u2019s judgment * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The Revised Code does permit a mental health patient to refuse certain specific types of treatment. R.C. 5122.271 provides under certain circumstances that the patient must be allowed to make an informed intelligent decision. However, if the patient is declared an incompetent, then she is presumed unable to make an informed decision and the guardian and/or court is authorized to make it for her. R.C. 5122.271(E) does provide a standard similar to the one advanced by appellant, but provides that major adverse intervention can be administered only when the incompetent \u201c * * * continues to engage in behavior destructive to himself or others * * Appellant does not offer, nor has our research revealed, any other applicable provision which indicates that a standard other than best interest is to be applied. Appellant does not argue that psychotropic drugs constitute major adverse intervention and, therefore, it is apparent that R.C. 5122.271(E) is inapplicable. Thus, the best interest of the ward should be the determinative issue when deciding if an incompetent should be forced to take psychotropic medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>In support of her position, appellant cites several federal cases, including <em>Washington v. Harper </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 210, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178, for the proposition that a person must present serious physical harm to himself or others before psychotropic drugs may be administered against that person\u2019s will. In <em>Washington, </em>the Supreme Court upheld a state regulatory scheme, whereby psychotropic drugs could be forcibly administered to a prison inmate if the inmate was found to be dangerous to himself or others. The court held that, while the state policy did create a liberty interest in the prisoner to refuse treatment, given requirements of the prison environment, the regulations were reasonably related to the state\u2019s interest in assuring the health of the inmate and the safety of prison personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><em>Washington </em>is distinguishable in that appellant was first declared incompetent before the court approved the forcible administration of drugs. A trial court twice addressed the issue of appellant\u2019s competency, first in the R.C. Chapter 5122 proceeding and again as part of the application for guardianship. Both times the court found appellant to be incompetent. R.C. 2111.01(D) defines \u201cincompetent\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201c(D) \u2018Incompetent\u2019 means any person who is so mentally impaired as a result of a mental or physical illness or disability, or mental retardation, or as a result of chronic substance abuse, that he is incapable of taking proper care of himself or his property or fails to provide for his family or other persons for whom he is charged by law to provide, or any person confined to a penal institution within this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">During both of the competency proceedings, appellant was afforded procedural due process protection superior to that afforded the respondent in <em>Washington. </em>In fact, respondent\u2019s primary contention in <em>Washington </em>was that, in order to adequately protect his due process rights, he should have first been declared incompetent and only thereafter could he be forced to take psychotropic medications. The Supreme Court answered this contention by noting the unique governmental interest associated with prison regulation and safety. Justice Blackmun went even further in his concurring opinion and squarely addressed the issue by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">\u201c * * * Much of the difficulty will be lessened if, in any appropriate case, the mentally ill patient is formally committed. This on occasion may seem to be a bother or a nuisance, but it is a move that would be protective for all concerned * * <em>Id., </em>494 U.S. at 236, 110 S.Ct. at 1044, 108 L.Ed.2d at 208.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">R.C. 2111.02(C)(3) provides that before a guardian is appointed the applicant must prove incompetency by clear and convincing evidence. The evidence before the probate court included a medical report from appellant\u2019s treating physician, a second evaluation conducted by David Tennenbaum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Ph.D., an expert employed on appellant\u2019s behalf, and the testimony of appellee. Taken together, they show that appellant has a long history of paranoid delusions that, at the very least, border on schizophrenia when appellant does not take her medication. Appellant has been known to take long walks carrying large sums of money in the middle of the night. When not medicated, she engages in rather bizarre thoughts and actions which are a matter of record. There was ample evidence to support the probate court\u2019s conclusion that appellant could no longer handle her affairs. Importantly, appellant was not only found to be incompetent in the general sense, but she was also found to be unable to make an intelligent decision concerning the benefits and detriments of use of the medicine. This finding is supported by the evidence and it serves to distinguish further any authority upon which appellant relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The bottom line is that appellant suffers from a manageable form of mental illness. On two occasions, the court has concluded that she is incapable of making an informed decision regarding her own physical and emotional well-being. If appellant is permitted to continue to refuse medication, her family will most probably disintegrate. Medical science has the tools to permit appellant to lead a relatively normal life and her family appears to love and support her. Her present condition makes it impossible for her to understand the implications of her decision. Given the relatively minor invasion of her privacy and the much greater benefits gained by the invasion, it is in appellant\u2019s best interest to have a guardian appointed with the power to authorize the forced administration of psychotropic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Ohio statutory law delineates the best interest standard to be applied to the appointment decision. Appellant\u2019s cited authority is distinguishable on the basis that a prior judicial determination of incompetency has been made in this action. A holding that appellant must first present a danger to herself or others before ordering forced medication is not constitutionally required. Appellant has been afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard at every juncture and the invasion of her privacy is slight compared to the probable benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Appellant\u2019s assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the probate court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b593-9\">John C. Young and Petree, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
