When I made the offer several years ago financial conditions were different, and I cannot now renew thht pledge. I will, however, agree to give $10,000 towards the endowment fund of $200,000, and pay the same when the entire amount, is Covered by valid pledges or payments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-15\">\u201cJohn H. Converse.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2U\">It appears from the testimony that at the .time the letter was written but $2,000 had been subscribed toward the endowment fund, and that at the time of Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Converse\u2019s death, but $14,000 had been paid or subscribed. At the present time approximately $125,000 has been paid or pledged. It also appears that Mr. Converse\u2019s subscription was used as an inducement to others to subscribe and it is a fair presumption that his subscription had some effect in inducing further subscriptions : Pierson\u2019s Est., 6 Pa. D. E. 23.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-4\">As a matter of fact the auditing judge has found \u201cthat on the faith of this promise numerous other subscriptions\u201d were obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">Two questions confront us \u2014 first, was there a consideration for the promise, and, second, did Mr. Converse\u2019s death, the condition not having been performed in his lifetime, revoke his subscription.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-6\">As was said by Penrose, J., in Pierson\u2019s Estate, supra, a valuable consideration sufficient to make a promise binding may be</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-7\">(1) A payment made or an act done by the promiser at, or (if moved by a previous request) before, the time of the promise of the promiser; (2) a contemporaneous promise by the promiser or some third person; or (3) a subsequent act \u201con the part of the promiser or some third person, induced by the promise of the promiser but not done by reason of any obligation of the promisee or third person. In the latter case the contract is unilateral, and the promiser may withdraw at any time before performance has been begun by the promiser, &amp;c., but not afterwards: Addison on Contracts, *23; 26 Hare on Contracts 304, 309-10; Pollock on Contracts 12, Note (M).\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-8\">And as was said by Mr. Justice Thompson in Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions v. Smith, 209 Pa. 361.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-9\">A test of good consideration is whether the promisee a,t the instance of the promiser has done, forborne or undertaken to do anything real, or whether he has suffered any detriment or whether in return for the promise he has done something that he was not bound to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>or has promised to do some act or has abstained from doing something.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\">\u201cIf any of the elements of such test be established the consideration becomes sufficient to support a promise .although its inadequacy may be grossly disproportionate to the promise. The law does not consider such inadequacy and a learned judge has significantly said that the smallest spark of benefit or accommodation was sufficient to create a valid consideration for a promise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">We must conclude, therefore, that as other subscriptions were secured on the faith of Mr. Converse\u2019s promise, something had been done, money paid by others, and that consequently his promise had in his lifetime become a contract based upon a valuable consideration, and had he lived and $190,000 been paid or pledged, he would have been liable for the payment of his subscription of $10,000 and it could have been secured by legal process.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-7\">Did his death revoke the promise? A contract to pay money which falls due after the death of the obligor undoubtedly survives. \u201cAnd what is the difference,\u201d as was said by Mr. Justice Thompson in White v. Commonwealth, 39 Pa. 167, \u201cbetween an agreement to pay at a future period or. on a future contingency? The contract is to be completed, not by any personal performance, but by the payment of money. This act an executor can do as effectually as the testator.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-8\">This authority was relied upon by Fkeas, P. J., in Bennett\u2019s Est., 12 Luzerne Leg. Beg. Beps. 463, and we believe properly. We see no reason why, unless the engagement is personal and involves the performance of something which no one but the promisor can properly perform, death should avoid or revoke a contract based upon a valuable consideration, but the performance of which by the obligee has not been completed in the lifetime of the obligor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-9\">Mr. Converse, as appears from the various claims presented at the audit based upon promises to make char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>itable gifts was in tbe habit of creating obligations of this class and as a moral proposition it would be unreasonable to believe that he only contemplated their fulfillment in the event that he should live to see the several and various ventures completed in his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AF3\">Stuart' v. Second Presbyterian Church, 84 Pa. 388, apparently relied upon by the auditing judge and which is the only Supreme Court case called to our attention in which a conditional gift falling due after the death of the promisor has been considered, would seem to have been decided upon its own peculiar facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\">In that case Mr. Hamilton after having made and paid a number of subscriptions, made an additional subscription of $1,000 conditioned upon the whole amount of the remaining indebtedness of the church being raised. The indebtedness at the time was about $14,000 \u2014and about $7,000 had been subscribed at the date of his death. By his will he devised real estate to the church which was sold for $7,000, and Mr. Justice Paxson for the Supreme Court reversed the judgment entered by the Court of Common . Pleas in favor of the \u25a0church for the amount of the subscription, $1,000, and although he did hold that the subscription was nudum pactum and imposed no liability on Mr. Hamilton\u2019s personal representatives after his death, he laid stress upon the fact that the subscription was to be good only when the whole amount of the debt had been raised by others and not by himself, as it eventually was by his gift by will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">Being of the opinion, therefore, that Mr. Converse\u2019s promise by reason of the other subscriptions induced thereby became a contract based upon a valuable consideration the fulfilment of which might be as well performed by his representatives after his death as by himself, we sustain the exceptions filed on behalf of Park College, and direct the accountants to retain $10,000 pending the acquisition of the balance of the endowment fund of $190,000 within a reasonable time, or until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>further order by the auditing judge in the event that the project should for any. reason fail of completion within a reasonable tim\u00e9.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-4\">On exceptions to the adjudication of the second account, Dallett, P. J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-5\">The exceptions filed in this estate relate to the award by the auditing judge of $10,000 to Park College. By the opinion of the court filed on May 17, 1912, (21 D. B. 571), the accountants were directed \u201cto retain $10,000 pending the acquisition of the balance of the endowment fund of $190,000 within a reasonable time, or until further order by the auditing judge, in the event that the project should for any reason fail of completion within a reasonable time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">As appears from the adjudication, the auditing judge has found that $188,185.69 on account of the- necessary $190,000 has been paid to the proper authorities of Park College, and that $9,042.30 in addition has been subscribed by what are considered \u201cvalid pledges\u201d and expresses the opinion that considering the magnitude of the enterprise, the number of people pledged, and the varying amounts of the subscriptions, the fund has been raised within \u201ca reasonable time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-7\">In view of the fact that the opinion of the court determining this question was filed on May 17, 1912, and the audit was held on November 8, 1912, a period of approximately six months, we agree with his conclusions as being in accord with the views expressed in our opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-f\">The exceptions are therefore dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-9\">. <em>Errors assigned </em>were dismissing exceptions to the adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-10\"><em>E.
