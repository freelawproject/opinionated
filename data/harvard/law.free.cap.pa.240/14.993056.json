Plaintiff went behind the machine while it was still running and picked up the plug, and while standing back of the machine about one or one and one-half feet from the point he was endeavoring to reach attempted to put the plug in place; while so doing his overalls were caught by an unguarded shaft located in the rear of the machine about two feet from the floor and six inches within its outside limits, and which had a collar with an exposed set screw upon it.

Judgment was entered on a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant has appealed from a refusal of judgment non obstante veredicto in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The appellant states the questions involved to be: \u201cIn an action to recover damages for personal injuries by an employee against his employer based on an al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>leged violation of the Act of May 2, 1905, P. L. 352, requiring the safe-guarding of machinery. (1) Was the negligence of the defendant legally established? (2) Was the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law in performing the action resulting in the injury in an obviously dangerous manner, when there was known to him a safe method of performance?\u201d After reading the testimony we are not convinced of a lack of sufficient evidence to justify the findings comprehended by the verdict. No excuse or explanation was given for not guarding the shafting which caused the injury, and under the circumstances surrounding its location the jury might well have concluded that it was negligence to leave it unguarded. While the jury might have found the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence because he did not stop the machine or stand at its front when he attempted to replace the plug, yet it does not appear from the evidence that the course taken by him was such an obviously unusual and dangerous one as to convict him of contributory negligence as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\">The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
