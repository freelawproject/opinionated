He gave directly to her one-half of his real estate for life. No other meaning can be attached to his words; and, when he added, \u201cafter her death it shall go to her heirs and assigns,\u201d his meaning is equally clear that it should descend from her. That she took a fee under the rule in Shelley\u2019s case and the Act of April 27,1855, P. L. 368, is too plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>for discussion, and the only conceivable reason why this appeal was taken must have been the apprehension that, at some time in the future, some one, not a lawyer, might question the title of the testator\u2019s daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
