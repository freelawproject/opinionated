Oakley attempted to purchase drugs from the men, but was refused based on the fact that she owed defendant money for drugs he previously had sold to her. Oakley testified that defendant and Collins suggested that Oakley have sex with the men in exchange for the drugs, and that when she refused, the men suggested she commit a robbery. Oakley agreed to commit the robbery, and the men got into her car where they drove to the R &amp; W convenience store. On defendant's instructions, Oakley went into the store to see who was working and how many people were inside. When she returned to the car, defendant instructed her to move her car to a spot in the parking lot where it would not be visible from inside the store. Oakley did as instructed, and was then handed a gun by one of the men and told to rob the store. Oakley entered the convenience store, pointed the gun at the store owner, and demanded money which she received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Oakley, who was arrested shortly thereafter, was identified by the store owner as being the woman who robbed her at gunpoint. Oakley confessed to Detective Brian Kilgore that she approached defendant and two other men in hopes of purchasing drugs. The men suggested that she rob a convenience store in exchange for the drugs, which she agreed to do. The men then gave her a gun, which she used during the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 15 December 2003, defendant was indicted for robbery with a dangerous weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. Following a jury trial, on 25 August 2004 defendant was found guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, and not guilty of both robbery with a dangerous weapon and common law robbery. Defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twenty-three to thirty-seven months. His sentence was suspended and he was placed on thirty-six months of supervised probation. Defendant now appeals his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant first contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon based on insufficiency of the evidence to support the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In order to survive a motion to dismiss, the State must offer \"substantial evidence of each essential element of the offense charged and of the defendant being the perpetrator of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Oakley testified that defendant and the other men told her to rob the store in exchange for drugs, which she agreed to do. They then provided her with a gun, and she in turn committed the robbery. Oakley stated that she spoke primarily with defendant during the discussion regarding the robbery. She testified that one of the men told her that the gun was not real, but that she was uncertain whether or not it was fake. Detective Kilgore testified concerning statements Oakley made immediately after her arrest, in which she identified defendant as one of the individuals from whom she attempted to purchase drugs, and who suggested she commit a robbery in exchange for the drugs. In one of Oakley's statements to the police, she stated that defendant and the others had two guns, one real and one fake, and that she believed she had been given the fake one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on the evidence presented at defendant's trial, there was sufficient evidence to suggest that defendant entered into an agreement with Oakley in which she would use a gun given to her by defendant and the others to commit a robbery. As there was conflicting evidence regarding whether the gun given to Oakley was real or not, there was sufficient evidence to find that the gun given to her was indeed a real and operable weapon. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant next contends the trial court committed plain error by failing to instruct the jury on the offense of conspiracy to commit common law robbery.

In the instant case, the trial court properly instructed the jury on the offenses of robbery with a dangerous weapon and common law robbery, apparently based on the conflicting evidence regarding whether the gun used was real or fake. The same conflicting evidence directly pertained to defendant's charge of conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, in that the evidence regarding the agreement between defendant, Oakley, and the other parties to the conspiracy also was conflicting as to whether or not the gun Oakley was to use was in fact real. Thus, we hold the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the offense of conspiracy to commit common law robbery, and in doing so the trial court improperly limited the jury's consideration of the offenses which defendant could be found guilty of.

A conspiracy to commit a felony is a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    The crime is complete when the agreement is made.\n   </em>\n   Many jurisdictions follow the rule that one overt act must be committed before the conspiracy becomes criminal.\n   <em>\n    Our rule does not require an overt act.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8573990\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/272/528/#p532\">\n    272 N.C. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20S.E.2d%20505\">\n    158 S.E.2d 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 508 (1968) (emphasis supplied). The crime of conspiracy merely requires an agreement between two or more persons to engage in an unlawful act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20S.E.2d%20505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Whether or not the agreed upon offense was actually perpetrated is irrelevant to a determination of whether a conspiracy occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20S.E.2d%20505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, the State presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that defendant engaged in an agreement with Oakley and Collins to commit a robbery with a dangerous weapon. Oakley testified that she was not sure whether the gun she used in the robbery was real. Oakley gave a statement to police in which she stated, \"I went in because they said either I go in with the fake gun, because they had a - they had a fake gun and a real one, or they want sex. So either I go in or give them sex.\" The agreement between Oakley, Collins, and defendant involved the use of a weapon to accomplish the robbery. The only conflicting evidence is whether the gun Oakley used in the robbery was real or \"fake.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Wilma Allen (\"Allen\"), the store owner, whom Oakley robbed at gunpoint, was asked, \"Is there any doubt in your mind that that gun was a fake gun?\" Allen responded, \"Huh-uh. It looked real to me.\" She later testified, \"There was no doubt; it was real to me.\" Allen also testified that she knew the difference between a revolver and a semiautomatic weapon, and that the gun used by Oakley appeared to be a revolver. Police did not recover a fake gun from any of the conspirators. Both of defendant's co-conspirators pled guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Evidence was presented which tended to show a real gun was used in the robbery. Defendant has failed to show that the trial court's failure to give an instruction on conspiracy to commit common law robbery had a \"probable impact on the jury's finding that the defendant was guilty\" of conspiracy to commit armed robbery to warrant a new trial under plain error review.\n   <em>\n    Odom,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8565416\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/307/655/#p660\">\n    307 N.C. at 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=300%20S.E.2d%20375\">\n    300 S.E.2d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The conspiracy was complete when the agreement to commit a robbery with a dangerous weapon was made.\n   <em>\n    Gallimore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8573990\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/272/528/#p532\">\n    272 N.C. at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=158%20S.E.2d%20505\">\n    158 S.E.2d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court did not commit plain error in failing\n   <em>\n    ex mero moto\n   </em>\n   to instruct the jury on conspiracy to commit common law robbery to entitle defendant to a new trial. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
